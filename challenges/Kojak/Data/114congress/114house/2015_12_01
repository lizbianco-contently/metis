The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I \nparticipated in a forum hosted by a Foundation created in the 1980s by \nCongress: the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, or NFWF. The forum \nwas on the connection between agriculture and the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The health of the bay is important in Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District, which I represent, since the streams and rivers \nin a large portion of the district drain into it. This is also a region \nwhich depends on agriculture, the Commonwealth's largest industry.\n  Among the topics of discussion at the forum were the Chesapeake \nStewardship grants, which are funded by the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency and administered by the NFWF. This funding goes \ntoward the restoration of streams which flow into the bay and to those \nthat cut down on nutrient and sediment pollution.\n  This fall, I joined the NFWF in touring several sites across \nPennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, which were all funded by \nthese grant programs. These sites show the direct connection between \nagriculture and the health of the Chesapeake Bay, with all of them \nlocated on farmland. The projects range from those which keep animal \nwaste out of waterways to flood control and stream bank restoration, \nall of which improve the overall health of local streams, local \nwatersheds, and, ultimately, the health of the Chesapeake Bay.\n  As chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation and \nForestry, as well as a member of the House National Resource Committee, \nthe health of our watersheds is critically important. Healthy \nwatersheds are needed for the sustainability of both agriculture and \nthe land.\n  As I explained during the forum, the commitment to agriculture and \nhealthy watersheds continues through passage last year of a 5-year farm \nbill and the various conservation programs contained within title II of \nthat bill.\n  The tour of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation watershed \nprojects, along with this recent forum, gave me the opportunity to hear \nfirsthand from farmers, agricultural leaders, and those involved in the \nrestoration of streams and rivers on what can be done here in \nWashington to help improve the quality of water in our local rivers, \nstreams, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, and the bay itself. I look \nforward to working with the agriculture community and many \nconservationists as we prepare for the next reauthorization of the farm \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8649-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8649-H8650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the eyes of the world are on Paris as it \nrecovers from one tragedy and when 150 world leaders gather to prevent \nanother. They meet to secure a global agreement on climate change.\n  Reliance on fossil fuels, especially coal, and wasteful, expensive \nenergy consumption shortchanges today's priorities and threatens our \nfuture. Ten years from now, even many of the current climate skeptics \nwill wonder, ``What were we thinking?''\n  The scientific evidence and the overwhelming consensus it has created \nis clear. The immediate impacts of record temperatures, erratic, very \ndangerous weather patterns, ocean acidification, drought, disease, \nsocial disruption, and wildfires have predictable impacts that have \nalready cost us dearly, with many more severe problems on the horizon.\n  It is sad that what should be a straightforward, scientific \nconclusion has become so emotionally charged and politically volatile. \nIt is embarrassing and ironic that in the middle of this historic event \non climate change, as the world consensus is strengthening and moving \ntoward action, the best that our Republican Congress can do is voting \non two pieces of legislation that would undo much of the progress we \nhave already made.\n  The Republican leader in the Senate argues that the carbon rule of \nthe administration is a vast overreach and\n\n[[Page H8650]]\n\nyet that the Obama policies won't accomplish anything, all while \nworking to undermine their effectiveness. We will then vote on H.R. 8, \na fossil fuel giveaway that will do nothing to combat climate change, \nbut only accelerate the problem.\n  The best solution to the climate threat is not these foolish votes \nand obstructionism, but an action that has the potential to resolve \nother controversial issues while addressing our major climate \nchallenges.\n  It is past time for the Federal Government to enact a revenue-neutral \nfee on carbon emissions. This would not be an excuse to expand \ngovernment spending and new programs, but instead simplify and solve \ncurrent problems in a cost-effective manner.\n  Consider for a moment that high on the list of problems, in addition \nto climate change, is that almost everyone thinks we should fix our \nbroken corporate Tax Code, avoiding the looming Social Security \ndeficit, and streamlining the patchwork of uneven energy subsidy \nprovisions.\n  A revenue-neutral carbon tax is a proven market mechanism to reduce \nthe devastating carbon pollution. We could sweep away expensive and \noften conflicting clean energy subsidies and replace them with \nsomething much more effective.\n  We could use the carbon revenues not for new programs, but to \neliminate the looming 25 percent cut in Social Security, acting quickly \nwhile a solution is more affordable and less disruptive to the lives of \nour seniors.\n  At the same time, we could adjust the Social Security tax downward to \nprotect middle and lower income people from impacts of the fee, and we \ncould boost small business, shielding them from part of the cost and \nlowering the payroll tax they pay, making it cheaper for them to employ \npeople.\n  Finally, a portion of the revenues could be used to buy down the \nworld's highest corporate tax rate that the United States currently \nhas, which distorts business decisions and places us at a competitive \ndisadvantage with other developed countries.\n  Think about it. We could solve the existential climate threat, make \nthe tax system simpler, more fair, and effective, avoid the looming \nSocial Security crisis, and shield individuals and small business from \nthe undue impact from the carbon fee, while making our businesses more \ncompetitive. That is about as close as can you get to a nonpartisan, \nnonideological, grand-slam policy home run.\n  Instead of policies of division and denial, it is time for us to come \ntogether to support a revenue-neutral carbon tax to solve multiple \nproblems and meet our obligations to our children and grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8650-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING WILLIAM BOSTIC JR. AND DOUGLAS CLAYTON FARGO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nthe lives of two outstanding Americans who passed away in October. Both \nmen were part of the Greatest Generation and served our country \nhonorably during the Second World War.\n  William Bostic Jr., also known as Bill, passed away on October 30. He \nwas a native of West Virginia, born in Renick in 1922, lived most of \nhis life in Ravenswood in the Second Congressional District, and was \nthe son of William Bostic Sr. and Nancy Lou Dale Bostic.\n  In 1943, he was called to serve his country, and serve it well he \ndid. Bill served in the Pacific Theater, where he was injured in the \nline of duty.\n  On February 8, 1945, Corporal Bostic was serving as a member of an \nartillery liaison party when the enemy began attacking with rocket, \nartillery, and mortars in support of demolition units. Bill, with \ncomplete disregard for his own safety, left his foxhole and crawled to \na point where he could better communicate with the supporting \nartillery.\n  After establishing communications, he was struck by enemy mortar \nfragments and, though seriously wounded, refused to leave his post \nuntil the enemy attack had been repulsed. His utter disregard for his \nown personal welfare and his devotion to duty assisted materially in \nthe adjustment of artillery fire that broke up the enemy attack.\n  For this act of gallantry, Bill was awarded the Silver Star. During \nhis 11 years of service to our country, he also earned six Bronze \nStars, a Purple Heart, and a Good Conduct ribbon, just to name a few.\n  Bill is survived by his wife of 65 years, Pauline Bostic. She still \nlives in Jackson County, West Virginia. He will be laid to rest at \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  Mr. Douglas Clayton Fargo, Doug, is another true American hero who \npassed away.\n  Doug lived in Charles Town, West Virginia, for over 25 years. After \ngraduating from high school, Doug enlisted with the U.S. Army and \nserved from 1944 to 1946. He fought in nine major battles and was \nquickly elevated in rank from a private to a sergeant as he served \nunder the great General George Patton. He was awarded the Bronze Star \nand the Combat Infantry Badge for his services.\n  In 1951, he was recalled to Active Duty and served another 2 years in \nthe Korean war, where he received his field commission as a lieutenant. \nHe led 11 combat patrols and was awarded a second Bronze Star and a \nsecond Combat Infantry Badge, as well as 18 other ribbons and \ndecorations.\n  After his retirement, he remained active in the community and stayed \ninvolved with a number of veterans organizations, including the Korean \nWar Veterans Association, Forty and Eight, Kiwanis, and Military \nOfficers Association of America.\n  Doug was preceded in death by his first wife, Maria Laura Mae Fargo, \nand his second wife, Eileen Fargo, as well as the last love of his \nlife, Eunice Steed. Additionally, Mr. Fargo lost his grandson, Adam \nJoseph Fargo, on July 22, 2006, when he was killed in action while \nfighting in Iraq.\n  Doug will also be buried in the Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Bill and Doug were fantastic men who served their country and their \ncommunities with honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8650-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8650-H8651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PARIS CLIMATE TALKS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, this week, more than 40,000 negotiators \nfrom 196 governments have descended on the French capital for the Paris \nclimate summit. This summit provides the world with a critical \nopportunity to take a significant step toward creating an ambitious and \neffective global framework for addressing climate change.\n  Climate change is no longer a problem for future generations. It is \nour problem, and we must act now. Paris gives us that opportunity.\n  The science demonstrating the reality of climate change advances by \nthe day. In fact, 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have occurred \nsince the year 2000, and 2015 is on track to be the warmest year of \nall.\n  No country, no matter how large or small, wealthy or poor, is immune \nto the detrimental effects we will face if we do not address this \nglobal climate crisis.\n  The good news is that there has been quite a bit of global action \nover the past few months leading up to the Paris summit. Nearly 180 \ncountries, covering more than 95 percent of the global greenhouse gas \nemissions, have pledged to take steps to reduce CO2 \nemissions.\n  A U.N. report shows that the pledges submitted so far represent a \nsubstantial step in global action that will significantly curtail the \nworld's carbon trajectory.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  If those pledges are implemented, global warming would slow to \nroughly 3 degrees by 2100. While this isn't enough to meet U.N. \ntargets, it is better than the 4- to 5-degree increase if nothing were \ndone.\n  With such a significant and impactful opportunity in front of us, \nmany eyes are on the U.S. What will we do? How will we act?\n  As the world's largest economy and the second largest emitter of \ncarbon dioxide, we cannot stand by and do nothing. Thanks to President \nObama, we have made real progress in advancing our goals of reducing \nemissions and improving our air quality.\n\n[[Page H8651]]\n\n  Earlier this year the administration finalized the Clean Power Plan, \nwhich establishes the first ever national standards to limit carbon \npollution from existing power plants. This is a plan that will prevent \nup to 3,600 premature deaths, 90,000 asthma attacks in children, and \n300,000 missed workdays and schooldays, all the while creating tens of \nthousands of jobs and saving American families money on their energy \nbills.\n  Right now world leaders at the Paris Climate Summit are working to \nforge international progress on the climate crisis. So it comes as no \nsurprise that my colleagues here in Congress are taking action on this \nimportant topic as well. Not so much.\n  In Paris, they are developing a road map to gradually reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. In Washington, we are voting on resolutions \nthat would nullify the only national plan we have to address carbon \npollution.\n  In Paris, the burden of slashing greenhouse gases is being shared by \neveryone, not just the wealthy countries. In Washington, some, the \nmajority, are reluctant to take any blame for this growing crisis.\n  This all makes perfect sense. Right?\n  At a time when the world is coming together to address one of the \ndefining issues of our lifetime, some of my colleagues have decided to \nsabotage American leadership on this critical topic.\n  This is not what American families need, and this is certainly not \nwhat the world needs to see from a global leader.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``Knowing what's right doesn't mean \nmuch unless you do what's right.''\n  We know we are running out of time to mitigate climate change. If we \nfail to take meaningful action now, that knowledge will mean nothing.\n  As with any global challenge, climate change will not be solved in \none fell swoop. No single action, no single government, and no single \nsummit will decisively address one of the greatest global threats our \nworld has ever seen.\n  But Paris does allow us the opportunity to devise a common purpose to \ncreate a better world for future generations.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, vote against these \nharmful environmental riders on the floor this week, and allow America \nto be the leader on climate change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8651-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER DANIEL N.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Veasey) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to respectfully share with my \ncolleagues some of the thoughts and concerns shared by residents in the \nDallas-Fort Worth metroplex. These are heartfelt views expressed since \nwe last met as a legislative body and voted on the passage of the \nAmerican SAFE Act.\n  A passionate public discussion is underway about the role the United \nStates should play during one of the greatest humanitarian crises of \nour time. I have received calls, emails, handwritten letters, texts, \nFacebook messages from fellow Texans back home.\n  Many have expressed clearly that they think that some of the enhanced \nsecurity clearances for Syrian and Iraqi refugees really means that \nAmerica's legacy as a Nation that shares its freedom and opportunity is \nin danger.\n  They have expressed their disappointment, sometimes anger, that we \nmay be allowing our national security concerns to trump our Nation's \nhistory of standing for liberty and justice.\n  I will take a moment to share their thoughts and views to ensure my \ncolleagues that we also consider their views when making any future \ndecision about the Syrian refugee crisis.\n  One resident stated that voting for a pause in accepting refugees \nfrom Iraq and Syria may not slow down the trickle that arrives here, \nbut it is a huge symbolic vote.\n  Another resident stated that the SAFE Act only makes it harder for \ngood people to flee from danger and being used by ISIL, and his hope is \nthat the Obama administration is able to provide what Congress needs to \ndo its job and that good Members reconsider the SAFE Act and don't vote \nto override the President's impending veto.\n  Other residents, like one in Arlington, directly stated that this \nbill was wrong.\n  Let me be clear. I did not view the SAFE Act as a vote against Syrian \nor Iraqi refugees or the greater refugee community. But the \nconstituents that I represent have sent a strong message that any \naction that does not effectively balance national security with our \nnational values is off course.\n  We must remember that the Statue of Liberty is more than just a \nsymbol of freedom. It is a symbol that America is committed to \nwelcoming and protecting those who seek and need refuge.\n  Many of my Democratic colleagues have joined me in supporting \nlegislation that echoes this sentiment. We have sent letters to the \nadministration and agencies supporting refugees this past year.\n  I have cosigned a letter to President Obama urging him to convene \ninternational negotiations to stop the Syrian civil war.\n  I cosponsored the Protecting Religious Minorities Persecuted by ISIS \nAct of 2015. This legislation directs the Secretary of State to \nestablish or use existing refugee processing mechanisms to allow those \nwith a credible fear of persecution by ISIL for gender, religious, or \nethnic membership to apply for refugee admission to the United States.\n  But we can do more, as a Congress, to support the goals of refugee \nresettlement and keep the American people safe at the same time.\n  If we vote to update the refugee resettlement program, we must also \nallocate appropriate funds to ensure that men, women, and children \nfleeing violence do not get caught in unnecessary bureaucracy.\n  As a Congress, we can give legislative teeth to security enhancements \nto the Visa Waiver Program implemented by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity earlier this year. We can fully fund the President's budget \nrequest for aviation security. We can support and expedite our efforts \nto expand preclearance capability of foreign airports around the world. \nDoing so will provide with us a greater ability to prevent those who \nshould not be flying here.\n  I am committed to keeping Americans safe, but I know that doing so is \nnot inconsistent with providing refuge to some of the world's most \nvulnerable people. To turn our backs on refugees would be to betray our \nvalues.\n  The United States is a welcoming country that knows diversity equals \nstrength. Our resettlement program must continue to reflect this. Any \nlegislation that challenges this legacy should be rejected.\n\n[[Page H8652]]\n\n  I will continue to keep residents' thoughts and concerns at the \nforefront of my decisionmaking, and I thank them for reaching out to me \nover the last week. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8652-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STUDENT SUCCESS ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak \nabout the issue of public education in America and what we need to do \nhere in Washington, D.C., to improve our public education system.\n  I specifically rise today to urge passage of the Student Success Act \nin the name of putting students first.\n  The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that right now the Federal education \nbureaucracy has imposed more mandates on local classrooms, on students, \non teachers, on administrators, than was ever intended or contemplated \nby our Constitution and essentially runs afoul of the principles of \nfederalism. That being that, if power is not vested upon the Federal \nGovernment to do something, it should be left to the States or even \nmore local subdivisions; in this case, our local school boards.\n  The Student Success Act seeks to empower teachers, administrators, \nparents, and students by sending control back to school boards and \nclassrooms across this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Student Success Act accomplishes a great deal for \nthe sake of the student. I am going to spend a minute explaining how \nand why that is. But it is also important to point out what happens if \nwe do not pass this bill: more curriculum mandates out of Washington, \nD.C., more testing mandates out of Washington, D.C. If we do not pass \nthis bill, we get more of that.\n  If we do not pass this bill, we have more power and control \nadministered at the sole discretion of the Secretary of Education, as \nit stands right now. The Secretary of Education has the power of the \npurse at his disposal, and we have a waiver program that essentially \nplays out as follows:\n  If the Secretary of Education at the Federal level likes what you are \ndoing with your curriculum and your accountability measures at the \nlocal level, you get grant money. If he doesn't like it, you don't get \nthe grant money. There is way too much discretion in Washington, D.C., \nover how public education is managed and administered in this country. \nThat is not the way it was intended to be.\n  The waiver program, which is in effect right now, is acting as a top-\ndown lever to dictate what is taught in the classrooms, how it is \ntaught, when and how much testing should be employed by teachers, how \nthey teach in the classroom, and when students have to take tests.\n  I cannot tell you how often I hear from parents and students and \nteachers lamenting about not only the days spent testing, but the days \nspent preparing to test.\n  The effort with the Student Success Act is to roll that back and have \nStates take a leadership role in that and the Federal Government \nretreat, reduce the Federal footprint in education in this country.\n  This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue of fairness. It is \nonly fair that teachers and parents get more say over public education \nand Washington, D.C., gets less.\n  A vote against this bill is a vote for the status quo, and I don't \nthink anyone really, truly wants public education coming more out of \nWashington, D.C.\n  The Student Success Act ensures that States cannot be coerced into \nCommon Core.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Mrs. Beatty) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the \nmemory of the great Rosa Parks, also known as the mother of the modern \ncivil rights movement.\n  Today, December 1, marks the 60th anniversary of Rosa Parks' arrest \nfor refusing to surrender her seat on a city bus in Montgomery, \nAlabama, to a White male. Her arrest on this date in 1955 put a face to \nJim Crow and the disgrace of segregation in this country and, in many \nways, united a nation in the struggle for civil rights for all.\n  As many of you know the story, Rosa Parks refused to give up her \nseat, sparking the peaceful Montgomery bus boycott, which lasted 381 \ndays and led to the eventual desegregation of the public transportation \nsystem across this Nation.\n  Rosa Parks in every way embodies the tremendous difference a single \nperson, Mr. Speaker, can make through the power of protest, \nnonviolence, and courage.\n  As a member of the Ohio General Assembly, where I served as House \nleader, I was proud to have led the efforts that resulted in the 2005 \npassage of House Bill 421 designating December 1 as Rosa Parks Day, the \nfirst State in the Nation to do so. Each year, the State of Ohio, \nspearheaded by the Central Ohio Transit Authority, proudly celebrates \nthe life of Rosa Parks in our State capital, Columbus, Ohio.\n  It is important that we do not let her legacy of bravery die. I look \nforward to joining my constituents when I travel back to the district \non December 3 to celebrate the 11th annual statewide tribute to Rosa \nParks, ``The Power of One.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman John Conyers, the dean \nof this House, for agreeing to participate in my Community Leaders \nForum at this year's celebration.\n  For five decades, Congressman Conyers has been a champion of civil \nrights and voting rights. His distinguished career is highlighted by \nhis work on important civil rights legislation such as the Martin \nLuther King Holiday Act of 1983, the Motor Voter bill of 1993, and the \nHelp America Vote Act of 2002. Today, he continues to fight for voting \nrights and civil rights as the ranking member on the House Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I look forward to welcoming him to our Rosa Parks celebration because \nhe shared a personal relationship with her. She worked for Congressman \nConyers from 1964 until 1988. However, before working with Congressman \nConyers, she took a stand for justice and equality. The power of one \nperson changed our Nation forever.\n  Our fight for racial equality and real inclusion is ongoing, as \nrecently publicized tensions across our Nation have made clear. With \nthe Supreme Court decision to strike down section 4 of the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 in Shelby County v. Holder, we no longer have the \nsafety net that ensures that Americans, especially minorities, are able \nto participate in our democratic process.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should not be rolling back voting rights protection. \nInstead, we should honor the progress our country has made to ensure \nand protect equal rights and equal treatment for all.\n  That is why I am the cosponsor of the Voting Rights Advancement Act \nof 2015, H.R. 2867, which enjoys bipartisan and bicameral support. \nCongress should immediately bring this legislation to the floor to \nensure that all Americans may cast ballots to choose their leaders in \npublic service.\n  Mr. Speaker, many of the policies being pushed by the House \nRepublican leadership would adversely and disproportionally affect \npeople of color and individuals in low-income communities.\n  When we talk about reform in Washington and starting with a clean \nslate\n\n[[Page H8653]]\n\nwithout consideration of how these policies will affect all \ncommunities, we do our Nation a disservice. I am confident we can do \nbetter. I am hopeful that we can do better. We have a responsibility to \ndo better.\n  Today and every day, let us be inspired by Rosa Parks and remember \nthat each person must live their life as a model for others.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this \nimportant issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8653-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OUR VETERANS DESERVE BETTER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, last month, we celebrated Veterans Day, a day \nwhere we rightly single out the members of our military, past and \npresent, and pay tribute to their service and sacrifice.\n  When you stop to think about it, it is amazing that men and women \nchoose to serve in our Armed Forces, knowing full well that their \nsacrifice could be tremendous and even require their life. But, still, \nthey volunteer. They do so because America--her ideals, her people, and \nher way of life--are worth defending.\n  The entire Nation owes our military personnel and veterans a huge \ndebt of gratitude, and ensuring that debt is properly repaid is one of \nmy top priorities in Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I travel North Carolina's Fifth District, I hear a \nsimilar refrain. No matter where I go, constituents tell me horror \nstories of their experiences with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Veterans from my district and across the country are frustrated with \nthe lack of service they are receiving. They are angry because they \ncan't get an appointment or a phone call returned. And they are \noutraged, as I am, that the Obama administration is doing nothing to \nsolve the multitude of problems that have been revealed.\n  My heart is always touched when veterans and their families describe \ntheir efforts to get service through the VA and how the VA wouldn't \nhelp them until my office intervened. These stories affect me more than \nwords can say.\n  I am always happy to know that my office has helped, and my staff is \nencouraged when we get a problem solved. However, these veterans \nshouldn't have to contact their congressional office to access the \nbenefits they have earned.\n  To say I am fed up with this administration's treatment of veterans \nis an understatement. How they can turn their backs on the veterans the \nway they do is unconscionable to me.\n  It is past time to put an end to the agency-wide pattern of \nmismanagement at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The bureaucratic \nincompetence is abominable, and there needs to be a shakeup at all \nlevels. The agency needs to be led and staffed by people who believe \nAmerica has a duty and an obligation to help our veterans.\n  Right now, it seems there is no sense of responsibility or concern \nfrom the Obama administration with the disgraceful way our veterans are \nbeing treated. It is time for President Obama to truly commit to \nreforming the VA and give America's veterans a meaningful, decisive \nplan to right the many wrongs.\n  Regardless of the outcome, my office will continue to leave no stone \nunturned when it comes to serving our veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8653-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8653-H8654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                HIV/AIDS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Pelosi) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to mark World AIDS \nDay.\n  I do so in great pride, following my colleague from Ohio, \nCongresswoman Joyce Beatty, who spoke on the floor about the 60th \nanniversary of what happened in Montgomery when Rosa Parks, with great \ncourage, refused to give up her seat on the bus. The courage of that \nwoman and all of those who supported her has made such an incredible \ndifference in our country, and it is indeed related to what I want to \nsay about HIV and AIDS.\n  Many of us had the privilege of knowing Rosa Parks when she worked \nfor John Conyers. We honored her here in the House and are so proud \nthat we have a statue of Rosa Parks in the Capitol of the United \nStates.\n  We think of her and we think of the courage she had, which led to the \nCivil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act. And that Voting Rights Act and \nCivil Rights Act led to our having a much more diverse Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  From there came our Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, \nand the Asian Pacific Caucus. The Black Caucus directly related to Mr. \nConyers, who was a founding member, and Rosa Parks, who was an \ninspiration. They were responsible for so much change in the leadership \nof our Congress. And because so many issues spring from the \nCongressional Black Caucus, some say ``the conscience of the \nCongress.''\n  So the relationship from Rosa Parks, through the caucus, to now we \nare observing the 25th anniversary of World AIDS Day, the link is \nCongresswoman Barbara Lee, who has been such a champion in the Congress \non this subject. We take great pride in the accomplishments she has had \nin her capacity as a Member of Congress but also as our representative \nto the United Nations General Assembly.\n  Each year, World AIDS Day is observed internationally to reflect the \nprogress that has been made in reaffirming our determination to banish \nAIDS to the annals of history. We recognize that achieving an AIDS-free \ngeneration requires our relentless, energetic, and undaunted commitment \nto testing, treatment, and finding a cure.\n  The World AIDS Day theme this year, ``The time to act is now,'' \nchallenges us to act with the urgency that this global epidemic \ndemands.\n  AIDS, as we know, and the HIV virus is a ferocious and resourceful \ndisease, a resourceful virus, ever-mutating to escape our efforts to \ndestroy it. Therefore, we have to be ferocious, resourceful, and \nadaptable in our effort to succeed to end HIV. We must bring bold \nthinking and deep commitment to testing, treatment, and the search for \na cure and a vaccine to prevent.\n  President Bush, with his PEPFAR initiative, took a big advance in how \nwe can help prevent the spread of AIDS in the rest of the world. He and \nMrs. Bush, with their Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon Initiative to link \ncervical cancer prevention with HIV testing and treatment in Africa, \nwas a remarkable initiative.\n  So we salute the bipartisanship. We supported, of course, President \nBush with PEPFAR. We wanted it bigger, and he wanted it strong, and \nthere we were with something that has saved millions of lives and given \nhope to people.\n  I visited some of the clinics in Africa where PEPFAR is being \nadministered, and some of the people I met there said, ``I would never \nhave come in to be tested before because there was no reason. I had no \nhope that there would be any remedy or any maintaining of a quality of \nlife that would have encouraged me to risk the stigma of saying that I \nwas HIV-infected.'' So, again, it is all about the people.\n  In New York today, Bono will be observing the 10th anniversary of the \nONE and (RED) initiatives that have set out to alleviate poverty and \neradicate disease, with a heavy focus on HIV/AIDS. We know the work of \nthe Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation and what they have done on this \nissue, particularly in India.\n  I, today, also wish I could be in San Francisco, where amfAR will be \nsaluting the work at University of California-San Francisco on HIV/AIDS \nby establishing a new initiative there.\n  I am just mentioning a few other observances of World AIDS Day. It is \nhappening throughout the world.\n  If you go back a number of years, when I came to Congress, we were \ngoing to two funerals a day. It was the saddest thing. Now we are going \nto weddings and helping people make out their wills and all the rest \nbecause they have a longer life ahead.\n  The maintenance of life, the quality of life is really important, but \nwe do want a cure.\n  So I said it was the 25th anniversary of World AIDS Day; I meant to \nsay the 25th anniversary of the Ryan White CARE Act. That young man, \nwhose\n\n[[Page H8654]]\n\nname is something that is iconic to all of us, left us, but his mother \ncarries on the tradition, and it has made such a tremendous difference.\n  My colleague Henry Waxman, who is no longer in the Congress but is \nstill a champion on HIV/AIDS, was so instrumental in leading us to \npassing that legislation.\n  So it has been bipartisan. It is global. It is personal. It is urgent \nthat we continue so that, one day, 50 years from now, people will say, \n``What was AIDS? What was that?'', and the books will show that it was \na terrible, terrible tragedy that befell the world's population \nregardless of status, of wealth, of gender or of race, and something \nthat is now buried in the news somewhere as a terrible memory but not a \npart of our future.\n  Again, as we observe World AIDS Day, may we all wear our red ribbons \nin sympathy with those who have lost their lives, sadly, before the \nscience took us to a better place on this.\n  That is what we are counting on, research and science to take us to a \nbetter place on this, and also the enthusiasm, determination, and \nrelentlessness of so many people throughout the world to make HIV/AIDS \na horrible, horrible memory, again, but not part of our future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8654-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1045\n     THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY MUST EXTEND TO ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, like most Americans, I store a lot on \nmy computer and on my phone: family photographs, personal calendars, \nemails, schedules, and even weekend to-do lists or, as my wife calls \nthem, honey-do lists.\n  But this information stored on a phone, like the one I have here in \nmy hand, is not private from the prying, spying eyes of government--our \ngovernment. Most Americans have no idea that Big Brother can snoop on \ntweets, Gchats, texts, Instagrams, and even emails.\n  Anything that is stored in the cloud for over 6 months is available \nto be spied on by government as long as it is older than 180 days. Now, \nwhy is that? Well, it goes all the way back to the outdated Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act of 1986. That act protects privacy of emails \nthat are less than 6 months old.\n  In 1986, those were the days before the World Wide Web even existed. \nMany of us have staff that weren't even born before 1986. We stored \nletters in folders, filing cabinets, and desk drawers. No one knew what \nthe cloud was because the cloud did not exist. There was not any \nbroadband, no social media, no tablets, or no smartphones. So, in 1986, \nlawmakers tried to protect emails but only did so for 180 days.\n  Under current law, every email, every text, every Google doc and \nFacebook message, every photograph of our vacation is subject to \ngovernment inspection without a warrant, without probable cause, and \nwithout our knowledge if it is older than 6 months.\n  This is an invasion of privacy. Constitutional protection for 6 \nmonths only? That is nonsense, Mr. Speaker.\n  What is worse, some government agencies don't want the law changed. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is lobbying to keep the same law \non the books so they can snoop around in emails after 6 months without \na warrant. The SEC is not even a law enforcement agency, but yet they \nwant to keep the ability to look at emails.\n  I suspect they want to be able to read personal financial records and \ncommunications without a warrant. Spying on citizens by government \nsounds like conduct reminiscent of the old Soviet Union.\n  The SEC is not the only government agency that has access to emails \nover 6 months old. Any government agency can go in, confiscate emails \nthat are older than 6 months without a warrant, without probable cause, \nand without knowledge of the person that they are snooping on. To me, \nthis is a clear violation of the spirit of the United States \nConstitution.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we go back to the days of snail mail and you write a \nletter and you put it in an envelope and you put it in a mailbox and it \nfloats around the country from place to place and finally ends up in \nsomebody else's mailbox, government cannot go and grab that letter and \nsearch it without a warrant under most circumstances, no matter where \nit goes in the U.S., because it is protected. It is the privacy of the \nperson who wrote the letter and the person who is receiving the letter.\n  Why should government have the ability to snoop around in our \npersonal emails? They don't have that right, even though they have the \nability to do so.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Fourth Amendment makes us, the U.S., different than \nany nation on Earth to protect the privacy of American citizens. \nGovernment agencies can't raid homes or tap into phones or read mail \nwithout showing a judge they have probable cause that a crime was \ncommitted. They must obtain a search warrant.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was a judge in Texas for 22 years, a criminal court \njudge, and saw 20,000 cases or more. Police officers would come to me \nat all times, day or night, with a search warrant. If it stated \nprobable cause, I would sign the warrant, and then they would be \ninstructed to go search whatever it was that they had probable cause to \nsearch.\n  That is what the Constitution requires before you can snoop around \nand spy on Americans. If you want to search, get a warrant. That is the \nrule under our law.\n  Why should our possessions and communications be less private because \nthey are online? Well, they shouldn't be. That is why I have teamed up \nwith Representative Zoe Lofgren on the other side and lots of other \nMembers of Congress in both parties to introduce legislation to update \nthe outdated ECPA law.\n  There are several bills pending. In fact, these bills have over 300 \nsponsors right now, bipartisan, to restore ECPA's original purpose to \nprotect the privacy of American citizens.\n  This legislation would protect the sacred right of privacy from ever-\nincreasing spying government trolls on Americans. Our mission is \nsimple: extend constitutional protections to communications and records \nthat Americans store online for any amount of time.\n  Mr. Speaker, technology may change, but the Constitution remains the \nsame. Thomas Jefferson said in the Declaration of Independence, \ngovernment is created to ensure our rights, not violate those rights.\n  It is about time we make government protect the right of privacy \nrather than violate the right of privacy. We need to pass this ECPA law \nand get privacy back in America.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8654-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans \nacross the country know the benefits of evidence-driven mental health \ncare; yet, our national mental health system has been harmed after \nyears of bad policy.\n  Yesterday The Wall Street Journal stated, ``As it happens, this month \na House subcommittee passed one of the more consequential bills of this \nRepublican majority--the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act. \nRecent mass killers have nearly all had some kind of mental illness; \nyet, few receive proper treatment. Representative Tim Murphy spent more \nthan a year investigating dysfunction and writing an overhaul.''\n  I am grateful to be a cosponsor of the Helping Families in Mental \nHealth Crisis Act developed by a dedicated professional, Tim Murphy. \nThis legislation helps States to modernize involuntary commitment laws \nand encourages assisted outpatient treatment for patients to remain \nactive in their communities.\n  This legislation determines funding based on evidence-based care, \nputting critical resources into programs we know work, not into vague \nor untested theories. As the former president of the Mid-Carolina \nMental Health Association myself, I appreciate this reform.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops.

What happened in Chicago is \njust the latest evidence that it needs to end.\n  If enacted, the Police Training and Independent Review Act would \ncondition the receipt of full Byrne-JAG funding on States adopting laws \nto require independent investigation and, if necessary, prosecution of \nlaw enforcement officers in cases involving the use of deadly force.\n  If we are serious about restoring a sense of fairness and justice, we \nneed to pass this bill and remove this conflict.\n  Law enforcement, police, and sheriffs have a tough job, a dangerous \njob, and they bring cases to DAs and serve as witnesses. This hand-in-\nglove relationship shouldn't be upset, but it also shouldn't upset \njustice.\n  We have seen charges brought against officers in certain cities, but \nmore would be brought if there were independent prosecutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8655-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING PRINCIPAL STEVE HOPE, 2015 INDIANA HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL \n                              OF THE YEAR\n\n  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. WALORSKI.

Since he became the \nprincipal in 2008, Indiana's Department of Education has named Penn an \nA-rated school and a 4-Star Award winner.\n  He has taught students more than just curriculum.

Mr. Speaker, it is so disappointing that President \nObama believes a climate change summit is somehow a rebuke of \ninternational terrorism. Think about that.\n  The President's timid response about how to take on ISIS and how to \ndefine our enemy has emboldened our enemy, radical Islamists \nextremists.\n  But he has not been timid in his response on global warming. At a \nmeeting of world leaders right now in Paris, President Obama is \nchoosing to pursue his climate change agenda instead of addressing how \nwe are going to destroy ISIS.\n  In fact, our President seems to believe that global warming is a \ngreater threat than international terrorism. It is clear, in the wake \nof the horrific attacks in Paris, that his priorities are gravely \nmisplaced.\n  When discussing ISIS, the President reminded the Nation that ``we've \nfaced greater threats to our way of life before.'' True. But that \ndoesn't change the fact that radical Islamic extremism is the threat we \nface now.\n\n[[Page H8656]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8656-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE LIFE OF ROSA PARKS\n\n  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago today Rosa Parks was arrested for \nrefusing to give up her bus seat to a White man. Her simple act of \ndefiance and her quiet dignity in the face of daily injustice grabbed \nthe attention of activists and launched the civil rights movement.\n  In 2013, we unveiled a statue of Rosa Parks that stands just outside \nthese doors in the U.S. Capitol Statuary Hall. This year I took my 11-\nyear-old granddaughter to Rosa Parks Museum in Montgomery, Alabama, so \nthat the next generation of young Americans can understand the role \nthat she played in shaping the history of our country.\n  I actually got the great honor of meeting Rosa Parks at an event once \nthat my father held at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital \nin Watts. What thrill it was to hold her hand as the audience sang ``We \nShall Overcome.''\n  It has been 60 years, but, unfortunately, we know that the \ndiscrimination Rosa Parks faced still faces minorities communities in \nthis country today.\n  On this anniversary, I hope we can look to her example for \ninspiration in the ongoing struggle for justice for every American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8656-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING MIAMI DADE COLLEGE WOLFSON CAMPUS PRESIDENT DR.

The \ntheme this year is: The Time to Act is Now.\n  First, I would like to thank Leader Pelosi for her steadfast \ncommitment to fighting HIV and AIDS and for guaranteeing strong United \nStates leadership in this area.\n  As the cofounder and cochair along with my good friend from Florida, \nCongresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of the bipartisan Congressional HIV/\nAIDS Caucus, we have seen the significant progress that we have made in \nthe global fight against HIV.\n  From PEPFAR and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, which \nwe were very proud to cosponsor, to the Ryan White CARE Act and the \nMinority AIDS Initiative, the U.S. has been a global leader in \ncommitting the critical resources needed to end this disease.\n  Thanks to the leadership of people like Congresswoman Maxine Waters, \nformer Congresswoman Donna Christensen, and the Congressional Black \nCaucus, we are turning the tide in providing lifesaving prevention and \ntreatment services to disproportionately affected communities here at \nhome. This has been a bipartisan effort which we must continue because \nwe still have a lot of work to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the United States, southern States are now the \nepicenter of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Stigma, discrimination, and lack of \neducation about the disease continue to be significant barriers to care \nand prevention.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight November as Epilepsy \nAwareness Month. Tragically, across the country today thousands of \nfamilies dealing with epilepsy and other debilitating seizure disorders \nhave been forced to uproot their families as they travel to States \nwhere CBD oil is already legalized.\n  Especially in children, CBD oil helps reduce the amount and the \nduration of seizures. But over and over again the government has stood \nin the way of access to lifesaving care for these children.\n  Children across the country, like Sophie Weiss, deserve better. \nSophie is an inspiring young girl from the Tenth Congressional District \nin Illinois. She suffers from a severe form of epilepsy and, without \nCBD oil, suffers upwards of 200 seizures each and every day.\n  Mr. Speaker, for Sophie and children suffering like her, I helped \nintroduce a bill to stop the government from standing in the way of \nthis lifesaving relief.\n  In honor of Epilepsy Awareness Month, I call on my colleagues to join \nme so we can pass the Charlotte's Web Medical Hemp Act of 2015 and \nensure that no family has to endure the loss of a child as they wait \nfor approval of this natural, lifesaving option.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8656-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    9/11 HEALTH AND COMPENSATION ACT\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

What I would like to note is that I am glad that some of \nthe issues have been resolved.\n  Particularly, I am concerned and glad that it will provide critical \nresources for the fight against ISIL, emphasize collection to monitor \nand ensure compliance with the Iranian nuclear agreement, which some \nhave been very concerned about, that intelligence is very important, \nand as well it promotes foreign partner capabilities such as helping \nour allies in France.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I close, let me say my concern, however, still \nremains on\n\n[[Page H8658]]\n\nthe authority limited of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \nBoard. It is a bill that we all should consider.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8658-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8658-H8663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 8, NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY \n  AND INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF 2015; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S.J. \nRES. 23, PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY \nTHE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY; AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF \n    S.J.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 539 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 539\n\n       Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of \n     the bill (H.R. 8) to modernize energy infrastructure, build a \n     21st century energy and manufacturing workforce, bolster \n     America's energy security and diplomacy, and promote energy \n     efficiency and government accountability, and for other \n     purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed \n     with. All points of order against consideration of the bill \n     are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and \n     shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by \n     the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce. After general debate, the Committee of \n     the Whole shall rise without motion. No further consideration \n     of the bill shall be in order except pursuant to a subsequent \n     order of the House.\n       Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in \n     order to consider in the House any joint resolution specified \n     in section 3 of this resolution. All points of order against \n     consideration of each such joint resolution are waived. Each \n     such joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points \n     of order against provisions in each such joint resolution are \n     waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on each such joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to \n     final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour \n     of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce; and (2) one motion to commit.\n       Sec. 3.  The joint resolutions referred to in section 2 of \n     this resolution are as follows:\n        (a) The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 23) providing for \n     congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United \n     States Code, of a rule submitted by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency relating to ``Standards of Performance for \n     Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and \n     Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating \n     Units''.\n       (b) The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 24) providing for \n     congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United \n     States Code, of a rule submitted by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency relating to ``Carbon Pollution Emission \n     Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility \n     Generating Units''.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 539 provides for a rule to consider \nthree important bills that will help millions of Americans and their \nfamilies who are having to pay or will soon be paying higher energy \ncosts due to the administration's misguided and ill-conceived energy \npolicies. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided \nbetween the majority and the minority of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, on each of the pieces of legislation before us, including \nS.J. Res. 23, a resolution of disapproval of a rule promulgated by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency on greenhouse gases from new stationary \nsources; S.J. Res. 24, a resolution of disapproval of a rule \npromulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency on greenhouse gases \nfrom existing stationary sources; and H.R. 8, the North American Energy \nSecurity and Infrastructure Act of 2015, which will move this country \nin a direction of greater energy independence.\n  The rule before us today provides for a closed rule on both \nresolutions of disapproval, as is standard for such measures, allowing \nfor 1 hour of debate equally divided between the majority and minority \nof the Committee on Energy and Commerce, while allowing the minority a \nmotion to commit on each of the resolutions.\n  Further, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate on H.R. 8, also \nequally divided between the chair and ranking member of the Committee \non Energy and Commerce. A subsequent order from the Committee on Rules \nwill likely address any amendments to be made in order later in the \nweek.\n  The House, in taking up these measures, is doing so to reflect the \nwill of the people so many of us represent who are opposed to the \nadministration's actions and wish to stop this out-of-control \nEnvironmental Protection Agency from doing further damage to the \neconomy. Further, H.R. 8 reflects a broad consensus of energy \nstakeholders who are ready and willing to move the country's energy \nfuture into high gear.\n  S.J. Res. 23, disapproving of the Environmental Protection Agency's \nnew greenhouse gas rules on new stationary sources--loosely translated, \nthat means the Nation's power plants, keeping the lights on in your \nhome, the heat on in the winter, and the air-conditioning on in the \nsummer--and S.J. Res. 24, disapproving of the EPA's new greenhouse gas \nrules on existing stationary sources, both of these joint resolutions \npassed in the Senate in October by a majority vote of 52-46. The \nCongressional Review Act, the law which allows for the process of \ndisapproval by Congress when an administration goes too far with one of \nits rules, allows us an up-or-down vote on the resolution, which cannot \nbe filibustered, thus allowing the measure to be considered in the \nSenate. It is now time for the House to be heard on this measure as \nwell.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Environmental Protection Agency's overreaching \ngreenhouse gas rules have had an extensive number of hearings in the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee over the last few years. The committee \nreviewed all aspects of the proposed rules, including the impacts on \nreliability and the impacts on consumer costs, including bringing the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to discuss possible impacts on \nreliability around the country due to these rules.\n  Already, in many States across the Nation, coal-fired power plants \nare closing because they see that the Obama administration's EPA has \nmade it clear that it will go after them relentlessly until they are \nshuttered. This means fewer cost-effective options for consumers and \nalso the potential for brownouts and blackouts during high-consumption \ntimes, like during the peak of the summer in Texas, where rolling \nbrownouts are already not uncommon. The Environmental Protection \nAgency's new rules will only exacerbate this issue.\n  Whether Members of this body support these rules or oppose them, the \nmeasures before us today will provide each Member the opportunity to be \nofficially registered on where they stand on these EPA rules, and that \nis what we are all here to do.\n  H.R. 8, in contrast to the EPA's regulations, moves the country to a \nplace of greater energy security and abundance. Over the past several \nyears, the Energy and Commerce Committee has worked towards modernizing \nthe Nation's energy laws, making the government more accountable, more \naccountable to the people it is meant to represent as it makes \ndecisions which affect literally every citizen in this country and \ntheir pocketbooks.\n  The free market has long been the guiding force in moving this \ncountry ahead in the energy sector. Texas was one of the first major \nbeneficiaries, with the oil boom in the last two centuries. Now, as new \ntechnologies and innovations emerge, Congress must stand on the side of \nthe free market\n\n[[Page H8659]]\n\nagain, stopping the executive branch from picking winners and losers in \nthe energy market and allowing consumers--allowing consumers--to make \nthose decisions for themselves.\n  When consumers choose what energy sources and what technologies work \nbest for them, the economy grows faster and grows more efficiently than \never the government could possibly drive it. That is what the \nArchitecture of Abundance is all about.\n  This country has the resources to be energy independent. It has the \nability to end our reliability on oil and gas from the Middle East, a \nregion that is perpetually in turmoil. But the Obama administration has \nstymied much of the progress that was made in the first decade of this \ncentury, slowing or stopping leases on public lands for new exploration \nof our own resources and putting up red tape and numerous barriers to \nallowing Americans to tap into what is rightfully theirs. This is a \nbill that is long overdue, and I certainly thank Chairman Upton for his \nwork on the bill, H.R. 8.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and \n``yes'' on the three underlying bills. They are an important first step \nin setting this country on the path to a modern, stable, and abundant \nenergy future.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Burgess) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this closed rule and the \nunderlying legislation.\n  I want to begin by congratulating the Republican majority for \nbreaking a record today. Through their exemplary, heavyhanded, \nundemocratic leadership, this is now officially the most closed session \nof Congress in the entire history of the United States of America. I am \nnot sure that is something to be proud of, but that is the title that \nthey have earned.\n\n  Today, we are debating the 47th and 48th closed rules of the 114th \nCongress. We are in our third legislative week since Speaker Ryan took \nthe gavel, and we are already debating our third and fourth closed \nrules during his short tenure.\n  Speaker Ryan promised a more open, more inclusive, more deliberative, \nmore participatory process. I think he must have misspoken because, by \nany measure, the Republican leadership has already fallen short of that \ncommitment.\n  Today, we are considering three bills: two that seek to undermine the \nEPA's ability to protect our public health and environment and a third \nthat offers many troubling provisions, including one which would \nhastily rush the natural gas pipeline approval process and allow \npipelines to be built and run right through our magnificent national \nparks.\n  On December 11, our government will run out of money. During the \n114th Congress, we have stood in this Chamber debating Republican \nmessaging bills to repeal the Affordable Care Act, undermine the Dodd-\nFrank financial reform law, and weaken public health and environmental \nregulations while failing to consider meaningful legislation that would \ncreate jobs, boost the economy, and help vulnerable Americans rise out \nof poverty. Instead of focusing on these priorities, this majority will \nbring to the floor three bills intended to prevent the EPA from \neffectively doing its job.\n  Now, if anyone is feeling deja vu, that is probably because what I \njust said is from a floor speech I gave on a rule for three antiscience \nbills that the Republicans brought before us last November. The only \ndifference is I changed 113th to 114th Congress. And while I hate to \nrepeat myself, unfortunately, the majority is in a rut of bringing \nbefore us the same old same old: unproductive legislation that is going \nnowhere.\n  We have 6 legislative days left to ensure that the government doesn't \nrun out of money, just 6 days; but instead of focusing on that, instead \nof working to ensure the government is funded, we are on the floor \ndebating more Republican messaging bills that I think were written in \nthe National Republican Congressional Committee because they are poorly \ndrafted. These bills have drastic and devastating effects on public \nhealth and the environment, and they will be vetoed by the President of \nthe United States.\n  I include in the Record the Statements of Administration Policy on \nthese bills, expressing the administration's intent to veto these \nbills.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n H.R. 8--North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015\n\n                   (Rep. Upton, R-MI, Nov. 30, 2015)\n\n       The Administration is committed to taking responsible steps \n     to modernize the Nation's energy infrastructure in a way that \n     addresses climate change, promotes clean energy and energy \n     efficiency, drives innovation, and ensures a cleaner, more \n     stable environment for future generations. The Administration \n     strongly opposes H.R. 8 because it would undermine already \n     successful initiatives designed to modernize the Nation's \n     energy infrastructure and increase our energy efficiency.\n       Increased energy efficiency offers savings on energy bills, \n     provides opportunities for more jobs, and improves industrial \n     competitiveness. H.R. 8 would stifle the Nation's move toward \n     energy efficiency by severely hampering the Department of \n     Energy's (DOE) ability to provide technical support for \n     building code development and State implementation. In \n     addition, the bill would undercut DOE's ability to enforce \n     its appliance standards and would weaken section 433 of the \n     Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which requires \n     a reduction in fossil fuel-generated energy in Federal \n     buildings.\n       H.R. 8 includes a provision regarding certain operational \n     characteristics in capacity markets operated by Regional \n     Transmission Organizations (RTO5) and Independent System \n     Operators (ISOs). The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     (FERC) and RTOs and ISOs are already well positioned, \n     especially as technologies change over time, to ensure that \n     capacity market structures adequately provide for the \n     procurement of sufficient capacity to efficiently and \n     reliably fulfill the resource-adequacy function that these \n     markets are intended to perform.\n       H.R. 8 includes new, unnecessary provisions that would \n     broaden FERC's authority to impose deadlines on other Federal \n     agencies reviewing the environmental implications of natural \n     gas pipeline applications. H.R. 8 also would unnecessarily \n     curtail DOE's ability to fully consider whether natural gas \n     export projects are consistent with the public interest.\n       Further, H.R. 8 would undermine the current hydropower \n     licensing regulatory process in place under the Federal Power \n     Act that works to minimize negative impacts associated with \n     the siting of hydropower projects, including negative impacts \n     on safety, fish and wildlife, water quality and conservation, \n     and a range of additional natural resources and cultural \n     values. Among the ways that H.R. 8 would undermine this \n     process would be by creating a new exemption from licensing \n     that would undercut bedrock environmental statutes, including \n     the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, \n     and the Endangered Species Act.\n       Finally, H.R. 8 presents certain constitutional concerns. \n     Sections 1104 and 3004 would impermissibly interfere with the \n     President's authorities with regard to the conduct of \n     diplomacy and in some cases diplomatic communications, and \n     sections 1109 and 1201 raise concerns under the \n     Recommendations Clause.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 8, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n S.J. Res. 23--Disapproving EPA Rule on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from \n   New, Modified, and Reconstructed Electric Utility Generating Units\n\n                 (Sen. McConnell, R-KY, Nov. 17, 2015)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S.J. Res. 23, which \n     would undermine the public health protections of the Clean \n     Air Act (CAA) and stop critical U.S. efforts to reduce \n     dangerous carbon pollution from power plants. In 2007, the \n     Supreme Court ruled that the CAA gives the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate greenhouse \n     gas (GHG) pollution. In 2009, EPA determined that GHG \n     pollution threatens Americans' health and welfare by leading \n     to long-lasting changes to the climate that can, and are \n     already, having a range of negative effects on human health \n     and the environment. This finding is consistent with \n     conclusions of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and numerous other \n     national and international scientific bodies. Power plants \n     account for roughly one-third of all domestic GHG emissions. \n     While the United States limits dangerous emissions of \n     arsenic, mercury, lead, particulate matter, and ozone \n     precursor pollution from power plants, the Carbon Pollution \n     Standards and the Clean Power Plan put into place the first \n     national limits on power plant carbon pollution. The Carbon \n     Pollution Standards will ensure that new, modified, and \n     reconstructed power plants deploy available systems of \n     emission reduction to reduce carbon pollution.\n       S.J. Res. 23 would nullify carbon pollution standards for \n     future power plants and power\n\n[[Page H8660]]\n\n     plants undertaking significant modifications or \n     reconstruction, thus slowing our country's transition to \n     cleaner, cutting-edge power generation technologies. Most \n     importantly, the resolution could enable continued build-out \n     of outdated, high-polluting, and long-lived power generation \n     infrastructure and impede efforts to reduce carbon pollution \n     from new and modified power plants--when the need to act, and \n     to act quickly, to mitigate climate change impacts on \n     American communities has never been more clear.\n       Since it was enacted in 1970, and amended in 1977 and 1990, \n     each time with strong bipartisan support, the CAA has \n     improved the Nation's air quality and protected public \n     health. Over that same period of time, the economy has \n     tripled in size while emissions of key pollutants have \n     decreased by more than 70 percent. Forty-five years of clean \n     air regulation have shown that a strong economy and strong \n     environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.\n       Because S.J. Res. 23 threatens the health and economic \n     welfare of future generations by blocking important standards \n     to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector that take a \n     flexible, common sense approach to addressing carbon \n     pollution, if the President were presented with S.J. Res. 23, \n     he would veto the bill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n   S.J. Res. 24--Disapproving EPA Rule on Carbon Pollution Emission \n       Guidelines for Existing Electric Utility Generating Units\n\n                   (Sen. Capito, R-WV, Nov. 17, 2015)\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes S.J. Res. 24, which \n     would undermine the public health protections of the Clean \n     Air Act (CAA) and stop critical U.S. efforts to reduce \n     dangerous carbon pollution from power plants. In 2007, the \n     Supreme Court ruled that the CAA gives the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate greenhouse \n     gas (GHG) pollution. In 2009, EPA determined that GHG \n     pollution threatens Americans' health and welfare by leading \n     to long-lasting changes to the climate that can, and are \n     already, having a range of negative effects on human health \n     and the environment.

Power plants \n     account for roughly one-third of all domestic GHG emissions. \n     While the United States limits dangerous emissions of \n     arsenic, mercury, lead, particulate matter, and ozone \n     precursor pollution from power plants, the Clean Power Plan \n     and the Carbon Pollution Standards put into place the first \n     national limits on power plant carbon pollution. The Clean \n     Power Plan empowers States to cost-effectively reduce \n     emissions from existing sources and provides States and power \n     plants a great deal of flexibility in meeting the \n     requirements. EPA expects that under the Clean Power Plan, by \n     2030, carbon pollution from power plants will be reduced by \n     32 percent from 2005 levels.\n       By nullifying the Clean Power Plan, S.J. Res. 24 seeks to \n     block progress towards cleaner energy, eliminating public \n     health and other benefits of up to $54 billion per year by \n     2030, including thousands fewer premature deaths from air \n     pollution and tens of thousands of fewer childhood asthma \n     attacks each year. Most importantly, the resolution would \n     impede efforts to reduce carbon pollution from existing power \n     plants--the largest source of carbon pollution in the \n     country--when the need to act, and to act quickly, to \n     mitigate climate change impacts on American communities has \n     never been more clear.\n       Since it was enacted in 1970, and amended in 1977 and 1990, \n     each time with strong bipartisan support, the CAA has \n     improved the Nation's air quality and protected public \n     health.

Forty-five years of clean \n     air regulation have shown that a strong economy and strong \n     environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.\n       Because S.J. Res. 24 threatens the health and economic \n     welfare of future generations by blocking important standards \n     to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector that take a \n     flexible, common sense approach to addressing carbon \n     pollution, if the President were presented with S.J. Res. 24, \n     he would veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. But I guess from the Republican point of view, the \npositive thing about these bills is that they are yet another pander to \nbig money fossil fuel special interests. I urge my colleagues to follow \nthe money because that is what this is all about here today. It is not \nabout serious legislating. It is about fundraising.\n  Mr. Speaker, S.J. Res. 23 and S.J. Res. 24 look to stop commonsense \nregulations that the EPA has put in place that protect us from the \nharmful pollution emitted by power plants. These joint resolutions are \nanother clear message from the Republican majority that they do not \nbelieve that climate change is real. Over 120 environmental, faith-\nbased, and public health organizations have already come out opposing \nthese two resolutions, including the American Lung Association, the \nAllergy and Asthma Network, the League of Conservation Voters, the \nNatural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and Public Citizen. \nI can stand here forever and repeat the other organizations that have a \nlot of public support in this country that have come out against these \nbills.\n  Power plants account for 40 percent of our annual carbon pollution \nemissions. They are the single biggest source of carbon pollution in \nthe country. Yet the Republican majority wants to take away the \ngreatest step we have taken to try to curb that major source of \npollution. These two joint resolutions would permanently prevent the \nEPA from ever, ever limiting pollution from power plants in the future \nas well.\n  H.R. 8 is also a deeply troubling piece of legislation. It favors the \nuse of fossil fuels over renewable energy and favors consumption over \nenergy efficiency.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  It would ram pipeline applications through FERC in under 90 days even \nthough most applications, by the way, are reviewed and approved in less \nthan 1 year.\n  It all but removes individuals from the process, allowing big gas \ncompanies to choose to build wherever they want, regardless of the \nconsequences for local communities. It would even allow them to build \nthrough our treasured national parks. It is an early Christmas gift for \nbig special interests.\n  At some point, we must face the facts, Mr. Speaker.\n  So I want to say something to my colleagues on the Republican side. I \nknow it may make you feel uncomfortable, but it is the truth: Climate \nchange is real.\n  The overwhelming science says it is real, yet a huge chunk of the \nRepublican Conference is in denial. They don't believe there is such a \nthing as climate change. They don't believe we have any responsibility \nto our children or to future generations to combat climate change.\n  They are perfectly happy living in this fantasy world where you can \nrely on fossil fuels and rely on fossil fuels and rely on fossil fuels \nand can just make believe that it has no impact at all on the \nenvironment.\n  Quite frankly, if climate change weren't such a serious issue, it \nwould be comical, but climate change is a serious issue. It is a real \nissue. It is an issue not just for us; it is an issue for future \ngenerations. So their denial, quite frankly, is frightening.\n  We shouldn't be propping up coal and oil industries with taxpayer \nsubsidies. We shouldn't be using taxpayer money to destroy our \nenvironment. When the scientific community reaches a clear consensus on \nan issue like climate change, Congress shouldn't undermine them with \ndangerous legislation like this.\n  When we receive credible, peer-reviewed study after study after study \nafter study that tells us we are in the middle of a climate crisis and \nthat something must be done about it, we need to listen, but the \nRepublican majority refuses to listen.\n  Climate change is often referred to as the most pressing issue of our \ntime. We know that climate change is for real. We know that. We see it. \nWe live it. The scientific community has verified it.\n  Climate change is not a theory, it is not a hoax, and it is certainly \nnot some silly fantasy. When arctic ice is crashing into the oceans at \nrecord rates, that is not a hoax. When species are going extinct at \naccelerated rates around the globe, that is not a fantasy. When extreme \nweather events are becoming commonplace, that is not a theory. When the \nglobal temperature of the planet continues to increase every year for \ndecades, we should pay attention.\n  These are the exact same scare tactics that have been used for over \n45 years in opposition to climate change. It is the same old stuff. \nOpponents of clean air have been claiming for half a century that clean \nair regulations would kill jobs and hurt economic growth, but they are \nwrong.\n  The truth is that the Clean Air Act alone has created $57 trillion in \nbenefits since it was enacted in 1970. The Clean Power Plan will lead \nto a stronger economy, a safer climate, and better health for all of \nus.\n  Why is this so difficult? Maybe it is because my friends on the other \nside of\n\n[[Page H8661]]\n\nthe aisle don't like the President, so anything that he is for they \nhave to be against. You have got to move beyond your anger. You have \ngot to look at the issues, and you have to evaluate them based on the \nevidence.\n  The evidence is that climate change is for real, but you would never \nknow that in listening to the majority. They have no solutions, only \ndenial. Let's keep on down the road of the same old, same old, and \ntheir ``just say no'' agenda is a recipe for disaster.\n  As we gather here, leaders from all around the world are meeting in \nParis to talk about how to deal with the issue of climate change. What \nwe should be doing here is providing some wind at the backs of not only \nour President but of all of the leaders of the world who are gathering \nto try to figure out how to deal with this challenge.\n  Instead of doing that, we are doing this. It is really sad that this \nis what we have come to. If we are going to say ``no'' to anything \ntoday, it should be to this closed rule and to S.J. Res. 23 and to S.J. \nRes. 24.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The Republican Party is in the majority today. There are a couple of \nreasons that is so.\n  There were bills passed in 2009 and 2010, and the American people \nlooked at what was happening in their legislative body and said: We \nneed a change. We need a change from the direction in which we are \ngoing.\n  One of those bills, I will submit, was the Waxman-Markey bill, the \ncap-and-trade scheme that was drawn up in the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, of which I am a member. I sat through the debate on it. I \nremember it very well.\n  That bill was brought to this floor, and that bill was forced through \nthis House in June of 2009, right before Members went home for the 4th \nof July weekend.\n  A lot of people will look at the Affordable Care Act and say that is \nthe reason Congress changed from a majority-Democrat institution to a \nmajority-Republican institution. It is because of the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Yet, Mr. Speaker, I submit that it was actually that activity in June \nof 2009 that caused people to look at what was going on in their \nCongress and to look at that bill that was drafted in the Energy and \nCommerce Committee by Chairman Waxman and Chairman Markey and say: No, \nnot for us. We are not going along with this. This is not a direction \nin which we want you to take this country.\n  We still function under that quaint notion that we have government \nwith the consent of the governed, but the governed did not consent to \nwhat they saw being passed in Congress late in June of 2009. So it is \nno accident that things are the way they are today.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.\n  I want to read a passage from columnist George Will from earlier this \nyear, January 7, of his writing in the Washington Post. Mr. Will \nwrites:\n  ``We know, because they often say so, that those who think \ncatastrophic global warming is probable and perhaps imminent are \nexemplary empiricists. They say those who disagree with them are \n`climate change deniers' disrespectful of science.\n  ``Actually, however, something about which everyone can agree is \nthat, of course, the climate is changing--it always is. And if climate \nCassandras are as conscientious as they claim to be about weighing \nevidence, how do they accommodate historical evidence of enormously \nconsequential episodes of climate change not produced by human \nactivity? Before wagering vast wealth and curtailments of liberty on \ncorrecting the climate,'' perhaps they should consider the past.\n  Then he goes on to detail those episodes in the past: the Little Ice \nAge and the Medieval Warm Period.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  There are, indeed, recent episodes in recorded history that can be \nlooked to where the climate has changed and, yes, has affected human \nbehavior and the human condition, but those were not climate changes \naffected by the result of human activity. Those were caused by natural \ncycles, within the Sun cycle, within things over which none of us had \nany control.\n  Again, I would take the words of Mr. Will to heart. Before we wager \nvast amounts of wealth and curtailments of liberty, we would do well to \nconsider those facts.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I inquire of the gentleman as to how many \nmore speakers he has, for I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I believe I am the only speaker.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  With all due respect to George Will, with whom I don't agree on very \nmuch of anything, quite frankly, if he or anybody else really believes \nthat there is no correlation between human activity and climate change, \nI would suggest that maybe he go back to school, because the \noverwhelming science tells us that there is a connection. The \noverwhelming science tells us that our reliance on fossil fuels, in \nparticular, has accelerated the climate change on this planet.\n  Again, it just astounds me that, on an issue on which the scientific \ncommunity has come together overwhelmingly, there is such a disconnect. \nAgain, at a time when all the world's leaders are gathered in Paris \ntrying to figure out how to deal with this challenge, the House of \nRepresentatives is dealing with this. I think that is sad and \nregrettable.\n  I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question. If we defeat the \nprevious question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up \nbipartisan legislation that would grant law enforcement the authority \nto block the sale of firearms and explosives to individuals who are \nsuspected of international or domestic terrorism.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the \ntext of the amendment, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to me, this should not be controversial, \nbut in this Chamber that is so beholden to the National Rifle \nAssociation, this has become a point of controversy. We are talking \nabout people who are suspected of international or domestic terrorism. \nI don't think any reasonable person feels comfortable with selling \nthose people weapons.\n  We ought to be able to come together by putting the security \ninterests of the people of this country first and enacting this. I hope \nthat there is a strong, bipartisan vote to defeat the previous question \nso that we can actually bring this up, debate it, and pass it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a letter from 120 \norganizations--many environmental organizations, many faith-based \norganizations--all who oppose S.J. Res. 23 and S.J. Res. 24.\n\n                                                November 30, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members, \n     the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose Senators \n     McConnell and Capito's Congressional Review Act resolutions \n     of disapproval (S.J. Res. 23 and 24) that would permanently \n     block the EPA's Clean Power Plan.\n       These resolutions are an extreme assault on public health, \n     the clean energy economy, and modernizing our energy sector. \n     The Clean Power Plan puts in place commonsense limits on \n     power plant carbon pollution, developed with the input of \n     thousands of stakeholders, and provides the flexibility \n     states need to develop their own plans to meet pollution \n     reduction targets. Blocking these commonsense safeguards puts \n     polluter profits before the health of our children.\n       Power plants are the country's single largest source of the \n     pollution fueling climate change and the Clean Power Plan is \n     the single biggest step we have ever taken to tackle climate \n     change. This plan is expected to deliver billions of dollars \n     in benefits and will prevent nearly 3,000 premature deaths \n     and more than a hundred thousand asthma attacks per year by \n     2030.\n       Not only would these resolutions undo all of the health and \n     economic benefits of the Clean Power Plan, they would also \n     bar EPA from issuing any standards in the future that are \n     substantially similar. This means that Americans would \n     continue to be exposed indefinitely to carbon pollution and \n     the impacts of climate change.\n\n[[Page H8662]]\n\n       The world's leading scientists agree that failing to act on \n     climate change will ensure worsening extreme weather events, \n     threaten food supplies and increase public health risks. We \n     strongly urge you to oppose these resolutions that put the \n     health of our children and families at risk, threaten the \n     quality of our air, and strip the EPA of the tools to address \n     dangerous carbon pollution.\n           Sincerely,\n       350.Org, ActionAid USA, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy \n     Environments, American Rivers, Appalachian Voices, Arizona \n     Interfaith Power & Light, Arkansas Public Policy Panel, \n     Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Air Task Force, Clean \n     Water Action, Climate Action Alliance of the Valley.\n       Climate Law & Policy Project, Climate Parents, Coalition on \n     the Environment and Jewish Life, Colorado Interfaith Power & \n     Light, Conservation Voters for Idaho, Conservation Voters of \n     South Carolina, Defenders of Wildlife, Delaware Interfaith \n     Power & Light, Earthjustice, Earth Ministry/Washington \n     Interfaith Power & Light, Elders Climate Action,\n       Environment America, Environment Arizona, Environment \n     California, Environment Colorado, Environment Connecticut, \n     Environment Florida, Environment Georgia, Environment Iowa, \n     Environment Maine, Environment Maryland, Environment \n     Massachusetts, Environment Michigan, Environment Minnesota, \n     Environment Missouri.\n       Environment Montana, Environment Nevada, Environment New \n     Mexico, Environment New Hampshire, Environment New York, \n     Environment North Carolina, Environment Ohio, Environment \n     Oregon, Environment Rhode Island, Environment Texas, \n     Environment Virginia, Environment Washington, Environmental \n     Advocates of New York.\n       Environmental Investigation Agency, Environmental Justice \n     Leadership Forum on Climate Change, Environmental Law and \n     Policy Center, Environmental and Energy Study Institute, \n     Environmental Defense Action Fund, Georgia Interfaith Power & \n     Light, GreenLatinos, Health Care Without Harm, Hoosier \n     Interfaith Power & Light, Illinois Interfaith Power & Light, \n     Interfaith Power & Light, Interfaith Power & Light (DC.

Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a letter that was \nsent to every Member of Congress who is opposed to these two bills. It \nis signed by the Allergy and Asthma Network, the American Lung \nAssociation, the American Public Health Association, the Children's \nEnvironmental Health Network, the Trust for America's Health, the \nNational Association of Hispanic Nurses, the Asthma and Allergy \nFoundation of America, and the Health Care Without Harm.\n  Again, they are all opposed to the legislation that we are bringing \nbefore the House today.\n\n                                                November 16, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: The undersigned public health and \n     medical organizations strongly urge you to oppose \n     Congressional Review Act resolutions H.J. Res. 71 and 72. The \n     measures are excessive attacks on public health protections \n     from carbon pollution from power plants.\n       The Congressional Review Act resolutions are an extreme \n     tool that would permanently block the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA)'s actions to reduce dangerous carbon \n     pollution from power plants. These resolutions would prevent \n     EPA from moving forward with any substantially similar action \n     in the future. Carbon pollution from power plants greatly \n     contributes to climate change, which is widely recognized as \n     one of the greatest threats to public health. To protect \n     public health, it is vital that our nation make progress in \n     the fight against climate change.\n       As U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, MD, MBA, said during \n     2015 National Public Health Week, ``We know that climate \n     change means higher temperatures overall, and it also means \n     longer and hotter heat waves . . . higher temperatures can \n     mean worse air in cities, and more smog and more ozone. We \n     know that more intense wildfires will mean increased smoke in \n     the air. And we know that earlier springs and longer summers \n     mean longer allergy seasons.''\n       The science is clear: communities across the nation are \n     experiencing the health effects of climate change now. \n     Climate change is impacting air pollution, which can cause \n     asthma attacks, cardiovascular disease and premature death, \n     and fostering extreme weather patterns, such as heat and \n     severe storms, droughts, wildfires and flooding, that can \n     harm low-income communities disproportionately. Bold action \n     is needed to protect public health, which is why our \n     organizations support the Clean Power Plan.\n       EPA's action to reduce carbon pollution from power plants \n     will help the nation take important steps toward protecting \n     Americans' health from these threats. Not only does the Clean \n     Power Plan give states flexible tools to reduce the carbon \n     pollution that causes climate change, these crucial tools \n     will also have the co-benefit of reducing other deadly \n     pollutants at the same time, preventing up to 3,600 premature \n     deaths and 90,000 asthma attacks every year by 2030.\n       Please make your priority the health of your constituents \n     and vote NO on these Congressional Review Act resolutions, \n     H.J. Res. 71 and 72.\n           Sincerely,\n         Allergy and Asthma Network; American Lung Association; \n           American Public Health Association; American Thoracic \n           Society; Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America; \n           Children's Environmental Health Network; Health Care \n           Without Harm; National Association of Hispanic Nurses; \n           Trust for America's Health.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I close as I began, which is by reminding \nmy colleagues that we are at an important crossroads. We still have an \nopportunity to do something about climate change.\n  We still have an opportunity to be on the right side of history. We \nhave the opportunity to do something that is good not only for all of \nus but for our children, for our grandchildren, and for generations to \ncome.\n  We have an opportunity to provide some wind at the backs of the \nleaders from all over the world who are gathered in Paris and who are \ntrying to figure out how to deal with the issue of climate change.\n  If we want to take advantage of that opportunity, we need to reject \nthe same old, same old. We need to understand that we need to \ntransition from our historic reliance on fossil fuels.\n  There is a correlation between our reliance on these forms of energy \nand what we are seeing right now in our environment. It didn't begin \nthat way, and we didn't think we were doing harm to the environment \nwhen we were utilizing these resources, but science, over the years, \nhas shown us, undeniably, the damage that has been done to our planet. \nIt is up to us to try to reverse this trend, not to bury our heads in \nthe sand, not to deny science, not to deny climate change, but to do \nthe right thing.\n  I hope that my colleagues, even some of my Republican colleagues, \nwill join with us in rejecting this legislation and will instead work \nwith this White House and will work with other world leaders to deal \nwith the issue of climate change\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  We all talk about national security as being our top priority. Well, \nnational security is more than just the number of weapons we have in \nour arsenal. It also includes the cleanliness and the purity of our \nenvironment. It is about time we become good stewards of this planet.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and to \nvote ``no'' on this backward-thinking legislation that really should \nnot be on the floor today.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do feel obligated to point out that, in the absence of \nthe\n\n[[Page H8663]]\n\nWaxman-Markey bill, during this administration and the previous \nadministration, between 2005 and 2012, carbon emissions in this country \nfell by 10 percent because of market-based activity.\n  That puts the United States halfway to the goal that it set for \nitself in the United Nations agreement, a goal that we would reduce \ncarbon emissions by 20 percent in the year 2020.\n  We are halfway there, a 10 percent reduction. That is without Waxman-\nMarkey. That is without any international agreement that the President \nmight think he is entertaining or entering into over in Paris.\n  Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of three \nimportant bills for our energy future, two resolutions disapproving of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's greenhouse gas regulations and a \nbill that is forward looking that will set this country on the path to \ngreater energy security.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts \nis as follows:\n\n  An Amendment to H. Res. 539 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts\n\n       Strike all after the resolved clause and insert:\n       That immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney \n     General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of \n     firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected \n     dangerous terrorist. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 2. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1076.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The question is on \nordering the previous question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Nunes) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes).\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous material on the bill, H.R. 4127.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, when Ranking Member Schiff and I assumed the helm of the \nIntelligence Committee, we committed to carrying on the practice of \npassing annual intelligence authorization bills, which is the most \nimportant tool Congress can use to control the intelligence activities \nof the United States Government. Today, building on the legacy of \nChairman Rogers and Ranking Member Ruppersberger, we are bringing the \nsixth consecutive intelligence authorization bill to the floor.\n  Earlier this year the House passed its version of the bill with a \nstrong vote. Since then, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nreported out its version of the bill by a unanimous consent vote. I \ncommend Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein for their leadership \non the bill, and I look forward to working with them in future years.\n  The current bill contains text agreed to by both the House and the \nSenate committees. It preserves key House initiatives while adding \nseveral important provisions from the Senate. None of these provisions \nare considered controversial.\n  As most of the intelligence budget involves highly classified \nprograms, the bulk of the direction is found in the bill's classified \nannex, which has been available in HVC-304 for all Members to review \nsince yesterday.\n  At an unclassified level, I can report that the classified annex is \nconsistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. It reduces the \nPresident's request by less than 1 percent while still providing an \nincrease above last year's level.\n  The agreed text preserves key committee and House funding initiatives \nthat are vital to national security. These initiatives are offset by \nreductions to unnecessary programs and increased efficiencies. The \nagreement also provides substantial intelligence resources to help \ndefeat ISIS and other terrorist groups.\n  Mr. Speaker, today the threat facing America is higher than at any \ntime since 9/11. ISIS has established a safe haven across Iraq and \nSyria, and the group hopes to create a state stretching from Lebanon to \nIraq, including Syria, Jordan, and Israel.\n  The goal of our counterterrorism strategy should be to deny safe \nhavens from which terrorists can plot attacks against the United States \nand our allies. Regrettably, we have not prevented ISIS from \nestablishing a safe haven and the group has become skilled at hiding \nfrom western intelligence services.\n  ISIS members have used that breathing room to plan attacks in Europe, \nNorth Africa, and the Middle East, and they are undoubtedly planning \nattacks against the United States.\n  We rightly demand that our intelligence agencies provide policymakers \nwith the best and most timely information possible on the threats we \nface. We ask them to track terrorists wherever they train, plan, and \nfundraise. We ask them to stop devastating cyber attacks that steal \nAmerican jobs. We ask them to track nuclear missile threats. We demand \nthat they get it right every time.\n  This bill will ensure that the dedicated men and women of our \nintelligence community have the funding, authorities, and support they \nneed to carry out their mission and to keep us safe.\n  Before closing, I want to take a moment to thank the men and women of \nthis country who serve in our intelligence community. I am honored to \nget to know so many of them in the course of our oversight work.\n  I would also like to thank all the staff of the committee, both \nmajority and minority, for their hard work on the bill and for their \ndaily oversight of the intelligence community.\n  I would especially like to thank Jeff Shockey, Shannon Stuart, Andy \nPeterson, Jake Crisp, and Michael Ellis for all the long hours they put \nin to get this bill across the finish line.\n  From the minority staff, I would like to thank Michael Bahar, Tim \nBergreen, Carly Blake, and Wells Bennett for their work on the bill.\n  Finally, thank you to the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff). It \nhas been a pleasure to work with him on this bill, and I look forward \nto continuing the committee's oversight work with him over the next \nyear.\n  I would also like to recognize one member of the committee staff, \nBill Flanigan. Bill is undergoing surgery today. We wish him all the \nbest in his recovery.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 4127.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\nJoint Explanatory Statement to Accompany the Intelligence Authorization \n                        Act for Fiscal Year 2016\n\n       The following consists of the joint explanatory statement \n     to accompany the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2016.\n       This joint explanatory statement reflects the status of \n     negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the \n     House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (hereinafter, ``the \n     Agreement''). The joint explanatory statement shall have the \n     same effect with respect to the implementation of this Act as \n     if it were a joint explanatory statement of a committee of \n     conference.\n\n[[Page H8672]]\n\n       The joint explanatory statement comprises three parts: \n     first, an overview of the application of the annex to \n     accompany this statement; second, select unclassified \n     congressional direction; and third, a section-by-section \n     analysis of the unclassified legislative text.\n\n\n              PART I: APPLICATION OF THE CLASSIFIED ANNEX\n\n       The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities \n     prevents the congressional intelligence committees from \n     publicly disclosing many details concerning the conclusions \n     and recommendations of the Agreement. Therefore, a classified \n     Schedule of Authorizations and a classified annex have been \n     prepared to describe in detail the scope and intent of the \n     congressional intelligence committees' actions. The Agreement \n     authorizes the Intelligence Community to obligate and expend \n     funds not altered or modified by the classified Schedule of \n     Authorizations as requested in the President's budget, \n     subject to modification under applicable reprogramming \n     procedures.\n       The classified annex is the result of negotiations between \n     the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It reconciles the \n     differences between the committees' respective versions of \n     the bill for National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the \n     Homeland Security Intelligence Program for Fiscal Year 2016. \n     The Agreement also makes recommendations for the Military \n     Intelligence Program (MIP), and the Information Systems \n     Security Program, consistent with the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, and provides certain \n     direction for these two programs\n       The Agreement supersedes the classified annexes to the \n     reports accompanying H.R. 2596, as passed by the House on \n     June 16, 2015, and S. 1705, as reported by the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence on July 7, 2015. All references to \n     the House-passed and Senate-reported annexes are solely to \n     identify the heritage of specific provisions.\n       The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated \n     into the bill pursuant to Section 102. It has the status of \n     law. The classified annex supplements and adds detail to \n     clarify the authorization levels found in the bill and the \n     classified Schedule of Authorizations. The classified annex \n     shall have the same legal force as the report to accompany \n     the bill.\n\n\n          PART II: SELECT UNCLASSIFIED CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTION\n\n     Enhancing Geographic and Demographic Diversity\n       The Agreement directs the Office of the Director for \n     National Intelligence (ODNI) to conduct an awareness, \n     outreach, and recruitment program to rural, under-represented \n     colleges and universities that are not part of the IC Centers \n     of Academic Excellence (IC CAE) program. Further, the \n     Agreement directs that ODNI shall increase and formally track \n     the number of competitive candidates for IC employment or \n     internships who studied at IC CAE schools and other \n     scholarship programs supported by the IC.\n       Additionally, the Agreement directs that ODNI, acting \n     through the Executive Agent for the IC CAE program, the IC \n     Chief Human Capital Officer, and the Director, IC Equal \n     Opportunity & Diversity, as appropriate, shall:\n       1. Add a criterion to the IC CAE selection process that \n     applicants must be part of a consortium or actively \n     collaborate with under-resourced schools in their area;\n       2. Work with CAE schools to reach out to rural and under-\n     resourced schools, including by inviting such schools to \n     participate in the annual IC CAE colloquium and IC \n     recruitment events;\n       3. Increase and formally track the number of competitive IC \n     internship candidates from IC CAE schools, starting with \n     Fiscal Year 2016 IC summer internships, and provide a report, \n     within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, on its plan to \n     do so;\n       4. Develop metrics to ascertain whether IC CAE, the Pat \n     Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program, the Louis Stokes \n     Educational Scholarship Program, and the Intelligence Officer \n     Training Program reach a diverse demographic and serve as \n     feeders to the IC workforce;\n       5. Include in the annual report on minority hiring and \n     retention a breakdown of the students participating in these \n     programs who serve as IC interns, applied for full-time IC \n     employment, received offers of employment, and entered on \n     duty in the IC;\n       6. Conduct a feasibility study with necessary funding \n     levels regarding how the IC CAE could be better tailored to \n     serve under-resourced schools, and provide such study to the \n     congressional intelligence committees within 180 days of the \n     enactment of this Act;\n       7. Publicize all IC elements' recruitment activities, \n     including the new Applicant Gateway and the IC Virtual Career \n     Fair, to rural schools, Historically Black Colleges and \n     Universities, and other minority-serving institutions that \n     have been contacted by IC recruiters;\n       8. Contact new groups with the objective of expanding the \n     IC Heritage Community Liaison Council; and\n       9. Ensure that IC elements add such activities listed above \n     that may be appropriate to their recruitment plans for Fiscal \n     Year 2016.\n       ODNI shall provide an interim update to the congressional \n     intelligence committees on its efforts within 90 days of the \n     enactment of this Act and include final results in its annual \n     report on minority hiring and retention.\n     Analytic Duplication & Improving Customer Impact\n       The congressional intelligence committees are concerned \n     about potential duplication in finished analytic products. \n     Specifically, the congressional intelligence committees are \n     concerned that contemporaneous publication of substantially \n     similar intelligence products fosters confusion among \n     intelligence customers (including those in Congress), impedes \n     analytic coherence across the IC, and wastes time and effort. \n     The congressional intelligence committees value competitive \n     analysis, but believe there is room to reduce duplicative \n     analytic activity and improve customer impact.\n       Therefore, the Agreement directs ODNI to pilot a repeatable \n     methodology to evaluate potential duplication in finished \n     intelligence analytic products and to report the findings to \n     the congressional intelligence committees within 60 days of \n     the enactment of this Act. In addition, the Agreement directs \n     ODNI to report to the congressional intelligence committees \n     within 180 days of enactment of this Act how it will revise \n     analytic practice, tradecraft, and standards to ensure \n     customers can clearly identify how products that are produced \n     contemporaneously and cover similar topics differ from one \n     another in their methodological, informational, or temporal \n     aspects, and the significance of those differences. This \n     report is not intended to cover operationally urgent analysis \n     or current intelligence.\n     Countering Violent Extremism and the Islamic State in Iraq \n         and the Levant\n       The Agreement directs ODNI, within 180 days of enactment of \n     this Act and in consultation with appropriate interagency \n     partners, to brief the congressional intelligence committees \n     on how intelligence agencies are supporting both (1) the \n     Administration's Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) program \n     first detailed in the 2011 White House strategy Empowering \n     Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United \n     States, which was expanded following the January 2015 White \n     House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism, and (2) the \n     Administration's Strategy to Counter the Islamic State of \n     Iraq and the Levant, which was announced in September 2014.\n     Analytic Health Reports\n       The Agreement directs the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) \n     to provide Analytic Health Reports to the congressional \n     intelligence committees on a quarterly basis, including an \n     update on the specific effect of analytic modernization on \n     the health of the Defense Intelligence Analysis Program \n     (DIAP) and its ability to reduce analytic risk.\n     All-Source Analysis Standards\n       The Agreement directs DIA to conduct a comprehensive \n     evaluation of the Defense Intelligence Enterprise's (DIE) \n     all-source analysis capability and production in Fiscal Year \n     2015. The evaluation should assess the analytic output of \n     both NIP and MIP funded all-source analysts, separately and \n     collectively, and apply the following four criteria \n     identified in the ODNI Strategic Evaluation Report for all-\n     source analysis: 1) integrated, 2) objective, 3) timely, and \n     4) value-added. The results of this evaluation shall be \n     included as part of the Fiscal Year 2017 congressional budget \n     justification book.\n     Terrorism Investigations\n       The Agreement directs the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     (FBI) to submit to the congressional intelligence committees, \n     within 180 days of enactment of this Act, a report detailing \n     how FBI has allocated resources between domestic and foreign \n     terrorist threats based on numbers of investigations over the \n     past 5 years. The report should be submitted in unclassified \n     form but may include a classified annex.\n     Investigations of Minors Involved in Radicalization\n       The Agreement directs the FBI to provide a briefing to the \n     congressional intelligence committees within 180 days of \n     enactment of this Act on investigations in which minors are \n     encouraged to turn away from violent extremism rather than \n     take actions which that would lead to Federal terrorism \n     indictments. This briefing should place these rates in the \n     context of all investigations of minors for violent extremist \n     activity and should describe any FBI engagement with minors' \n     families, law enforcement, or other individuals or groups \n     connected to the minor during or after investigations.\n       Furthermore, the Agreement directs the FBI to include how \n     often undercover agents pursue investigations based on a \n     location of interest related to violent extremist activity \n     compared to investigations of an individual or group believed \n     to be engaged in such activity. Included should be the number \n     of locations of interest associated with a religious group or \n     entity. This briefing also should include trend analysis \n     covering the last five years describing violent extremist \n     activity in the U.S.\n\n\n PART III: SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS AND EXPLANATION OF LEGISLATIVE \n                                  TEXT\n\n       The following is a section-by-section analysis and \n     explanation of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2016.\n\n\n                    TITLE I--INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES\n\n     Section 101. Authorization of appropriations\n       Section 101 lists the United States Government departments, \n     agencies, and other elements for which the Act authorizes \n     appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities for Fiscal Year 2016.\n\n[[Page H8673]]\n\n  \n\n     Section 102. Classified Schedule of Authorizations\n       Section 102 provides that the details of the amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated for intelligence and \n     intelligence-related activities and the applicable personnel \n     levels by program for Fiscal Year 2016 are contained in the \n     classified Schedule of Authorizations and that the classified \n     Schedule of Authorizations shall be made available to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives and to the President.\n     Section 103. Personnel ceiling adjustments\n       Section 103 is intended to provide additional flexibility \n     to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in managing \n     the civilian personnel of the Intelligence Community (IC). \n     Section 103 provides that the DNI may authorize employment of \n     civilian personnel in Fiscal Year 2016 in excess of the \n     number of authorized positions by an amount not exceeding \n     three percent of the total limit applicable to each IC \n     element under Section 102. The DNI may do so only if \n     necessary to the performance of important intelligence \n     functions.\n     Section 104. Intelligence Community Management Account\n       Section 104 authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence \n     Community Management Account (ICMA) of the Director of \n     National Intelligence and sets the authorized personnel \n     levels for the elements within the ICMA for Fiscal Year 2016.\n     Section 105. Clarification regarding authority for flexible \n         personnel management among elements of intelligence \n         community\n       Section 105 clarifies that certain Intelligence Community \n     elements may make hiring decisions based on the excepted \n     service designation.\n\n\n TITLE II--CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY SYSTEM\n\n     Section 201. Authorization of appropriations\n       Section 201 authorizes appropriations in the amount of \n     $514,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2016 for the Central \n     Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund.\n\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  First, I want to begin by thanking Chairman Nunes. It has been a \ngreat pleasure to work with him. I greatly appreciate his dedication to \nthe responsibilities that we have, the bipartisan way that he has run \nthis committee, the professional way that he and his staff have \nconducted all the business of the committee. It has just been an honor \nto work with him, and I am greatly appreciative of all he has done to \nbring this bill forward.\n  I also want to express my gratitude to Senators Burr and Feinstein \nfor their efforts at producing this bipartisan, bicameral work product.\n  Earlier this year the House passed its version of the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act for the fiscal year 2016. After the Senate's \nIntelligence Committee advanced its version out of committee, we worked \ntogether to produce the bill that is before us today. It is the result \nof careful negotiations and of a bipartisan and bicameral commitment to \nproduce a strong intelligence bill for the sake of our country and of \nour allies.\n  I was not able to vote for the intelligence authorization when it \nfirst came before the House in June, but I am proud to support it \ntoday. Many of the underlying issues have been resolved or \nsignificantly improved. This annual bill, like those that came before \nit, funds, equips, and sets priorities for the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity, which is critical in the world that we inhabit today.\n  The recent Paris attacks drive home just how vigilant we need to be, \nand the bill before us provides urgent resources for the fight against \nISIS and al Qaeda. At the same time, we must never let our focus on any \none threat or terror group distract us from the other challenges we \nface, like those posed by Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China.\n  This bill strikes the right balance by providing the necessary means \nto counter other wide-ranging threats from state and nonstate actors, \nparticularly in cyberspace, outer space, and in the undersea \nenvironment. The bill also takes critical steps to shore up our \ncounterintelligence capabilities. This is of particular significance \nafter the devastating OPM breach.\n  Additionally, the intelligence authorization continues to be the \nsingle most important means by which Congress conducts oversight of the \nintelligence community. We much support the IC, but we also have to \nrigorously oversee it and make sure that what it does in our name \ncomports with our values.\n  The bill, therefore, prioritizes and provides detailed guidance, \nstrict authorizations, and precise limitations on the activities of the \nintelligence community. It also fences funds to ensure that throughout \nthe year congressional guidance is strictly followed.\n  Some of the other highlights of the bill include emphasizing \ncollection to monitor and ensure Iran's compliance with the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action--this is critical--funding our most \nimportant space programs, investing in space protection and resiliency, \npreserving investments in cutting-edge technologies, and enhancing \noversight of contracting and procurement practices. I am particularly \npleased with where the revised bill ends up with respect to our space \nprograms.\n  Other highlights of the bill are promoting enhancements to our \nforeign partner capabilities, which are crucial to multiplying the \nreach and impact of our own intelligence efforts; enhancing human \nintelligence capabilities, which is often the key to understanding and \npredicting global events; greatly intensifying oversight of defense \nspecial operation forces activities worldwide.\n  The revised bill also continues to incorporate some of the excellent \nprovisions championed by many of the Democratic members of the House \nIntelligence Committee as well as Republicans, in particular, Mr. \nHimes' effort to enhance the quality of metrics we use to enable more \nthorough oversight, Ms. Sewell's provisions to enhance diversity within \nthe intelligence community, Mr. Carson's provisions to better \nunderstand FBI resource allocation against domestic and foreign threats \nand the role of FBI and DNI in countering violent extremism \nparticularly in minors, Ms. Speier's provision to provide greater human \nrights oversight of the IC's relationships with certain foreign \npartners, Mr. Quigley's provision regarding intelligence support to \nUkraine, and Mr. Swalwell's provision to ensure that Department of \nEnergy's national labs can work with State and local government \nrecipients of Homeland Security grants.\n  As I said earlier, I was not able to support the prior version of the \nbill, but I am proud to support this version. I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same. This version corrects the misguided overreliance on short-\nterm overseas contingency operations funding to evade the Budget \nControl Act caps at the expense of our domestic programs.\n  The bill still contains unwelcome restrictions, in my view, on the \nclosure of our facility at Guantanamo Bay, but it modifies them to \nmirror the provisions, which passed in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act and which the President recently signed into law. To \nthe extent there are any intelligence funds which could be used to \nclose the prison, these IAA provisions would subject them to the same \nrestrictions as govern the spending of defense funds in the NDAA.\n  I remain strongly opposed to any restrictions on closing the prison \nat Guantanamo Bay. As these provisions reflect what is currently in \nlaw, I support the larger bill. Especially with what happened in Paris, \nwe need to act now to fund and enable our intelligence agencies.\n  Once again, I want to thank Chairman Nunes, Chairman Burr, and Vice \nChairman Feinstein, as well as the wonderful and hardworking staff of \nthe HPSCI and the SSCI. I also want to thank the administration for \ntheir good work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I insert in the Record at this point the \nsecond part of the joint explanatory statement.\n\n\n                     TITLE III--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n     Section 301. Increase in employee compensation and benefits \n         authorized by law\n       Section 301 provides that funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by the Act for salary, pay, retirement, and \n     other benefits for federal employees may be increased by such \n     additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for \n     increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law.\n     Section 302. Restriction on conduct of intelligence \n         activities\n       Section 302 provides that the authorization of \n     appropriations by the Act shall not be deemed to constitute \n     authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity that \n     is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of \n     the United States.\n     Section 303. Provision of information and assistance to \n         Inspector General of the Intelligence Community\n       Section 303 amends the National Security Act of 1947 to \n     clarify the Inspector General\n\n[[Page H8674]]\n\n     of the Intelligence Community's authority to seek information \n     and assistance from federal, state, and local agencies or \n     units thereof.\n     Section 304. Inclusion of Inspector General of Intelligence \n         Community in Council of Inspectors General on Integrity \n         and Efficiency\n       Section 304 amends Section 11(b)(1)(B) of the Inspector \n     General Act of 1978 to reflect the correct name of the Office \n     of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. The \n     section also clarifies that the Inspector General of the \n     Intelligence Community is a member of the Council of the \n     Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.\n     Section 305. Clarification of authority of Privacy and Civil \n         Liberties Oversight Board\n       Section 305 amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) to clarify that nothing in the \n     statute authorizing the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \n     Board should be construed to allow that Board to gain access \n     to information regarding an activity covered by section 503 \n     of the National Security Act of 1947.\n     Section 306. Enhancing government personnel security programs\n       Section 306 directs the Director of National Intelligence \n     (DNI) to develop and implement a plan for eliminating the \n     backlog of overdue periodic investigations, and further \n     requires the DNI to direct each agency to implement a program \n     to provide enhanced security review to individuals determined \n     eligible for access to classified information or eligible to \n     hold a sensitive position.\n       These enhanced personnel security programs will integrate \n     information relevant and appropriate for determining an \n     individual's suitability for access to classified \n     information; be conducted at least 2 times every 5 years; and \n     commence not later than 5 years after the date of enactment \n     of the Fiscal Year 2016 Intelligence Authorization Act, or \n     the elimination of the backlog of overdue periodic \n     investigations, whichever occurs first.\n     Section 307. Notification of changes to retention of call \n         detail record policies\n       Section 307 requires the Director of National Intelligence \n     to notify the congressional intelligence committees in \n     writing not later than 15 days after learning that an \n     electronic communication service provider that generates call \n     detail records in the ordinary course of business has changed \n     its policy on the retention of such call details records to \n     result in a retention period of less than 18 months. Section \n     307 further requires the Director to submit to the \n     congressional intelligence committees within 30 days of \n     enactment a report identifying each electronic communication \n     service provider (if any) that has a current policy in place \n     to retain call detail records for 18 months or less.\n     Section 308. Personnel information notification policy by the \n         Director of National Intelligence\n       Section 308 requires the Director of National Intelligence \n     to establish a policy to ensure timely notification to the \n     congressional intelligence committees of the identities of \n     individuals occupying senior level positions within the \n     Intelligence Community.\n     Section 309. Designation of lead intelligence officer for \n         tunnels\n       Section 309 requires the Director of National Intelligence \n     to designate an official to manage the collection and \n     analysis of intelligence regarding the tactical use of \n     tunnels by State and non-State actors.\n     Section 310. Reporting process for tracking country clearance \n         requests\n       Section 310 requires the Director of National Intelligence \n     (DNI) to establish a formal reporting process for tracking \n     requests for country clearance submitted to overseas DNI \n     representatives. Section 310 also requires the DNI to brief \n     the congressional intelligence committees on its progress.\n     Section 311. Study on reduction of analytic duplication\n       Sec. 311 requires DNI to carry out a study to identify \n     duplicative analytic products and the reasons for such \n     duplication, ascertain the frequency of and reasons for \n     duplication, and determine whether this review should be \n     considered a part of the responsibilities assigned to the \n     Analytic Integrity and Standards office inside the Office of \n     the DNI. Sec. 311 also requires DNI to provide a plan for \n     revising analytic practice, tradecraft and standards to \n     ensure customers are able to readily identify how analytic \n     products on similar topics that are produced \n     contemporaneously differ from one another and what is the \n     significance of those differences.\n     Section 312. Strategy for comprehensive interagency review of \n         the United States national security overhead satellite \n         architecture\n       Section 312 requires the Director of National Intelligence, \n     in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, and the \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to develop a strategy, \n     with milestones and benchmarks, to ensure that there is a \n     comprehensive interagency review of policies and practices \n     for planning and acquiring national security satellite \n     systems and architectures, including the capabilities of \n     commercial systems and partner countries, consistent with the \n     National Space Policy issued on June 28, 2010. Where \n     applicable, this strategy shall account for the unique \n     missions and authorities vested in the Department of Defense \n     and the Intelligence Community.\n     Section 313. Cyber attack standards of measurement study\n       Section 313 directs the Director of National Intelligence, \n     in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the \n     Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the \n     Secretary of Defense, to carry out a study to determine the \n     appropriate standards to measure the damage of cyber \n     incidents.\n\n\n  TITLE IV--MATTERS RELATING TO ELEMENTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY\n\n      Subtitle A--Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n\n     Section 401. Appointment and confirmation of the National \n         Counterintelligence Executive\n       Section 401 makes subject to Presidential appointment and \n     Senate confirmation, the executive branch position of \n     National Counterintelligence Executive (NCIX), which was \n     created by the 2002 Counterintelligence Enhancement Act. \n     Effective December 2014, the NCIX was also dual-hatted as the \n     Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security \n     Center.\n     Section 402. Technical amendments relating to pay under title \n         5, United States Code\n       Section 402 amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5102(a)(1) to expressly \n     exclude the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \n     (ODNI) from the provisions of chapter 51 of title 5, relating \n     to position classification, pay, and allowances for General \n     Schedule employees, which does not apply to ODNI by virtue of \n     the National Security Act. This proposal would have no \n     substantive effect.\n     Section 403. Analytic Objectivity Review\n       The ODNI's Analytic Integrity and Standards (AIS) office \n     was established in response to the requirement in IRTPA for \n     the designation of an entity responsible for ensuring that \n     the Intelligence Community's finished intelligence products \n     are timely, objective, independent of political \n     considerations, based upon all sources of available \n     intelligence, and demonstrative of the standards of proper \n     analytic tradecraft.\n       Consistent with responsibilities prescribed under IRTPA, \n     Section 403 requires the AIS Chief to conduct a review of \n     finished intelligence products produced by the CIA to assess \n     whether the reorganization of the Agency, announced publicly \n     on March 6, 2015, has resulted in any loss of analytic \n     objectivity. The report is due two years from the date that \n     the reorganization was announced, March 6, 2017.\n\n\n       Subtitle B--Central Intelligence Agency and Other Elements\n\n     Section 411. Authorities of the Inspector General for the \n         Central Intelligence Agency\n       Section 411 amends Section 17 of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency Act of 1949 to consolidate the Inspector General's \n     personnel authorities and to provide the Inspector General \n     with the same authorities as other Inspector Generals to \n     request assistance and information from federal, state, and \n     local agencies or units thereof.\n     Section 412. Prior congressional notification of transfers of \n         funds for certain intelligence activities\n       Section 412 requires notification to the congressional \n     intelligence committees before transferring funds from the \n     Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund or the \n     Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund that are to be used for \n     intelligence activities.\n\n\n             TITLE V--MATTERS RELATING TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES\n\n                 Subtitle A--Matters Relating to Russia\n\n     Section 501. Notice of deployment or transfer of Club-K \n         container missile system by the Russian Federation\n       Section 501 requires the Director of National Intelligence \n     to submit written notice to the appropriate congressional \n     committees if the Intelligence Community receives \n     intelligence that the Russian Federation has deployed, or is \n     about to deploy, the Club-K container missile system through \n     the Russian military, or transferred or sold, or intends to \n     transfer or sell, such system to another state or non-state \n     actor.\n     Section 502. Assessment on funding of political parties and \n         nongovernmental organizations by the Russian Federation\n       Section 502 requires the Director of National Intelligence \n     to submit an Intelligence Community assessment to the \n     appropriate congressional committees concerning the funding \n     of political parties and nongovernmental organizations in the \n     former Soviet States and Europe by the Russian Security \n     Services since January 1, 2006, not later than 180 days after \n     the enactment of the Fiscal Year 2016 Intelligence \n     Authorization Act.\n     Section 503.

Report of resources and collection posture with \n         regard to the South China Sea and East China Sea\n       Section 511 requires the Director of National Intelligence \n     to submit to the appropriate congressional committees an \n     Intelligence Community assessment on Intelligence Community \n     resourcing and collection posture with regard to the South \n     China\n\n[[Page H8675]]\n\n     Sea and East China Sea, not later than 180 days after the \n     enactment of the Fiscal Year 2016 Intelligence Authorization \n     Act.\n     Section 512. Use of locally employed staff serving at a \n         United States diplomatic facility in Cuba\n       Section 512 requires the Secretary of State, not later than \n     one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, to \n     ensure that every supervisory position at a United States \n     diplomatic facility in Cuba is occupied by a citizen of the \n     United States who has passed a thorough background check. \n     Further, not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the provision requires the Secretary \n     of State, in coordination with other appropriate government \n     agencies, to submit to the appropriate congressional \n     committees a plan to further reduce the reliance on locally \n     employed staff in United States diplomatic facilities in \n     Cuba.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  The world is a dangerous place, and our intelligence agencies and \nprofessionals are on the front lines of keeping us, our allies, and our \npartners safe. We also have to ensure that no matter how dangerous the \nworld becomes, the United States adheres to its values. What is done to \nprotect America cannot undermine America, and this legislation ensures \nconsistent and rigorous oversight.\n  To the men and women of our intelligence community, you continue to \nhave my sincerest gratitude and respect for all that you do and my full \nappreciation of your dedication, your patriotism, and your unparalleled \nskills.\n  We in Congress must now do our part by passing this bill, and then we \nmust turn to completing work on cyber legislation and to beginning the \nurgent task of preparing for the fiscal year 2017 authorization bill.\n  To Chairman Nunes, Chairman Burr, and Vice Chair Feinstein, thank you \nagain for your leadership, your bipartisanship, and your determination \nto do what is right.\n  To all the Members of the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence, I thank you for your good work as well.\n  Finally, thank you to our very superb professional staff. You do a \ngreat job each and every day, and often for very, very long hours.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, before I close, I want to reiterate that the \nbill is the most effective way for Congress to carry out oversight of \nintelligence activities. This bill forces the executive branch to \nremain responsive to congressional direction and priorities.\n  As the recent terrorist attacks in Paris show, our enemies are \nrapidly improving their ability to launch deadly strikes against the \nUnited States and our allies. Given these elevated threat levels, it is \ncrucial that our intelligence professionals receive the resources they \nneed to keep Americans\n\n[[Page H8676]]\n\nsafe. This bill will authorize those resources while ensuring full \ncongressional oversight of the intelligence community. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for the bill.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Mr. Schiff for his \ncongeniality and all of his staff's work and our staff's work on our \nside.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee and Ranking member of the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations, I rise in support of H.R. 4127, the ``Intelligence \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016,'' for several reasons.\n  With bipartisan legislative changes negotiated and incorporated, H.R. \n4127, is an improved and acceptable bill that will provide critical \nfunding for our nation's 16 intelligence agencies.\n  While this measure is not perfect, H.R. 4127 corrects many of the \nprovisions that were objectionable by providing a more balanced and \nrealistic budget for our Intelligence Community.\n  The revised Intelligence Authorization Act makes cuts to less \neffective programs, adds money to underfunded ones, and requires \nintelligence agencies to keep Congress abreast of their activities to \nensure responsible and lawful spending practices.\n  More specifically, I am pleased that this bill will: provide critical \nresources for the fight against ISIL; emphasize collection to monitor \nand ensure compliance with the Iranian nuclear agreement; provide the \nnecessary means to counter threats from nation-state actors, \nparticularly in cyberspace, space and the undersea environment, and \nfurthermore helps to shore up our counter-proliferation and counter-\nintelligence capabilities; support our overhead architecture through \nthe funding of critical space programs, invests in space protection and \nresiliency, preserves investments in cutting-edge technologies, and \nenhances the oversight of contracting and procurement practices; \npromotes foreign partner capabilities; and enhance human intelligence \ncapabilities and oversight throughout CIA's reorganization process.\n  H.R. 4127 will provide funding that is 7% above last year's enacted \nbudget level, and only 1% less than President Obama's budget request.\n  Importantly, this version of the bill corrects the over-reliance on \nshort-term Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding to evade \nBudget Control Act caps, which proved problematic in the earlier \nversion.\n  I applaud my colleagues for working together to reach agreement on a \nfair and balanced budget framework that does not harm our economy or \nrequire draconian cuts.\n  Additionally of concern in the prior measure, to the extent \nintelligence funds might be used in an effort to shutter the Guantanamo \nfacility, the Guantanamo-related language in the current version will \nmerely subject those funds to restrictions identical to those imposed \nby the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, recently passed and \nsigned into law by the President.\n  Lastly, while a provision of H.R. 4127 still curtails the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board's (PCLOB) ability to access information \nregarding covert action, it does not alter the PCLOB's broader \njurisdiction or mission to provide independent oversight and to ensure \nthat the U.S. appropriately protects privacy and civil liberties in its \ncounter terrorism programs.\n  With respect to covert actions, the language of H.R. 4127 has been \nreworded to emphasize that such actions are subject to presidential \napproval and reporting to Congress pursuant to existing law.\n  The balance between liberty and security must be respected to \npreserve our way of life and the values that countless generations have \nfought to preserve.\n  This includes taking precautionary measures to ensure that lives are \nsafe from eminent danger and terrorist threats both domestically and \nabroad.\n  On balance, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4127 contains more salutary than \nobjectionable provisions, and for that reason I support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Nunes) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4127.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8676-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today with sadness in the aftermath \nof a terrible act of violence that took the lives of three innocent \nvictims and injured nine others in my hometown of Colorado Springs, \nColorado, last Friday.\n  Among those lives that were tragically lost was Iraq war veteran and \nfather of two, Ke'Arre Stewart; wife and mother of two, Jennifer \nMarkovsky; and University of Colorado-Colorado Springs police officer, \nhusband, father of two and the pastor at Hope Chapel, Garrett Swasey, \nwho bravely rushed to the scene to help save others. Officer Swasey \nimmediately left his own jurisdiction and rushed to the scene when he \ngot word that an officer was down. These three innocent individuals and \ntheir families, friends, and loved ones were the victims of senseless \nviolence.\n  I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the brave first \nresponders and law enforcement officers who responded on that day. \nTheir heroism prevented a bad situation from being so much worse.\n  I would also like to thank everyone for their outpouring of support \nand prayers for Colorado Springs. We are a resilient and supportive \ncommunity that will come together and will pull through this tragedy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to stand with me and my colleagues \nfrom the Colorado delegation and with the community of Colorado Springs \nfor a moment of silence and to reflect upon the lives that were lost \nand to pray for their families and loved ones.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The House will observe a moment of silence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8678-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8678-H8679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        BREAST CANCER RESEARCH STAMP REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Act also modifies the National \n     Highway Freight Network created by the Moving Ahead for \n     Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), and requires the \n     redesignation of the Network every five years to reflect \n     changes in freight flows, including emerging freight \n     corridors and critical commerce corridors.\n       The NSFHP program will facilitate the construction of \n     infrastructure projects that are difficult to complete solely \n     using existing federal, state, local, and private funds. \n     Among other purposes, projects supported by this program will \n     reduce the impact of congestion, generate national and \n     regional economic benefits, and facilitate the efficient \n     movement of freight. This program emphasizes the importance \n     of addressing transportation impediments, which significantly \n     slow interstate commerce. Across the country there are \n     significant bottlenecks that could benefit from this program, \n     which would provide substantial grant funding for \n     infrastructure projects.\n       To address deficient bridges, the FAST Act continues the \n     set-aside for off-system bridges, and expands funding \n     available for on-system bridges located off the National \n     Highway System.\n     Increases Flexibility\n       The FAST Act converts the Surface Transportation Program \n     (STP) to a block grant program, maximizing the flexibility of \n     STP for states and local governments. It also increases the \n     amount of STP funding that is distributed to local \n     governments from 50 percent to 55 percent over the life of \n     the bill. The Act provides states and local governments with \n     increased flexibility by rolling the Transportation \n     Alternatives Program into STP, and allowing 50 percent of \n     certain transportation alternatives funding suballocated to \n     local areas to be used on any STP-eligible project.\n       The FAST Act expands eligibility for the Transportation \n     Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program by \n     allowing states to use National Highway Performance Program, \n     STP block grant, and NSFHP funds to pay the subsidy and \n     administrative costs associated with providing TIFIA credit \n     assistance.\n     Streamlines Reviews, Reduces Bureaucracy, & Increases \n         Transparency\n       The FAST Act streamlines the environmental review and \n     permitting process to accelerate project approvals. The Act \n     includes important reforms to align environmental reviews for \n     historic properties. In addition, it establishes a new pilot \n     program to allow up to five states to substitute their own \n     environmental laws and regulations for the National \n     Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) if the state's laws and \n     regulations are at least as stringent as NEPA. The Act also \n     requires an assessment of previous efforts to accelerate the \n     environmental review process, as well as recommendations on \n     additional means of accelerating the project delivery process \n     in a responsible manner.\n       The FAST Act increases the transparency of the Federal-aid \n     Highway Program by requiring Federal Highway Administration \n     (FHWA) to provide project-level information to Congress and \n     the public. This information permits monitoring of projects \n     for cost overruns and assists Congress in understanding how \n     states are using their Federal-aid Highway funds.\n     Promotes Innovative Technologies\n       The FAST Act provides for the deployment of transportation \n     technologies and congestion management tools that support an \n     efficient and safe surface transportation system. It \n     encourages the installation of vehicle-to-infrastructure \n     equipment to reduce congestion and improve safety.\n     Focus on Highway Safety\n       The FAST Act increases the focus on roadway safety \n     infrastructure and on the safety needs of pedestrians. In \n     addition, there is an increase in funding to improve the \n     safety of railway-highway grade crossings.\n     Additional Provisions\n       The FAST Act removes a requirement which would have \n     required states to collect superfluous data on unpaved and \n     gravel roads. It also bans the use of funding for automated \n     traffic enforcement systems.\n     Additional Explanatory Language\n       The conferees intend that a wide range of freight projects \n     be eligible under the new formula and competitive grant \n     programs, including projects that eliminate freight \n     bottlenecks, use new technologies to improve the efficiency \n     of freight movement, and modify highways to provide \n     additional freight capacity, including by physically \n     separating passenger vehicles from commercial trucks.\n       The conference report expands the flexibility for the use \n     of Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program \n     (CMAQ) funds for rural states and for the use of CMAQ funds \n     for port-related freight operations and vehicle-\n     infrastructure communications equipment.\n       The conferees intend that none of the amendments made by \n     section 1308 affect the authority of the U.S. Department of \n     Justice\n\n[[Page H8806]]\n\n     related to an approved state's implementation of NEPA that \n     existed prior to the date of enactment of this Act.\n       Pursuant to section 1403 of the conference report, \n     conferees intend that additional monies deposited into the \n     Highway Trust Fund by subsequent Acts shall automatically be \n     made available for obligation to states, without further \n     action by Congress. These adjustments to contract authority, \n     which will be distributed among authorized programs in the \n     same manner as set forth in the FAST Act, will ensure that \n     any funding that flows into the Highway Trust Fund can \n     immediately be used to fund necessary surface transportation \n     investments.\n\n                  Title II--Innovative Project Finance\n\n       Title II of the FAST Act makes additional modifications to \n     improve access to the TIFIA program and expand leveraging \n     opportunities. Specifically, it updates the TIFIA program to \n     enable it to be better utilized by rural areas and more \n     accessible for small projects. This is accomplished by using \n     the leveraging ability of TIFIA to support state \n     infrastructure banks and allowing the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation (USDOT) to set-aside TIFIA funding in order to \n     replace the fees typically collected from TIFIA borrowers to \n     pay for independent financial analysis and outside counsel \n     for rural projects.\n       The conference report also directs USDOT to establish a \n     streamlined application process for use by an eligible \n     applicant under certain circumstances. It also makes transit-\n     oriented development projects eligible to apply for TIFIA \n     loans and reinstates the ability of a state to capitalize \n     their state infrastructure bank with their federal-aid \n     highway funds for fiscal years 2016 through 2020.\n       Lastly, the conference report codifies an existing USDOT \n     practice of allowing costs related to highway projects \n     delivered by a public-private partnership that uses an \n     advance construction authorization coupled with the \n     availability payment concession model to be eligible for \n     federal-aid reimbursement.\n\n                    Title III--Public Transportation\n\n       Title III of the FAST Act reauthorizes the programs of the \n     Federal Transit Administration (FTA) through FY 2020 and \n     includes a number of reforms to improve mobility, streamline \n     capital project construction and acquisition, and increase \n     the safety of public transportation systems across the \n     country.\n     Invests in Public Transportation\n       The FAST Act provides stable, robust funding for FTA's \n     state and local partners. The five years of predictable \n     formula funding provided by this Act will enable recipients \n     to better manage their long-term capital assets and address \n     the backlog of state of good repair needs. It also includes \n     funding for new competitive grant programs for buses and bus \n     facilities, innovative transportation coordination, frontline \n     workforce training, and public transportation research \n     activities. Overall, the investments made by this Act will \n     promote greater mobility and access to public transportation \n     services throughout the Nation.\n     Improves Safety\n       The FAST Act clarifies FTA's safety authority with respect \n     to the oversight of, and responsibilities for, the safe \n     operation of rail fixed guideway public transportation \n     systems. It also requires the Secretary of Transportation \n     (Secretary) to undertake a review of safety standards and \n     protocols and evaluate the need to establish federal minimum \n     public transportation safety standards. Finally, the Act \n     requires the Secretary to promote workforce safety through a \n     rulemaking process.\n     Promotes Wise Investments\n       The FAST Act includes a number of reforms to the rolling \n     stock procurement process in an effort to facilitate more \n     cost-effective investments by public transportation agencies. \n     The conferees are aware that one of the biggest challenges to \n     capital asset acquisition, particularly for small and rural \n     public transportation providers, is the high purchasing costs \n     attributable to the relatively small size of the procurement. \n     The Act addresses current purchasing power issues for smaller \n     public transportation providers by supporting cooperative \n     procurements and leasing.\n     Additional Explanatory Language\n       The conference report includes language clarifying the \n     program of interrelated projects under the Capital Investment \n     Grant program. The conferees intend to ensure that project \n     sponsors have the option to seek funding for a program that \n     blends new fixed guideway capital projects, core capacity \n     improvement projects, and small start projects as well as a \n     program of projects that are only new fixed guideway capital \n     projects, core capacity improvement projects, or small start \n     projects.\n       The conferees note the ongoing efforts of the USDOT in \n     coordination with the U.S. Department of Treasury to advance \n     the Build America Investment Initiative (Initiative). This \n     Initiative is intended to increase infrastructure investment \n     and economic growth by engaging with state and local \n     governments and private sector investors to encourage \n     collaboration, expand the market for public-private \n     partnerships and put federal credit programs to greater use. \n     The conferees encourage the USDOT to utilize all available \n     tools, including the National Surface Transportation and \n     Innovative Finance Bureau and the Expedited Project Delivery \n     for Capital Investment Grants Pilot Program established in \n     section 3005(b) for public transportation infrastructure \n     projects.\n       Section 3005(b) establishes a program for the expedited \n     project delivery of projects utilizing public-private \n     partnerships. The program streamlines the project delivery \n     process for up to eight grants for new fixed guideway capital \n     projects, core capacity improvement projects, or small start \n     projects. The conferees seek to expedite projects that have a \n     federal interest of less than 25 percent. The conferees \n     intend state and local governments, as well as private \n     investors to complete their due diligence for a project prior \n     to their agreement to commit to the project. This pilot \n     program maintains the Secretary's discretion to determine \n     that the eligible project is a part of an approved \n     transportation plan; that the applicant has the legal, \n     financial, and technical capacity to carry out the project; \n     that the project will be supported by a public-private \n     partnership; that the project is supported by an acceptable \n     degree of local financial commitment; and that the project \n     will be operated by existing public transportation providers. \n     The conferees do not intend for public-private partnerships \n     to be a means to privatization, rather the pilot program is \n     intended to ensure that the FTA has all of the tools \n     necessary to allow public transportation infrastructure \n     projects to more effectively leverage public dollars and \n     encourage private investment through an innovative expedited \n     project delivery method.\n       The conferees expect that all projects receiving funding \n     through this expedited process enter into revenue service. \n     Therefore, the conference report includes a provision \n     specifying that an applicant must repay all federal funds \n     awarded for the project from all federal funding sources, for \n     all eligible project activities, facilities, and equipment, \n     plus interest and penalty charges allowed by law if a project \n     is not completed. This provision is intended to ensure that \n     all federal interest is protected and returned plus interest \n     if a public-private partnership fails to deliver a project.\n       Section 3005(b) requires the Secretary to deliver an annual \n     report on expedited project delivery for capital grants. As \n     with full funding grant agreements under section 5309, this \n     pilot program requires each recipient to conduct a before and \n     after study report, with an additional description and \n     analysis of predicted and actual benefits and costs of the \n     innovative project delivery and financing methods.\n       The conference report includes a provision to promote the \n     local coordination of all transportation services in an area. \n     The purpose of this provision is to ensure that all \n     transportation providers receiving federal assistance \n     coordinate the provision of service to improve mobility for \n     the transportation disadvantaged, achieve service \n     efficiencies, and reduce or eliminate the duplication of \n     transportation services. Section 3006(b) establishes the \n     ``Pilot Program for Innovative Coordinated Access and \n     Mobility'' to provide grants for innovative projects that \n     improve the coordination of transportation services and non-\n     emergency medical transportation, including the deployment of \n     technology. In section 3006(c), the conferees direct the \n     members of the Interagency Transportation Coordinating \n     Council on Access and Mobility (Council) to undertake action \n     to improve local coordination, establish a cost-sharing \n     policy, provide recommendations to Congress on eliminating \n     federal barriers to local coordination, and address \n     recommendations made previously to the Council by the \n     Government Accountability Office (GAO) for member federal \n     agencies.\n       Section 3011 of the conference report includes a provision \n     to allow rolling stock manufacturers that procure iron and \n     steel produced in the United States, as defined in 49 CFR \n     661.5(b), to include the cost of that iron and steel in the \n     domestic content calculation made pursuant to section \n     5323(j)(2)(C), when such iron or steel is used in rolling \n     stock frames and car shells. The conferees intend for this \n     provision to apply to rolling stock frames or car shells, \n     regardless of where they are produced, provided the iron or \n     steel is produced in the United States.\n       To increase accountability, section 3011 requires the \n     Secretary, upon denial of a Buy America waiver, to issue a \n     written certification that the item is produced in the United \n     States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount, the \n     item is of satisfactory quality, and includes a list of known \n     manufacturers in the United States from which the item can be \n     obtained. This section subsequently requires the Secretary to \n     disclose any waiver denial and subsequent written \n     certification on the website of the USDOT.\n       The conference report includes a definition of a small \n     purchase to mean a purchase of not more than $150,000 for the \n     application of Buy America requirements in section 5323(j).\n       Section 3013 provides the Secretary with increased \n     authority to assist public transportation systems with severe \n     safety needs. MAP-21 granted the Secretary permission to take \n     enforcement actions against recipients that are noncompliant \n     with federal transit safety law. The conferees expect the \n     Secretary to utilize this authority to issue directives, \n     require more frequent oversight, impose more frequent \n     reporting requirements, require that formula grant funds be \n     spent to correct safety deficiencies before funds are spent \n     on other projects, withdraw funds from a recipient, and \n     provide direct safety oversight when deemed necessary. In\n\n[[Page H8807]]\n\n     addition, the conferees intend to provide clarification that \n     the FTA's authority extends to each of the states in which a \n     multi-state fixed guideway public transportation system \n     operates.\n       Section 3017 amends FTA's Buses and Bus Facilities grant \n     program to reflect a number of changes. This section allows \n     recipients in a state to pool formula funds to accommodate \n     larger scale procurements. Subsection (b) reinstitutes a \n     competitive grant bus program to address the capital \n     investment needs of public transportation systems across the \n     country. This competitive grant program includes a 10 percent \n     rural set-aside and a limitation that not more than 10 \n     percent of all grant amounts be awarded to a single grantee. \n     States may also submit a statewide application for bus needs \n     to allow the state, rather than the federal government to \n     distribute competitively awarded grant funds.\n       The conference report also incorporates grants for low or \n     no emission buses and bus facilities, previously included in \n     the research program, into the competitive bus program. The \n     conferees note that these grants are appropriately situated \n     in the bus program and have included language to ensure that \n     any vehicles or facilities financed under this program are \n     ready for full integration into a public transportation \n     system. Additionally, the new low or no emissions buses and \n     bus facilities grant program includes project eligibility for \n     rehabilitating or improving existing public transportation \n     facilities to accommodate low or no emission vehicles to \n     account for such things as retrofitting to include charging \n     stations.\n       The conferees are aware that one of the biggest challenges \n     to capital asset acquisition, particularly for small and \n     rural public transportation providers, is the high purchasing \n     costs attributable to the relatively small size of the \n     procurement. The conferees intend to address current \n     purchasing power issues for smaller public transportation \n     providers in a variety of ways. First, the conference report \n     includes a provision allowing multiple states and providers \n     to purchase capital assets through cooperative procurements. \n     These procurements allow one state to act as a lead \n     procurement agency in an administrative capacity on behalf of \n     each participant to the contract. These voluntary cooperative \n     procurements will enable providers purchasing similar capital \n     assets to pool their procurement requests, which will \n     increase the size of the request and result in the \n     procurement receiving a more competitive bid from the \n     manufacturers. This provision will not only support the needs \n     of small and rural public transportation providers, but also \n     provide additional purchasing opportunities for large and \n     medium-sized public transportation providers.\n       In addition, the conference report creates a pilot program \n     to allow up to three geographically diverse nonprofits to \n     host cooperative procurement contracts. These are intended to \n     be separate from the state cooperative purchasing contracts \n     and provide another opportunity for public transportation \n     systems of all sizes to enhance their purchasing options.\n       Section 3019 of the conference report reduces the barriers \n     for transit agencies to develop and enter into leasing \n     arrangements for public transportation equipment or \n     facilities by removing existing regulatory requirements that \n     have impeded the authority of transit agencies seeking to \n     reduce long-term capital costs. The conference report ensures \n     that the terms of a lease agreement are negotiated by the \n     grantee to best suit their short- and long-term needs.\n\n                    Title IV--Highway Traffic Safety\n\n       Title IV of the FAST Act reauthorizes highway traffic \n     safety programs administered by the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration (NHTSA) through FY 2020 and makes \n     several reforms to existing law to help keep drivers, \n     pedestrians, and our roads safer.\n     Prioritizes Emerging Safety Needs\n       The FAST Act enables states to spend more funds on the \n     pressing safety needs unique to their states by reallocating \n     unspent National Priority Safety Program funds and increasing \n     the percentage of such funds that can be flexed to each \n     state's traditional safety programs. It also requires the \n     Secretary to study the feasibility of establishing an \n     impairment standard for drivers under the influence of \n     marijuana and provide recommendations on how to implement \n     such a standard. Finally, the Act requires NHTSA to take \n     additional actions to improve awareness of the dangers of \n     drug impaired driving.\n     Improves Safety\n       The FAST Act reforms the Impaired Driving Countermeasures, \n     Distracted Driving, and State Graduated Driver License \n     incentive grants to reduce unreasonable barriers to state \n     eligibility, while strengthening incentives for states to \n     adopt laws and regulations to improve highway safety. It \n     encourages states to increase driver awareness of commercial \n     motor vehicles. Finally, the Act creates a state grant to \n     enhance safety for bicyclists, pedestrians, and other non-\n     motorized users.\n     Additional Explanatory Language\n       The conferees are concerned about the dangers posed by \n     unsecured loads on non-commercial vehicles. Federal grant \n     funds for state-run safety campaigns raising awareness about \n     the dangers posed by unsecured loads are currently eligible \n     for funding under State Highway Safety Programs (23 U.S.C. \n     402). Therefore, the conferees encourage states to address \n     unsecured loads the next time they submit their State Highway \n     Safety Program for approval by the Secretary or through other \n     state initiatives.\n       The conferees are concerned with the number of deaths due \n     to impaired driving. The conference report includes Senate \n     language to create an incentive grant for states that provide \n     a 24-7 sobriety program available for use within a state.\n       As a condition of receiving grant funds, NHTSA currently \n     requires states to sign certifications and assurances that \n     they comply with applicable statutes and regulations with \n     regard to maintenance of effort requirements. The conference \n     report provides additional flexibility to allow states to \n     certify compliance with maintenance of effort requirements. \n     Therefore, the conferees expect that NHTSA should reasonably \n     defer to state interpretations and analyses that underpin \n     such certifications.\n\n                        Title V--Motor Carriers\n\n       Title V of the FAST Act reauthorizes the programs of the \n     Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) through \n     FY 2020 and includes several reforms to improve truck and bus \n     safety, while reducing regulatory burdens.\n     Improves Safety\n       The FAST Act incentivizes the adoption of innovative truck \n     and bus safety technologies and accelerates the \n     implementation of safety regulations required by law. The Act \n     also authorizes a new testing method to detect the use of \n     drugs and alcohol by commercial motor vehicle drivers.\n     Reduces Regulatory Burdens\n       The FAST Act reforms the regulatory process by requiring \n     FMCSA to use the best available science and data on various \n     segments of the trucking industry when developing rulemakings \n     and by establishing a process under which the public or the \n     motor carrier industry can petition FMCSA to revise or repeal \n     regulations if they are no longer current, consistent, and \n     uniformly enforced. The Act also consolidates nine existing \n     FMCSA grant programs into four and streamlines program \n     requirements to reduce administrative costs and regulatory \n     burdens on states.\n     Provides Opportunities for Veterans\n       The FAST Act awards grant priority to programs that train \n     veterans for careers in the trucking industry and reduces \n     regulatory barriers faced by veterans seeking employment as \n     commercial truck and bus drivers. It also establishes a pilot \n     program for younger veterans and reserve members that \n     received training during their service in the military to \n     drive certain commercial motor vehicles in interstate \n     commerce.\n     Reform of Compliance, Safety, Accountability Program\n       The FAST Act requires a thorough review and reform of the \n     current enforcement prioritization program to ensure that \n     FMCSA's Compliance, Safety, Accountability analysis is the \n     most reliable possible for the public and for enforcement \n     purposes. Following reviews by the GAO, the U.S. Department \n     of Transportation Inspector General and various law \n     enforcement organizations, the Act requires that FMCSA \n     analysis of enforcement data be temporarily removed from \n     public websites on the day after enactment, until the agency \n     has completed reforms required by this Act. Enforcement and \n     inspection data reported by states and enforcement agencies \n     will remain available for public view\n     Additional Explanatory Language\n       Section 5101 requires that states grant maximum reciprocity \n     for inspections conducted using a nationally accepted system \n     that allows ready identification of previously inspected \n     commercial motor vehicles. The conferees believe that decals \n     used to meet this requirement should adhere to design and \n     functional requirements as specified by the Secretary. \n     Section 5101 also provides additional flexibility for states \n     to exercise the ``Right of Entry'' requirement provided by \n     the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program to ensure that \n     alternate methods for gaining access to motor carriers can be \n     used to satisfy inspection or enforcement requirements.\n       The FMCSA has informed the conferees and the conferees \n     agree that nothing in section 5402 authorizes the use of hair \n     testing as an alternative to urine tests until the U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services establishes federal \n     standards for hair testing.\n       The conferees intend section 5501 to be carried out to \n     identify delays experienced by commercial motor vehicle \n     drivers, including during the loading and unloading of goods \n     at shipper and receiver facilities. The conferees do not \n     intend this provision to measure productivity at ports.\n       Section 5515 requires the Administrator of the FMCSA to \n     conduct a study on the safety effects of a motor carrier \n     operator commuting more than 150 minutes. On June 17, 2014, a \n     tractor-trailer struck a van near Cranbury, New Jersey, \n     killing one person and injuring several others. According to \n     the National Transportation Safety Board, the truck driver \n     had been awake more than 24 hours at the time of the crash. \n     In addition, the Georgia-based driver had driven 12 hours \n     overnight to his job in Delaware before starting his shift. \n     The study shall address the prevalence of long commutes in \n     the industry and the impact on safety.\n       Conferees expect that the implementation of section 5516 \n     will provide the maximum\n\n[[Page H8808]]\n\n     flexibility possible to re-route longer combination vehicles \n     in the affected state to divided highways, highway facilities \n     designed for freight transportation, or along routes that \n     will enhance overall highway safety.\n       In implementing section 32934 of MAP-21, FMCSA determined \n     that the language in subsection (b), which ensures that \n     federal transportation funds to a state would ``not be \n     terminated, limited, or otherwise interfered with,'' only \n     applied with respect to the exemptions enumerated in \n     subsection (a) and not with respect to any further exemption \n     or other minimum standard imposed by state law or regulation. \n     Section 5518 clarifies that states which enact laws or \n     regulations that exempt or impose other minimum standards \n     beyond those enumerated in subsection (a) for farm vehicles \n     and the drivers of such vehicles will not lose federal \n     transportation funds. FMCSA reviewed this section and \n     informed the conferees that it will be implemented in the \n     manner described above.\n\n                          Title VI--Innovation\n\n       Title VI of the FAST Act reauthorizes the programs for the \n     research activities of the USDOT through FY 2020 and includes \n     several provisions to promote innovation and the use and \n     deployment of transportation technologies to address various \n     surface transportation needs.\n     Invests in Innovation\n       The FAST Act provides dedicated Highway Trust Fund \n     authorizations to carry out research and development, \n     technology deployment, training and education, intelligent \n     transportation systems activities, grants to University \n     Transportation Centers, and to administer the Bureau of \n     Transportation Statistics (BTS).\n     Emphasizes Technology\n       The FAST Act ensures that these programs areimplemented and \n     Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are deployed in a \n     technology neutral manner.The Act promotes technology neutral \n     policies that accelerate vehicle and transportation safety \n     research, development and deployment by promoting innovation \n     and competitive market-based outcomes, while using federal \n     funds efficiently and leveraging private sector investment \n     across the automotive, transportation and technology sectors.\n     Promotes Safety\n       The FAST Act encourages FHWA and other federal agencies, \n     states, local governments, and stakeholders to examine \n     additional ways that they can safely and expediently drive \n     the adoption, deployment, and delivery of innovative \n     technology and techniques that would enhance the safety and \n     efficiency of the Nation's roadways.\n     Establishes a Competitive Deployment Program\n       The FAST Act establishes a competitive advanced \n     transportation and congestion management technologies \n     deployment grant program to promote the use of innovative \n     transportation solutions. The deployment of these \n     technologies will provide Congress and USDOT with valuable \n     real life data and feedback to inform future decision making.\n     Updates Federal Regulations\n       The use of transportation technologies by state and local \n     partners is growing, and the FAST Act makes several changes \n     to ensure that federal regulations promote innovation, not \n     stand in its way.\n     Additional Explanatory Language\n       The conference report provides for the collection of \n     statistics on port capacity and throughput for the 25 largest \n     ports to be reported annually by the BTS.\n       The conference report focuses on research for user based \n     alternative revenue mechanisms that preserve a user fee \n     structure to maintain the long-term solvency of the Highway \n     Trust Fund. It is essential that the federal government \n     properly invest in our infrastructure by looking to \n     alternative revenue sources.\n       The conferees believe that federal, state, and local \n     agencies must be prepared for the future growth and adoption \n     of innovative technologies such as autonomous vehicles and \n     that the ITS program should support research initiatives that \n     are engaged in the research, development, testing, and \n     validation of autonomous vehicle technologies.\n       Subtitle C of Title V of the Water Resources Reform and \n     Development Act of 2014 (128 Stat. 1332-1345) established the \n     ``Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act'' (WIFIA), \n     a program designed to assist a wide array of water resources \n     infrastructure projects intended to attract private capital, \n     along with state and local public capital, alongside federal \n     investment.Section 1445 of the conference report modifies the \n     WIFIA program to ensure both public and private capital have \n     an equal opportunity to participate, thereby ensuring \n     financing is adequately leveraged. Some have expressed \n     concerns that modifying the prohibition on the use of tax \n     exempt debt financing may inadvertently disadvantage private \n     capital being used in financing projects.The conferees would \n     request that as the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     US Army Corps of Engineers continue to implement the WIFIA \n     program, the agencies include specifications that will ensure \n     private capital has an equal opportunity to engage in the \n     financing of these projects.\n\n              Title VII--Hazardous Material Transportation\n\n       Title VII of the FAST Act strengthens and advances the safe \n     and efficient movement of hazardous materials through a \n     number of reforms and safety improvements. It also authorizes \n     hazardous materials safety and grant programs for fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2020.\n     Enhances Emergency Preparedness and Response\n       The FAST Act reforms an underutilized grant program to get \n     more resources to states and Indian tribes for emergency \n     response, while also granting states more power to decide how \n     to spend their planning and training grants to improve \n     emergency response. It helps better leverage training funding \n     for hazardous materials employees and those enforcing \n     hazardous material regulations.\n     Streamlines Processes and Creates Certainty and Transparency \n         for Industry\n       The FAST Act accelerates the administrative process and \n     reduces inefficiencies to create certainty for the hazardous \n     materials industry with special permits and approvals. The \n     Act requires a full review of third-party classification labs \n     to ensure the labs can perform such examinations in a manner \n     that meets the hazardous materials regulations. Furthermore, \n     it allows the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety \n     Administration (PHMSA) to respond more effectively during \n     national emergencies. Finally, it requires PHMSA to withdraw \n     a rulemaking on ``wetlines'' consistent with a GAO study \n     recommending that PHMSA collect more data before proceeding \n     further.\n     Enhances Information Available to First Responders\n       The FAST Act requires Class I railroads to generate \n     accurate, real-time, electronic train composition information \n     for first responders through agreements with fusion centers \n     and to provide information about certain flammable liquid \n     shipments to State Emergency Response Commissions (SERCs). It \n     prohibits the withholding of train composition information \n     from first responders in the event of an accident, incident, \n     or emergency. The Act requires the USDOT to establish \n     security and confidentiality protections for the release of \n     any information intended for fusion centers, SERCs, or other \n     authorized persons. It also requires a GAO study on the \n     quality of emergency response information carried by train \n     crews\n     Improves Tank Car Safety Requirements\n       The FAST Act enhances safety by requiring new tank cars to \n     be equipped with ``thermal blankets,'' mandating all legacy \n     DOT-111 tank cars in flammable liquids service are upgraded \n     to new retrofit standards regardless of the product shipped, \n     and setting minimum requirements for the protection of \n     certain valves. Further, it requires reporting on the \n     industry-wide progress and capacity to modify DOT-111 tank \n     cars. Finally, the Act requires a derailment test and an \n     independent evaluation to investigate braking technology \n     requirements for the movement of trains carrying certain \n     hazardous materials, and it requires the Secretary to \n     determine, fully incorporating the results of the testing and \n     evaluation, whether recent electronically-controlled \n     pneumatic braking system requirements are justified.\n\n             Title VIII--Multimodal Freight Transportation\n\n       Title VIII of the FAST Act focuses attention on the \n     importance of multimodal freight transportation as a \n     foundation for the United States to compete in the global \n     economy. The Act establishes a multimodal freight policy and \n     a national multimodal freight strategic plan and designates a \n     National Multimodal Freight Network to assist states in \n     strategically directing resources and informing freight \n     transportation planning.\n       The FAST Act encourages each state to establish a freight \n     advisory committee comprised of freight stakeholders to \n     provide input on freight projects and funding needs. Further, \n     states will be required to develop a fiscally-constrained \n     freight plan, either independently or incorporated into the \n     broader transportation planning process.\n     Additional Explanatory Language\n       The conferees intend for states to solicit input from a \n     broad range of freight stakeholders in adding mileage to the \n     National Multimodal Freight Network, including critical rural \n     freight corridors. The conferees intend for states to take a \n     strong lead in designating facilities for inclusion in the \n     final National Multimodal Freight Network.\n       The conferees emphasize the importance of the national \n     strategic freight plan, which will now be multimodal in \n     scope, and, among other things, will assess the conditions \n     and performance of the National Multimodal Freight Network, \n     and develop best practices for improving the performance of \n     the Network, including critical commerce corridors and \n     critical urban and rural access to critical freight \n     corridors.\n\nTitle IX--National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau\n\n       Title IX of the FAST Act establishes the National Surface \n     Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau (Bureau) within \n     USDOT. The Bureau will serves as a one-stop-shop for states \n     and local governments to receive federal financing or funding \n     assistance, as well as technical assistance, in order to move \n     forward with complex surface transportation projects. The Act \n     directs the Bureau to administer the application process for \n     various credit assistance programs and the NSFHP program; \n     promote innovative financing best practices; reduce \n     uncertainty\n\n[[Page H8809]]\n\n     and delays with environmental reviews and permitting; reduce \n     costs and risks to taxpayers in project delivery; and \n     procurement. The Act also gives the Secretary the authority \n     to consolidate or eliminate different offices within USDOT. \n     These targeted improvements are based on previous \n     congressionally initiated reforms, oversight, and USDOT led \n     pilot projects that seek to reduce project delays and \n     maximize taxpayer funding.\n       Finally, the FAST Act establishes a Council on Credit and \n     Finance (Council) within USDOT. It requires the Council to \n     review applications for various credit assistance programs \n     and the NSFHP program, as appropriate, and then make \n     recommendations to the Secretary about which applications \n     should receive federal financing or funding assistance.\n\n    Title X--Sport Fish Restoration and Recreational Boating Safety\n\n       Title X of the FAST Act reauthorizes expenditure authority \n     for the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act through FY \n     2020 and reforms grant programs to reduce administrative \n     costs and increase flexibility for states. The Act also \n     provides parity for the Coast Guard by establishing a set-\n     aside for the Service's administrative expenses.\n     Additional Explanatory Language\n       The conferees understand that funds provided under section \n     10001 are sufficient to pay the salaries and expenses of \n     some, but not all, of the personnel whose duties exclusively \n     involve boating safety, but who are currently funded out of \n     the Service's Operating Expenses account. Under the authority \n     provided by section 10002, the conferees expect the Coast \n     Guard to use any additional funds provided under section \n     10001 to pay only the salaries and expenses of personnel \n     whose duties exclusively involve boating safety.\n       The majority of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's \n     (USFWS) grants management work with state fish and wildlife \n     agencies occurs at the regional level. As a result, the \n     conferees direct the USFWS to prioritize the use of \n     administrative funds by regional offices to improve grant \n     administration timeliness and responsiveness to state fish \n     and wildlife agencies.\n\n                             Title XI--Rail\n\n       Title XI of the FAST Act reforms Amtrak to improve its \n     business operations and planning; improves rail \n     infrastructure; strengthens freight and passenger rail \n     safety; accelerates project delivery; and leverages \n     innovative rail financing, including potential private sector \n     capital, by reforming an underutilized loan program.\n     Authorizations\n       The FAST Act authorizes fiscally-responsible levels for \n     Amtrak, under a new structure that provides separate funding \n     authorizations for the Northeast Corridor and the National \n     Network. It also authorizes three grant programs to help \n     improve the Nation's rail infrastructure to meet the future \n     needs of freight and passenger movement.\n     Amtrak Reforms\n       The FAST Act makes significant reforms to the way Amtrak \n     structures its financial reporting and planning functions. \n     This Act aligns these critical functions along Amtrak's core \n     operating business lines. All of Amtrak's financial, \n     business, and asset activities are required to be organized \n     in a way that supports the corporation's major business \n     lines. These provisions will allow Northeast Corridor net \n     operating revenues to be re-invested into the Corridor's \n     substantial capital investment needs, while ensuring Amtrak \n     has the tools and resources needed to efficiently operate its \n     National Network. The Act also creates a State-Supported \n     Route Committee to encourage a more collaborative \n     relationship between states, Amtrak, and USDOT regarding \n     state-supported routes for which states provide financial \n     resources. Finally, the Act encourages non-federal \n     participation in certain elements of Amtrak's system by \n     creating station development opportunities for the private \n     sector; exploring the potential for new revenue streams \n     through right-of-way development; and facilitating the use of \n     local products on Amtrak routes.\n     Intercity Passenger Rail Policy\n       The FAST Act includes provisions to improve the Nation's \n     rail infrastructure and its intercity passenger rail service, \n     while ensuring sound use of taxpayer investments in passenger \n     rail projects. The subtitle authorizes a new Consolidated \n     Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements grant program to \n     support a broad array of rail projects and activities, using \n     cost-benefit analysis principles for project selection, and \n     repeals duplicative grant programs. It authorizes a Federal-\n     State Partnership for State of Good Repair grant program \n     designed to improve critical rail assets with a backlog of \n     deferred maintenance, such as Northeast Corridor \n     infrastructure. It also authorizes a Restoration and \n     Enhancement Grant program to assist with, on a competitive \n     basis, the initiation or restoration of routes formerly \n     operated by Amtrak, including the rail service discontinued \n     in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. This program is paired with \n     funding for a Gulf Coast Working Group to study the return of \n     this service.\n       The Act also includes provisions to enhance collaborative \n     capital planning efforts amongst all Northeast Corridor \n     users. The Act creates competitive opportunities for \n     intercity passenger rail routes and strengthens requirements \n     for large capital projects funded with federal dollars. All \n     grant programs are subject to the grant conditions contained \n     in section 24405 of title 49, United States Code.\n     Rail Safety\n       The safe movement of goods and people by rail remains the \n     top rail policy priority of both the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate. The Federal Railroad \n     Administration (FRA) recently reported that fiscal year 2014 \n     was one of the safest years on record, and the agency noted \n     that, since fiscal year 2005, total train accidents have \n     declined by 46 percent, total derailments have declined by 47 \n     percent, and total highway-rail grade crossing incidents have \n     declined by 24 percent. The FAST Act aims to further increase \n     safety.\n       The FAST Act includes several provisions to improve the \n     safety of highway-rail grade crossings, including grade \n     crossing safety action plans, a private grade crossing study, \n     and an evaluation on the use of locomotive horns at grade \n     crossings. Additionally, the Act includes requirements to \n     strengthen the safety of passenger rail, including locomotive \n     recording devices, speed limit action plans, and locomotive \n     alerters. It also includes a post-accident assessment for the \n     Amtrak accident on May 12, 2015, in Philadelphia, \n     Pennsylvania.\n       The FAST Act also establishes a process for obtaining a \n     public version of a bridge inspection report, such as a \n     summary form. However, it does not require a railroad to \n     provide, or authorize the FRA to provide, any copy of any \n     bridge inspection report prepared in accordance with section \n     417 of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 to any state, \n     political subdivision of a state, or other unauthorized \n     persons.\n     Project Delivery\n       Moving projects through the federal review process can be \n     challenging given the number of agencies and entities \n     involved. Subtitle E of this title, the Train, Railroad, and \n     Infrastructure Network Act, streamlines the process for \n     approving rail projects without compromising our historic and \n     natural resources. It does so by applying important \n     provisions already in law for other modes of transportation \n     to rail projects. It directs the Secretary to apply to rail--\n     to the greatest extent feasible--the expedited environmental \n     review procedures already used for highways and transit. It \n     also requires the Secretary to engage in a process to \n     identify additional categorical exclusions used in \n     transportation projects and to propose new and existing \n     exclusions for rail. With respect to historic sites, it \n     preserves existing requirements for important historic sites, \n     such as historic stations, while ensuring expedited delivery \n     of critical improvements to rail infrastructure. It ensures \n     that improvements to certain bridges and tunnels over which \n     common-carrier service has been discontinued or railbanked, \n     but not those bridges and tunnels abandoned from the \n     interstate rail network, are not considered a use of a \n     historic site. This will create an improved and more \n     equitable way for the USDOT to manage federal permitting and \n     reviews for all surface transportation programs, regardless \n     of mode.\n     Financing\n       Innovative financing programs are a method to advance major \n     infrastructure. The Railroad Rehabilitation Improvement and \n     Financing (RRIF) program is authorized to provide loans and \n     loan guarantees to railroad projects, ranging from short-line \n     railroad equipment to passenger rail facilities. While this \n     program provides attractive low-interest, long-term \n     financing, it has not been extensively utilized, and its \n     inflexible terms and limited consideration of project-finance \n     style lending features limit its utility to large-scale \n     infrastructure projects. Subtitle F of this title, the \n     Railroad Infrastructure Financing Improvement Act (RIFIA), \n     includes several provisions designed to unlock this program \n     by streamlining USDOT's approval processes; mirroring \n     programmatic features similar to the successful TIFIA program \n     to make RRIF a more flexible lender; and making it easier to \n     develop partnerships that combine RRIF loans with other types \n     of financing, including private financing. It also requires \n     the Secretary to pay back the credit risk premium, with \n     interest, to a borrower that has repaid its RRIF loan, \n     regardless of whether the loan is or was included in a \n     cohort. The intent of this provision is for the Secretary to \n     pay back such credit risk premium, with interest, as soon as \n     feasible but not later than three months after the date of \n     enactment. Finally, subtitle F includes language that \n     modifies general authority to provide direct loans under RRIF \n     to include at least one of the eligible applicants in a joint \n     venture\n\n[[Page H8810]]\n\n\n\n     H.R. 22, FIXING AMERICA'S SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT (FAST ACT)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  H.R.  22      H.R.  22\n     EAH           EAS              Titles          Conference Agreement\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   DIVISION A--SURFACE TRANSPORTATION\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1...........            1   Short title; table of  Senate recedes with\n                        2    contents.              modifications.\n2...........            3   Definitions..........

Specifically, the Title would modernize \n     and improve the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration (NHTSA) by improving the vehicle safety recall \n     processes, enhancing agency transparency, and increasing \n     efficiency in current regulatory processes. The Title would \n     also increase accountability among automakers and other \n     stakeholders in the automotive industry, promote \n     entrepreneurship and innovation within the automotive \n     industry, and foster greater attention to vehicle safety \n     issues from both automakers and regulators.\n       To modernize and enhance transparency at NHTSA, the Title \n     includes good-government provisions that would require the \n     agency to submit an annual agenda to Congress on its \n     activities for the upcoming year and authorizes additional \n     funding for NHTSA's vehicle safety program if the agency \n     implements recommendations made by the Department of \n     Transportation Inspector General to improve the agency's \n     efficacy.\n       The Title also incentivizes the development and utilization \n     of new crash avoidance technologies that can help reduce the \n     severity of accidents, or prevent accidents altogether. It \n     also directs a study on unattended children warning systems. \n     One section directs NHTSA to update standards related to Tire \n     Pressure Monitoring Systems. This section should not be \n     interpreted as precluding the use of indirect tire pressure \n     monitoring systems or technologies. Both the House and the \n     Senate have been informed that NHTSA has not identified any \n     safety concerns with the indirect systems currently in use in \n     the United States. The Title also requires NHTSA to \n     promulgate a rule for registration of tires sold by \n     independent retailers.\n       To improve the motor vehicle safety recall process, the \n     Title expands the availability and accessibility of vehicle \n     safety recall information to consumers and establishes a \n     pilot grant program for States to notify consumers of vehicle \n     recalls. These provisions are intended to help improve recall \n     awareness among motorists and encourage quick repair of \n     defective vehicles. In addition to these provisions, the \n     Safety Title incentivizes dealers to check for open recalls \n     at the time of service for all patrons and requires rental \n     car companies to ground vehicles that are subject to an open \n     safety recall until they are fixed. The rental car safety \n     provision contains a rule of construction stating that this \n     section should not be construed to create or increase \n     liability under State and local law for damages related to \n     the commercial loss of use of a recalled rental vehicle \n     pending completion of the recall remedy. To encourage future \n     adoption of direct vehicle notification of open recalls, the \n     Title also includes a study on the feasibility of such \n     technology.\n       The Safety Title includes a provision addressing regulatory \n     parity between electric and natural gas vehicles. This \n     provision would modify the manner in which the fuel economy \n     of natural gas dual-fueled vehicles is calculated, beginning \n     in 2016, so as to more closely match the way it is done for \n     electric vehicles.\n       An essential part of improving vehicle and roadway safety \n     is increasing accountability among automotive companies. To \n     that end, the Safety Title extends the time period for \n     automakers to pay for defect remedies from 10 years to 15 \n     years; it extends the period companies must retain safety \n     records from 5 years to 10 years; and increases the maximum \n     cap on civil penalties for violations of motor vehicle safety \n     standards and laws from $35 million to $105 million upon \n     NHTSA's certification that its final rule on civil penalty \n     factors has been completed. These provisions reflect the \n     greater longevity of cars on the road and will prompt NHTSA \n     and automakers to identify safety issues earlier so that \n     recalls can be issued to ensure that motor vehicle owners can \n     have the necessary repairs made as quickly as possible. The \n     Title also broadens a company's recall obligations in the \n     event of bankruptcy and increases corporate responsibility \n     for documents submitted to NHTSA. It also incentivizes \n     industry employees to\n\n[[Page H8815]]\n\n     come forward with original information about possible motor \n     vehicle safety violations by allowing the Secretary of \n     Transportation to pay awards from a portion of recovered \n     sanctions.\n       Entrepreneurship and experimentation within the \n     manufacturing sector are also essential components to the \n     automotive industry's development. To promote sustained \n     growth and ingenuity within the low-volume manufacturing \n     industry, the Safety Title includes a section that creates a \n     framework for low-volume manufacturers to produce replica \n     vehicles. One section directs the manufacturer of the engine \n     installed within replica vehicles to provide instructions to \n     the EPA Administrator and the vehicle manufacturer explaining \n     how to install the engine and maintain its functionality such \n     that it complies with certain environmental laws and \n     regulations. While the instructions must be submitted to the \n     Administrator, nothing in the legislative language \n     contemplates an approval process by the EPA Administrator. \n     Further, this provision explicitly preserves state \n     registration and licensing authorities over the use of such \n     vehicles.\n\n                          DIVISION C--FINANCE\n\n                        Tax Complexity Analysis\n\n       Section 4022(b) of the Internal Revenue Service \n     Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (the `IRS Reform Act') \n     requires the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (in \n     consultation with the Internal Revenue Service and the \n     Treasury Department) to provide a tax complexity analysis. \n     The complexity analysis is required for all legislation \n     reported by the Senate Committee on Finance, the House \n     Committee on Ways and Means, or any committee of conference \n     if the legislation includes a provision that directly or \n     indirectly amends the Internal Revenue Code and has \n     widespread applicability to individuals or small businesses.\n       Pursuant to clause 11(a) of rule XXII of the Rules of the \n     House of Representatives, the staff of the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation has determined that a complexity analysis is not \n     required under section 4022(b) of the IRS Reform Act because \n     the bill contains no provisions that amend the Code and that \n     have `widespread applicability' to individuals or small \n     businesses, within the meaning of the rule.\n\n            Title XXXI--Highway Trust Fund and Related Taxes\n\n Extension of Highway Trust Fund Expenditure Authority (sec. 51101 of \nthe Senate amendment, sec. 31101 of the House amendment, sec. 31101 of \n the conference agreement, and secs. 9503, 9504, and 9508 of the Code) \n                                  \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     \\1\\ Except where otherwise stated, all section references are \n     to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \n     ``Code''). All references to the House amendment refer to the \n     House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 22 (the \n     ``DRIVE Act''), the Surface Transportation Reauthorization \n     and Reform Act of 2015, as passed by the House of \n     Representatives on November 5, 2015.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Present Law Highway Trust Fund Expenditure Provisions In \n         general\n       Under present law, revenues from the highway excise taxes, \n     as imposed through October 1, 2016, generally are dedicated \n     to the Highway Trust Fund. Dedication of excise tax revenues \n     to the Highway Trust Fund and expenditures from the Highway \n     Trust Fund are governed by the Code.\\2\\ The Code authorizes \n     expenditures (subject to appropriations) from the Highway \n     Trust Fund through December 4, 2015, for the purposes \n     provided in authorizing legislation, as such legislation was \n     in effect on the date of enactment of the Surface \n     Transportation Extension Act of 2015, Part II.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Sec. 9503. The Highway Trust Fund statutory provisions \n     were placed in the Internal Revenue Code in 1982.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Highway Trust Fund expenditure purposes\n       The Highway Trust Fund has a separate account for mass \n     transit, the Mass Transit Account.\\3\\ The Highway Trust Fund \n     and the Mass Transit Account are funding sources for specific \n     programs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ Sec. 9503(e)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Highway Trust Fund expenditure purposes have been revised \n     with each authorization Act enacted since establishment of \n     the Highway Trust Fund in 1956. In general, expenditures \n     authorized under those Acts (as the Acts were in effect on \n     the date of enactment of the most recent such authorizing \n     Act) are specified by the Code as Highway Trust Fund \n     expenditure purposes. The Code provides that the authority to \n     make expenditures from the Highway Trust Fund expires after \n     December 4, 2015. Thus, no Highway Trust Fund expenditures \n     may occur after December 4, 2015, without an amendment to the \n     Code.\n       Section 9503 of the Code appropriates to the Highway Trust \n     Fund amounts equivalent to the taxes received from the \n     following: the taxes on diesel, gasoline, kerosene and \n     special motor fuel, the tax on tires, the annual heavy \n     vehicle use tax, and the tax on the retail sale of heavy \n     trucks and trailers.\\4\\ Section 9601 provides that amounts \n     appropriated to a trust fund pursuant to sections 9501 \n     through 9511, are to be transferred at least monthly from the \n     General Fund of the Treasury to such trust fund on the basis \n     of estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury of the \n     amounts referred to in the Code section appropriating the \n     amounts to such trust fund. The Code requires that proper \n     adjustments be made in amounts subsequently transferred to \n     the extent prior estimates were in excess of, or less than, \n     the amounts required to be transferred.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\4\\ Sec. 9503(b)(1).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The expenditure authority for the Highway Trust Fund is \n     extended through September 30, 2021.

The remaining three are a \n     retail sales tax on heavy highway vehicles, a manufacturers' \n     excise tax on heavy vehicle tires, and an annual use tax on \n     heavy vehicles. A substantial majority of the revenues \n     produced by the Highway Trust Fund excise taxes are derived \n     from the taxes on motor fuels. The annual use tax on heavy \n     vehicles expires October 1, 2017. Except for 4.3 cents per \n     gallon of the Highway Trust Fund fuels tax rates, the \n     remaining taxes are scheduled to expire after October 1, \n     2016.

In addition to the \n     revocation or denial of passports to delinquent taxpayers, \n     the Secretary of State is authorized to deny an application \n     for a passport if the applicant fails to provide a social \n     security number or provides an incorrect or invalid social \n     security number. With respect to an incorrect or invalid \n     number, the inclusion of an erroneous number is a basis for \n     rejection of the application only if the erroneous number was \n     provided willfully, intentionally, recklessly or negligently. \n     Exceptions to these rules are permitted for emergency or \n     humanitarian circumstances, including the issuance of a \n     passport for short-term use to return to the United States by \n     the delinquent taxpayer.\n       The provision authorizes limited sharing of information \n     between the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury. \n     If the Commissioner of Internal Revenue certifies to the \n     Secretary of the Treasury the identity of\n\n[[Page H8817]]\n\n     persons who have seriously delinquent Federal tax debts as \n     defined in this provision, the Secretary of the Treasury or \n     his delegate is authorized to transmit such certification to \n     the Secretary of State for use in determining whether to \n     issue, renew, or revoke a passport. Applicants whose names \n     are included on the certifications provided to the Secretary \n     of State are ineligible for a passport. The Secretary of \n     State and Secretary of the Treasury are held harmless with \n     respect to any certification issued pursuant to this \n     provision.\n       A seriously delinquent tax debt generally includes any \n     outstanding debt for Federal taxes in excess of $50,000, \n     including interest and any penalties, for which a notice of \n     lien or a notice of levy has been filed. This amount is to be \n     adjusted for inflation annually, using calendar year 2014 as \n     a base year, and a cost-of-living adjustment. Even if a tax \n     debt otherwise meets the statutory threshold, it may not be \n     considered seriously delinquent if (1) the debt is being paid \n     in a timely manner pursuant to an installment agreement or \n     offer-in-compromise, or (2) collection action with respect to \n     the debt is suspended because a collection due process \n     hearing or innocent spouse relief has been requested or is \n     pending.\n       Effective date.--The provision is effective on January 1, \n     2015.\n\n\n                            House Amendment\n\n       The House amendment is the same as the Senate amendment.\n\n\n                          Conference Agreement\n\n       The following changes are included in the conference \n     agreement to ensure that there is a mechanism allowing the \n     IRS to correct errors and to take into account actions taken \n     by a taxpayer to come into compliance after procedures has \n     been initiated to inform the Secretary of State that the \n     taxpayer is seriously delinquent. As explained below, these \n     measures include clarification of the definition of a \n     seriously delinquent tax debt, notification requirements, \n     standards under which the Commissioner may reverse the \n     certification of serious delinquency, and limits on authority \n     to delegate the certification process. A limited right to \n     seek injunctive relief by a taxpayer who is wrongly certified \n     as seriously delinquent is also provided.\n       The provision clarifies the definition of ``seriously \n     delinquent tax debt'' to permit revocation of a passport only \n     after the IRS has followed its examination and collection \n     procedures under current law and the taxpayer's \n     administrative and judicial rights have been exhausted or \n     lapsed.\n       The provision requires notice to taxpayers regarding the \n     procedures. First, the provision adds the possible loss of a \n     passport to the list of matters required to be included in \n     notices to taxpayer of potential collection activity under \n     sections 6320 or 6331. Second, the provision requires that \n     the Commissioner provide contemporaneous notice to the \n     taxpayer(s) when the Commissioner sends a certification of \n     serious delinquency to the Secretary of the Treasury. \n     Finally, in instances in which the Commissioner decertifies \n     the taxpayer's status as a delinquent taxpayer, he is \n     required to provide notice to the taxpayer contemporaneous \n     with the notice to the Secretary of the Treasury.\n       The decertification process included in the conference \n     agreement provides a mechanism under which the Commissioner \n     can correct an erroneous certification or end the \n     certification because the debt is no longer seriously \n     delinquent, due to certain events subsequent to the \n     certification. If after certifying the delinquency to the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, (1) the IRS receives full payment \n     of the seriously delinquent tax debt, (2) the taxpayer enters \n     into an installment agreement under section 6159, (3) the IRS \n     accepts an offer in compromise under section 7122, or (4) a \n     spouse files for relief from joint liability, the \n     Commissioner must notify the Secretary that the taxpayer is \n     not seriously delinquent. In each instance, the \n     ``decertification'' is limited to the taxpayer who is the \n     subject of one of the above actions. In the case of a claim \n     for innocent spouse relief, the decertification is only with \n     respect to the spouse claiming relief, not both. The \n     Commissioner must generally decertify within 30 days of the \n     event that requires decertification. The Commissioner must \n     provide the notice of decertification to the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, who must in turn promptly notify the Secretary of \n     State of the decertification. The Secretary of State must \n     delete the certification from the records regarding that \n     taxpayer.\n       The provision as amended limits the Commissioner's \n     authority to delegate duties under this section. As amended, \n     the authority to certify or decertify a seriously delinquent \n     tax debt is delegable only to the Deputy Commissioner for \n     Services and Enforcement, or to a Division Commissioner (the \n     head of an IRS operating division).\n       Finally, the amendments to the provision permit limited \n     judicial review of the certification or a failure to reverse \n     a certification.\n       Effective date.--The provision as amended is effective upon \n     date of enactment.\n\n B. Reform of rules related to qualified tax collection contracts, and \n  special compliance personnel program (secs. 52102 and 52103 of the \n Senate amendment, secs. 32106 and 32107 of the House amendment, secs. \n32102 and 32103 of the conference agreement, and sec. 6306 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Code section 6306 permits the IRS to use private debt \n     collection companies to locate and contact taxpayers owing \n     outstanding tax liabilities of any type\\24\\ and to arrange \n     payment of those taxes by the taxpayers. There must be an \n     assessment pursuant to section 6201 in order for there to be \n     an outstanding tax liability. An assessment is the formal \n     recording of the taxpayer's tax liability that fixes the \n     amount payable. An assessment must be made before the IRS is \n     permitted to commence enforcement actions to collect the \n     amount payable. In general, an assessment is made at the \n     conclusion of all examination and appeals processes within \n     the IRS.\\25\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\24\\ This provision generally applies to any type of tax \n     imposed under the Internal Revenue Code.\n     \\25\\ An amount of tax reported as due on the taxpayer's tax \n     return is considered to be self-assessed. If the IRS \n     determines that the assessment or collection of tax will be \n     jeopardized by delay, it has the authority to assess the \n     amount immediately (sec. 6861), subject to several procedural \n     safeguards.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Several steps are involved in the deployment of private \n     debt collection companies. First, the private debt collection \n     company contacts the taxpayer by letter.\\26\\ If the \n     taxpayer's last known address is incorrect, the private debt \n     collection company searches for the correct address. Second, \n     the private debt collection company telephones the taxpayer \n     to request full payment.\\27\\ If the taxpayer cannot pay in \n     full immediately, the private debt collection company offers \n     the taxpayer an installment agreement providing for full \n     payment of the taxes over a period of as long as five years. \n     If the taxpayer is unable to pay the outstanding tax \n     liability in full over a five-year period, the private debt \n     collection company obtains financial information from the \n     taxpayer and will provide this information to the IRS for \n     further processing and action by the IRS. The Code specifies \n     several procedural conditions under which the provision would \n     operate. First, provisions of the Fair Debt Collection \n     Practices Act apply to the private debt collection company. \n     Second, taxpayer protections that are statutorily applicable \n     to the IRS are also made statutorily applicable to the \n     private sector debt collection companies. In addition, \n     taxpayer protections that are statutorily applicable to \n     employees of the IRS are made statutorily applicable to \n     employees of private sector debt collection companies. Third, \n     subcontractors are prohibited from having contact with \n     taxpayers, providing quality assurance services, and \n     composing debt collection notices; any other service provided \n     by a subcontractor must receive prior approval from the IRS.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\26\\ The provision requires that the IRS disclose \n     confidential taxpayer information to the private debt \n     collection company. Section 6103(n) permits disclosure of \n     returns and return information for ``the providing of other \n     services . . . for purposes of tax administration.''\n     \\27\\ The private debt collection company is not permitted to \n     accept payment directly. Payments are required to be \n     processed by IRS employees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Code creates a revolving fund from the amounts \n     collected by the private debt collection companies. The \n     private debt collection companies are paid out of this fund. \n     The Code prohibits the payment of fees for all services in \n     excess of 25 percent of the amount collected under a tax \n     collection contract.\n       The Code provides that up to 25 percent of the amount \n     collected may be used for IRS collection enforcement \n     activities. The law also requires the Treasury Department to \n     provide a biennial report to the Committee on Finance and the \n     Committee on Ways and Means. The report is to include, among \n     other items, a cost benefit analysis, the impact of the debt \n     collection contracts on collection enforcement staff levels \n     in the IRS, and an evaluation of contractor performance. The \n     Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 (the ``Act''), which made \n     appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, \n     included a provision stating that none of the funds made \n     available in the Act could be used to fund or administer \n     section 6306.\\28\\ Around the same time, the IRS announced \n     that the IRS would not renew its contracts with private debt \n     collection agencies.\\29\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\28\\ Pub. L. No. 111-8, March 11, 2009.\n     \\29\\ IR-2009-19, March 5, 2009.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n     Qualified tax collection contracts\n       The provision requires the Secretary to enter into \n     qualified tax collection contracts for the collection of \n     inactive tax receivables. Inactive tax receivables are \n     defined as any tax receivable (1) removed from the active \n     inventory for lack of resources or inability to locate the \n     taxpayer, (2) for which more than 1/3 of the applicable \n     limitations period has lapsed and no IRS employee has been \n     assigned to collect the receivable; or (3) for which, a \n     receivable has been assigned for collection but more than 365 \n     days have passed without interaction with the taxpayer or a \n     third party for purposes of furthering the collection. Tax \n     receivables are defined as any outstanding assessment that \n     the IRS includes in potentially collectible inventory.\n       The provision designates certain tax receivables as not \n     eligible for collection under qualified tax collection \n     contracts, specifically a contract that: (1) is subject to a \n     pending or active offer-in-compromise or installment \n     agreement; (2) is classified as an innocent spouse case; (3) \n     involves a taxpayer identified by the Secretary as being (a) \n     deceased, (b) under the age of 18, (c) in a designated combat \n     zone, or (d) a victim of identity theft; (4) is currently \n     under examination, litigation, criminal investigation, or \n     levy; or (5) is currently subject to a proper exercise of a \n     right of appeal. The provision grants authority to the \n     Secretary to prescribe procedures for taxpayers in \n     presidentially declared disaster areas to request\n\n[[Page H8818]]\n\n     relief from immediate collection measures under the \n     provision.\n       The provision requires the Secretary to give priority to \n     private collection contractors and debt collection centers \n     currently approved by the Treasury Department's Bureau of the \n     Fiscal Service (previously the Financial Management Service) \n     on the schedule required under section 3711(g) of title 31 of \n     the United States Code, to the extent appropriate to carry \n     out the purposes of the provision.\n       The provision adds an additional exception to section 6103 \n     to allow contractors to identify themselves as such and \n     disclose the nature, subject, and reason for the contact. \n     Disclosures are permitted only in situations and under \n     conditions approved by the Secretary.\n       The provision requires the Secretary to prepare two reports \n     for the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate \n     Committee on Finance. The first report is required annually \n     and due not later than 90 days after each fiscal year and is \n     required to include: (1) the total number and amount of tax \n     receivables provided to each contractor for collection under \n     this section, (2) the total amounts collected by and \n     installment agreements resulting from the collection efforts \n     of each contractor and the collection costs incurred by the \n     IRS; (3) the impact of such contacts on the total number and \n     amount of unpaid assessments, and on the number and amount of \n     assessments collected by IRS personnel after initial contact \n     by a contractor, (4) the amount of fees retained by the \n     Secretary under subsection (e) and a description of the use \n     of such funds; and (5) a disclosure safeguard report in a \n     form similar to that required under section 6103(p)(5).\n       The second report is required biannually and is required to \n     include: (i) an independent evaluation of contactor \n     performance; and (ii) a measurement plan that includes a \n     comparison of the best practices used by private debt \n     collectors to the collection techniques used by the IRS and \n     mechanisms to identify and capture information on successful \n     collection techniques used by the contractors that could be \n     adopted by the IRS.\n     Special compliance personnel program\n       The provision requires that the amount that, under current \n     law, is to be retained and used by the IRS for collection \n     enforcement activities under section 6306 of the Code be \n     instead used to fund a newly created special compliance \n     personnel program. The provision also requires the Secretary \n     to establish an account for the hiring, training, and \n     employment of special compliance personnel. No other source \n     of funding for the program is permitted, and funds deposited \n     in the special account are restricted to use for the program, \n     including reimbursement of the IRS and other agencies for the \n     cost of administering the qualified debt collection program \n     and all costs associated with employment of special \n     compliance personnel and the retraining and reassignment of \n     other personnel as special compliance personnel. Special \n     compliance personnel are individuals employed by the IRS to \n     serve either as revenue officers performing field collection \n     functions or as persons operating the automated collection \n     system.\n       The provision requires the Secretary to prepare annually a \n     report for the House Committee on Ways and Means and the \n     Senate Committee on Finance, to be submitted no later than \n     March of each year. In the report, the Secretary is to \n     describe for the preceding fiscal year accounting of all \n     funds received in the account, administrative and program \n     costs, number of special compliance personnel hired and \n     employed as well as actual revenue collected by such \n     personnel. Similar information for the current and following \n     fiscal year, using both actual and estimated amounts, is \n     required\n       Effective date.--The provision relating to qualified tax \n     collection contracts applies to tax receivables identified by \n     the Secretary after the date of enactment. The requirement to \n     give priority to certain private collection contractors and \n     debt collection centers applies to contracts and agreements \n     entered into within three months after the date of enactment, \n     and the new exception to section 6103 applies to disclosures \n     made after the date of enactment. The requirement of the \n     reports to Congress is effective on the date of enactment.\n       The provision relating to the special compliance personnel \n     program applies to amounts collected and retained by the \n     Secretary after date of enactment.\n\n\n                            house amendment\n\n       The House amendment is the same as the Senate amendment.\n\n\n                          conference agreement\n\n       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and \n     the Senate amendment provision. It is intended that the IRS \n     will implement the proposal without delay to facilitate the \n     collection of taxes, which are owed to the Government but are \n     not being actively pursued by the IRS for collection, while \n     protecting taxpayer rights and privacy. To carry out these \n     goals of expeditious tax collection and taxpayer rights, it \n     is intended that the IRS will make it a priority to use \n     collection contractors and debt collection centers currently \n     approved by the Treasury Department.\n\nC. Repeal of Modification of Automatic Extension of Return Due Date for \n    Certain Employee Benefit Plans (sec. 52105(b)(3) of the Senate \n amendment, sec. 32104 of the conference agreement and secs. 6058 and \n                           6059 of the Code)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       An employer that maintains a pension, annuity, stock bonus, \n     profit-sharing or other funded deferred compensation plan (or \n     the plan administrator of the plan) is required to file an \n     annual return containing information required under \n     regulations with respect to the qualification, financial \n     condition, and operation of the plan.\\30\\ The plan \n     administrator of a defined benefit plan subject to the \n     minimum funding requirements \\31\\ is required to file an \n     annual actuarial report.\\32\\ These filing requirements are \n     met by filing an Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit \n     Plan, Form 5500, and providing the information as required on \n     the form and related instructions.\\33\\ Similarly, the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') \n     requires the administrator of certain pension and welfare \n     benefit plans to file annual reports disclosing certain \n     information to the Department of Labor (``DOL'') and, with \n     respect to some defined benefit plans, to the Pension Benefit \n     Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'').\\34\\ Plan administrators also \n     comply with these ERISA filing requirements by filing Form \n     5500.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\30\\ Sec. 6058.\n     \\31\\ Sec. 412. Most governmental plans (defined in section \n     414(d)) and church plans (defined in section 414(e)) are \n     exempt from the minimum funding requirements.\n     \\32\\ Sec. 6059.\n     \\33\\ Treas. Reg. secs. 301.6058-1(a) and 301.6059-1. Form \n     5500 consists of a main form and various schedules, some of \n     which require additional information to be included. The \n     schedules that must be filed and the additional information \n     that must be included with Form 5500 depend on the type and \n     size of plan. A simplified annual reporting form, Annual \n     Return/Report of Small Employee Benefit Plan, Form 5500-SF, \n     is available to certain plans (covering fewer than 100 \n     employees) that are subject to reporting requirements under \n     ERISA and the Code. References herein to Form 5500 include \n     Form 5500-SF.\n     \\34\\ ERISA secs. 103, 104, and 4065. Most governmental plans \n     and church plans are exempt from ERISA, including the ERISA \n     reporting requirements. ERISA section 3004 requires that, \n     when the IRS and DOL carry out provisions relating to the \n     same subject matter, they must consult with each other and \n     develop rules, regulations, practices and forms designed to \n     reduce duplication of effort, duplication of reporting, and \n     the burden of compliance by plan administrators and \n     employers. Under ERISA section 4065, the PBGC is required to \n     work with the IRS and DOL to combine the annual report to \n     PBGC with reports required to be made to those agencies.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Forms 5500 are filed with DOL, and information from Forms \n     5500 is shared with the IRS and PBGC.\\35\\ Form 5500 is due by \n     the last day of the seventh month following the close of the \n     plan year.\\36\\ DOL and IRS rules allow the due date to be \n     automatically extended by 2\\1/2\\ months if a request for \n     extension is filed.\\37\\ Thus, in the case of a plan that uses \n     the calendar year as the plan year, the extended due date for \n     Form 5500 is October 15.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\35\\ Form 5500 filings are also publicly released in \n     accordance with sec. 6104(b) and Treas. Reg. sec. \n     301.6104(b)-1 and ERISA secs. 104(a)(1) and 106(a).\n     \\36\\ Under ERISA section 104(a)(1), the annual report is due \n     within 210 days after the close of the plan year or within \n     such time as provided by regulations to reduce duplicative \n     filings. DOL and IRS regulations provide for filing at the \n     time required by the forms and instructions issued by the \n     agencies. 29 C.F.R. sec. 2520.104a-5(a)(2) and Treas. Reg. \n     secs. 301.6058-1(a)(4) and 301.6059-1(a).\n     \\37\\ Treas. Reg. sec. 1.6081-11(a). Instructions for Form \n     5500 also provide for an automatic extension of time to file \n     the Form 5500 until the due date of the Federal income tax \n     return of the employer maintaining the plan if (1) the plan \n     year and the employer's tax year are the same; (2) the \n     employer has been granted an extension of time to file its \n     federal income tax return to a date later than the normal due \n     date for filing the Form 5500; and (3) a copy of the \n     application for extension of time to file the Federal income \n     tax return is maintained with the records of the Form 5500 \n     filer.

Section 32202 also dissolves the existence \n     of the surplus account on a go-forward basis. Finally, \n     Section 32202 ensures future net earnings of the Federal \n     Reserve, in excess of dividend paid, are remitted to the U.S. \n     Treasury.\n\n\n                            senate amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment to H.R. 22 contains no provisions \n     comparable to the House position.\n\n\n                         conference substitute\n\n       The Senate recedes from its position and concurs in the \n     House position with certain modifications. Specifically, the \n     conference substitute retains the Federal Reserve surplus \n     account, but caps it at $10,000,000,000. Any amounts which \n     exceed the cap are remitted to the U.S. Treasury.\n     Section 32203--Dividends of the Federal Reserve Bank\n\n\n                            senate amendment\n\n       Section 52203 of the Senate amendment to H.R. 22 modified \n     Section 7(a)(1)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. \n     289(a)(1)(A)) by reducing the interest rate from 6 percent to \n     1.5 percent on capital paid into the Federal Reserve System \n     by member banks with consolidated assets over $1,000,000,000.\n\n\n                            house amendment\n\n       The House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 22 \n     contains no provisions comparable to the Senate position.\n\n\n                         conference substitute\n\n       The House recedes from its position and concurs in the \n     Senate position with certain modifications. Specifically, the \n     conference substitute retains the 6 percent dividend in \n     current law for Federal Reserve System member banks with \n     consolidated assets of $10,000,000,000 or less, indexed to \n     inflation. For member banks with consolidated assets greater \n     than that amount, the conference substitute replaces the 1.5 \n     percent interest rate with the smaller of: the rate equal to \n     the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the \n     last auction held prior to the payment of a dividend, and 6 \n     percent. Finally, the conference substitute delays the \n     effective date of the modification to January 1, 2016.\n     Section 32204--Strategic Petroleum Reserve Drawdown and Sale\n       Drawdown and Sale. Subsection (a) would direct the \n     Department of Energy to draw down and sell 66 million barrels \n     of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).\n       Emergency Protection. Subsection (b) would provide that \n     Secretary shall not draw down and sell crude oil under this \n     section in quantities that would limit the authority to sell \n     petroleum products under section 161(h) of the Energy Policy \n     and Conservation Act. This subsection conditions the 66 \n     million barrels of oil authorized to be sold in a) upon the \n     maintenance of a 530 million barrel floor generally in the \n     Reserve. Forthcoming drawdowns previously authorized by the \n     Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 would take precedence.\n       Increase; Limitation. Subsection (c) would authorize the \n     increase of drawdown and sales under subsection (b) in order \n     to maximize the financial return to the United States \n     taxpayers, but limits the drawdown and sales under this \n     section to a maximum of $6,200,000,000 of revenue to the \n     Treasury.\n     Sec. 32205--Repeal\n       Section 32205 would repeal Section 201 of the Bipartisan \n     Budget Act of 2015. Section 201 of the Bipartisan Budget Act \n     of 2015 required the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \n     renegotiate the Standard Reinsurance Agreement by December \n     31, 2016, and would have placed a cap on the overall rate of \n     return such that the target rate of return did not exceed 8.9 \n     percent of the retained premium.\n     Sec. 32301--Interest Overpayments\n       Section 32301 strikes the requirement that the Office of \n     National Resources Revenue (ONRR) pay interest on \n     overpayments. ONRR, which is part of the Department of the \n     Interior, believes that some lessees overpay deliberately in \n     order to engage in ``banking with ONRR'' and that the ONRR \n     interest rate is in some cases greater than that offered by \n     other interest earning mechanisms. This provision is part of \n     the President's FY 2016 budget. Offset estimate: $300 \n     million.\n     Section 32401--Budgetary Effects\n\n\n                            house amendment\n\n       The House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 22 \n     contains no provisions compared to the Senate position.\n\n\n                            senate amendment\n\n       Section 80001 of the Senate amendment to H.R. 22 provides \n     the budgetary effects to be entered into the PAYGO scorecard \n     maintained pursuant to section 4(d) of the Statutory Pay-As-\n     You-Go Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-139) shall be determined \n     by the submission printed for the Congressional Record by the \n     Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\n\n                         conference substitute\n\n       The conference substituteprovides that the budgetary \n     effects of this Act shall not be entered on either PAYGO \n     scorecard maintained pursuant to section 4(d) of the \n     Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-139).\n\n                       DIVISION D--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n               Title XLI--Federal Permitting Improvements\n\n       Title XLI of the conference report seeks to make more \n     efficient the process for federal approval for major \n     infrastructure projects. It creates a council composed of the \n     relevant permitting agencies to establish best practices and \n     model timelines for review, designate individuals within \n     agencies with primary responsibility for coordinating reviews \n     and agency decisions, and shorten the time in which \n     challenges can be made to final decisions.\n       The Senate recedes with an amendment.\n\n                   Title XLII--Additional Provisions\n\n       Title XLII directs the GAO to study the payments made to \n     vendors of kerosene that is used in noncommercial aviation \n     and submit the results of that study in a report to Congress.\n\n            Title XLIII--Requirements Regarding Rule Makings\n\n       The House amendment includes a provision requiring that for \n     any publication in the Federal Register pertaining to a rule \n     required pursuant to this Act, the agency making the rule \n     shall include the information that the rule is based upon, \n     including data and studies, and indicate how the public can \n     access that information online.\n       The Senate amendment contains no similar provision.\n       The Senate recedes.\n\n       Title XLIV--Payments to Certified States and Indian Tribes\n\n       In the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act \n     (MAP-21), payments based upon Abandoned Mine Land (AML) funds \n     set forth in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act \n     of 1977 due to certified states were capped at $15,000,000.00 \n     annually, regardless of the amounts actually due to those \n     certified states. The amounts due the certified states in \n     excess of the $15,000,000.00 were used as offsets for \n     different purposes. In certain instances, the $15,000,000.00 \n     payments were insufficient to meet the amounts certified \n     states were owed by the Federal government. This provision \n     requires payment of those excess funds owed by the Federal \n     government to those certified states, but not paid.\n\n          DIVISION E--EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n       Division E reauthorizes and reforms the Export-Import Bank \n     of the United States. There was no disagreement between the \n     Senate amendment and the House amendment.\n\n                      DIVISION F--ENERGY SECURITY\n\n     Sec. 61001--Emergency Preparedness for Energy Supply \n         Disruptions\n       Section 61001 would include the finding that recent natural \n     disasters have underscored the importance of having resilient \n     oil and natural gas infrastructure and effective\n\n[[Page H8820]]\n\n     ways for industry and government to communicate to address \n     energy supply disruptions. This section also would direct the \n     Secretary of Energy to develop and adopt procedures to \n     enhance communication and coordination between the Department \n     of Energy (DOE), Federal partners, State and local \n     government, and the private sector to improve emergency \n     response and recovery.\n     Sec. 61002--Resolving Environmental and Grid Reliability \n         Conflicts\n       Section 61002 would resolve conflicts between orders issued \n     pursuant to the Federal Power Act and compliance with \n     environmental laws and regulations. Administration of section \n     202(c) has led owners of electric generating units (EGUs) to \n     conclude that they can be forced to choose between complying \n     with an emergency order from DOE under that section or \n     violating an obligation imposed by environmental laws or \n     regulations. Left unresolved, therefore, the current \n     statutory structure presents the potential for conflicting \n     legal mandates that could threaten the reliability of the \n     grid.\n       To ensure that EGUs and other facilities critical to \n     electric reliability are available for service as needed and \n     to remove the potential for conflict between obligations \n     imposed by law, section 61002 would amend section 202(c) of \n     the FPA to clarify that when a party is under an emergency \n     directive to operate pursuant to section 202(c), it would not \n     be deemed in violation of environmental laws or regulations \n     or subject to civil or criminal liability, or citizen \n     enforcement actions, as a result of actions taken that are \n     necessary to comply with a DOE-issued emergency order. The \n     section further provides that after an initial order, not to \n     exceed 90 days duration, DOE may renew or reissue an order \n     for subsequent 90-day periods as it determines necessary. \n     However, in renewing or reissuing any such order, DOE must \n     consult with the primary federal agency with expertise in the \n     environmental interest protected by a potentially conflicting \n     environmental law and include in such order conditions \n     determined by such agency to be necessary to minimize any \n     adverse environmental impacts that may result from such \n     order, to the extent practicable. DOE may exclude such a \n     condition from the renewed or reissued order if it determines \n     that such condition would prevent the order from adequately \n     addressing the emergency necessitating such order and \n     provides in the order, or otherwise makes publicly available, \n     an explanation of such determination.\n     Sec. 61003--Critical Electric Infrastructure Security\n       Section 61003 would establish a new section 215A of the \n     Federal Power Act that would provide the Secretary of Energy \n     with the authority to address grid security emergencies if \n     the President provides a written directive or determination \n     identifying a grid security emergency. The Secretary would be \n     authorized to take emergency measures to protect the bulk \n     power system or defense critical electric infrastructure \n     located in the contiguous 48 States and the District of \n     Columbia, including ordering critical electric infrastructure \n     owners and operators to take appropriate actions, with such \n     measures to expire no later than fifteen days from issuance. \n     The new section 215A would also facilitate the protection and \n     voluntary sharing of critical electric infrastructure \n     information between private sector asset owners and the \n     Federal government by: (1) exempting designated Critical \n     Electric Infrastructure Information from certain Federal and \n     State disclosure laws for a period up to 5 years; (2) \n     requiring FERC to facilitate voluntary information sharing \n     between Federal, State, local and tribal authorities, the \n     Electric Reliability Organization, regional entities, and \n     owners, operators and users of the bulk-power system in the \n     U.S.; and (3) establishing sanctions for the unauthorized \n     disclosure of shared information.\n       Section 61003 would also codify DOE as the Sector-Specific \n     Agency for cyber security for the energy sector and specify \n     DOE's duties with regard to that role.\n     Sec. 61004--Strategic Transformer Reserve\n       Section 61004 would require DOE to submit a plan to \n     Congress evaluating the feasibility of establishing a \n     Strategic Transformer Reserve for the storage, in \n     strategically-located facilities, of spare large power \n     transformers and emergency mobile substations in sufficient \n     numbers to temporarily replace critically damaged large power \n     transformers and substations. Strategically-located spare \n     large power transformers and emergency mobile substations \n     would diminish the vulnerability of the United States to \n     multiple risks facing electric grid reliability, including \n     physical attack, cyber-attack, electromagnetic pulse, \n     geomagnetic disturbances, severe weather, and seismic events.\n     Sec. 61005--Energy Security Evaluation\n       Section 61005 would direct the Secretary of Energy, in \n     collaboration with the Secretary of State, to establish U.S. \n     energy security valuation methods to ensure that energy-\n     related actions that significantly affect the supply, \n     distribution, or use of energy are evaluated with respect to \n     their potential impact on energy security, including their \n     impact on consumers and the economy; energy supply, diversity \n     and resiliency; well-functioning and competitive energy \n     markets; United States trade balance; and national security \n     objectives.\n\n                     DIVISION G--FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\n\n                            House Amendment\n\n       Division G (Financial Services) of the House amendment to \n     the Senate amendment to H.R. 22 is comprised of 15 titles \n     that provide regulatory relief to facilitate capital \n     formation, ensure greater consumer access to financial \n     products and services, and provide for certain reforms \n     relating to mint operations and housing. The titles within \n     Division G are derived from measures passed by the House on a \n     bipartisan basis in the 114th Congress.\n     Title LXXI--Improving Access to Capital for Emerging Growth \n         Companies\n       Title LXXI makes changes related to the treatment of \n     Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs), as defined by the Jumpstart \n     Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act). Specifically, this \n     title reduces the number of days an EGC must have a \n     confidential registration statement on file with the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it may \n     conduct a ``road show'' from 21 days to 15 days. Title LXXI \n     also clarifies that an issuer that was an EGC at the time it \n     filed a confidential registration statement but is no longer \n     an EGC will continue to be treated as an EGC through the date \n     of its IPO. Finally, Title LXXI requires the SEC to revise \n     its general instructions on Form S-1 regarding the financial \n     information an issuer must disclose prior to its IPO. The \n     House passed legislation identical to the provisions \n     contained in Title LXXI by voice vote on July 14, 2015.\n     Title LXXII--Disclosure Modernization and Simplification\n       Title LXXII directs the SEC to simplify its disclosure \n     regime for issuers and investors by permitting issuers to \n     submit a summary page on Form 10-K with cross-references to \n     the content of the report. This title also directs the SEC to \n     revise Regulation S-K to scale disclosure rules for EGCs and \n     smaller issuers, and to eliminate duplicative, outdated, or \n     unnecessary Regulation S-K disclosure requirements for all \n     issuers. Finally, Title LXXII directs the SEC to further \n     study Reg. S-K and engage in rulemaking to implement \n     additional reforms to simplify and modernize Regulation S-K \n     disclosure rules within 360 days of enactment of this title. \n     The House passed legislation identical to the provisions \n     contained in Title LXXII by voice vote on October 6, 2015.\n     Title LXXIII--Bullion and Collectible Coin Production \n         Efficiency and Cost Savings\n       Title LXXIII eliminates a requirement for special packaging \n     of gold investment-grade coins made by the United States \n     Mint, allows the Mint to purchase blanks for silver coins \n     made of standard coinage silver instead of a custom silver \n     alloy, and removes the requirement for an already-completed \n     study leading to the Mint issuing investment-grade coins of \n     palladium. This title also allows for the collector version \n     of the 30th anniversary American Eagle Siler Bullion Coin to \n     be edge-lettered to denote such anniversary. The House passed \n     legislation identical to the provisions contained in Title \n     LXXIII by voice vote on June 24, 2015.\n     Title LXXIV--SBIC Advisers Relief\n       Title LXXIV amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to \n     reduce unnecessary regulatory costs and eliminate duplicative \n     regulation of advisers to Small Business Investment Companies \n     (SBICs). This title preempts state registration requirements \n     of advisers solely advising SBIC funds, allows advisers to \n     venture capital funds to continue to be ``exempt reporting \n     advisers'' if they also advise an SBIC fund, and prevents the \n     inclusion of the assets of an SBIC fund in the SEC \n     registration calculation of assets under management for those \n     advisers that advise private funds in addition to SBIC funds. \n     The House passed legislation identical to the provisions \n     contained in Title LXXIV by voice vote on July 14, 2015.\n     Title LXXV--Eliminate Privacy Notice Confusion\n       Title LXXV amends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to reduce \n     confusion among consumers that can occur when they receive \n     annual privacy notices by clarifying that annual privacy \n     notices are only required when disclosure policies change \n     after the relationship begins, and to the extent an \n     institution shares sensitive personal information with third \n     parties for marketing purposes. The House passed legislation \n     identical to the provisions contained in Title LXXV by voice \n     vote on April 13, 2015.\n     Title LXXVI--Reforming Access for Investments in Startup \n         Enterprises\n       Title LXXVI amends Section 4 of the Securities Act of 1933 \n     to facilitate the sale of company-issued securities by \n     employees of private companies. Under current law, a holder \n     of securities issued in a private placement may resell the \n     securities on a public market after a holding period. \n     However, there is not a legal framework providing for the \n     private resale of such securities. Accordingly, this title \n     establishes a legal framework for such transactions. The \n     House passed legislation identical to the provisions \n     contained in Title LXXVI by a vote of 404-0 on October 6, \n     2015.\n     Title LXXVII--Preservation Enhancement and Savings \n         Opportunity\n       Title LXXVII amends the Low Income Housing Preservation and \n     Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (LIHPRHA) to permit \n     property owners (including nonprofits) of multifamily \n     developments subsidized by the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development (HUD) to access income derived from such \n     developments provided that the owners\n\n[[Page H8821]]\n\n     adhere to HUD's affordability and compliance standards. This \n     title also provides for certain reforms under LIHPRHA \n     relating to obtaining or refinancing a loan secured by a low-\n     income housing project. The House passed legislation \n     identical to the provisions contained in Title LXXVII by \n     voice vote on July 14, 2015\n     Title LXXVIII--Tenant Income Verification Relief\n       Title LXXVIII permits HUD to allow public and assisted \n     housing administrators to verify income once every three \n     years--instead of annually--for low-income tenants that have \n     fixed incomes, such as incomes derived from social security \n     payments. The House passed legislation identical to the \n     provisions contained in Title LXXVIII by voice vote on March \n     24, 2015.\n     Title LXXVIX--Housing Assistance Efficiency\n       Title LXXVIX amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance \n     Act to allow a private nonprofit organization to administer \n     permanent housing rental assistance provided through the \n     Continuum of Care Program under the Act. This title also \n     requires that the HUD Secretary reallocate, at least once \n     during each fiscal year, any housing assistance provided from \n     the Emergency Solutions Grants Program that is unused or \n     returned, or that becomes available after the minimum \n     allocation requirements under the Act. The House passed \n     legislation identical to the provisions contained in Title \n     LXXVIX by voice vote on July 14, 2015.\n     Title LXXX--Child Support Assistance\n       Title LXXX amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to \n     eliminate the requirement that state and local child support \n     agencies and courts notify an obligor ten days before \n     retrieving a consumer report for purposes of determining the \n     appropriate level of child support payments, or enforcing a \n     child support order, award, agreement, or judgment. The House \n     passed legislation identical to the provisions contained in \n     Title LXXX by voice vote on October 6, 2015.\n     Title LXXXI--Private Investment in Housing\n       Title LXXXI authorizes the HUD Secretary to establish a \n     demonstration program under which the Secretary may enter \n     into budget-neutral, performance-based agreements (for up to \n     12 years each) that result in a reduction in energy or water \n     costs with appropriate entities. Specifically, such \n     agreements shall facilitate energy or water conservation \n     improvements at up to 20,000 residential units in multifamily \n     buildings participating in Section 8 rental assistance \n     programs, supportive housing for the elderly, or supportive \n     housing for people with disabilities. This title mirrors a \n     request by the Administration in its 2015 Budget proposal. \n     The House passed legislation identical to the provisions \n     contained in Title LXXXI by voice vote on July 14, 2015.\n     Title LXXXII--Capital Access for Small Community Financial \n         Institutions\n       Title LXXXII amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to allow \n     privately insured credit unions to be eligible for membership \n     in the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System. In order to be \n     eligible for membership, a privately insured credit union \n     must receive a certification from its state supervisor \n     stating that it is eligible to apply for Federal deposit \n     insurance. Additionally, the private insurer of the credit \n     union must provide a copy of the credit union's annual audit \n     report to the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) and \n     the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Further, a state \n     supervisor must provide to the NCUA, upon request, the \n     results of any examination and reports concerning a private \n     insurer of credit unions licensed in that state. The House \n     passed legislation identical to the provisions contained in \n     Title LXXXII by voice vote on April 13, 2015.\n     Title LXXXIII--Small Bank Exam Cycle Reform\n       Title LXXXIII amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to \n     increase the qualifying asset threshold for insured \n     depository institutions eligible for 18-month on-site \n     examination cycles from $500 million to $1 billion. The House \n     passed legislation identical to the provisions contained in \n     Title LXXXIII by a vote of 411-0 on October 6, 2015.\n     Title LXXXIV--Small Company Simple Registration\n       Title LXXXIV simplifies the registration process by \n     amending the SEC's Form S-1 registration statement, which is \n     the basic registration form for new securities offerings, to \n     allow smaller reporting companies to incorporate by reference \n     any documents filed with the SEC after the effective date of \n     the Form S-1. The House passed legislation identical to the \n     provisions contained in Title LXXXIV by a vote of 426-0 on \n     July 14, 2015.\n     Title LXXXV--Holding Company Registration Threshold \n         Equalization\n       Title LXXXV amends Title VI of the JOBS Act to raise the \n     threshold for mandatory SEC registration of savings and loan \n     companies from 500 shareholders of record to 2,000 \n     shareholders of record (with no limitation on the number of \n     non-accredited investors) and to raise the threshold for a \n     savings and loan company to terminate its registration from \n     300 to 1,200 shareholders of record. The House passed \n     legislation identical to the provisions contained in Title \n     LXXXV by voice vote on July 14, 2015.\n\n\n                            Senate Amendment\n\n       The Senate amendment to H.R. 22 contains no provisions \n     comparable to the House position.\n\n\n                         Conference Substitute\n\n       The Senate recedes from its position and concurs in the \n     House position with certain modifications. Specifically, the \n     conference substitute consists of the above-described fifteen \n     titles, as adopted by the House without further modification, \n     and five additional titles providing for regulatory relief \n     and related financial services reforms. These five titles are \n     the following:\n     Title LXXXVI--Repeal of Indemnification Requirements\n       Title LXXXVI amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and \n     the Commodity Exchange Act to repeal the indemnification \n     requirements added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act for regulatory authorities to obtain \n     access to swap data. Foreign regulators and regulatory \n     entities have indicated concerns regarding the \n     indemnification requirements of Dodd-Frank. The title removes \n     such requirements so data can be shared with foreign \n     authorities. The title would still require the regulatory \n     agencies requesting the information to agree to certain \n     confidentiality requirements prior to receiving the data. The \n     House passed legislation identical to the provisions \n     contained in Title LXXXVI by voice vote on July 14, 2015.\n     Title LXXXVII--Treatment of Debt or Equity Instruments of \n         Smaller Institutions\n       Title LXXXVII amends the Financial Stability Act of 2010 to \n     adjust the date on which consolidated assets are determined \n     for purposes of exempting certain instruments of smaller \n     institutions from capital deductions. The purpose of this \n     title is to provide regulatory relief from the requirements \n     of Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act to certain bank holding companies \n     with less than $15 billion in assets. The title permits bank \n     holding companies to continue counting hybrid capital \n     instruments issued before May 19, 2010, as Tier 1 capital so \n     long as the company held less than $15 billion in assets as \n     of either December 31, 2009 or March 31, 2010.\n     Title LXXXIII--State Licensing Efficiency\n       Title LXXXIII amends the Secure and Fair Mortgage Licensing \n     Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) by directing the Attorney General to \n     provide appropriate state officials responsible for \n     regulating financial service providers with access to \n     criminal history information to the extent that criminal \n     history background checks are required under state law for \n     the licensing of such parties. In 2006, the states, under the \n     auspices of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), \n     developed the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and \n     Registry (NMLS). According to CSBS, the NMLS platform was \n     designed to provide ``improved coordination and information \n     sharing among regulators, increased efficiencies for \n     industry, and enhanced consumer protection.'' Congress \n     codified the NMLS in 2008 through the SAFE Act. Title LXXXIII \n     is intended to authorize the NMLS to process criminal \n     background checks for non-depository licensees beyond \n     mortgage loan originators. The House passed legislation \n     identical to the provisions contained in Title LXXXIII by \n     voice vote on October 28, 2015.\n     Title LXXXIX--Helping Expand Lending Practices in Rural \n         Communities\n       Title LXXXIX amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act to require the Bureau of Consumer \n     Financial Protection (Bureau) to create a petition process \n     for interested parties to apply for an area not designated by \n     the Bureau as rural for purposes of federal consumer \n     financial law to be so designated. Under this title, the \n     Bureau is required to publish applications in the Federal \n     Register within 60 days and make them available for public \n     comment for no fewer than 90 days. When evaluating the \n     application, the Bureau would be required to take into \n     consideration:\n       Criteria used by the U.S. Census Bureau when classifying \n     geographical areas as rural or urban;\n       Criteria used by the Office of Management and Budget when \n     designating counties as metropolitan or micropolitan or \n     neither;\n       Criteria used by the Department of Agriculture when \n     determining property eligibility for rural development \n     programs;\n       The Department of Agriculture rural-urban commuting area \n     codes;\n       A written opinion of the State banking regulator; and\n       Population density.\n       Title LXXXIX further requires the Bureau to grant or deny \n     any application within 90 days following the expiration of \n     the comment period. The grant or denial must be published in \n     the Federal Register, along with an explanation of what \n     factors the Bureau relied upon in making the decision.\n       Title LXXXIX contains a rule of construction providing that \n     the Bureau is not required to consider, in connection with \n     the above-described evaluation, any previous designation of \n     the area as non-rural by certain other Federal agencies. \n     Title LXXXXIX also includes a sunset provision providing that \n     the designation review process established under such title \n     shall cease to have force or effect after the end of the two-\n     year period beginning on the date of the title's enactment. \n     In addition, Title LXXXIX amends the Truth in Lending Act to \n     provide the Bureau with authority to treat a balloon loan as \n     a ``qualified mortgage'' if such loan was extended by any \n     creditor operating in rural or underserved areas, even if the \n     creditor\n\n[[Page H8822]]\n\n     does not operate predominantly in such areas. Finally, Title \n     LXXXIX provides expanded authority for the Bureau to exempt \n     creditors serving rural or underserved areas from \n     requirements applicable to escrow and impound accounts \n     relating to certain consumer credit transactions.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 539, I call \nup the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 23) providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of a rule \nsubmitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to \n``Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, \nModified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility \nGenerating Units'', and ask for its immediate consideration in the \nHouse.\n  The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 539, the joint \nresolution is considered read.\n  The text of the joint resolution is as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 23\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     disapproves the rule submitted by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency relating to ``Standards of Performance for \n     Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and \n     Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating \n     Units'' (published at 80 Fed. Reg. 64510 (October 23, 2015)), \n     and such rule shall have no force or effect.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The joint resolution shall be debatable for \n1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on S.J. Res. 23.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today, we will debate resolutions of disapproval under the \nCongressional Review Act for the two EPA rules regulating greenhouse \ngas emissions from new and existing electric generating units.\n  I might say that it is appropriate that we are debating these \nresolutions today. As we know, the President and other leaders are \nmeeting in France as we speak. They are speaking in generalities; they \nare not being detailed in their plans. Yet, in America, we are becoming \naware more each day of exactly the impact the EPA's regulations are \nhaving on the American people.\n  I remind everyone that Congress was not a part of any of this. The \nWhite House did not talk to us about any of this. The clean energy plan \ncomes from the White House and is being implemented by the EPA.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma \n(Mr. Mullin).\n  Mr. MULLIN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage Members to support these \nresolutions.\n  In 1996, Congress passed and the President signed into law an \nimportant tool for ensuring our three branches of government stay true \nto the vision of our Founding Fathers that was set over 200 years ago. \nToday, we are here to use\n\n[[Page H8823]]\n\nthis tool to rein in a President who has forgotten that the legislative \nbranch makes the laws and that the executive branch enforces them.\n  The final rules regarding emissions from new and existing power \nplants are a clear executive overreach. In issuing these rules, the EPA \nhas acted outside the authority it was granted by Congress in the Clean \nAir Act.\n  Electricity generation has always been the responsibility of States, \nbut with these rules the President is threatening communities, \nbusinesses, and families by attempting to put the Federal Government in \ncharge. These rules are unworkable, and they put the reliability of our \nelectric grid at risk.\n  I ask my colleagues to seriously consider the consequences of \nallowing such clear executive overreach to stand, and I urge them to \nsupport this resolution of disapproval.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong opposition to this resolution, and I oppose the \nother resolution that we will also consider this afternoon.\n  Once again, Republicans are attempting to stop any action by this \nadministration to reduce carbon emissions, and, once again, the \nopponents of the EPA's regulations have no constructive alternative to \noffer that would improve the environmental performance of the \nelectricity sector.\n  In fact, this week, the House of Representatives will not only \nconsider these two unnecessary, ill-conceived resolutions, but it will \nalso consider an energy bill that is dedicated to rolling back gains \nthat have been made in energy efficiency, grid modernization, and \nrenewable energy.\n  Mr. Speaker, governments and many of the world's largest private \nsector companies are gathered in Paris this week. They are putting \nforward innovative ideas, and they are making commitments to forge a \ndifferent energy path--one that will prevent us from further \noverheating the Earth and causing major disruptions to people's lives, \ntheir property, and the global economy.\n  We know that climate change is harming us today through droughts, \nfires, floods, and storms, and we know that it will endanger our \nchildren's future if we don't act now.\n  Some of the opposition to these resolutions is based on the assertion \nthat they will not solve the world's carbon emissions problems or \nensure that we will avoid increased warming and catastrophic climate \nchange, but that is not true. Reducing carbon pollution from the power \nsector through the implementation of performance standards for new \npower plants and improving the overall environmental performance of our \ngrid will reduce carbon emissions here in the United States.\n  By making a commitment to this effort and demonstrating that reducing \npollution is consistent with maintaining a reliable, resilient \nelectricity supply, the United States exercises its leadership, giving \nassurance to other nations to follow our example.\n  This resolution and its companion will block the EPA and this \nadministration from taking prudent steps to reduce carbon pollution \nfrom one of the highest emitting sectors, the power sector.\n  That is not all. The Congressional Review Act stipulates that the \npassage of a resolution to block a final rule also bars the Agency from \nissuing any rules that are substantially similar. So these resolutions \nprevent any future administration from developing similar rules to \ncontrol carbon emissions from power plants.\n  The irony is that this sector already is poised to make many of the \nchanges that are contained within these EPA rules. These changes are \nbeing driven by a combination of factors, only one of which is Federal \nregulation. State policies, changes in the relative price of natural \ngas and coal, smart grid technologies, consumer demand, and the further \nexpansion of wind and solar generation all are factors that are \nreshaping the grid and redefining relationships within the electricity \nsector.\n  Instead of trying to hold back these forces, we should be helping \nStates, local governments, consumers, grid operators, utilities, and \ndisplaced workers to make this transition easier.\n  Every significant effort to improve air quality through the Clean Air \nAct regulations has met the same tired, old arguments from the GOP--\nthat it will cost too much, that it will jeopardize the reliability of \nour electricity system, that we don't have the technology to meet these \nnew standards. Every time these dire predictions by my Republican \ncolleagues are put forward, they have failed to materialize.\n  We have already had delayed action on climate change, Mr. Speaker, \nfor too long. The EPA's rules to set greenhouse gas emissions standards \nfor new and reconstructed generating units is an essential first step \ntoward a more sustainable energy future. This rule sends a strong \nsignal to the market in favor of technologies that provide improved \nenvironmental performance.\n  These EPA rules--this one and the one that will be mentioned later \ntoday--should move forward, and this joint resolution should be \ndefeated. I urge a ``no'' vote on the resolution.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We are taking this action today to protect the American people. The \nAmerican people do not expect unelected bureaucrats, acting at the \ndiscretion and the direction of the President of the United States, to \nunilaterally adopt regulations that are questionably illegal.\n  We have 23 States that are filing lawsuits on the new coal plant \nrules, and we have 27 States that have already filed lawsuits on the \nexisting electric generating rules. I might add that, in the last 5 \nyears, this administration has spent a total of $77 billion on climate \nchange.\n  People ask why we have not taken action. This administration has been \nso extreme, so aggressive--and view this as the number one priority \nfacing mankind--that we don't have enough money to act. Also, there are \n61 separate Federal programs under the Obama administration that \naddress climate change.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. \nBrooks).\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, back in October I had the \nopportunity to attend the Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers annual \nconference in Indianapolis. There I heard from stakeholders across the \nenergy supply chain about the serious economic and reliability issues \nemanating from the EPA Clean Power Plan.\n  For instance, John Hughes with the Electricity Consumers Resource \nCouncil presented findings showing that Indiana alone stands to lose \n12,500 jobs because of these rules. This comes on top of the previous \nObama administration regulations that have severely restricted my \nState's economic competitiveness and has dramatically increased \nelectricity bills for Hoosiers.\n  In fact, Indiana's electric rates have gone from the fifth lowest in \nthe Nation in 2003 to the twenty-sixth lowest in 2014. When these rules \ntake effect, electricity rates in my State will continue to climb to \nthe tune of up to 20 percent each year.\n  As a result, Hoosier manufacturers, who drive more than 30 percent of \nour economy, will be forced to shutter assembly lines and lay off \nemployees simply to pay their utility bills.\n  Congress needs to think about the very real consequences of this, \neven if the EPA and the Obama administration are not thinking about \nthis. The EPA Clean Power Plan means lost jobs, lost economic growth, \nand higher utility costs for both individuals and businesses.\n  That is why I strongly support both of the bills before us, which put \nan end to the executive overreach, protect the American ratepayer, and \nallow us to truly pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will \ntransform our economy and lay that strong foundation for our energy \nfuture.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Judy Chu).\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, this week something historic \nis happening. Leaders from 195 countries are meeting in Paris to \ndiscuss a global solution to a global problem: climate change.\n  There is no denying it anymore. Climate change is real. Human \nactivity is contributing to it. Without action, the results will be \ncatastrophic.\n\n[[Page H8824]]\n\n  Yet, while the nations of the world gather in agreement and concern, \nwhat are the House Republicans doing? They are rejecting science and \nreversing what progress we have made.\n  These disapproval resolutions effectively gut EPA's Clean Power Plan \nand carbon pollution standards for power plants. By attacking the EPA, \nRepublicans are opening the smokestacks to release more of the \ndangerous emissions we know contribute to global warming. This is \nreckless.\n  Not only do these resolutions ignore the warnings of the scientific \ncommunity by reversing progress, they also block the EPA from issuing \nany standards in the future that are substantially similar. Republicans \nmust accept that our country is evolving.\n  In fact, many States are already running on an increasing amount of \nrenewable energy, reducing energy waste, and decreasing carbon \npollution. My own State of California has set a goal of 50 percent \nrenewable energy by 2030, and others are developing their own plans to \nmeet pollution reduction targets.\n  Each new goal towards a cleaner environment only encourages the \ninvestments and innovations that will help get us there. That is a \nbenefit to our economy and our world, which is why two-thirds of \nAmericans support a climate change pact.\n  It is time we listen to our constituents, to the vast majority of \nscientists and experts, and to the tens of thousands of world leaders, \nexperts, and advocates who are seeking a path toward a sustainable \nfuture for our children and grandchildren.\n  I oppose these resolutions and these reckless attacks on our \nenvironment.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I might say that no one on our side of the aisle has denied climate \nchange. I think we still live in a country where we all can express our \nviews and we simply disagree with the President on the urgency of the \nissue. The President has even told the world that climate change is a \nmore pressing issue to mankind than terrorism.\n  When we talk to people in the developing world, when we talk to \npeople in Europe and around the globe, representatives come here and \nthey stress to us that they are more concerned about clean water, a \njob, electricity, health, hygiene, issues like that, than they are \nabout climate change.\n  Even in the polls here in America, only about 5 percent of the \nAmerican people view climate change as one of the most pressing issues \nfacing mankind. So that is why we have over 180 separate groups around \nthe country that support these joint resolutions to turn back what \nPresident Obama is doing in an extreme and unprecedented way.\n  I would also just like to read that the Partnership for a Better \nEnergy Future, which is a 181-member coalition, including national as \nwell as State and local organizations in 36 States, writes of EPA's \nrule for new plants, which is precisely what we are discussing today: \nThe EPA set a regulation so strict that the only technology that meets \nthe requirement for a coal-fired power plant, carbon capture and \nsequestration is not commercially available.\n  There is no technology available to meet the stringent emissions \nstandard set by EPA. Yet, China, India, and every other country in the \nworld can build a new coal plant if they decide to do so.\n  We are not mandating that a plant be built, but we are recognizing \nthe increased need for electricity in America and that it must be \naffordable and it must be abundant. For us to compete in the global \nmarketplace, we simply want that option, and that is what this is \nabout.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nCarter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S.J. \nRes. 23, which disapproves of the EPA's carbon standard rules for power \nplants.\n  Our country is blessed with an abundance of energy sources. Reliable, \naffordable, and secured energy is critical to our national security, \nand a diverse energy portfolio adds to our strength.\n  While new technologies have allowed us to tap into sustainable \nsources of energy, we lack the infrastructure to use that energy \nnationwide. Clean coal, natural gas, and nuclear produce the bulk of \nAmerica's energy for a reason. They are affordable, reliable, and the \nmost available.\n  The carbon capture and storage technologies mandated by this rule are \nnot commercially viable. Make no mistake. The EPA is seeking to ban the \nconstruction of any new fossil fuel power plants and severely limit the \nproduction of the others. With its companion rule on greenhouse gases, \nthe EPA will simultaneously force the closure of many existing power \nplants.\n  Until alternative sources of energy are affordable and available from \ncoast to coast, we must ensure that Americans can continue to \naffordably light and heat their homes. Under this rule, we will be \nunable to achieve this.\n  I urge my colleagues to protect families and the economy by \nsupporting this bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just have to say, I listened to my colleague from Kentucky (Mr. \nWhitfield), who I respect a great deal. I think he is suggesting that \nsomehow the Republicans on our committee or maybe the leadership in the \nHouse do want to address climate change.\n  Every time that I have tried in the committee to bring up the issue \nof climate change, nothing has happened. We haven't had a hearing. We \nhaven't had a bill. We haven't had any initiative since I have been on \nthe committee, let alone served as the ranking member, in the last \nyear--any initiative--that would address the issue of climate change.\n  So when my colleague from Kentucky says, ``Well, we are not denying \nthat this exists. We just don't think it is a priority,'' well, it is \nnot only not a priority. It is not something we have addressed at all \nin any way anytime the Democrats or myself have tried to raise this \nissue.\n  To suggest that it shouldn't be a priority--and maybe that is not \nwhat he is saying, but it sounded that way--well, I come from a \ndistrict where we had Hurricane Sandy that devastated our district. We \nhave droughts in California--we were just discussing it with my \nCalifornia colleagues who will be speaking soon--and all kinds of \nweather extremes that are causing all kinds of problems--loss of jobs, \ndestruction around the country that has to be made up for later by FEMA \nand other Federal agencies that come in and spend billions of dollars \nto try to correct these problems. To suggest that this is not a \npriority I think is wrong. To suggest that somehow maybe the \nRepublicans are dealing with it is simply not the case.\n  Again, I know you don't particularly like the President's power plan, \nbut at least he is trying to do something. I don't see the GOP \naddressing this at all.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I am Congressman Ted Lieu \nfrom California. I rise in opposition to the Republican resolution \nopposing the Clean Power Plan.\n  This is just another example of the Republican majority denying the \nurgency and severity of carbon pollution. At a time when the entire \nworld is meeting in Paris to address carbon pollution, you now have the \nRepublican majority doing exactly the opposite.\n  Now, America is an exceptional country, the best in the world. One \nreason we got here is because we believe in science. We believe in \nfacts.\n  So if 9 out of 10 doctors said that your child is showing the \nsymptoms of diabetes, would you ignore that and keep feeding your child \ndoughnuts? No. You would go seek treatment.\n  So listen to 9 out of 10 scientists that are saying carbon pollution \nis real and it is going to kill us as a species if we don't do anything \nabout it.\n  If you don't want to listen to those scientists, listen to some of \nthe most conservative companies and organizations in America. Listen to \nExxonMobil today. They say carbon pollution is real, it is being caused \nby humankind, and they support putting a price on carbon emissions.\n  Listen to the U.S. military. I served in Active Duty, and I am still \nin the Reserves. I am very proud of our military. They take the world \nas it is, not as they think it should be, not as they hope it will be, \nbut as it is. They rely on facts and science.\n  They are telling us carbon pollution is a national security threat \nand it is\n\n[[Page H8825]]\n\ngoing to flood our bases, it is going to cause more extreme weather \nevents, and it is going to make it much worse for humanity if we don't \ndo something about it.\n  At the end of the day, America is going to lead and the history books \nare going to say we led the way in saving humanity and dealing with \ncarbon pollution or there will be no history books.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Duncan).\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I wish President Obama \ntook the threat of radical Islamic jihadists as seriously as he takes \nthe pseudo science behind the manmade climate change threat.\n  Folks, these EPA rules affect jobs and they affect the amount of \nmoney in the pockets of moms and dads all across this great country. \nNow, transportation fuel costs are down for moms and dads, but the \npower to heat and cool their homes, the power to run the engines of the \neconomy--the cost of that power has gone up because of the EPA \nregulations and rule writing that we have seen.\n  What does that mean? Well, wholesale electricity prices in South \nCarolina will spike as high as 13.9 percent. Households will pay as \nmuch as $84.19 more a year. Industrial customers will pay as much as \n$40,200 more a year just in South Carolina. It will cause 11,700 \nmanufacturing jobs to be impacted.\n  Since 2012, 27 coal mining companies with core operations in West \nVirginia have filed for bankruptcy protection. But you know what? The \nTPP trade deal will allow West Virginia coal and Wyoming coal to be \nshipped to China to be burned. Now, where is the hypocrisy in that?\n  Let me tell you this: We rely on 24/7, always on, baseload power to \nrun the engines of our society to heat and cool our homes. We can't do \nthat with intermittent solar and wind. You can do that with nuclear, \nhydro, and fossil-fuel-fired power plants.\n  Think about the morality of 24/7 baseload power. That means the \nincubators in the hospitals are there to provide the incubation for the \npreemie children. That means that you can keep food from spoiling. That \nmeans you can heat your homes with some sort of source that doesn't \ncause pollution inside your home like it does, say, in Latin America or \nAfrica, where they are burning wood or coal.\n  We have the ability through nuclear, hydro, and through fossil-fuel-\nfired power plants to provide that 24/7 baseload power. You can't do it \nwith regulations that continue to kill the industry. You can't do it \nwith intermittent energy sources like wind and solar. These regulations \nand these rules, written because of those regulations, are killing job \ncreation in this country.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). Without objection, the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) will control the time on behalf of \nthe gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps). She serves as a member of the Subcommittee on \nEnvironment and the Economy. She is an outspoken voice for defending \nthe environment and calling for our sound stewardship of the \nenvironment.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in unwavering opposition to these \nresolutions which deny the real effects of climate change and express \nopposition to our Nation's effort to address it.\n  These resolutions are particularly embarrassing because they come at \na time when the rest of the world is coming together in Paris to \nidentify solutions to climate change. There is overwhelming consensus \naround the globe that climate change is one of the most critical issues \nfacing our world, not just for the environment, but for human health \nand for our local economies.\n  Our climate is changing. Our actions are emitting the greenhouse \ngasses that are contributing to this problem. Climate change is \nthreatening public health, people's livelihoods, and the very \nenvironment that we live in.\n  While we should be determining a course forward to protect our \nconstituents and safeguard our planet for generations to come, we are \ninstead sending a signal to the rest of the world of willful negligence \nand disregard. Instead of arguing about whether the climate is \nchanging, which it is, or if we are responsible, which we are, it is \nhigh time that we work together to determine solutions.\n  The new source carbon pollution standards and the Clean Power Plan \nwill not solve all of the problems associated with greenhouse gasses, \nbut it is a necessary step in the right direction. In addition to \nenacting meaningful change to curb emissions from the power sector, \nwhich is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in this \ncountry, these regulations also send a signal to people across America \nand across the world that we are working to address this broader issue.\n  Curbing carbon emissions from new and existing power plants in the \ncountry signifies that we are serious about working toward a cleaner, \nhealthier future.\n  In addition to providing for a healthier environment for current and \nfuture generations, these regulations are important for both our public \nhealth and our business community alike. EPA's carbon regulations will \nlead to billions of dollars of public health benefits, potentially \naverting thousands of premature deaths and tens of thousands of asthma \nattacks in children.\n  The private sector has also stressed the need to take action because \nthey understand the long-term costs and benefits. Businesses understand \nthe economic consequences of inaction, that they are severe, and that \nwe need to prepare for climate change today. They know the regulations \nare projected to create over 300,000 new clean energy jobs.\n  On the central coast of California, my congressional district, we \nhave seen firsthand how important the jobs associated with the clean \nenergy technologies are. Renewable energy projects in my district have \ncreated hundreds of new jobs, and provide enough energy for over \n100,000 homes.\n  Instead, here we are today, debating and voting on resolutions of \ndisapproval that deny these facts and show again the willingness of the \nmajority to bury its head in the sand when faced with the need for \naction on climate change.\n  Just a few months ago, we all sat in this Chamber together as the \nPope spoke of our world's most pressing challenges. In that speech, he \nreminded us that it is our moral obligation to respond to climate \nchange. I couldn't agree more. We must band together to enact \nmeaningful and lasting change for our people and our planet. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose these resolutions.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  One of the great things about having a debate in this body is that we \nall get to express our different views, and the world benefits when \ndifferent views can be expressed.\n  One of the reasons that we brought these resolutions to the House \nfloor today is because of the climate change conference in France going \non today. We want the world to know that there is disagreement with the \nPresident on this issue, not about the fact that the climate is \nchanging, but about the priority that is being placed on it.\n  Why should this President penalize America and put us in jeopardy \ncompared to other countries of the world and require us to do more than \nother countries of the world are doing just so that he can go to France \nand claim to be the world leader on climate change?\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, energy-related \nCO2 emissions in America will remain below 2005 levels \nthrough 2040. Our CO2 emissions today are roughly the same \nas they were 20 years ago. America does not have to take a backseat to \nanyone on addressing climate change. That is the point that we want the \nworld to understand. We are doing a lot. We would like to help other \ncountries do more, but why should we be penalized?\n  At this time, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, you have heard the facts from the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky just now. What we are dealing with here on the other side \nis an ideology.\n\n[[Page H8826]]\n\n  Today I rise in support of the two resolutions that work to keep \nelectricity affordable and reliable for Americans. S.J. Res. 23 and \nS.J. Res. 24 are a response to harmful regulations established by the \nEPA under the President's Clean Power Plan. The EPA's regulations \nimplement the first-ever caps on carbon emissions, which will result in \nhigher energy costs for American families, businesses, and consumers. \nSome experts have said that the Clean Power Plan could be the most \nexpensive regulation ever imposed on Americans.\n  Congress must protect Americans from legacy-driven agendas that \ntrample the rights of our citizens, hurt our economy, and hinder job \ngrowth. These two resolutions work to provide protection for existing \nand future American power plants and safeguard Americans from higher \nenergy costs.\n  The Senate has already passed this legislation. As the people's \nHouse, it is imperative that we vote to protect Americans from these \ndestructive regulations.\n  I will continue to fight against the EPA's power grab. That is why I \nstrongly support these two pieces of legislation.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for our colleague from Kentucky. \nHowever, when he talks about being in disagreement with the President \nof the United States, I should point out also that he is in \ndisagreement with 97 percent of the scientist community that professes \nthat we need to do something tremendously strong in response to climate \nchange.\n  In regard to our role in this whole arena, putting ourselves at a \ncompetitive disadvantage, one of the responsibilities that befalls the \nleading nation like the United States is that, in fact, we must be that \ninspiration that inspires the international community. We have been \nable to bring some 150 countries to the fold to speak to their efforts \nof climate change, and we have inspired efforts from major nations like \nthat of China, Brazil, and Mexico so as to begin that process.\n  When I met in my office with representatives from the EU--I think \nthere were 13 nations represented--they all wanted to know where the \ngiant was on this issue. The world is looking to the United States for \nits leadership, and that is a role that we should not take lightly, and \nit is one that we should move forward with in bold fashion.\n  With that being said, I now yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McNerney), who has been an outstanding voice on the \nSubcommittee on Environment and the Economy.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose S.J. Res. 23 and S.J. \nRes. 24.\n  Frankly, this effort to deny climate change reminds me of the 50-plus \nvotes we have taken to try to eliminate the Affordable Care Act.\n  As a global leader, we must reduce carbon emissions. To simply ignore \nour responsibility is misguided and will harm generations to come. We \ncan't solve climate change by ourselves, but we must lead and be part \nof a larger effort.\n  I know that fossil fuels--and in particular, liquid fuels--will be \nneeded in the years ahead, but we can still move toward a more \nefficient and sustainable energy system.\n  For example, I have actually had coal plants in my region shut down, \nshift to biomass, and become very successful while also benefiting the \nclimate. I would also note that California is again leading the world \nin efforts to promote cleaner energy with a 50 percent renewable energy \ngoal by 2050.\n  I represent part of the Central Valley, which has some of the worst \nair quality in the Nation. While this comes from a variety of sources, \nit impacts everyone. In an area that is already hurt economically, \ndirty air affects school- and workdays and disproportionately hurts \nchildren and other adults. This makes me more determined than ever to \ndevelop green energy.\n  This vote will again show that most or all House Republicans deny the \nobvious: climate change is taking place as a result of human activity. \nI expect that many of my Republican colleagues know and believe that \nclimate change is real and is a long-term threat, and yet we are voting \non these two resolutions today.\n  Lastly, one argument we hear is that the Clean Power Plan is \nadministrative overreach and that it was never authorized by Congress. \nBut this is exactly what the Clean Air Act does. The Supreme Court has \nruled that carbon emissions can be regulated by the Clean Air Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our future, reject efforts that \nincrease pollution, and oppose this measure.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining \non both sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 16\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from New York has 14\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe).\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his leadership \non this important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, every day Washington hits the American people with more \nregulations that hurt families, but very few will hurt these families \nmore than President Obama's so-called Clean Power Plan because, \naccording to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, the average \nelectricity cost for a Texas household each year is $1,800, which is \nalready 26 percent higher than the national average. To put this in \nperspective, almost half of all Texans spend more than 15 percent of \ntheir annual household budget on energy costs alone.\n  To stand up for middle-income families, we have an obligation to \nfight for policies that will keep energy costs down. Unfortunately, the \nadministration's new regulations do exactly the opposite, which is why \nI introduced resolutions to combat these regulations immediately after \nthey were announced and garnered the support of cosponsors from 15 \ndifferent States. Americans across every corner of this country are \nimpacted by this administration's overregulatory zeal, and we have got \nto do everything we can to stop it.\n  The facts are clear. These regulations will shut down vital power \nplants across the country, costing thousands of hardworking Americans \ntheir jobs, and in the process driving up electricity costs for every \nAmerican. To that point, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas \nanticipates that these regulations will increase retail power prices in \nTexas by up to 16 percent; and when family budgets are already \nstretched so thin, they simply can't afford this increase. In \ndeveloping these regulations, the Obama administration once again has \nignored everyday Americans and instead doubled down on its extreme \nideological agenda.\n  Making matters worse, the EPA itself admits that these regulations \ncome at a cost of anywhere between $5.1 billion and $8.4 billion in \nyear 2030 alone.\n  What are the benefits of these regulations, you may ask? In exchange \nfor crushing American families, losing American jobs at a cost of \nbillions and billions of dollars, what profound effect will these \nregulations have on our environment?\n  Well, the scientific experts estimate that these regulations would \nonly reduce the global temperature by one one-hundredth of a degree \nFahrenheit and reduce sea levels by a mere two-tenths of 1 millimeter. \nMr. Speaker, we simply can't let the Obama administration force \nAmericans to sacrifice so much when even the most optimistic of \ncalculations predict that the return would be negligible at best.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both pieces of legislation which are \nso critical to stopping these regulations dead in their tracks.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is much talk of the impact the President has on \nthis issue and that it is a one-person force driving this country in a \ngiven direction, but a memo has been brought to my attention from \nCassandra Carmichael, Executive Director of the National Religious \nPartnership for the Environment, and the faith-based community, which \nincorporates several faiths, who have written very strongly about their \nbelief that we need to move forward with climate change action.\n\n[[Page H8827]]\n\nThey are disappointed in the lack of foresight and leadership reflected \nin these two resolutions. They make it abundantly clear that their \ncommunities are on the front lines of issues like health care, disaster \nrelief, refugee resettlement, and development work. These are all \nissues that are somewhat connected in the external measurements of the \nfight on climate change.\n  They also talk about their beliefs that the Clean Power Plan is a \nsolution that they have been advocating for over the course of many \nyears, and that they believe that we can do this by assignment to the \nindividual States, not imposing heavy economic pressure on some of our \npoorest neighborhoods, and that there is a way to be sound stewards of \nthe environment and at the same time grow our economy.\n  I believe that it is a very powerful statement that should motivate \nall of us to think twice about our actions here, that we should move \nforward in a progressive fashion. They indicate God's creation is \nsacred and that we are called on to be responsible stewards of the \ngifts of creation while protecting our vulnerable neighbors. It doesn't \nget stronger than that.\n  So with that, I just think it needs to be brought into the discussion \nthat it is not a one-person operation, a one-person show that is \ndrawing us down this certain route of response to climate change but, \nrather, a large universe of support there that speaks to the wisdom of \nsound stewardship.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nJohnson), who is a passionate voice on behalf of the environment and \neconomic recovery.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose S.J. Res. 23 and 24, which \nconstitute the latest salvo by my friends on the other side of the \naisle attacking our Nation's commitment to cut carbon pollution and \nslow climate change.\n  Now, I do realize that some of us really don't care whether or not \nmankind's actions contribute to climate change. Some of us really don't \ncare.\n  Some of us don't care to consider that 95 percent of scientists \nrecognize that it is man's activities that are contributing to the \nastronomical rate of climate change that is occurring that has the \npotential to render our planet uninhabitable by human beings. You can \nlaugh, you can smile, you can joke, but 95 percent of the scientists \nagree that if we continue along the same path that we are continuing \nalong, it is the demise of humankind itself that is the end result.\n  Now, some say you can adapt. Well, what we should be adapting to is \nthe reality of the fact that we can change this. We can make things \nbetter for our children. That is why 195 progressive-thinking leaders \nof 195 countries represented in Paris today--right now, as we speak--\nare working on this very profound issue that affects humankind.\n  And what are we here in Congress doing? We are trying to scuttle the \nplans that have been made by this country to try to reduce carbon \npollution. We are trying to scuttle it. We are using the argument that \nit is too costly to the big businesses that are already making \nbillions.\n  Don't you know that, regardless of the cost to the big businesses, \nthey are going to transfer those costs on down to you and me? Well, I \nthink the health of our babies, the health of our elderly, and our own \nhealth is something that most Americans are willing to pay for.\n  We have got to have leadership in this Congress. We can't allow \nourselves to put our heads in the sand and let climate change just rape \nand pillage the world. 195 world leaders say that we can't do that. \nThat is what they are working on now, today, and we should be \nsupporting that effort.\n  Unfortunately, we are going in the wrong direction here in this \nparticular body by trying to kill it. I don't know whether or not that \nis because President Obama represents this country. He has been the \nmost mistreated President during my lifetime, certainly. I don't know \nwhether or not it is the hatred for him that causes people to deny \nscience. But whatever it is, let's get off of it. Let's do the right \nthing, and let's oppose these two resolutions.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I might say that this is really not a debate about \nscience today. I have said repeatedly and most people have said, yes, \nwe agree the climate is changing, but this is a debate about the \nsolution and about the policies being advanced by this administration. \nThat is why for both rules you have a total of 50 States and a \nmultitude of other entities that have filed lawsuits--because we \nbelieve it is illegal. In fact, on the existing rule, which we will \ndiscuss in the next hour, EPA changed 30 years of its legal opinions, \nsaying that they could not regulate under 111(d) the way they intend to \ndo it now.\n  So I have the greatest respect for every Member of this body, and \ncertainly those on the Energy and Power Subcommittee and the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, but I think it is important that we be able to have \nthe debate. And that is what we are doing: showing how we disagree with \nthe President's policies and his solutions.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nHurd), who has been involved on this issue.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the two \ndisapproval resolutions that the House will consider today.\n  Mr. Speaker, many of our bellies are still full from Thanksgiving and \nnow we are thinking about what we are going to buy our loved ones and \nfamily for Christmas. Let me tell you what families in Texas do not \nwant for Christmas, and that is higher energy bills. But that is what \nwe are going to get if EPA's proposed rules for new and existing power \nplants go into effect.\n  Many families in Texas are already living paycheck to paycheck. They \nare looking for ways to put a little extra aside so they can have a \nnice Christmas. But the EPA's rule for power plants will do more than \njust raise their electricity rates. Higher rates increase the cost of \nmany other products and services that families need to buy.\n  During this weak economic recovery, families struggling to pay bills \nor still looking for good-paying jobs simply can't afford for their \ncost of living to go up. Folks in my district have had enough of this \nkind of executive overreach by the White House. They have had enough of \nthe excessive red tape that just seems to keep on coming from Federal \nbureaucracies like the EPA. They know it destroys jobs and economic \ngrowth; and in this case, it also puts our national security at risk. \nThis new red tape by the EPA will hamper American energy security, and \nAmerican energy security is a critical component of American national \nsecurity.\n\n  The EPA's plan is an unnecessary attempt to eliminate reliable and \naffordable energy. Let's help make sure our families, our veterans, and \nour senior citizens don't face higher energy bills. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support S.J. Res. 23 and 24.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the policies, I believe that the many, \nmany hearings on the many issues, in a way, provide for a doable, \nworkable plan. But opposition to a policy or just saying ``no'' isn't \npublic policy. It isn't a strong response. It isn't a substantive \nresponse. To just disagree with what is being offered here without \nhaving viable solutions, without addressing carbon emissions, without \nspeaking to the nuances of greening up our power supplies and growing \nenergy independence, we are failing to respond in an effective manner.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts \n(Ms. Tsongas), a very strong voice and progressive voice for the \nenvironment, who is strong in her beliefs about climate change.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the misguided resolutions \nbefore the House that seek to block the Clean Power Plan and undermine \nUnited States global leadership on climate change.\n  Climate change is no longer an academic question for scientists to \nponder. It is a very real crisis that, if left untouched, will cause \nirreparable harm to current and future generations.\n  Should the resolutions we are considering today become law, our \ncountry would be prevented from taking necessary steps to safeguard our \nfuture.\n  The Clean Power Plan calls for a 32 percent reduction in carbon \ndioxide\n\n[[Page H8828]]\n\nemissions below 2005 levels by 2030 and sets individual goals for each \nState in order to meet this national standard. It is a reasonable, \ncommonsense approach that gives States the flexibility to reduce carbon \npollution with strategies that work best in their State while \nbolstering clean energy investments and economic development.\n  Efforts to block the Clean Power Plan not only ignore overwhelming \nscientific consensus--we only have to turn on the radio today to hear \nit time after time, moment after moment--but they ignore the global \nconsensus that we must take action to address climate change.\n  Right now, leaders from over 190 countries are gathered in Paris to \noutline long-term strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \nstave off the worst impacts of climate change. While at the summit, \nPresident Obama personally met with other heads of state, including the \nleaders of China and India, to reaffirm their commitment to reducing \ncarbon emissions.\n  America must be at the forefront and lead by example. We must embrace \nmodern policies that cut emissions, increase the use of renewable \nenergy, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and encourage the \ndevelopment of innovative green technologies. If we are successful, the \neconomic, security, and environmental benefits to our Nation will be \nwidespread, long-lasting, and significant.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject these harmful resolutions. The cost of \ninaction on the critical generational challenge is simply unacceptable \nand the price of delay too high.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it raises the question once again. As I said, we have \nbeen very successful in America under the Clean Air Act. Our \nCO2 emissions are as low as they were 20 years ago, and they \nare projected to be below 2005 levels through 2040. We are making great \nprogress.\n  So why is the President committing America to being a country that \ncannot build a new coal-powered plant? We are not saying you should \nbuild one, but the President said he is for an all-of-the-above energy \npolicy; yet he is prohibiting, through regulation, the building of a \nnew coal-powered plant because the technology is not available to meet \nthe emissions standards.\n  You don't think the Chinese would agree to not build a coal plant, do \nyou? They are providing money for Pakistan to build coal plants. They \nare providing money for India to build coal plants. And even in Europe, \nwith the natural gas prices from Russia so high, they are building new \ncoal plants as they close down some gas plants.\n  So that is the kind of policy that we are discussing here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from \nNorth Dakota (Mr. Cramer), who has been focused on this issue for his \nentire congressional career.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding the time \nand for his leadership.\n  I might add that, prior to being in Congress, I was focused on the \nissue for nearly 10 years as a regulator of the energy industry in \nNorth Dakota. I served nearly 10 years on the North Dakota Public \nService Commission, where I regulated not only the siting of coal \nplants, the reclamation of coal mines, but the cost of electricity to \nconsumers.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  I have to address some of the comments made by the gentleman from \nGeorgia. I am sure they were sincere. I am sure they were well-\nintentioned.\n  But to stand here, Mr. Speaker, and lecture us that we are somehow \nmotivated by hatred for the President of the United States is so \nbeneath the dignity of this Chamber, and I am embarrassed for him.\n  Let me tell you that Barack Obama has the right to his opinion, and \nhe is entitled to have it be different than mine. He perfectly has the \nright to be wrong even, if he wants to be.\n  But he doesn't have the right to break the law because he couldn't \nget a law changed when he had a Democratic House and a Democratic \nSenate. And that is what we are here to talk about, the violation of \nthe law, as the chairman has pointed to earlier.\n  I don't even want to deal with the merits of climate change or global \nwarming. I want to deal with the solution.\n  We have heard today that Republicans don't have a solution. Well, let \nme tell you about my little rectangular spot in the middle of the North \nAmerican continent, North Dakota, best known now, of course, for \nproducing a whole bunch of oil.\n  But long before we produced oil, we produced coal, 30 million tons a \nyear, as a matter of fact. Seventy-nine percent of our electricity is \ngenerated by coal. We generate coal-generated electricity for many \nStates in our region.\n  But we also are one of the seven States that meet all ambient air \nquality standards as prescribed by the EPA. We have a grade A, perfect, \nyear after year after year for our air by the American Lung \nAssociation. The counties that have the greatest concentration of coal-\nfired power plants get an A grade.\n  Our utilities have been investing hundreds of millions of dollars \nover the years in clean coal technologies and scrubbers and everything \nthat we can do to make our environment cleaner.\n  We live there. We love it. No bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., is \ngoing to love the air that we breathe in North Dakota more than those \nof us who live in North Dakota.\n  We also enjoy, like other coal-producing States, some of the lowest-\npriced electricity in the country.\n  I also would like to point out that, long before it was cool, we were \nsiting wind farms. I sited over 1,000 megawatts of wind farms when I \nwas on the Commission. Now there are nearly 2,000 megawatts of \ninstalled wind in North Dakota.\n  We don't even have a mandate. We don't need to be lectured to by \npeople who don't know a thing about where we live, a thing about our \neconomy. We will do the right thing because it is the right thing. We \nwill do the right thing because it is good for our families.\n  And, by the way, the rule that we are disapproving, the two rules we \nare disapproving, disproportionately hurt the poor and the middle \nincome. Do you think it is the poor people that can afford to buy an \nEnergy Star refrigerator at the end of the month? Is it the poor people \nthat can afford to wrap their house in new insulation? Of course not.\n  We need to pass these resolutions and reject these rules.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  The whole effort to make certain that we move forward with carbon \nemission reduction and the claims that we have dropped since 2005 \nlevels--well, there was a drop in 2008 and 2009 because of the \nrecession, a wind-down of activity, of less use of electricity. But \nthen, again, we had climbed in 2012 and 2013, the last measurements on \nrecord.\n  So we need to be real about this effort. We know that if we do \nnothing we will see drops by 2040 of only 9 percent, when efforts here \nto make certain that we can reduce that carbon emission by 80 percent \nby 2050 are a strong contrast, and the goals here are laudable and \nnoble.\n  I would also make mention that we have it within our power to provide \nfor issues that, with technology, enable us to respond to these goals. \nWe need to do that. I think we need to set the standards in a way that \npronounce our stewardship as very noble for the environment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I again encourage us to reject these resolutions. I \nthink they set us back. It would nullify opportunities to policy \nstandards that would require stronger response.\n  We would allow for build-out that provides for additional \nconstruction, additional pollution that would accompany that \nopportunity that would be dangerous to our environment.\n  It would nullify our efforts to address carbon pollution, so that \nthis is a dangerous thing, and I think it is why the President has \nindicated that, should they come to his desk, he would veto these \nmeasures, and why we are having this debate today while we should be \nchampioning the cause in a bipartisan, bicameral way to show the world \nthat we care significantly about carbon emission reduction and that we \nwant to stand as a world leader. That is where we should place \nourselves and posit ourselves in that noble dimension.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H8829]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Tonko, who does a great job on our \ncommittee, and I certainly respect his views.\n  I wanted to just touch previously on and reiterate why we are here \ntoday. The Senate has already passed both of these resolutions by a \nvote of 52-46 of disapproval of the President's clean energy plan and \nhis regulation relating to new coal-fired plants.\n  We wanted this on the floor today because we want to send a message \nto the climate change conference in Paris that in America there is \nserious disagreement with the extreme policies of this President.\n  I would like to just point out briefly one of the reasons why we are \nso upset with this particular resolution about the emission standards \nfor new coal-fired plants if one is going to be built.\n  EPA went to great detail of setting an emission standard, and they \nbased that standard on four plants. And guess what? None of the three \nplants in America are even in operation.\n  In fact, the one in Texas, it looks like it is not going to be built \nat all. The one in California, DOE has suspended funding for it. The \none in Mississippi has already experienced a $4.2 billion cost overrun. \nAnd it is close to an oil field for enhanced oil recovery to make it \nwork, but it is not in operation.\n  The only plant that is operating, on which EPA set this emission \nstandard, is a very small project in Canada that would not have been \nbuilt without the Canadian Government funding. And it looks like it \nwill never achieve a technical readiness level that would show it is \navailable for commercial demonstration.\n  So here you have EPA taking this drastic step based on emissions of \nplants that really are not even in operation.\n  Why should America be the only country where you cannot build a new \ncoal plant because EPA has set an emission standard that commercially \nand technically is not feasible?\n  That is what we are talking about here, just the policy, just the \ndisagreement on the solution. I would urge our Members to support this \nresolution, and let's send a message to the White House and to those \nconferees in Paris.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, this week, world leaders are meeting in \nParis to address the serious threat of climate change. Across the globe \nand here at home, there is broad recognition of the need to act \ndecisively to curb the climate crisis that threatens our communities. \nAnd yet today we are considering legislation that would allow continued \ncarbon pollution, jeopardizing public health and the environment.\n  The President's Clean Power Plan limits carbon pollution from new and \nexisting power plants for the first time ever. It is a flexible, \nmeaningful plan that will help states transition to clean energy \nsources and greater efficiency. It was developed with extensive \nstakeholder outreach. And it will create jobs, reduce the toxic \npollution that is a leading contributor to climate change, and protect \npublic health.\n  The resolutions on the Floor today would stop this common sense plan \nand prohibit any similar measure. And Congressional Republicans are not \noffering any plan to replace it. They continue to deny the problem of \nclimate change, even in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence \nand the damaging storms, increased flooding, and drought that are \nalready impacting our communities. They are ignoring the warnings from \nour Department of Defense, who call climate change a threat multiplier \nthroughout the world.\n  We have the opportunity to lead, to expand opportunities in 21st \ncentury energy, and to protect our environment for future generations. \nThe world is watching. We must reject these shameful, regressive \nresolutions and act to prevent climate change.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the joint \nresolution.\n  The question is on the third reading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the joint resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8829-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8829-H8837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE \n                    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 539, I call \nup the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 24) providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of a rule \nsubmitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ``Carbon \nPollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric \nUtility Generating Units'' and ask for its immediate consideration in \nthe House.\n  The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 539, the joint \nresolution is considered read.\n  The text of the joint resolution is as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 24\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     disapproves the rule submitted by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency relating to ``Carbon Pollution Emission \n     Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility \n     Generating Units'' (published at 80 Fed. Reg. 64662 (October \n     23, 2015)), and such rule shall have no force or effect.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The joint resolution shall be debatable for \n1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority \nmember of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Tonko) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on S.J. Res. 24.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, even more sweeping than EPA's new source performance \nstandard for power plant greenhouse gas emissions is the rule governing \nexisting sources. And that is what S.J. Res. 24 is about, and the \nimpact that this rule is going to have on every existing coal plant in \nAmerica and the impact that it could have on the electricity rates and \nthe impediments that it could establish for future economic growth in \nAmerica.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nOlson), who is vice chair of the Energy and Power Subcommittee.\n  Mr. OLSON. I thank the chair and my good friend from Kentucky for the \ntime to speak on this important resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, today is a sad day for America when our administration \nharms our country without a valid reason, and yet that is exactly what \nPresident Obama's EPA has done with their clean power rules.\n  Without input from Congress and with only small, limited public \nmeetings, EPA rammed through new rules to limit CO2. These \nrules destroy new coal power in America.\n  In my home State of Texas, our grid is regulated by ERCOT, 90 \npercent. They say they lose 4,000 megawatts of power, at a minimum, \nwith the early retirements of coal plants because of the Clean Power \nPlan. Energy costs for customers may be up by 60 percent by 2030 due to \nthe CPP.\n  EPA's actions violate the words and the intent of the Clean Air Act, \nand that is why a majority of States have sued in Federal court to stop \nits implementation.\n  EPA's actions have Texans scratching their heads and saying, ``What \nthe heck?'' Why is EPA's CPP tougher on newer coal plants than older \nones?\n\n[[Page H8830]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Newer is always cleaner than upgraded, retrofitted older plants. What \nthe heck?\n  This is all done in the name of climate change. Climate change has \nhappened since God created our Earth. Over 66 million years ago my home \nState of Texas was under water. Texas, as an ocean, is huge climate \nchange unlikely due to human campfires set at that time.\n  In September 2014, a high ranking former Obama administration member, \nthe under secretary for science at the Department of Education, Dr. \nSteven Koonin, wrote this in The Wall Street Journal: ``The climate has \nalways changed and always will.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I will quote from Dr. Koonin: ``There isn't a \nuseful consensus at the level of detail relevant to assess human \ninfluence on climate change.''\n  Yet, here we are, fighting for American jobs and commonsense \nregulations while world leaders are in Paris making promises they can't \nkeep. Enough of the Band-Aids from EPA.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for S.J. Res. 24 and S.J. \nRes. 23 and for American jobs.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are considering two \nresolutions today that are designed to prevent the Environmental \nProtection Agency from moving forward with critical regulations to \nreduce carbon emissions from existing and new power plants.\n  That previous resolution that was just aired in the House and now \nthis resolution should be called exactly what they are, that being an \nattack on EPA's Clean Air Act authority. These resolutions would block \nthis administration or any future administration from taking meaningful \naction to curb carbon emissions from our power plants.\n  We have ample evidence from more than four decades' worth of clean \nair regulation that shows that a strong economy and strong \nenvironmental and public health protections do indeed go hand in hand. \nSo let's stop promoting this false notion that we cannot improve the \nair we breathe while simultaneously growing our economy and, yes, \ncreating jobs.\n  The EPA's Clean Power Plan will promote public health. The EPA \nestimates that the Clean Power Plan will reduce carbon pollution from \nthe power sector by 32 percent--32 percent--below 2005 levels. There \nwill also be significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and \nNOX emissions.\n  This is a tremendous public health victory. It will avoid thousands \nof premature deaths and an estimated 90,000 asthma attacks in children \nin 2030 alone.\n  Mr. Speaker, I understand the concerns of the individuals, families, \nand communities that may have their jobs lost or displaced due to this \nenergy transition. We share those concerns.\n  I agree that these people who have dedicated their lives to providing \nus with reliable power deserve a lot more than a pink slip, but we do \nthese people no favors by promising job security that the economy will \nno longer deliver.\n  Instead of working together to find ways to ease the transition for \nStates and communities that already are challenged by the many changes \nthat are happening in the electric utility sector, we are spending time \ntrying to turn back the clock. It cannot be done.\n  EPA is a convenient scapegoat here, but the transition that is \noccurring is driven by much more than EPA regulations. Natural gas--its \nabundance and low price--is out-competing coal within the utility \nsector. Power plants are aging.\n  Even more important, the economy has changed. Many of the older \nplants are located in areas that once had far more demand for \nelectricity, demand from large manufacturing plants and heavy industry. \nThose factories have closed or modernized, both resulting in far less \nelectricity use.\n  There are new technologies. Wind and solar generation is growing, and \nthose renewable energy sources have strong, broad-based, public \nsupport.\n  Other technologies that enable the electric grid to be smarter, more \nflexible, and more resilient are being deployed now, and more are in \ndevelopment. State policies to encourage energy efficiency and to \ndiversify energy sources are also driving this transition.\n  As I have said before, Mr. Speaker, was the transition from wire to \nwireless communication a war on copper? Was the transition to the \nautomobile a war on horses? No, of course not.\n  EPA's regulations are playing some role in driving the changes we \nsee. That is true. But the Agency is doing what Congress directed it to \ndo on behalf of all Americans: to act in defense of public health and \nto act in defense of our environment.\n  Let's put aside the EPA scapegoating and have a real dialogue on our \nchanging power sector and what can be done to support those working in \nimpacted industries. Meanwhile, we are debating these resolutions as \nour negotiators are in Paris working on an international climate \nagreement.\n  The bottom line is there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that \nclimate change is happening and is primarily caused by human activity, \nparticularly the burning of fossil fuels.\n  Climate change is no longer a problem for future generations. We are \nalready feeling its effects in every corner of our Nation and across \nthe globe, which threaten our economic and our national security.\n  The Clean Power Plan will play a significant role in the fight \nagainst climate change. The United States' action alone won't stop \nclimate change, but action by the rest of the world without the United \nStates' action also will not succeed.\n  Other countries will have an excuse to delay action as long as the \ngiant, the United States, does as well. This is the dynamic that has \nprevented us from action in the past. But now we have seen major \ncommitments from the world's largest developed and developing nations.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Clean Power Plan demonstrates United States \nleadership and is key to our effort to secure an ambitious and lasting \ninternational climate agreement.\n  We cannot fool ourselves that the Clean Power Plan, an agreement in \nParis, or any one action alone will solve all of our climate crises. \nBut these rules will deliver substantial benefits to our society, and \nthey will move us in the right direction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject these resolutions. Let's \nwork together in a meaningful strategy to address the problems that are \nemerging from the transition in our own electricity sector while \npromoting a cleaner, more sustainable Nation and growing significant \njobs that are not yet on the radar screen.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon). He is a member of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 24, which \nexpresses congressional disapproval under the Congressional Review Act \nof the EPA's rule on existing power plants. I also support S.J. Res. 23 \nthat was just debated.\n\n  According to the EPA's own cost-benefit analysis, these regulations \nwould do very little to impact global temperatures, but these \nregulations will, without a doubt, be devastating for Hoosier \nbusinesses and families that rely on affordable energy. Those hurt the \nmost will be the poor and seniors on a fixed income.\n  Mr. Speaker, advances in how we produce energy should be achieved \nthrough innovation, technology, and efficient business practices, not \nby unobtainable Federal Government mandates from the EPA.\n  Mr. Speaker, Indiana disapproves of the EPA's attack on our State's \neconomy and our State's jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this overreach by \nsupporting S.J. Res. 23 and 24.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly), my colleague and friend. He is the cochair of \nthe SEEC Coalition in the House, the Sustainable Energy and Environment \nCoalition. He is an outstanding leader with SEEC, and he is an \noutstanding leader for his district and the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\n[[Page H8831]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from New York, who \nis the cochair of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition and \ndoes such a superlative job.\n  I rise to support him in opposing this legislative effort which \nargues overreach, but what it is really all about is making sure that \nthe government does not protect the public, that we live in a Darwinian \nworld where you apparently take your chances, whether it is asthma, \nother respiratory illnesses, cancer, and all kinds of other ailments \nthat can affect communities that suffer from this pollution. We, as a \ncountry, can do better. We can create jobs, not lose them.\n  The arguments on the other side have always been that the Clean Air \nAct costs jobs and raises costs, neither of which are true. We have \ngotten lots of experience since 1970 with the Clean Air Act. I can tell \nyou that, in my home State of Virginia, electric costs came down. They \ndidn't go up. Jobs got created, not lost.\n  I end, Mr. Speaker, by reminding us of what His Holiness Pope Francis \nhas argued. When Pope Francis came to the White House, before he spoke \nto this body, he personally thanked the President for these rules in \nprotecting clean air.\n  His first encyclical is on climate change, which he believes is one \nof the most important and imperative moral issues facing mankind today. \nThat is what the Pope has to say about this subject. We ought to heed \nhis words and his moral warning as we debate this subject.\n  Mr. Speaker, I oppose the legislation and support the amendments with \nrespect to the Clean Air Act.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Bost).\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky and my \nneighbor across the river.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan rule is a \ndagger aimed at the heart of the coal industry and affordable, \nAmerican-made energy.\n  According to recent studies, the regulation will increase electric \ncosts in my home State of Illinois by 27 percent. That is an unbearable \nburden on working families, seniors, and those people who are on set \nincomes.\n  On top of that, Mr. Speaker, the mining industry employs thousands of \nworkers in southern Illinois and supports thousands more in union \nretirees.\n  I have heard here today on this floor that it doesn't affect jobs. \nWell, tell that to the people of my district who have watched the coal \nmines close and who have watched the suffering. These people don't have \nthe opportunity to keep their children working near their own homes. \nThey have to move away.\n  Mr. Speaker, if this regulation takes effect, the local coal mines \nthat are left and coal generation plants will close down. Our priority \nmust be affordable energy and American jobs.\n  For this reason, I ask, I beg, and I plead: Vote for S.J. Res. 24.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Castor). She is a member of the Subcommittee on Energy and \nPower, and that reports to the greater Committee on Energy and Commerce \nthat we both serve. I have witnessed her straightforward thinking and \nher very strong, passionate response on behalf of climate change.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I thank the gentleman from New York for his \nkind words and his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution that seeks to \nhamstring America's ability to combat carbon pollution and the impacts \nof the changing climate.\n  In Paris today, 195 nations from around the world are meeting to \ntackle the challenges of the changing climate. I am proud to see that \nAmerica is leading this effort.\n  America's willingness to tackle the economic and environmental \nimpacts of climate change is a reflection of our values. We do not \ncower in the face of difficult circumstances. That is the essence of \nthe United States of America.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Yet that is what this Republican majority in the Congress would have \nus do--ignore the problem, pretend it doesn't exist, hope it goes away.\n  Well, we cannot do that. Scientific consensus is clear: The Earth's \nclimate is changing, temperatures are getting warmer, and it is the \ngreenhouse gases that are the primary drivers. Over the long term, the \nconsequences will be very serious and the costs will be very high, \nindeed, unless we take action.\n  My neighbors back home in Florida are particularly vulnerable. \nFlorida has more private property at risk from flooding linked to \nclimate change than any other State, an amount that could double in the \nnext 4 years.\n  Already, local governments and taxpayers are being asked to pay more \nfor stormwater drainage, drinking water initiatives, and beach \nrenourishment. Extreme weather events will likely cause increases in \nproperty insurance and flood insurance.\n  We just experienced, colleagues, one of the warmest Novembers on \nrecord in central Florida. Because of the heat, we had to run our air \nconditioners a lot longer than we are used to. We are used to turning \nthem off in November, so we are paying more on our electric bills.\n  For my friends in agriculture, the tomato crop was harvested earlier \nthis year because of the heat, and while the yield was comparable to \npast years, the size was affected. The increase in the number of days \nwith extreme heat is sure to impact other crops in Florida's economy.\n  We are not alone. We are going to continue to see the impacts all \nacross America. So we have a challenge before us. We cannot shirk our \nresponsibility to this great country or to future generations.\n  We must unleash American ingenuity to reduce carbon pollution. So \nmuch is already happening. Technology today helps consumers conserve \nenergy and save on their electric bills. Smartphones and smart meters \ncan help you control your thermostat.\n  Renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, hold great promise \nand are growing by leaps and bounds. I have seen it at home, where \nlocal businesses like IKEA and the big beer distributorship have put \nsolar panels on the roofs of their huge buildings to save on their \nelectric bills.\n  Roughly 20,000 megawatts of solar capacity is forecasted to come on \nline over the next 2 years, doubling the country's existing solar \ncapacity.\n  And industrial energy and heat that was once wasted is being turned \ninto fuel.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. TONKO. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  All of these efforts are creating the jobs of tomorrow in clean \nenergy, in engineering, in energy efficiency and green building.\n  So, colleagues, I urge you to defeat this resolution. It is largely a \nsymbolic vote. A ``yes'' vote is one to ignore the costs and \nconsequences of the changing climate, but if it passes, it will also be \nanother low point for this Congress, a Congress that has demonstrated \ntime and again an inability to deal with the complicated and thorny \nproblems that face America. I predict that many will come to regret \nthat legacy.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully disagree with the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from Florida who says this is a symbolic \nvote.\n  We want this vote to be held because the Senate has already adopted \nthis resolution. We want the House to adopt this resolution while the \nclimate change conference is going on in France so that the world will \nknow that in America there is a disagreement about the extreme power \ngrab that this President is initiating under his clean energy plan.\n  At this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nJohnson), who has been a real leader for Ohio in this issue and in the \nCongress.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I \ncouldn't agree with my chairman more on his comments.\n  I rise today in strong support of S.J. Res. 24, a joint resolution \ndisapproving of the EPA's regulations targeting existing power plants.\n  If the administration allows the Clean Power Plan to move forward, \ncountless coal and coal-related jobs across the country will be \neliminated, families and small businesses will be forced to pay higher \nelectricity prices, and grid reliability will be seriously jeopardized.\n  It is estimated that, to comply with the EPA's existing power plant \nregulations, energy sector expenditures\n\n[[Page H8832]]\n\nwould increase from $220 billion to $292 billion, with retail \nelectricity prices doubling in 40 States. In fact, by 2030, one study \npredicts Ohio's wholesale electricity prices will increase by 31.2 \npercent due to this regulation. The regulation will force consumers to \nabsorb a $64 billion cost just to replace the power plants shut down by \nthe rule.\n  This resolution of disapproval sends a clear message to the President \nthat a majority of the Senate, the House, and America do not approve of \nhigher electricity prices and an unreliable electric grid.\n  At least 27 States, including Ohio, are now challenging the \nregulations in court. Ohio EPA Director Craig Butler is correct; it \nwould be irresponsible for the U.S. EPA to force immediate compliance \nuntil the legal issues are resolved.\n  America faces real challenges. ISIS and other terrorist groups are \nplotting to attack us. We have a staggering national debt that our \nchildren and grandchildren will be buried under if we don't address it. \nWe have a Tax Code and regulatory framework that are stifling and \nstrangling innovation and job creation. And our education system isn't \nkeeping pace with those of our rivals.\n  These are real problems. America's air and water have never been \ncleaner. For the President to continue his crusade to shut down the \ncoal industry and all the jobs that go with it is shortsighted, \nfoolish, and wrong.\n  And it won't just be the coal miners who pay for the President's \npolicy on coal, Mr. Speaker. It will be every family and small business \nwho end up paying more for their electricity as a result.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support S.J. Res. 24.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. McDermott), a member of the Ways and Means Committee \nand, more important to this discussion, an outstanding, passionate \nvoice concerning climate change and carbon emission.\n  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nhis remarks.)\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress, the Republican \npropaganda machine is out here pushing a false choice: You either have \nno regulations or you have no economy. That is what it is. You have to \nget rid of all the regulations, or you won't have an economy.\n  Now, that simply is not true. The facts are piling up worldwide that \nwe cannot continue what we are doing.\n  Now, on the front page of today's Washington Post is a picture of a \nChinese city where you can't see a guy riding a bicycle in the street. \nThat is true in Delhi. That is true in Beijing. It is all over the \nworld.\n\n  And, unfortunately, climate is all over the world. We can't just have \nit clean in our neighborhood and have it awful in the rest of the \nworld. We have to think about a larger issue than our own.\n  I have heard the same arguments that I am hearing today when we said, \n``You got to stop smoking on the airplanes.'' Why, we heard the tobacco \nboys running in here saying, ``Oh, this is the end of the Earth. There \nwill be nobody smoking tobacco.''\n  And look what has happened. The air is cleaned up on planes, it is \ncleaned up in restaurants, it is cleaned up on this floor because we \nhad rules and regulations.\n  This is a public health problem as much as it is an economic problem. \nSince I got out of the military in 1968, 76,000 miners have died of \nblack lung disease--76,000. We have appropriated in this House $45 \nbillion in money to those miners because of their problems.\n  Our ravenous appetite for fossil fuels continues to be a real \nproblem, and it is getting worse. And yet, with all the reckless bills, \nthe Republicans are once again turning a blind eye to these costs. \n``They don't mean anything. We want the mine owners to have freedom to \ndo whatever they want and the power companies to do whatever they want. \nWe don't want anybody to tell them you have to clean it up.''\n  In Seattle, we have a steel plant right in the middle of town. It is \nrun by Nucor. The Nucor Steel rebar plant is right in the middle of the \ncity. It has been cleaned up, and you can do it.\n  But the coal boys and the power boys, they don't want to spend any \nmoney cleaning anything up. They don't want anybody telling them, with \nregulations, you have to reduce the amount of particulates in the air. \nSo we have this problem that is going on and on and on.\n  Now, as industry and the industry-bought Republicans fight tooth and \nnail against any effort to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, they are \nnot just condemning future generations to a world battered by \nincreasing extreme and erratic weather patterns--we are seeing them all \nover the world.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. TONKO. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. They are really betraying a generation of Americans \nwho are already reeling from the impact of all of this. Coal miners and \nthe communities they live in are bearing the brunt of this \nirresponsible action by the coal owners.\n  We had the same thing in Washington State with the forests. People \nsaid, ``You have to keep cutting trees. Cut every tree you can see that \nis standing anywhere.'' And we said, ``If you do that, you destroy the \nenvironment.'' So we stopped, and we helped the loggers find another \nway to make a living, and they are doing just fine.\n  Now, if we keep this up and keep resisting and keep exposing the \nAmerican public, both in the mines and in the cities, to this kind of \nenvironment, we are going to pay for it.\n  It is like that FRAM commercial when I was a kid. The FRAM commercial \nwas you either clean your air filter on your car now or you are going \nto pay me later by having to have the motor redone.\n  That is what this is about. We are talking about a President who \nsays, let's put some new FRAM filters in here and see if we can't cut \ndown the pollution and save both the people and the economy.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky \nfor yielding and for bringing this legislation to the floor.\n  I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 24.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we are talking about is rejecting this radical plan \nby President Obama's EPA that is going to actually impact every power \nplant in this country.\n  The President has a war on coal. He declared a war on coal years ago, \nand we are seeing the results of it. The results of it here in America \nare thousands of good jobs lost, thousands of middle class families \nthat are now unemployed and trying to fight to get back in the middle \nclass. And even more than that, Mr. Speaker, what you see is millions \nof people across this country paying more for electricity costs because \nof these regulations.\n  So what is President Obama's answer? It is to go to Paris and say \nthat the biggest threat to national security is global warming. For \ngoodness' sake, doesn't he see what is going on across the world?\n  We are here focusing on national security, Mr. Speaker. We are also \nfocusing on energy security, and we are standing up against a radical \nregulation that is going to increase costs on the most needy in this \ncountry.\n  When you look at the impact, this proposal by President Obama's EPA \nwould have a $29-billion-per-year cost on middle class families. The \npeople that are going to be hit the hardest are low-income families, \nMr. Speaker. In Louisiana alone, nearly 1 million middle-and low-income \nfamilies will be hit by this radical regulation.\n  At Christmas season, I think families would much rather be spending \ntheir hard-earned dollars going and buying Christmas presents for their \nfamilies instead of seeing a 13-percent increase in their utility bills \nfor a regulation that is not going to do anything to clean the air.\n  We are already seeing a reduction in carbon emissions because of the \nAmerican innovation. When some of these European countries signed Kyoto \nand some of these other accords that are wrecking their economies, we \ndidn't do it. Because we are actually doing better than them without \nsigning an accord because we used great American innovation.\n\n[[Page H8833]]\n\n  And, instead, the President wants to come behind and bring a \nregulation that is going to strangle small businesses, it is going to \nstrangle families, and it is going to increase electricity costs on \nthose that can least afford to pay it.\n  Again, let them keep the money in their own pockets. Let's innovate, \nlet's create jobs in this economy, not use radical regulations to \nstrangle our economy and our middle class. Let's pass this resolution.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to yield the balance \nof my time to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), our \ndistinguished ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who \nhas led a fight for carbon emission and climate change on behalf of the \nDemocrats in the House, and that he may control that time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, my colleague Congressman McDermott pointed to this \npicture in today's edition of The Washington Post. This is during the \ndaylight. It is outside. It is in China.\n  I have been over there about four times, and I can relate to this \npicture in case nobody has been over there. Anybody who has been over \nthere knows how the environment, the air quality, and people's health \nare impacted by the lack of regulations that have existed over in \nChina. They have an acute air pollution problem.\n  The fact is we don't have air pollution like that here in America \nbecause we have had regulations promulgated by agencies like the EPA, \nparticularly the EPA, that have resulted in, yes, some increased costs \nto Americans, but the result of that cost is air quality that does not \nlook like this.\n  This is worth paying for, and the people will continue to pay. We \nwill continue to pay. I mean, life is not free. It is true, though, \nthat, with companies making so much money these days due to the \nmisbalance in the economy, people are being squeezed.\n  I hate to ask people to pay more, but I myself cannot live just based \non the price that businesses have to pay to make sure that they are not \npolluting our environment. They should pay, and we have to pay our fair \nshare, too.\n  The question is: Are we going to be able to save our planet from \ncountries that don't have regulations?\n  We are going in the opposite direction here. We are talking about \ndoing away with the EPA. Why is it that the first thing my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle and all of their Presidential candidates \ntalk about is getting rid of the EPA?\n  There is a reason for that. The reason is that they want to protect \nthe ability of polluters to just pollute at will and to continue to \nmake all of the money at the expense of people's health, with our \npaying them exorbitant amounts for the energy that they are creating.\n  When are we going to do something about this? If not now, then when? \nIf it is not America that is leading, then who?\n  They talk about President Obama going to Paris. There are 185 nations \nbeing represented in Paris that are working on this problem, which is a \nprofound problem not just for America, but for the world. We all live \nin this same ship together, and we have got to take care of it.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I will reiterate and make sure that everyone understands that S.J. \nRes. 24 does not eliminate the EPA. It refers only to the President's \nexisting coal plant rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. \nWomack), who has been very involved in this issue in his career in \nCongress.\n  Mr. WOMACK. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky for his \nleadership on the issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 24 and to echo the \nsentiments of my colleagues.\n  There is no question that we are all searching for a brighter future \nfor generations to come. We disagree, however, on how to get there and, \nin this case, on the effects that our decisions could have on the \nenvironment and on the American family in the process.\n  Frankly, the EPA's Clean Power Plan will result in little to no \nenvironmental benefit at the expense of thousands of jobs and countless \ndollars and hours spent on compliance, all for the sake of an \nunrelenting government agency's agenda and the desired environmental \nlegacy of this administration. It is as simple as that.\n  Not only will the Clean Power Plan fail to achieve the results \nintended, but the administration's very authority to implement it is \nquestionable at best. The letter of the law itself denies the EPA this \nauthority to regulate power plants under section 111(d), something \nspecifically cited under section 112. Twenty-seven States' attorneys \ngeneral, including our very own Leslie Rutledge in Arkansas, agree and \nhave filed suit in response.\n  The Constitution clearly states that legislative powers are vested in \nthe Congress. The Clean Power Plan is a clear attempt to take \npolicymaking out of the hands of Congress. That is unacceptable. \nPresident Obama's never-ending regulatory overreach has to be stopped.\n  If the EPA will not halt, Congress must act to prevent this egregious \npower grab. This resolution will stop the EPA in its tracks and return \nthe power to where it rightfully exists. Maybe then we can all get back \nto this Nation's historic, all-of-the-above energy policy.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we want to leave our successors a better future, \nsupporting the two resolutions that have been debated here on the floor \ntoday is a really good first step.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time that remains \non both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 10\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 16\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Weber).\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of both joint \nresolutions, which will block the Obama administration's so-called \nClean Power Plan, a regulation, I will add, that was never authorized \nby Congress, that will hurt our economy, lower our standard of living, \nand have absolutely no impact on the climate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I often say the things that make America great are the \nthings that America makes. Now, how do we do that? We do that with an \naffordable, dependable, reliable energy supply.\n  According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which \noperates my State's electric grid, energy costs would increase \nprotections by up to 16 percent due to this Clean Power Plan. This will \nhave a disproportionate impact on the poor and on those on fixed \nincomes. Sadly, most of those folks don't even see it coming.\n  According to testimony we heard today, Mr. Speaker, in the Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee, the Clean Power Plan will reduce \nglobal temperatures by just .023 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100.\n  Furthermore, the EPA's claimed public health benefits from this \nregulation are due solely to reductions in air pollutants that are \nalready regulated by the Agency under existing standards. The reduction \nof carbon dioxide on its own has no public health benefits.\n  I mentioned that the things that make America great are the way that \nwe have a reliable, affordable power supply. I guess we could say that \nthe EPA stands for an ``energy and power assault.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the facts are clear. This regulation will hurt our \neconomy, and it will have none of the stated benefits the \nadministration claims. I often say that the EPA seems to stand for \n``eventually paralyzing America.''\n  We must adopt these resolutions of disapproval and hold this \nadministration accountable for its regulatory assault on our economy \nand on our low-income families. That is how I see it here in America.\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H8834]]\n\n  I have heard my Republican colleagues say over and over again that \nthe President's Clean Power Plan won't have any impact on air quality \nand that it won't do anything to improve the environment. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  The rule that we are discussing in this joint resolution and that the \njoint resolution would seek to disapprove establishes State-by-State \ntargets for lowering carbon emissions. When it is implemented, the rule \nwill reduce emissions from the power sector by 32 percent over the next \n15 years as compared to emissions in 2005.\n  The final rule has public health and other benefits of up to $54 \nbillion per year by 2030, and this includes thousands of fewer \npremature deaths from air pollution and tens of thousands of fewer \nchildhood asthma attacks each year--emphasizing again, thousands of \nfewer premature deaths from air pollution and tens of thousands of \nfewer childhood asthma attacks each year.\n  I keep hearing from my GOP colleagues about the costs. What are the \ncosts to society of air pollution and of people suffering from asthma \nand of premature deaths and of hospitalizations and of all of the \ncosts? None of these things are calculated by the Republicans in their \nspeeches. They just assume that somehow none of this matters.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues have said over and over again that \nthis is sort of a wasted debate because we know that the President has \nsaid he is going to veto the bill and that there wouldn't be enough \nvotes in the House or in the Senate to overcome the President's veto.\n  The theme that you are getting from the Republicans is somehow a \nclean environment and a good economy don't go together. In fact, the \nopposite is true.\n  The fact of the matter is that, ever since the Clean Air Act was \nimplemented years ago, we have seen reductions in air pollution. We \nhave seen people's lives saved. We have seen fewer people suffer from \nasthma attacks and the other consequences of pollution. At the same \ntime, the economy has improved.\n  In the Statement of Administration Policy, in which the President \nsays that he will veto this resolution, he specifically says that, \nsince it was enacted in 1970 and amended in 1977 and 1990, each time \nwith strong bipartisan support, the Clean Air Act has improved the \nNation's air quality and has protected public health.\n  Over that same period of time, the economy has tripled in size while \nemissions of key pollutants have decreased by more than 70 percent. \nForty-five years of clean air regulation have shown that a strong \neconomy and strong environmental and public health protections go hand \nin hand.\n  I just keep hearing these negative comments from the other side of \nthe aisle. The fact of the matter is, when you reduce air pollution, \nyou eliminate the consequences of people having bad health, of dying, \nof getting sick.\n  At the same time, the economy has improved because we have come up \nwith alternatives to the awful pollution that has resulted which this \nClean Power Plan is designed to thwart.\n  Again, I keep hearing my colleagues saying all of these things, but \nthe fact of the matter is you can have clean air, you can have a good \nenvironment, and you can have a good economy and grow jobs. That is \nexactly what this rule that the President has put forward is designed \nto achieve.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  Mr. YOHO. I thank my good friend from Kentucky for allowing me to \nspeak.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are as concerned about our environment and jobs and \nthe economy as anybody else is, and there was a point in time when we \nneeded this. We saw those pictures of China with the red glow and where \nyou couldn't see the bicycle rider. China has got a problem, and they \nneed to address that.\n  We have addressed that in this country, but it gets to a point at \nwhich you cross a line and you can't squeeze any more out of the rock. \nBack 40 years ago the mercury coming out of the smokestacks of the \ncoal-fired power plants was about 50 pounds of mercury a year. Now it \nis less than 2 pounds of mercury a year. So how much more can you \nincrease that?\n  Mr. Speaker, this administration has proven that it is no friend to \nthe hardworking American families across our country or to the power-\nproducing companies that supply power to all Americans.\n  Instead, this administration is placing added requirements on our \nNation's energy producers, requirements that will increase costs to all \nAmericans, affecting those most who can least afford it. It will \nincrease costs, it will decrease the grid's reliability, and it will \njeopardize our national security.\n  As we speak, nations across the world are meeting in Paris to discuss \nfurther restrictions on energy producers. As Americans, we do not bow \nto foreign pressure or influence. America needs to do what is best for \nAmerica, especially when it is a foreign country that is putting out \nmore than 50 percent of the carbon emitted into the atmosphere.\n  Instead of limiting our energy production, which, again, hits \nhardworking Americans especially at the lower economic scales, why \ndon't we use all of the resources that America has been blessed with \nand take a commonsense approach in making our economy stronger and more \ncompetitive rather than in crippling it?\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  The issue is near and dear to my heart as a Member from Florida who \nrepresents five co-ops in my district, and it is what we see.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. YOHO. The EPA's own report says that their new emissions \nstandards will not reduce the CO2 emissions or improve air \nquality or human health, but they are going ahead with it anyway to the \ndetriment of American manufacturing jobs and costs to the American \ntaxpayers.\n  I stand in strong support of S.J. Res. 24.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, I listened to the previous speaker. House Republicans keep \ntelling us that greenhouse gas emissions are falling in the United \nStates. The previous speaker suggested that the United States doesn't \nneed to do much more about climate change. That couldn't be more wrong.\n  U.S. greenhouse gas emissions did fall in 2008 and 2009 during the \neconomic recession. Since that time, our overall emissions have grown. \nCumulatively, U.S. emissions grew, not fell, in 2012 and 2013, the two \nmost recent years for which data is available.\n  What matters really is whether U.S. emissions are on track to decline \nin the future by the amount needed to prevent dangerous climate change. \nScientists say we need to reduce carbon pollution by 80 percent by 2050 \nto avoid catastrophic climate change. The EPA already predicts that, \nwithout any new policies to control carbon pollution, policies like the \nClean Power Plan, the U.S. will only see a 2 percent drop in \nCO2 emissions by 2040 compared to 2005 levels.\n  So this data highlights the importance of the Clean Power Plan and \nthe Obama administration's overall push to cut greenhouse gas \nemissions. To suggest the United States doesn't need to do any more, \nthat is just not the case. We need to do a lot more, and that is what \nthe Clean Power Plan is designed to do.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a member of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 23 and 24, \nresolutions that would protect my constituents from egregious EPA \noverreach. This burdensome regulation is projected to raise electric \nrates in Florida annually between 11 and 15 percent for over 10 years \nwhile providing virtually no environmental benefits.\n  The regulations for existing power plants, commonly called the Clean \nPower Plan, could have disastrous consequences for the safety, \naffordability, and reliability of my constituents' electricity. In my \ndistrict, there are over 200,000 residents who get their\n\n[[Page H8835]]\n\nelectricity from rural electric cooperatives, utilities formed during \nthe Great Depression to serve rural, traditionally underserved areas \nwith electricity.\n  If the Clean Power Plan continues without serious alterations, it has \nthe potential to negatively affect these underserved areas the most. \nThe Clean Power Plan could close down power plants in rural areas that \nprovide jobs and economic activity.\n  In Florida, the Seminole Electric Cooperative operates two power \nplants whose baseload generating units do not meet the emission rate \nrequirements. Their Seminole generating station employs over 300 \nindividuals. If the EPA forces the plant to close prematurely, these \njobs are at risk, and rural electric cooperative members, like my \nconstituents, will still have to pay for the closed plant in their \nrates through 2042 while also paying for a new electricity source.\n  The Congressional Review Act was created for a reason: to give this \nbody the authority to check the executive branch when it oversteps its \nbounds and enacts policy against the will of the people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these resolutions, both of them, to \nprotect my constituents from needless rate increases and to protect the \npowers of this institution.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. May I inquire as to the time remaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 10 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from New Jersey has 5\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S.J. \nRes. 24, which expresses Congress' disapproval of the EPA's carbon \nemission rule for existing power plants. The administration's \nunprecedented rule would inhibit our ability to produce affordable and \nreliable electricity.\n  A robust energy supply is essential to national security, public \nhealth, and the economy, yet the administration continues to wage war \non the source of 85 percent of America's energy. Until our energy \ninfrastructure can support widespread use of alternate energy sources, \nwe cannot arbitrarily force the closure of plants that are keeping \nlights on for millions of Americans.\n  Implementing this rule would result in the loss of over 125,000 jobs, \nas well as significantly higher electric bills in 48 States. Forty of \nthese States would see double-digit electricity price increases.\n  Our Nation is still in a period of economic recovery. Low- and \nmiddle-income American families already spend 17 percent of their \nhousehold budget on electric bills. These families cannot afford to \nhave another costly mandate forced upon them.\n  Our economy cannot recover, much less compete on a global level, with \nthis many jobs lost. This resolution would prevent this rule from \nhaving any effect and would prohibit the EPA from reissuing this rule \nin a similar form.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can assure Americans \nare not disadvantaged by another costly regulation.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, I just want to comment on two issues that keep coming up \non the Republican side. One is this notion, which I think the GOP Whip \nScalise talked about, of the President's war on coal. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  I agree that the transition away from coal is contributing to job \nlosses in the coal industry, but setting aside these rules will not \nalter this trend. There are too many other changes occurring in the \npower sector that are impacting these workers.\n  Technologies--including distributed generation, smart grid, energy \nstorage, energy efficiency, microgrids, and combined heat and power \nsystems--are maturing and being incorporated at a faster pace. In some \nareas, they call into question the old grid model that was dominated by \nlarge, centralized generation.\n  Concern for these displaced energy workers should be motivating us to \ndo something to help these people and their communities to transition \nto other good-paying jobs in new industries. Setting aside this rule is \nnot going to replace the job security that they had in the past.\n  Instead of wasting time trying to hold back progress and ignore \nclimate change, we should be working together to address this \nchallenge. This rule moves us forward, and it represents our Nation's \ncommitment to addressing a serious global problem that we helped to \ncreate.\n  I constantly hear this about job losses. The fact is that job losses \nare occurring regardless of anything that the Clean Power Plan would \ndo. Instead of saying job losses, the Republicans should be thinking \nabout ways of trying to help these workers.\n  The other thing I would mention is I kept hearing from the other side \nthis whole notion that electricity rates, prices, and bills are going \nto go up.\n  I include in the Record a letter from Public Citizen and a number of \nother consumers groups.\n\n         Public Citizen--Center for Accessible Technology--\n           Citizens Action Coalition--Citizens Coalition--\n           Consumers Union--Energy Coordinating Agency of \n           Philadelphia--Friendship Foundation--Greenlining \n           Institute--Low-Income Energy Affordability Network--\n           National Consumer Law Center--NW Energy Coalition--\n           Nuclear Information and Resource Service--Ohio Partners \n           for Affordable Energy--Public Utility Law Project of \n           New York--TURN The Utility Reform Network--Vermont \n           Energy Investment Corporation--Virginia Citizens \n           Consumer Council--WA State Community Action \n           Partnership--A World Institute for a Sustainable \n           Humanity (A W.I.S.H),\n                                                November 24, 2015.\n     RE: Consumer Groups Oppose S.J. Res. 23 and S.J. Res. 24.\n       Dear Representative: We urge you to oppose S.J. Res. 23 and \n     S.J. Res. 24. These resolutions would effectively repeal the \n     EPA Clean Power Plan, which curbs carbon pollution from power \n     plants. Opponents of the Clean Power Plan often argue that \n     they are protecting consumers, but they are mistaken. The \n     Clean Power Plan is good for consumers because it will \n     mitigate climate change and can lower household electricity \n     costs.\n       The Clean Power Plan will benefit consumers. Climate change \n     poses a severe threat to American consumers and in particular \n     to vulnerable populations. A few of the most salient risks \n     include: higher taxes and market prices to cover the costs of \n     widespread damage to property and infrastructure from extreme \n     weather; diminished quality and higher prices for food and \n     water, heightening food insecurity for America's most \n     vulnerable populations; and increased illness and disease \n     from extreme heat events, reduced air quality, increased \n     food-borne, water-borne, and insect-borne pathogens.\n       By curbing carbon pollution, the Clean Power Plan will \n     benefit consumers by mitigating these harms.\n       The Clean Power Plan should lower consumer electricity \n     bills. The Clean Power Plan is likely to lower consumer \n     costs, not raise them, because it will spur improvements in \n     energy efficiency. Although electricity prices may rise \n     modestly under the Plan, consumers will use less electricity. \n     This should result in lower bills overall. The EPA projects \n     that the rule will lower consumer bills by 7.0 to 7.7 percent \n     by 2030. A Public Citizen analysis of the proposed rule found \n     that the EPA's projection of bill reductions was conservative \n     because it overestimated the cost of efficiency programs and \n     underestimated how much progress the states can make on \n     efficiency. These points remain valid with respect to the \n     final rule, for which the EPA's analysis is similar. Consumer \n     costs are likely to decline by more than the agency projects.\n       We strongly encourage members to support the Clean Power \n     Plan and to oppose the resolutions disapproving it.

I would like to just read some sections from the letter. \nThe letter is from Public Citizen and a number of other consumers \ngroups.\n  They say in the letter that ``the Clean Power Plan will benefit \nconsumers. Climate change poses a severe threat to American consumers \nand in particular to vulnerable populations . . . The Clean Power Plan \nshould lower consumer electricity bills. The Clean Power Plan is likely \nto lower consumer costs, not raise them, because it will spur \nimprovements in energy efficiency. Although electricity prices may rise \nmodestly under the Plan, consumers will use less electricity. This \nshould result in lower bills overall. The EPA projects that the rule \nwill lower consumer bills by 7.0 to 7.7 percent by 2030. A Public \nCitizen analysis of the proposed rule found that the EPA's projection \nof bill reductions was conservative because it overestimated the cost \nof efficiency programs and underestimated how much progress the states \ncan make on efficiency. These points remain valid with respect to the \nfinal rule, for which the EPA's analysis is similar. Consumers costs \nare likely to decline by more than the agency projects.''\n  Again, we keep hearing from the other side of the aisle, oh, \nelectricity bills are going to go up. They are not. They are going to \ngo down. We keep hearing we are going to lose jobs. Well, a lot of \nthose jobs are going to be lost anyway because of the change in the \ntypes of generation of electricity. We should be thinking of ways to \ntry to deal with that rather than saying that somehow we are going to \nstop it, because we are not going to be able to.\n  I also want to say that I heard the national security argument. We \nhad, in the Energy and Commerce Committee, a minority hearing a couple \nof months ago at Annapolis. One of the reasons we went there is we know \nthat our military is seriously concerned about the impacts of climate \nchange and sea level rise. When we were there, the superintendent of \nthe Naval Academy was talking about hundreds of millions of dollars \nthat were being spent just at Annapolis to deal with sea level rise at \nthe academy and went on to talk about the impact of climate change on \nnaval operations and so many other things.\n  Again, I don't want to emphasize the impact on our national security, \nbut it is there. To suggest that somehow there is no impact is simply \nnot true. Climate change is very much in the minds of the admirals and \nthe generals at the Pentagon. They are very worried about the impact \nand what it is going to mean in terms of our national security and what \nwe have to do to address those concerns over the next few years.\n  The main thing I wanted to stress, Mr. Speaker, if I could, is that \nthis rule that the Republicans are trying to get rid of provides States \nwith a lot of flexibility to find the best path forward to meet their \nemission reduction goals. In fact, many States are already implementing \npolicies that are consistent with these regulations.\n  The fact of the matter is that the EPA spent several years talking to \nStates, talking to stakeholders, and talking to consumers. They have \nnot put together some kind of straightjacket here that says that the \nStates have to implement these reductions in carbon emissions in a \ncertain way. They are giving States a tremendous amount of flexibility. \nThey had a lot of public hearings. They had millions of people who \ncommented on the rule.\n  Somehow, when you listen to my colleagues here today, they suggest \nthat this rule came out of nowhere without considering all of the \neconomic impacts, without considering the costs. None of that is true. \nIn fact, there were a lot of discussions about the costs and about the \neconomic impact.\n  The bottom line is that there is every reason to believe that this \nrule will improve the public health, will improve the lives of \nAmericans in terms of the negative impact that air pollution has on \ntheir health, and, in the long run, will improve the economy and lower \ncosts for the consumer.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I certainly want to thank Mr. Pallone and the great job he does as \nranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I am delighted \nthat we have the opportunity to come to the House floor to debate \nthings like S.J. Res. 24.\n  The Congressional Review Act is an instrument that is available to \nCongress to try to stop the President when we believe that the \nPresident has exceeded his legal authority, and that is precisely why \nwe are here today on S.J. Res. 23 as well as S.J. Res. 24. We believe \nthe President has exceeded his legal authority.\n  Now, the President in 2013 went to Georgetown University and gave a \nspeech on climate change, and he set out his clean energy plan. I might \nsay that he never consulted with Congress. He never talked to Congress. \nHe never asked for any input from Congress on this issue. That is his \nprerogative. But the EPA took him at his word, and then they started \nthe process of adopting these final regulations.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  We have already talked about the regulation relating to new coal \npower plants so that America finds itself to be one of the only \ncountries in the world today where you cannot build a new plant.\n  But right now we are talking about the regulation on existing plants. \nThe reason we have such concern about it is that, first of all, EPA's \nown legal team, their lawyers, reversed 20 years of legal opinion when \nthey said that they could regulate under 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. \nPrior to that, they had always made the decision that, on this type of \nscale, they could not do it under 111(d).\n  I might also add that Professor Larry Tribe of Harvard Law School, \nwho taught Barack Obama while Barack Obama was a student at Harvard, \ncame to Congress and testified on this clean energy plan that, in his \nview, it was like tearing up the Constitution. In other words, the \nPresident exceeded his legal authority. In other words, it was a power \ngrab.\n  Now, some people say, well, the end justifies the means. There are a \nlot of people who feel that way. But we are still a nation of laws. We \nbelieve--and not only we believe--every time the EPA has testified \nabout this existing coal plant rule, they have stressed how they have \nmet with the States, they give the States maximum flexibility to try to \naddress this regulation. If that is the case, why have 27 States \nalready filed lawsuits against the EPA and a multitude of other \nentities as well?\n  This is even a violation of the Federal Power Act because States, \ngenerally speaking, have jurisdiction over electric generation and \nintrastate distribution. But under this regulation of existing coal \nplants, EPA will have that authority.\n  Guess what. Normally, when EPA has a major rule like this, they will \ngive the States 3 years to come up with their State implementation \nplan. But, in this instance, the rule came out and was finalized in \nSeptember or October of this year. The States have until September, \nbasically 1 year, to come up with a State implementation plan.\n  They wanted to finalize this rule so that the President could go and \ntell the world leaders in France that America was doing more than \nanyone else, and we already were doing more than anyone else.\n  With all due great respect to everyone, whether you agree with our \nposition or not, we have the right to express that view. We decided \nexplicitly\n\n[[Page H8837]]\n\nto bring these resolutions to the floor as the climate change \nconference is taking place in Paris because we want the world to know \nthat there are differences of opinion between the Congress and the \nPresident on this issue and on his clean energy plan.\n  I would respectfully ask every Member of Congress to vote for this \nresolution. As we said earlier, the U.S. Senate has already passed both \nof these resolutions because they are concerned about the President \nexceeding his legal authority, his power grab, his extreme plan. Even \nDemocrats in the Senate supported these resolutions.\n  That is all we are trying to do today. We are not debating climate \nchange. We are not debating the science of climate change. But we are \ndebating the President's view on the way you address it and the fact \nthat he is jeopardizing America because he is making us jump through \nmore severe obstacles and hoops than any other country is being asked \nto do. That is why we are here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the joint \nresolution.\n  The question is on third reading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint \nresolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on the passage of S.J.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, today we commence debate on H.R. 8, the North American \nEnergy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015. This bill culminates a \nmultiyear, multi-Congress effort to ensure that folks in Michigan and \nevery corner of the country have access to affordable and reliable \nenergy. It has been nearly a decade since we last considered a broad \nenergy package and a lot--a lot--has changed.\n  Back then, the energy situation looked downright dire: declining \ndomestic oil and natural gas output, increasing reliance on imports, \nand energy prices that seemed like they had nowhere to go but up. \nRemember 7 years ago they were $3.84 a gallon.\n\n[[Page H8840]]\n\nManufacturers were leaving and fleeing overseas in pursuit of cheaper \nenergy.\n  But thankfully, because of breakthrough innovation, a little American \ningenuity, and a lot of hard work, we are now experiencing game-\nchanging energy abundance that has, in fact, redefined America's \nstanding at home, as well as around the globe. Now Michigan and many \nparts of the country are enjoying a welcome manufacturing renaissance \nthanks to reliable and affordable energy. It is well past time that our \nlaws rooted in energy scarcity caught up to our newfound 21st century \nreality.\n  The first order of business is to allow the private sector to expand \nthe Nation's energy infrastructure. The Keystone XL pipeline is \ncertainly one of the most well-known examples of energy infrastructure \nprojects being delayed and ultimately denied, but it is far from the \nonly one.\n  We have a Federal permitting process that is not designed to \nexpeditiously handle the many projects necessary to bring online the \nNation's growing energy output and to meet energy needs of homeowners \nand businesses. How can it be that in this century we can't get energy \nto consumers in some parts of the country? We need to fix that problem. \nThis bill does that.\n  H.R. 8 has several useful provisions to make the approval process \nmore timely for projects such as interstate natural gas pipelines, LNG \nexport facilities, and new hydropower, which we discussed during a \nhearing with the FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, just \ntoday. And I would add that these streamlining provisions were done so \nin a manner that keeps the environmental and safety protections intact.\n  Perhaps the biggest changes brought on by our energy abundance are \ngeopolitical. Where we once feared rising dependence on the likes of \nOPEC, now we can, in fact, control our energy destiny and use our new \nstanding as an energy superpower to help our allies and friends around \nthe world and engage in energy diplomacy. However, this is a new role \nfor the U.S., and we don't have in place the means to act globally on \nenergy policy yet. This bill changes that.\n  Using the Department of Energy's Quadrennial Energy Review as a \nguide, this bill begins the process of incorporating energy security \nand diplomacy considerations into the decisionmaking process. It also \ncreates forums through which we can coordinate with our North American \nneighbors, as well as our allies and trading partners around the world, \non energy policy.\n  Unfortunately, the energy news over the last decade hasn't been all \nthat good. Cyber threats and electromagnetic pulses pose a growing and \nmore sophisticated risk to the Nation's electricity system. We need new \nmeasures to better address these and other threats to the grid, and \nthis bill, H.R. 8, has a number of important provisions.\n  I would add that while our energy abundance is a real blessing, it \ndoes not in any way reduce the importance of energy efficiency. H.R. 8 \nagain includes a number of updates to energy efficiency policy, \nincluding measures to help the Federal Government use energy more \nwisely, as well as improvements to existing energy efficiency programs \nthat have proven problematic.\n  A decade ago, no one, no one here, could have imagined where we would \nbe in 2015 and how much the energy script would be flipped in our \nfavor. It is a new day, but now that we are here, it is time to bring \nour energy policy in line with those new realities. It is time that we \nput the scarcity mindset in the rearview mirror and say yes to energy \nand yes to jobs.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Natural Resources,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2015.\n     Hon.

I appreciate your willingness to forego action \n     on the bill in order to expedite this bill for floor \n     consideration.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, when Chairman Upton and I first talked about energy \nlegislation, I was encouraged that we would be working together to \ndevelop a consensus, bipartisan bill. In the tradition of the Committee \non Energy and Commerce, that is what we started to do, spending months \nnegotiating over language and finally reporting a bill from \nsubcommittee on a voice vote in July. That bill was modest but \nbipartisan and was the result of good faith cooperation.\n  Unfortunately, that effort fell apart. H.R. 8 is not a bipartisan \nconsensus bill. Instead, the House is taking up a backward-looking \npiece of energy legislation at a time when we need to move forward. \nH.R. 8 undermines the progress we have made in deploying the \nsustainable clean energy economy of the future.\n  Although the title for H.R. 8 suggests we are authorizing \nimprovements in energy infrastructure, the bill provides no funding or \ninitiatives to address some of the significant energy infrastructure \nissues we are facing.\n  Meanwhile, the bill has only gotten worse since it left the \ncommittee. It\n\n[[Page H8842]]\n\nwas in Upton's manager's amendment that strips out the few good \nprovisions that remained from the committee markup. This so-called \nenergy bill now does nothing for solar, wind, or any other clean energy \ntechnology.\n  On top of that, the Republicans deleted a whole title of the bill \nwritten primarily by the subcommittee ranking member, Bobby Rush, the \n21st Century Workforce Initiative. That title created a new program at \nDOE to help minorities, women, and veterans find work and build careers \nin the energy industry. This was something that Republicans praised \nthroughout the committee process. In fact, the Energy Subcommittee \nchairman even praised the title last night during testimony before the \nRules Committee. Yet, Mr. Chairman, the bill before us doesn't have \nthat provision.\n  What does that say about Republicans' so-called commitment to \nexpanding job opportunities in the energy sector for minorities, women, \nand those who served our country? Unfortunately, it says all too much, \nand none of it is good.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  H.R. 8 has one central theme binding its titles: an unerring devotion \nto the energy of the past. Provision after provision favors an energy \npolicy that is dominated by fossil fuels and unnecessary energy use. It \nis the Republican Party's 19th-century vision for the future of U.S. \nenergy policy in the 21st century.\n  Needless to say, the administration opposes this bill. If it reaches \nthe President's desk, it will be vetoed. I, too, oppose H.R. 8, and I \nurge my colleagues to reject this attempt to roll back progress in \nenergy efficiency and clean energy.\n  I have to say I don't usually pay much attention to comments that \ncome from the media, but I was actually asked a couple of minutes ago \nto comment on the fact that some of the Republicans have said that this \nbill is actually something they can take to the Paris conference and \ntalk about in a positive way. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The Paris conference is seeking to address climate change and is \nseeking to move us towards less reliance on greenhouse gases, less \nreliance on fossil fuels, and more on renewables. Nothing in this bill \naccomplishes that goal, and it is hard for me to believe that my \ncolleagues on the Republican side could even suggest that, somehow, \nthis is something that they would want to bring up or talk about at the \nParis conference.\n  Again, I can't say anything positive about this bill, and it is \nunfortunate that we have gotten to the point now at which there is no \neffort, really, to reach any of the Democrats' concerns.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Barton), the chairman emeritus of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Upton for yielding me the \ntime.\n  I want to commend him for his leadership on this initiative and for \ngetting it to the floor. This has been a long process, and the \ngentleman is to be commended for going through the regular order of the \nsubcommittee, of the full committee, and now to floor consideration.\n  I support H.R. 8, as reported out of committee and as amended in the \nmanager's amendment that the gentleman presented to the Rules \nCommittee.\n  I have requested--and I think it will be made in order--an amendment \nto that bill to include a provision that we passed as a stand-alone \nbill several months ago, H.R. 702, which would repeal the current ban \non crude oil exports.\n  My amendment, if made in order by the Rules Committee--and I hope \nthat it will be--takes what the floor passed with amendments--and we \nhad a number of Republican and Democrat amendments that were added \ndealing with terrorism, national security, and things of this sort. I \nam asking that the Rules Committee make in order H.R. 702, as amended, \nand put it on the floor tomorrow as an amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, in the United States, we currently produce a little \nover 9 million barrels of oil per day. That makes us number 3 in the \nworld in terms of daily crude oil production, but we are not allowed to \nexport any of that crude oil. We can export refined products and we do \nexport up to 3 or 4 million barrels per day of refined products, but we \ncannot export crude oil.\n  If my amendment is accepted by the Rules Committee, made in order, \nvoted on in a positive way by the House, sent to the Senate, and the \nSenate passes H.R. 8, and it is signed by the President, we could then \nbegin to export our crude oil.\n  We have the capability to easily produce 15 million barrels a day, \nand some experts say we could go up to 20. That would be a strategic \nasset vis-a-vis OPEC, vis-a-vis ISIS, vis-a-vis the Russians, in that \nwe could use our oil in the international oil markets.\n  It would help our economy, would literally create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs, and would, surprisingly, minimize or lower gasoline \nprices here in the United States because more U.S. oil in the world \nmarket would lower the world price, which would lower gasoline prices \nat the pump.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your support. I ask that the Rules \nCommittee make my bipartisan amendment in order, which is cosponsored \nby Mr. Cuellar, Mr. Conaway, Mr. Flores, and Mr. McCaul, and that we \nadd it to your excellent bill on the floor tomorrow.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is strong--certainly bipartisan--consensus that \nwe need to update and modernize our energy infrastructure. \nUnfortunately, this bill fails to make meaningful advances in this \narena.\n  It does not advance clean energy. The ``energy efficiency'' title \nwould actually be a setback in reducing consumption and carbon \nemissions, and climate change is not addressed at all. Whenever \npossible, this legislation favors suppliers over consumers, consumption \nover efficiency, and the fossil fuels over renewable energy.\n  Most disappointingly, this bill could have been bipartisan. The \nSenate's energy bill, while far from perfect, at least acknowledges \nthat we need to invest real dollars into upgrading our Nation's energy \nsystems.\n  This bill has no shortage of flaws. I have offered two amendments to \naddress some of these shortcomings. The first would reauthorize the \nWeatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program. These \nare two existing programs that have operated successfully for years.\n  The Weatherization Assistance Program supports State-based programs \nto improve the energy efficiency of the homes of low-income families. \nThe Department of Energy provides grants to the States to deliver these \nservices through local weatherization agencies.\n  The Weatherization Assistance Program helps those in our communities \nwho do not have the financial resources to make energy efficiency \ninvestments on their own: the elderly, the disabled, and other low-\nincome families amongst them who are struggling to make ends meet.\n  The second amendment would strike section 1101, an unnecessary change \nto FERC's natural gas pipeline approval process. Nothing has been done \nto cast FERC's role as the lead agency for siting gas pipelines in \ndoubt, but the majority has used this pretense to make it easier for \npipeline companies to have projects approved without extensive public \nconsultation, requiring FERC to make a decision within 90 days \nregardless of the complexity of the application.\n  It would also allow for remote surveying instead of on-site \ninspections. This would allow companies to circumvent property owners' \nrights when surveying land. My amendment would strike this section to \nensure Federal and State regulators have the time necessary to review \nany and all applications, but these issues are far from my only \nconcerns with this bill.\n  Energy efficiency has a long history of bipartisanship, but, sadly, \nthis has not continued in this bill.\n  According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, \nthis bill would actually net cost consumers and cause additional \nemissions.\n  Furthermore, the DOE is prevented from providing assistance if it \nfinds\n\n[[Page H8843]]\n\nthat a proposed code does not meet a payback period of 10 years or \nless. That is a return on investment that does not jibe with reality \nwhere 30-year mortgages are often the norm.\n\n  The bill repeals a section of the Energy Independence and Security \nAct which has been used to improve the efficiency of new Federal \nbuildings.\n  There was an extensive hydropower section included during the full \ncommittee markup that was not subject to a hearing despite \nsignificantly changing the FERC licensing process.\n  It does nothing to address the public health and safety hazards \ncreated by old, leaky natural gas pipelines.\n  It does nothing to assist States' efforts to upgrade and modernize \ntheir electric grids.\n  It is silent on the infrastructure maintenance issues associated with \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve that the administration identified in \nthe Quadrennial Energy Review.\n  It has totally failed to recognize the growth in distributed \nrenewable energy, such as wind and solar, and it should come as no \nsurprise that this bill ignores the impact of climate change, which \nremains a major threat to our energy security, our economy, and human \nhealth.\n  These are just a handful of the serious issues with this bill.\n  I believe all of us started with the intention of continuing the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee's long tradition of working on \ncomprehensive energy legislation in a bipartisan fashion, but this bill \nis a far cry from the discussion drafts we actually held hearings on \nearlier this year. I understand we may not agree on everything, but \nthis legislation fails to capitalize on those areas of agreement in any \nmeaningful way.\n  This bill's focus is on the past, not on the future. It fails to make \nthe necessary investments in our energy infrastructure to improve \nsafety, public health, and reliability.\n  It rolls back efforts to improve energy efficiency, does nothing to \nencourage the expansion of renewable energy, and ignores climate \nchange, as I indicated, altogether. It promotes a future that is \neconomically and environmentally unsustainable.\n  I then urge my colleagues to reject this bill. We need to go back to \nthe drawing board and craft a bill that actually makes investments and \nlooks forward to America's energy future.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, the United States has become a leader in the area of \nenergy production. But if we are going to maintain that leadership and \nbe a true support for our allies, it requires certain actions that \nChairman Upton and his committee have recognized and have presented to \nus in this North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act.\n  This bill actually contains two provisions that were bipartisan \nprovisions that passed in my Natural Resources Committee, both of which \nwill ensure that the flow of energy to our Nation will be facilitated \nand will continue on in the future.\n  One, by Mr. MacArthur of New Jersey, illustrates the archaic \nprovisions that will never be used to prohibit and use Federal land as \na hindrance to pipeline production even if those pipelines are \nunderground and if they are already in established corridors for energy \nproduction, especially those going into the northeast of this country. \nIt is an extremely important position and point of view.\n  Mr. Zinke of Montana and Mr. Schrader of Oregon also have a \nbipartisan bill that deals with the Electricity Reliability and Forest \nProtection Act, which would minimize the potential of wildfire risk in \nthe over 100,000 miles of power lines we have going through national \nforest and Bureau of Land Management properties.\n  The provisions would require the agencies to actually work to come up \nwith constructive policies and to make timely decisions so that the \nutilities have the ability to take out hazardous elements, like trees, \nand so that ratepayers are not going to be on the hook for the \nliability of a freak forest fire that would come because of Federal \ninaction.\n  American energy production has literally changed in less than a \ndecade. There is no reason Federal lands should blockade any kind of \npragmatic approach from having these resources moved from the places \nthey are developed to where people can actually benefit from them.\n  This bill helps people, and it will move our country forward. I \nappreciate Chairman Upton's and his committee's leadership. This is an \nessential one if we are actually going to forge a better future for the \nUnited States. I am proud to be down here to support it, and I \nappreciate adding these two important, bipartisan provisions as part of \nthe overall package.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McNerney).\n  Mr. McNERNEY. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is well past time that Congress update our national \nenergy policy with a framework that includes clean energy technologies, \nreduces fossil fuel consumption, boosts energy efficiency in \nresidential, commercial, and Federal buildings, and provides the \nfunding necessary to advance our workforce and technological \ninnovation, but, unfortunately, H.R. 8 does not meet these goals.\n  I do want to thank Chairman Upton for working with me on several \nprovisions that are intended to improve responses to physical and \ncyberattacks on the grid, that encourage the development and use of \nwater and energy-efficient technology, that streamline hydropower \npermitting, and that generally improve the modernization of our \nelectric grid.\n  Unfortunately, the funding was removed for the electric grid grant \nprogram and for carbon capture sequestration, a provision promoting the \nnext generation energy workforce is gone, and language that weakens \nenergy efficiency in buildings has not been fixed.\n  This is a big disappointment, Mr. Chairman, because throughout most \nof the process there was real bipartisan cooperation, but in the final \nstages, the majority fell into partisanship and changed the bill to \nsomething most Democrats can't support.\n  So it is with great disappointment that I oppose H.R. 8, and I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 8, \na bill that will help our Nation rise to meet growing energy demands \nand challenges.\n  Our energy policy is incompatible with the current state of domestic \nenergy supply and production. The United States is now the world's \nlargest energy producer, but our energy infrastructure is woefully \ninadequate. We have the innovation and technology to safely expand the \nelectric grid and pipeline systems, but administrative red tape has \nseverely hindered these projects.\n  As long as natural gas, hydroelectric, and nuclear energy projects \ncontinue to languish for years in drawn-out Federal permitting \nprocesses, nobody can benefit from the cleaner and more affordable \nenergy these sources can provide.\n  Not only do we desperately need to expand our energy infrastructure \nto ensure reliable and affordable energy, but our national security \ndepends on secured energy sources and updated infrastructure to protect \nagainst real threats.\n  Cyber attacks on electric utility systems and electromagnetic pulses \nare no longer things you only see in movies. These threats are very \nreal and possible, and we need to be prepared. We need to improve \nenergy infrastructure security now, not later.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill so Americans can continue \nto have access to an affordable, reliable, and secure energy supply.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in adamant opposition \nto H.R. 8.\n  I don't have much time, so I can't go into all the terrible \nprovisions included in this legislation. To be clear, there are many.\n  I do want to address language that would give the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, or FERC, what\n\n[[Page H8844]]\n\namounts to fast-tracking power for pipeline approvals.\n  Setting arbitrary deadlines for the studies, research, and public \ncomment periods for dangerous and volatile pipeline projects, \nregardless of how complicated the proposal or how sensitive the land \nthese projects cuts through, doesn't give us what my colleagues across \nthe aisle call energy security.\n  What it will do is put private, public, and protected land, clean \nwater, and our environment at risk.\n  In my district, where we are already fighting just such a project, my \nconstituents will be the first to tell you just how preposterous a \nprovision of this nature is.\n  This bill deserves a resounding and unilateral ``no,'' and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in defeating it.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining on \nboth sides?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan has 18\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \nand the gentleman from New Jersey has 19 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak about the North American \nEnergy Security and Infrastructure Act.\n  With new technology and innovations, the energy industry is growing \nrapidly, and this important legislation works to maximize America's \nenergy potential.\n  The United States leads the world in energy production, but, sadly, \ndue to Washington's bureaucratic red tape, projects like updating our \npipelines and electric grid have fallen way behind.\n  This legislation will modernize our energy infrastructure, protect \nour electricity system, strengthen energy security and diplomacy, and \nimprove energy efficiency.\n  Bolstering our energy security and making our infrastructure more \nresilient will, in turn, strengthen our national security and our \neconomy. I support this important legislation because it is the next \nstep in becoming energy-independent. Now is the time to dramatically \nincrease our investment in homegrown American energy.\n  When I came to Congress, my top priority was growing the economy and \ncreating jobs. Mr. Chairman, this bill will do exactly that. It makes \nno sense to place restrictions on the abundance of energy potential in \nAmerica. The United States is an energy superpower, and it is time to \nstep up and lead.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this \nlegislation and, in particular, a section of the bill that would create \nan opening to cause irreparable damage to our national parks.\n  H.R. 8 would establish national energy security corridors to short \ncircuit the approval process for natural gas pipelines that cross our \nNation's public lands. In doing so, it eliminates longstanding \nprotections afforded to our national parks and other historically \nsignificant areas that were set aside for the very distinct purpose of \npreserving our Nation's cultural and natural heritage.\n  This legislation also blocks the public from providing any input on \nwhere these natural gas pipeline corridors should be located.\n  My home State of Massachusetts, like many areas around the country, \nfaces real energy challenges. In my district, a company is proposing to \nbuild a new 250-mile natural gas pipeline that crosses three States. I \nhave heard from hundreds of my constituents expressing their concerns \nwith the project, particularly with regard to its route.\n  Thanks to extensive public review and input, the pipeline route has \nalready been adjusted to minimize some of the environmental impacts, \nbut there are still many outstanding concerns that deserve careful \nscrutiny to be sure that the route does not adversely impact local \nfarmland, State forests, parks, wildlife management areas, and \nwetlands.\n  The significant amount of interest in this proposed pipeline reflects \nthe Commonwealth's longstanding history of preserving natural habitats \nand protecting open spaces for the public benefit, and we have invested \nenormous public resources toward these goals. This is also true of the \ninvestments that American taxpayers have made in our national parks.\n  By expediting approval of natural gas pipelines, H.R. 8 would \ndirectly erode the National Park Service's ability to meet its core \nmission of preserving and protecting our Nation's natural, cultural, \nand historic resources, unimpaired for the use and enjoyment of future \ngenerations.\n  I offered an amendment with my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) to \nremove this section from the bill. However, the majority blocked this \nsimple amendment from coming to the floor and receiving an up-or-down \nvote.\n  Our national parks belong to all Americans and have been famously \ncalled ``America's best idea.'' National parks protect, celebrate, and \ngive access to the many places that have shaped and defined who we are \nas a people and a country.\n  Members should have been given the opportunity to vote on whether or \nnot we should protect our national parks from natural gas pipelines.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. MacArthur).\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Chair, the North American Energy Security and \nInfrastructure Act does some important things to move us into the 21st \ncentury with our energy policy. It advances modernization, reliability, \nsecurity, and efficiency in our energy infrastructure.\n  I want to focus on one section of that bill, title 5, that ``national \nenergy security corridors'' portion. I originally proposed this as a \nseparate bill, and I am pleased to see it as part of this energy act. \nSimply put, it allows us to move natural gas from the western to the \neastern United States.\n  Let me give you an example of why this matters. A couple of weeks \nago, I visited Winteringham Village in Toms River in my district. It is \na village comprised almost entirely of seniors, and their average \nincome is slightly over $12,000 a year.\n  These people are not getting a cost-of-living increase under Social \nSecurity, but they most certainly are facing higher energy costs. The \nreason is simple. While other States, western States, enjoy lower \nenergy costs, States like mine are facing higher energy costs, and the \nreason is simple. We don't have the energy infrastructure to move gas \nfrom the West to the East.\n  Last winter, on one particular day, the cost of natural gas in New \nJersey was $22.35 for a million BTUs. It was $1.50 at the same time in \nPennsylvania, one State away from me.\n  The solution is this ``energy security corridors'' portion of the \nbill. It requires and empowers the Secretary of the Interior to \ndesignate 10 natural gas corridors across Federal lands.\n  Now, I just heard that it is across national parks. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. The Federal Government owns much land that is \nnot park land, and this would allow the Secretary of the Interior to \ndesignate corridors so we can properly plan our energy needs.\n  It does a few things for us. It lowers energy costs. It protects the \nmost vulnerable of our citizens. It would require thoughtful planning \nof where to put pipelines. It would be subject to a full environmental \nreview under NEPA.\n  It would create jobs. The President of the North American Building \nTrades Union testified at our hearing that it would not only create \njobs in building these corridors, but it would create jobs because of \nlower energy costs. Lastly, it would increase our security because \nenergy security and national security are inextricably linked.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to have this portion of the bill included, \nthe ``national energy security corridors'' portion. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this entire bill and move our energy policy into \nthe 21st century.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I was disappointed to see the Rules \nCommittee decided to add H.R. 2295, the National Energy Security \nCorridors Act, to H.R. 8.\n  There is no doubt that getting natural gas to where it is needed and \nto lowering electric and heating bills are\n\n[[Page H8845]]\n\nworthy accomplishments, but we shouldn't accomplish these by \nsteamrolling the concerns of residents who would see new pipelines \nbuilt in their backyards.\n  Right now, there are multiple proposals to run natural gas pipelines \nfrom West Virginia through the Commonwealth of Virginia to the eastern \nseaboard. There is the Atlantic coast pipeline, the Mountain Valley \npipeline, and more being considered.\n  Understandably, people who live along the proposed route of these \npipelines are concerned. Once a pipeline route is approved by FERC, \nland can be taken by eminent domain. The companies involved, of course, \nwant to draw the straightest, cheapest route they can. The communities \nin the way of these routes face huge impacts, environmentally and \nfinancially. They deserve a say.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation provides absolutely no method for the \npublic to have their voice heard when it comes to the location of these \ncorridors. It completely waives the Natural Environmental Policy Act \nfor the corridor designation, shutting out the community's opportunity \nfor public input.\n  Local governments are only allowed to speak to the extent that they \ncan help identify the most commercially viable, cost-effective acreage. \nIndividual resident concerns or environmental factors don't even come \ninto play.\n  This is not a productive way forward. This doesn't simplify getting \nnatural gas to the people who need it. This is a way that will lead to \nmore opposition, more lawsuits, and an atmosphere of distrust and \nresentment\n  I have another concern. H.R. 8 now contains a provision which will \nallow pipelines to be permitted across national parks without \ncongressional approval. This is contrary to longstanding U.S. law. \nEvery time we put a pipeline across a park, Congress has been involved.\n  My many friends in the Appalachian Trail community and the national \nparks conservation community are deeply worried about Congress \nabrogating its responsibility to approve such pipeline crossings.\n  We can't ignore the people and the parks that will be impacted by \nthis bill. I encourage my colleagues to oppose H.R. 8.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This energy bill does nothing for solar, wind, or any other clean \nenergy technology. It does nothing for energy infrastructure either \nsince all funding in the bill was stripped by the GOP.\n  The bill contains an energy efficiency title that actually results in \nmore energy consumption.\n  The bill contains provisions that will drive up electricity prices in \nthe Northeast and mid-Atlantic by rigging the markets to prop up old \nand uneconomical coal and nuclear plants that are losing out in the \nmarket to cost-effective natural gas and renewables.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  It also has provisions to help gas pipeline companies and \nhydroelectric licenses that will roll over environmental laws--like the \nClean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the NEPA--and undermine \nthe rights of consumers, tribes, and States.\n  Of course, the version that will be on the floor will have a couple \nof bad additions from the Committee on Natural Resources, including the \nMacArthur ``pipeline through parks'' legislation that would make it \neasy to run pipelines through Yellowstone, Yosemite, and every other \nnational park.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a terrible bill that demonstrates that the \nRepublican Party is solely focused on the energy policies of the past \nand is committed to throwing up barriers to the development of a clean \nand sustainable energy future.\n  Every Democrat should join us and the Obama administration in \nopposing the bill's passage.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  My Committee on Energy and Commerce colleagues and I worked to create \nthis broad energy bill and modernize our policies.\n  A generation ago, policymakers were concerned with managing a \nscarcity of energy resources, but times have changed. We are in the \nmiddle of a resurgence of American energy manufacturing. We should \nmanage our surplus of energy resources with clear, straightforward \npolicies that maximize our energy potential.\n  This bill is a necessary legislative step to ensure our energy \ninfrastructure is robust and continues to create jobs in the years to \ncome. Modern energy challenges demand modern energy policies. We must \ncut outdated red tape and ensure the energy markets remain nimble and \nsecure.\n  With H.R. 8, America can continue to take advantage of recent \ntechnology advancements and encourage a growing market that yields jobs \nat home and more influence abroad. The world doesn't want to deal with \nunstable exporters, such as Russia or Iran, if they don't have to. We \nshould be the secure and reliable trading partner that they can trust \nand they do trust.\n  H.R. 8 strengthens international partnerships and reforms processes \nfor energy exports that will pay important dividends for generations to \ncome.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee, especially \nChairman Upton, for their work on this very important bill.\n  This bill will keep energy affordable and ensure reliable electricity \nfor consumers and families across the nation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying I'm pleased that this \nbill includes several measures I have championed, including bills I've \noffered relating to energy efficiency and electric vehicles. However, I \nhave to oppose this legislation because H.R. 8 fails to address climate \nchange. In fact, the bill includes several controversial provisions \nthat shift our nation's energy policy into reverse.\n  I'm very grateful to Chairman Upton and Subcommittee Chairman \nWhitfield for including my legislation, the Energy Efficient Government \nTechnology Act, in the base text of H.R. 8. This bipartisan, \nnoncontroversial bill which I introduced with Rep. Kinzinger, received \n375 votes on the House floor last year. This measure would save \ntaxpayers millions of dollars and would make the federal government a \nleader in reducing energy use at data centers which can be highly \ninefficient.\n  I also appreciate that two amendments I offered at the Energy and \nCommerce Committee markup of this bill were agreed to by voice vote and \nare included in the Manager's Amendment. The first would allow federal \nagencies to offer electric vehicle charging stations to guests and \nemployees, a practice that is not currently allowed. The second would \nadd transparency requirements to ensure that only critical \ninfrastructure information is protected from FOIA requests, and that \nthis designation is periodically reviewed to ensure this authority is \nnot abused. These provisions are incremental but important steps toward \npromoting innovation and deployment of clean and energy-saving \ntechnologies.\n  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the rest of H.R. 8. With \nhistoric international climate negotiations currently underway in \nParis, this so-called ``comprehensive'' energy bill does not include a \nsingle reference to climate change or promotion of renewable resources. \nThis represents the squandering of an opportunity to put in place a \n21st century energy policy for our country that promotes clean energy \nand reduces our dependence on the fossil fuel resources that cause \nclimate change.\n  H.R. 8 includes several controversial provisions that my colleagues \nand I opposed at Committee and that are also opposed by the \nAdministration. For example, the bill contains unnecessary provisions \nto short-circuit the review process for exports of liquefied natural \ngas (LNG). The current process, which requires the Department of Energy \nto ensure that all exports are in the public interest of the United \nStates, is working and already has us on track to be the largest LNG \nexporter in the world within a decade. H.R. 8 also includes provisions \nthat would require a short-sighted view of energy efficiency \ninvestments in building codes, and it would repeal the requirement that \nall new and remodeled federal buildings phase out fossil fuel use by \n2030. Lastly, the Manager's Amendment includes a highly controversial \nbill from the Natural Resources Committee that would limit public \nreview and direct more natural gas pipelines to be built on public \nlands, including National Parks.\n  Again, I appreciate the Chairman's willingness to accept my \nbipartisan additions to this bill, but I cannot support this \nlegislation and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The Clerk \nwill report the motion.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Kuster moves that the managers on the part of the House \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \n     on the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill, \n     H.R. 644 be instructed to agree to the provisions contained \n     in subtitle A of title VII of the Senate amendment relating \n     to currency manipulation.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 2 of rule XXII, the \ngentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) and the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Brady) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. KUSTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my motion that will instruct \nconferees to include in the conference report language to combat \ncurrency manipulation from the Senate-passed version of H.R. 644.\n  Currency manipulation by foreign governments is one of the greatest \nchallenges we face to creating the type of free and fair trade that \nwill benefit all Americans from top to bottom and help us create more \njobs right here at home.\n  I, like so many others, am highly focused on helping our domestic \nmanufacturers grow and create good, strong, middle class jobs. Since \ntaking office, I have made supporting job creation and economic \nopportunity my number one priority, and our State's manufacturers play \nan integral role in that conversation.\n  Unfortunately, U.S. manufacturers already face so many challenges \nthat make it more difficult to compete with foreign companies. From the \nlower cost of labor to limited environmental protections, our \nmanufacturers must compete with foreign policies that lead to an uneven \nplaying field.\n  Unfair currency manipulation makes that competition even more \ndifficult. Currency manipulation is when governments use monetary \npolicy to devalue their currency, which makes their exports cheaper and \nforeign imports more expensive.\n  The good news is that we have the most talented workers and the most \ninnovative companies in the world, and we can compete and win despite \nthese challenges.\n  For example, right in my district in New Hampshire, I visited dozens \nof new manufacturing companies that are harnessing cutting-edge \ntechnologies, like precision manufacturing and healthcare technology, \nto revitalize the industry and create modern, 21st century jobs for our \nworkers. We must support these American manufacturers by cracking down \non unfair advantages overseas that hinder their success.\n  This motion will help to level the playing field for manufacturers in \nNew Hampshire and across the country by directing the Department of \nCommerce to slap duties on goods that have unfairly benefited from \nundervalued currency. This is the only provision in either customs bill \nthat will effectively deter currency manipulation by our trading \npartners.\n  Working to address currency devaluation has long enjoyed bipartisan \nsupport. In 2010, the House overwhelmingly passed legislation \nrestricting currency manipulation by a vote of 348-79. Earlier this \nyear, the Senate version of this legislation passed 78-20, in large \npart because of the critical language restricting currency \nmanipulation.\n  However, the version of this legislation passed by the House does not \ninclude the bipartisan provision that so many agree is crucial for \nlimiting the ability of U.S. workers and businesses to compete more \nfairly with foreign companies and workers.\n  I strongly support fair and open trade that will spur job creation \nback here in the United States. When 95 percent of global consumers \nexist outside the United States, we have to find new markets for our \nmanufacturers and other producers to grow and create more jobs here at \nhome.\n  But when U.S. manufacturers are already disadvantaged by foreign \nproducts that are subsidized by their home currency, it is difficult \nfor them to compete both at home and abroad.\n  And the impacts of this unfair manipulation are real. The Peterson \nInstitute estimates that, over the past decade, at least 1 million and \nas many as 5 million jobs have been lost due to currency manipulation.\n  Additionally, an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute estimates \nthat by eliminating currency manipulation we can reduce our trade \ndeficit by as much as $500 billion, leading to a substantial increase \nin GDP growth and helping our American economy thrive.\n  Specifically, New Hampshire could expect to see roughly 13,000 new \njobs as a result of an effective policy against currency manipulation.\n  The status quo is simply not good enough for U.S. workers, and that \nis why I am offering this motion today.\n  Our workers are already competing with foreign companies that pay \ntheir employees a fraction of what U.S. workers make. We should do \nwhatever we can to help make it less difficult for U.S. companies to \ncompete globally. Adding this currency manipulation language to the \nbill before us today will give us the best chance to do that.\n  Please join me in supporting my motion in support of American \nmanufacturers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on the Motion to Instruct \nConferees on H.R. 644.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in opposition to the motion to instruct conferees.\n  There is no question currency manipulation is a real problem, and I \nand many other Republicans are committed to fighting it. The bill that \nwe are going to conference on includes strong currency provisions, \nthanks to the hard work of Representative Miller and members of the \nMichigan delegation.\n  In addition, earlier this year, we passed a trade promotion authority \nlegislation that, for the very first time, raised fighting manipulation \nto a primary negotiating objective and provides the administration more \ntools to tackle the practice.\n  However, if the United States begins unilaterally levying tariffs, \nour trading partners will no doubt do the same, leading to a very \ndangerous cycle. This would undermine the very purpose of trade \nagreements: to break down barriers and to open economic freedom. More \nimportantly, this would hurt American competitiveness and hurt our \njobs.\n  I am also concerned that pursuing a unilateral approach could cause \nthe United States to be a target for retaliation by countries like \nChina, harming our businesses and their employees, and risk putting the \nUnited States in violation of international obligations and out of WTO \ncompliance.\n  And the administration agrees.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Earlier this year, Secretary Lew sent a letter to Congress stating \nthat the administration would oppose legislation that would use the \ncountervailing duty process to address currency undervaluation because \nit would raise questions about consistency with our international \nobligations and that it would be counterproductive to our ongoing \nbilateral and multilateral engagement as well as to our efforts to\n\n[[Page H8847]]\n\npromote greater accountability on currency policies in the context of \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States has a unique responsibility as a world \nreserve currency. This type of measure puts our standing at risk.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this motion is the next step in fast-track \nconsideration of Asian trade agreements and perhaps other trade \nagreements.\n  The fast-trackers know that the only way they can sell this agreement \nto the American people is to rely on stealth as much as possible to \nhide the agreement, as they have, for as long as possible; and then, \neven at the present time, not to give full information about all \naspects of this agreement, such as the alleged $18,000 tax cuts being \nprovided foreigners, without indicating what tax cuts are available for \nAmericans or what the effect of these tax cuts might be. And now, \ntoday, under this new, more inclusive House that we have heard so much \nabout with the new Speaker, we are provided less than an hour's notice \nfor the fast-trackers to strike again.\n  In moving to go to conference on a bill to attempt to fix a defective \nfast-track proposal, they have done so under a procedure that cut off \nall debate. We were not permitted to say a word about the customs bill \nas a whole, and the only way that we are able to comment about what is \nhappening here at all is thanks to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire \nwho has offered a nonbinding motion about one of the many questionable \nprovisions in this customs bill. It is a very important provision \nconcerning currency manipulation that allows some foreign trading \npartners to use their currencies and adjust them to get what they \ncannot do through normal trade procedures and greatly disadvantage \nAmerican manufacturers and hurt American jobs.\n  I applaud the gentlewoman's consideration and offering of that \namendment. Even though it will not bind the conference committee, it is \na way for the House to speak out about that issue.\n  But this is not the only flaw that exists in the customs bill. \nIndeed, the first provision included in this customs bill as passed by \nthe House--ironically, brought up today, as countries with good will \nare struggling with the issue of how we address climate change in \nParis--instructs that no trade agreements can obligate the United \nStates with respect to global warming or climate change.\n  So the bill that is being sent to conference, as approved in the \nHouse, is designed to prevent our acting concerning climate change, \nwhich is the great threat--perhaps one of the major national security \nthreats, and certainly the greatest environmental threat of our time. \nWe can see the effects all around us when we are not surrounded by \nclimate change deniers, of which there are many in this House who \nrefuse to accept science and prefer mythology and ideology to science. \nHence, this provision in a bill in a trade negotiation that began \nconsidering ways to address climate change now has a prohibition \nagainst doing it.\n  A second problem--I am all for trade. I voted for trade or supported \ntrade with most of the countries that are in the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. One of those countries, however, believes in turning a \nblind eye to trading women, trading children, trading indentured \nworkers, and that country is Malaysia.\n  Until the last couple of months, Malaysia was in a category with \nNorth Korea and a handful of other countries as a country that was \ndoing the least and had the worst record when it comes to human \ntrafficking. So the United States Senate approved a provision to \naddress that concern with Malaysia. And when that provision was in the \nWays and Means Committee in markup, I specifically asked then-Chairman \nRyan to ensure that we had any human trafficking amendment language \nfrom the Senate committee in this customs bill or in his TPP bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. He told me in the course of that hearing that he would \noppose truly conforming the House bill with the Senate bill because \n``it would make it more difficult to negotiate TPP,'' this Asian trade \nagreement.\n  So we put the desire for trade over our principles. I think it is \npossible to have more trade and support a 21st century trade policy \nwithout sacrificing our values as Americans.\n  What has happened in the meantime is a reclassification of Malaysia, \nall designed to get the trade there without getting Malaysia to do what \nit should about human trafficking, which I think is really tragic.\n  Then there is the third issue addressed in this customs bill, and \nthat is the question of enforcement. Of course, when it comes to \nprotection of the environment, when it comes to standards so that we \nare not in a race to the bottom with our American workers versus \nforeign workers, say in Vietnam working for 60 cents an hour, this \nUnited States Trade Representative's office has been asleep at the \nwheel. That is the name of a great Texas swing band, but it is not a \nvery good policy when it comes to enforcing the law. Unfortunately, \nthese enforcement provisions which are part of this customs bill leave \nit to USTR to proceed as it has in the past.\n  I think, instead of going to conference, what we should be doing is \ngoing back to the drawing board in the committee, looking at the \nenforcement provisions, and asking why it is that, though it has had \nresponsibility to enforce environmental and labor guarantees, it has \nnot brought successful actions to accomplish either.\n  And specifically with regard to the environment, in addition to the \nclimate change provisions, one of the most troubling developments as \nfar as both climate and the environment is the question of logging in \nthe Amazon region and other sensitive areas. USTR was charged with \nseeking audits of that logging and seeing that we acted under \nagreements that were approved during the Bush administration. It has \nfailed to do so.\n  So, for one reason after another, going to conference is a mistake. I \napplaud the motion. I hope it is adopted, but it is tragic that we are \nmoving in this direction.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  People often ask: How do you end the gridlock in Washington? The \nanswer is found in the Constitution. The House of Representatives \npasses its best idea on how to solve a problem, the Senate does the \nsame, and then you go to a conference committee to try to find common \nground and to try to find solutions that advance the principles of both \nparties to try to solve big problems.\n  The motion we passed earlier tonight was to start that open and \ntransparent process of going to a conference committee and having \nrepresentatives of the House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats, \ncome together to try to work out these issues. The underlying bill \npassed the House and the Senate earlier this summer. There have been a \nlot of, I think, very healthy discussions between both Chambers and \nboth parties in how we find common ground.\n  So this motion is to instruct those conferees; but in truth, what we \nare seeking is that open, transparent, I think, constitutional process \nwhere we listen to the ideas of, for example, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Levin), a member of the Ways and Means Committee whom I \nrespect, where we listen to the ideas of Senate Republicans and \nDemocrats and we, again, try to find common ground on a couple of \nthings: one, how do we streamline the time and the cost and efficiency \nof America trading its goods as we work to sell America throughout the \nworld, working through issues that were raised in trade promotion \nauthority by both parties.\n  These are legitimate, sincere issues. We have got an opportunity at \nconference to discuss them. Then, hopefully, we will find common ground \nand bring that solution back to the House and to the Senate for final \napproval. This is simply what we are trying to do.\n  Again, this motion to instruct goes after an issue we all agree on: \ncurrency manipulation. The key is to do it the right way so that it \ndoesn't boomerang on America but actually gets to this\n\n[[Page H8848]]\n\nissue. We are going to have this discussion in the conference \ncommittee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Levin).\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and congratulations \non your motion to instruct.\n  First, let me just say, in terms of process, I do think it is \nimportant that, before there is a motion to go to conference, there be \nsome notification to the minority; because there have been discussions \nunderway about the customs bill for a long time, and no one on our \nside, including our leadership, was given any notice of the motion to \ngo to conference today. I think that is a mistake, and I hope it won't \nbe repeated. I say that in good faith and with some good cheer. It is a \nbad precedent, and I hope it won't be followed.\n  Let me just say a word about currency. We have been working on this \nfor years. We passed several bills through this House directly relating \nto currency, and it never became law. Instead, there has been \ninterminable talk about doing something. So, finally, there was placed \nin the Senate bill the proposal of Chuck Schumer. We have an almost \nsimilar bill in the House. What is happening here is, I think, that the \nHouse bill is going to eliminate the Schumer amendment.\n  So for all the talk on currency, we are essentially going to be back \nto where we were and have been for years. There are no teeth in the \namendment that was proposed by my colleague from Michigan (Mrs. \nMiller). There are no teeth in it. It is kind of all gums. The same is \ntrue of the other language in the Senate bill on currency, with all due \nrespect. It just doesn't face up to the issue.\n  We have proposed some ideas to try to add strength to what has been a \nweak structure, and essentially what happens now is, instead of further \ndiscussions, we are going to conference. I think it is now preordained \nthat the Schumer amendment will be eliminated. It will be left with \nessentially empty language in terms of real strength to it.\n  So I congratulate my very distinguished colleague from New Hampshire \nfor not only bringing this up, but for your eloquence. We lost millions \nof jobs because of currency manipulation by Japan in the nineties and \nby China thereafter. The estimate is 2, 3, 4 million jobs. What more \ndoes this institution want?\n  Let me just say a couple of words about two other provisions.\n  The House bill essentially added language to TPA that said that there \nmust be assurance that trade agreements do not require changes to U.S. \nlaw or obligate the United States with respect to global warming or \nclimate change.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  So here we are going to conference one of the days of the Paris \nconference, and we face the language in the House that eliminates any \nmeaningful opportunity in trade agreements to address climate change.\n  It may take me a little longer. I may have to ask for a minute, but I \nwant to say something about our previous action.\n  We put in May 10 provisions relating to Peru and the Amazon. Why? In \npart, because it was displacing people who were living there, but also \nbecause the Amazon conditions affect the climate throughout the \nAmericas.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. KUSTER. I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And if this language were in place when we did May 10, we \nwould not have been able to have that provision that is part of \nAmerican law proudly. So we are headed in the wrong direction.\n  Let me just say a last word about human trafficking. The State \nDepartment reports on human trafficking in Malaysia are very clear. The \nink could not be darker. That is that there has been massive human \ntrafficking and, essentially, what the House language did was to weaken \nthe proposal of Senator Menendez.\n  Then the State Department, I think, essentially did not face up to \nthe realities within their own reports and moved Malaysia from tier 3 \nto tier 2 so that they could continue to be part of the negotiations.\n  I don't see how people can look in the mirror and not say to \nthemselves that we have to take into account human trafficking.\n  So I finish with this. There are some positive provisions within the \nCustoms bill, but there are also these very difficult and I think, in \nsome respects, dangerous, in the case of currency, worse-than-innocuous \nprovisions because, in currency, it retreats from the little step of \nmeaning that we were going to take.\n  So I congratulate the gentlewoman who is such a noble warrior on so \nmany issues for bringing up this motion to instruct, and I urge strong \nsupport.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, Customs bills in the past have been \npositive. They have been useful in trade enforcement packages.\n  However, the majority in this body has baked into this legislation \nharmful provisions that make the fast-track law even worse.\n  It fails to protect Dodd-Frank and financial regulations, consumer \nsafeguards. It stops our trade agreements from doing anything to \naddress immigration. It strips out provisions tackling currency \nmanipulation, an abuse that is costing millions of Americans their \njobs.\n  Don't take my word for it. Listen to the Peterson Institute. Listen \nto what they have to say, no left-leaning organization. It says that, \nas a result of currency manipulation, the United States has lost up to \n5 million jobs.\n  Why would we go down this road again? Why wouldn't we make currency \nmanipulation prohibitive, instead of using language that is not even in \nthe bill, but in a forum that they have put together around the TPP \nthat says that countries should refrain from currency manipulation, \nthey should avoid currency manipulation?\n  Avoid? Refrain? What kind of tough enforcement language is that? It \nis not.\n  What do countries do when they manipulate their currency? They drop \nthe cost of their currency. Their goods become cheaper. Our goods are \nmore expensive. We don't sell them abroad.\n  You know what happened in Mexico with NAFTA. They talked about all \nthe beautiful provisions, all the tariffs dropping, et cetera. When \nthey devalued the peso, it was all gone.\n  This is without strong, tough--and it won't be strong and tough \nbecause of the Senate language. But this is a good faith effort to deal \nwith currency.\n  But, in fact, the lack of currency enforcement here is going to cause \nruination in terms of American jobs and it is going to lower their \nwages. And already Malaysia has devalued its currency, as has Vietnam.\n  This agreement bans the United States from making commitments on \nclimate change in trade agreements. My colleagues have spoken about \nthis, provisions that are necessary to ensure that our trade policy \ndoes not negate our climate goals.\n  You have got--what is it?--I don't know--200 countries assembled in \nParis to look at how we bring some sanity to climate control and what \nwe do. We have the President there. These efforts are more important \nnow than ever, and we will be able to do nothing about dealing with the \nissue of climate.\n  This is a massive step backward for the already weak environmental \nobligation in our trade agreements. This bill contains no funding \nsupport for the enforcement and monitoring of our trade agreements. \nLack of enforcement has plagued our trade deals for decades.\n  Despite environmental rules in the U.S.-Peru free trade agreement, \nthe overwhelming majority of timber from Peru is illegally logged. \nDespite the labor rules in the Colombia free trade agreement, over 118 \nColombian trade unionists have been murdered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Babin). The time of the gentlewoman has \nexpired.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Within the last week, Vietnam, one of the partners in \nthis agreement, arrested labor activists. 118 Colombian trade unionists \nwere murdered. Vietnam will not allow organized labor, and in the \nagreement they\n\n[[Page H8849]]\n\nget a free pass for 5 years while our jobs are just being drained away.\n  Now the Congress is reviewing the TPP, the largest free trade \nagreement of its kind in history. It does include countries like \nVietnam and Malaysia, where labor and human rights abuses are rampant.\n  My colleagues have talked about Malaysia and trafficking and forced \nlabor. Where are the values of this Nation when we can take Malaysia \nthat traffics in young girls and say that they have gotten better and \nthey go from a tier 3 country to a tier 2 country just so that they can \nbe part of this agreement?\n  Where are the values of the United States of America? They are not \npresent here. We can't afford more free trade agreements without \nadequate enforcement.\n  Worst of all, this bill weakens protection in so many areas. We are \ndealing, as I said, in trafficking. It is modern slavery. That is what \nthat is all about.\n  Democrats have been clamoring for years and years for our government \nto include enforceable labor standards and enforceable environmental \nprovisions, and it has fallen on deaf ears.\n  This motion to instruct--and I say to my colleague thank you for \ndoing this--should pass. It will pass tonight or tomorrow, but it \nreally should not go to conference. There are so many flaws in the \nunderlying bill and in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement as well, \nand this should not go to conference.\n  In fact, put a gloss on a piece of legislation that is one of the \nworst pieces of legislation that has hit this floor of the United \nStates House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I am prepared to close if the gentlewoman from New \nHampshire is prepared to do so as well.\n  The value of a country's currency is a complex issue. It is \ndetermined by a number of factors: how much a country saves, how much \nit invests, the strength of its economy, its trade flows in and out. It \nis a complex issue.\n  Where Republicans and Democrats and the White House find common \nground is the desire that countries don't manipulate their currency in \norder to give themselves an unfair trade advantage.\n  The difference is how best to go about it. And because it is a \ncomplex issue, there are some very good ideas on all parties' sides on \nhow best to do that.\n  This motion essentially says to forget those discussions and don't \nhave Republicans and Democrats from the House and Senate work together \nthrough this complex issue and find a common solution. This motion \nsimply says to forget all that. There is only one solution, and we \ninsist upon it. End the discussion.\n  I don't think that is the right way to go about it. I think, frankly, \nthere are real serious concerns not just from Republicans, but from the \nWhite House on insisting on this one solution.\n  I think our country is better served and those who want to stop \ncurrency manipulation are better served by bringing our best ideas \ntogether in this conference committee.\n  That is what I am determined to do. That is what the American public \nwants us to do, an open, transparent, regular process that brings about \nthe very best solution for America.\n  That is why I urge a ``no'' vote on this motion to instruct.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to say to my colleague, the gentleman from Texas, I think that \nwe do agree to part of this about the danger of currency manipulation \nand the millions of jobs that are lost here in our country.\n  That is why I rise this evening to offer this motion to instruct the \nconferees to include in the conference report language to combat \ncurrency manipulation from the Senate-passed version of this bill.\n  I also want to associate myself with the comments of my colleagues \nbecause these are bipartisan issues. I have worked with my colleagues \nacross the aisle on human trafficking, and I know that my colleagues \nshare my values and are appalled at the egregious efforts that have \ngone down in Malaysia to traffic in young girls.\n  These are not American values that are being expressed at this \nhistoric moment, as countries across the world gather in Paris to \nprotect our society, our whole humankind, from the ravages of climate \nchange.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to support my motion. I will be \nasking for a recorded vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to \ninstruct.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to instruct.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8849-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1915\n                   CLIMATE CHANGE DEBATE NOT SETTLED\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, recently, President Obama declared climate \nchange to be the number one adversary of the United States.\n  He has proposed wide-ranging regulations to fight this supposed \nenemy, regulations that not only drastically increase the scope of \ngovernment but could only irreparably damage our economy. Today, we \nvoted to reject those policies.\n  While he concentrates on crony capitalism disguised as feel-good \npolicies, our true enemy has grown in strength and struck one of our \noldest allies. We know this enemy: a radical form of Islam that has \nsworn to destroy Western civilization, that abuses and enslaves women, \nthat seeks victory through suicide attacks and terrorizing civilians.\n  From manufacturing fake data to fit computer temperature models, to \nmanipulated actual temperatures being rounded up to fit the narrative, \nand the resistance by government entities to reveal their methodology \nand internal biases show that, indeed, the debate on climate change is \nfar from settled.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for the President to wake up, recognize that \nno nation should willingly choose to damage its own economy, as he \nproposes. It is time he recognized the United States' responsibility to \nthe free world and end the self-destructive cycle that his policies \nwould initiate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8849-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8849-H8853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, just to follow up on the eloquent 1-minute \nspeech by my friend, Doug LaMalfa, that it is extraordinary to think \nthat the President of the United States--some say he is the leader of \nthe free world--would actually say publicly and, even worse, at a \nconference of world leaders that, in effect, the worst blow we could \nhit ISIS with is for the leaders to come together on climate change?\n  It is hard to believe the leader of the free world would make such a \nstatement. Maybe it was just something that was given to him to read \nand he read, maybe it was in a teleprompter, or maybe he didn't have \ntime to think about what he was saying. Because I have talked to too \nmany people in all parts of the world who have dealt directly with \nradical Islamist terrorists, and they make clear that radical Islamist \nterrorists know nothing and respect nothing but power. Incredible. Just \nincredible.\n  Growing up, it would have been akin to bullies beating up and taking \nfrom smaller students on the playground and the teacher gathering all \nthe students and other teachers together and saying, ``I am going to \nteach the bullies a lesson by just ignoring them and\n\n[[Page H8850]]\n\nreading you a lovely story from our library.'' Who wouldn't understand \nthat the next day the bullies would be beating people up again and \nrobbing again? It is incredible.\n  Such insanity followed a terrible event, a shooting in Colorado \nSprings. As a judge, a former judge, a former prosecutor, the man that \ndid this needs to be punished. It is wrong, and no one should use any \nexcuse to go in and shoot other people, whether it is an Islamic \nterrorist or whether it is a deranged, mentally unstable person \nthinking they have some kind of score to even with people they don't \neven know, shooting people about whom they know nothing.\n  This story from November 30, Fox News, about the three people killed \nin Colorado, FoxNews.com:\n  ``The two civilians killed in Friday's shooting at a Colorado Planned \nParenthood clinic were identified by authorities and family members on \nSunday.\n  ``Jennifer Markovsky, 35, was accompanying a friend to the Colorado \nSprings Planned Parenthood clinic when she was killed in the shooting \nrampage, her father told The Denver Post.\n  ``John Ah-King said she grew up in Hawaii and met her husband, Paul, \nbefore the couple moved to Colorado when he was stationed here for the \nmilitary.\n  ``Ah-King told the Post from his home in Hawaii that Markovsky was a \nkind-hearted, lovable person with two children.\n  ``The second civilian killed was identified as Ke'Arre Stewart, 29, \nAmburh Butler, a lifelong friend and family spokeswoman told the \nAssociated Press.\n  ``Butler said that Stewart was accompanying someone to the clinic, \nand leaves behind two girls, 11 and 5, who live in Texas.\n  ``Stewart served in the Army's Fourth Infantry Division and was \ndeployed to Iraq, where Butler said he would often send her letters \ndescribing the horrors he saw on the front lines.\n  `` `He would tell me how terrible it was, how many guys he watched \ndie. It was terrible for him,' Butler told the Associated Press. The \nArmy stationed Stewart at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs in 2013 \nbefore he was discharged from the military the following year. `He went \nsomeplace where people expect to die, only to come back . . . and be \nkilled.' ''\n  She also said, ``He was just a standup guy, he would take a bullet \nfor you. He was the most sincere person I'd ever met.''\n  ``Markovsky and Stewart's identities were confirmed by officials, who \nsaid a full identification would be provided once autopsies were \ncompleted Monday.\n  ``The third victim was Garrett Swasey, who worked as a police officer \nat the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, and was called to \nassist with an active shooter at the nearby clinic.\n  ``Swasey was married with two children and a co-pastor at Hope \nChapel, where he was remembered Sunday by parishioners who watched a \nvideo of him ice skating.\n  `` `We are learning that eyewitnesses confirm that the man who will \nbe charged with the tragic and senseless shooting that resulted in the \ndeaths of three people and injuries to nine others at Planned \nParenthood's health center in Colorado Springs was motivated by \nopposition to safe and legal abortion,' Planned Parenthood Rocky \nMountain CEO Vicki Cowart said.''\n  Well, that is from Vicki Cowart. That does not appear to be official. \nAnd it always seems if it works better--for example, I would hope that \nthe President has learned by now that he shouldn't give opinions about \nshootings until he knows more about them. Don't condemn a policeman \nwhen it turns out the policeman was entirely justified because, by \ndoing so, you help stir up and divide this Nation that needs to come \ntogether.\n\n  So there are so many questions. When I was a prosecutor, when I was a \njudge, I wanted to know motive. I wanted to know what caused people to \ndo what they did.\n  We know why Islamic terrorists do what they do. They think that that \nis contributing to the caliphate. If they happen to die, just as Thomas \nJefferson was told--it was reported that Jefferson asked why the \nBarbary pirates kept attacking American ships when they weren't a \nthreat to that Muslim area. He was reportedly told, ``We believe we go \nto paradise if we are killed while we are fighting infidels like you.''\n  So we know what motivates most Islamic terrorists. Either they think \nthey are going to go to paradise--what a surprise they are going to \nget--or they think they are contributing to bringing the world under a \ntotalitarian domination by one theocrat, like the Ayatollah Khamenei or \nal-Baghdadi, who is head of ISIS.\n  So, with that tragedy just in our rearview mirror, unfortunately, \nonce again, the President, in front of a massive group, spoke without \nthinking about what he was saying.\n  I don't know whether it was on a teleprompter again and he just \nhadn't thought about what he was reading to the public, maybe somebody \nput something in front of him, or maybe he was talking off the cuff and \nhadn't really thought about what he was saying.\n  But this article from Alex Griswold, dated today, says, ``While \ngiving a press conference in Paris, President Barack Obama told \nreporters that the mass shootings that plague the United States just \nnever happen in other countries. `With respect to Planned Parenthood, \nobviously, my heart goes out to the families of those impacted,' Obama \nsaid in response to a reporter's question. `I mean, I say this every \ntime we've got one of these mass shootings; this just doesn't happen in \nother countries.' ''\n  He is in Paris, France, where they have just buried one of the 130 \npeople, mostly from mass shootings. I mean, they probably just finished \nthe funeral services for the victims of the Islamic terrorists, and the \nPresident says in front of the world so insensitively that these \nshootings, like the three people in Colorado Springs, never happens in \nany other countries, as he is standing in a country where it just had \n130 people killed, mainly in mass shootings.\n  In fact, the article says that ``the majority of the 130 deaths were \nin mass shooting attacks, where the ISIS-affiliated terrorists attacked \npublic places with automatic rifles. Nearly one hundred people alone \nwere killed in just one mass shooting at the Bataclan Theater.''\n  ``Earlier this year, Paris was also the victim of a terrorist attack \ntargeting the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The Al Qaeda-affiliated \nterrorists wielded assault rifles, killing 11 innocent people.'' That \nwas in Paris.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Now, I do realize this article says the 11 people with Charlie Hebdo, \nthe publisher of the magazine, that those 11 people, it says here, were \ninnocent. But, obviously, again, a leader of the United States, our \nSecretary of State, John Kerry, addressed on video for the world to see \nthis issue and basically was saying we can understand why the Charlie \nHebdo people were killed.\n  I mean, for goodness' sake, those people used the idea that they had \nthe freedom to speak any way they wanted to; and, apparently, radical \nIslamic terrorists were insulted, even though the President has said \nrepeatedly and John Kerry has said repeatedly and Hillary Clinton has \nsaid repeatedly, and continues to say, that these terrorist attacks by \nradical Islamic terrorists have nothing to do with Islam.\n  Well, that is a head-scratcher, because if the terrorist attacks on \nCharlie Hebdo had nothing to do with Islam, then why did John Kerry \nthink there may have been some justification for Islamic terrorists to \nkill these satirists, these magazine employees, because they said \nsomething offensive about Islam? If it wasn't about Islam, then why \nwere the terrorists killing these magazine employees because they said \nsomething about Islam? That is a head-scratcher.\n  And then when we look at what the media is saying about the Colorado \nSprings shooting and we look at what people in the mainstream media, \nwhether it is ``The View'' or other places, talk about, yeah, Hitler \nwas a Christian. No, he wasn't. And, yeah, McVeigh, was a Christian. \nWell, I am sure that would be a surprise to him. He seemed to brag late \nin life about being agnostic. Hitler certainly wasn't a Christian.\n  So if the President, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry are right that, \ngee, we need to worry as much about Christians--actually, our State \nDepartment\n\n[[Page H8851]]\n\nseems to think, in their reports, that we need to worry more about \nChristians than we do about Islamic terrorists, even though there is no \nindication that the Colorado Springs shooter was a Christian.\n  I can absolutely assure you, Mr. Speaker, no matter what he says his \nreligious affiliation is, he certainly was not a Christian, because he \ncertainly was not following the teachings of Christ. The Bible makes \nclear that we are known by our fruits, and if he has gone in and killed \nother people in this way, illegally, then he is certainly not following \nthe teachings of Christ. He is not part of the government. There is no \njustification. There has been no trial.\n  But it does also raise issues about the effects of the lawlessness of \nthis administration, having had whistleblowers come to me, law-abiding, \nmoral, ethical people you want to know. We have seen that the Justice \nDepartment will go after and destroy any honest, moral, ethical \nwhistleblower that may reflect poorly on the administration. We have \nseen reports of the acting inspector general at Homeland Security \nchanging IG reports. We get word that in the intelligence community \nreports have been changed from truth to something that would not make \nthe administration look bad, reports now coming out about, and \napparently former intelligence leader Flynn talking about this, how the \ntruth that was coming from intelligence in 2012 did not match up with \nthis administration's reelection campaign so they just changed the \nreports.\n  I mean, what effect does an administration lying and being lawless \nhave on what traditionally has been a majority law-abiding country? Can \nit create helplessness, a feeling, or a need that perhaps we need to \ntake the law into our own hands? I would tell anyone that is never \njustified. You do it through lawful means, through the government. Of \ncourse, Thomas Jefferson might say otherwise.\n  But what effect does it have when the law of the land, the Federal \nadministration governing, ruling over the country, required by the \nConstitution to follow the laws that have been passed by Congress and \nsigned by other Presidents, this President may not agree with and he \njust disregards the laws, say, on amnesty, disregards the laws about \ngoverning the EPA, so they just make up new regulations, and you just \ncreate 79,000 pages of new regulations as if you are a dictator in \nchief? I mean, if, hypothetically, that were happening, what effect \nwould it have on people who believed in having a law-abiding country \nwhen the administration over the country becomes so lawless? It seems \nsurely it would create a feeling of desperation.\n  What do you do? I have talked to whistleblowers who had that feeling. \nWhat do you do? I can't go to the Justice Department with the truth \nabout what is going on because they will prosecute me. They will \ndestroy my family. I will never be able to make a living again. I have \nseen what they do to whistleblowers who just want the administration to \nbe honest and follow the law. What do you do? Where do you go?\n  I would submit that the place you go is not to Russia to give away \nour utmost secrets because that is treason, but it is bound to be \nmitigating when an administration makes it so tough to just come \nforward and state the truth.\n  We found out that this administration had known about General \nPetraeus' affair for most of a year, but they waited until General \nPetraeus was in a position to destroy the election possibilities, \nreelection possibilities for President Obama, and they flowed out about \nthe affair they have known about for most of the year, and he is \ndestroyed. They prosecute him because apparently, as I understand it, \nhe provided a calendar to his biographer and searched as they might for \nanything that they could hang around his neck of being a lawless \nactivity. As I understand it, they found something in his calendar that \ncould have been said to be classified, so he agreed to plead to that.\n  And we find out yesterday there apparently have been 1,000, around \n1,000 Hillary Clinton emails so far that contain classified \ninformation. If Chuck Colson gets a year and a half for having \ninformation he is not supposed to, Petraeus' life, his livelihood, is \nruined because they are finally able to find something that might have \nbeen classified that he pleads guilty to having turned over to his \nbiographer. How long do you get for doing that a thousand times? I am \njust asking, Mr. Speaker.\n  But if, let's say, hypothetically, it were true what President Obama, \nJohn Kerry, and Hillary Clinton keep saying, that you should not say \nanything negative about the terrorists who claim to be Islamic and who \nsay, Praise be to Allah, ``Allahu Akbar,'' and then they kill innocent \npeople, you can't say anything that that is related to radical Islam \nbecause that only makes matters worse. Well, if they really believe \nthose things they have been saying, and if it were even true, and if \nHomeland Security is right that we need to worry about evangelical \nChristians or people that belong in the authority of the United States \nConstitution, then shouldn't the President, Hillary Clinton, and John \nKerry, be worried that they are going to stir up another crusade by \nbesmirching and maligning Christianity and Christians as routinely as \nthey do, saying these Christian terrorists are so bad or pointing out \nwe have got bad Christians, we have got the Crusades?\n  Well, if Christianity is as big a threat to commit violence as people \nwho say they are Islamic terrorists or jihadists, then I am just \nasking, Mr. Speaker, wouldn't that indicate that the President, Hillary \nClinton, and John Kerry are actually going to be responsible if a \nChristian goes and does something violent? I mean, using their own \nlogic, if they are out there running down Christians as a threat to \nviolence while saying you can't say anything negative about radical \nIslam and a Christian has done something wrong, well, if you are saying \nwe stir up radical Islamic terrorists by talking about them, then \nwouldn't you be responsible if you--generic indefinite ``you''--be \nresponsible for saying bad things about a Christian if a Christian then \ndoes something violent? I am just asking, applying the President's own \nlogic or lack thereof.\n\n  There is an article from 4 months ago by Kyle Becker that said, after \nthe tragic Charleston shooting that left nine Americans dead, President \nObama said the following: ``But let's be clear: At some point, we as a \ncountry will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass \nviolence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen \nin other places with this kind of frequency.''\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  The President said that 4 months or so ago, and he says it again now, \nwhile he is in Paris, where 130 people were just killed in a mass \nattack.\n  But this article was written 4 months ago, and it actually charts it. \nAnd it reads, ``Since most statistics on mass shootings in the world \ncompare apples and oranges by not correcting for population, let's get \na chart that makes sense, shall we?'' Between 2009 and 2013, the author \ngoes through and charts.\n  The loss of even one life should not be occurring. As someone who has \nlooked a defendant in the eye and has ordered him to be taken and held \nby the Texas Department of Criminal Justice until he is put to death \nand has signed the order requiring a multiple-murderer or a kidnapping \nmurderer-torturer be put to death, I know every life matters. Every \nlife matters. Every little baby who is cut up and sold for parts \nmatters.\n  How about the lawlessness of seeing the Planned Parenthood videos and \nnot only not be offended or finding those grotesque and inhumane but \nactually having the Department of Justice stand ready to be the \ncriminal defense firm for Planned Parenthood and stand by Planned \nParenthood in these alleged horribly egregious violations of humanity? \nWould that invoke helplessness? It shouldn't invoke anybody to \nviolence, but could it?\n  According to this article by Kyle Becker, between 2009 through 2013--\nthese are rampage shooting fatalities per 1 million people--Norway had \n15.3, Finland had 1.85, Slovakia had 1.47, Israel had 1.38, Switzerland \nhad .75, and the United States had .72.\n  Even one is too many, and the perpetrator should and must be \npunished. But if someone has committed crimes in Planned Parenthood, \nshouldn't we have an administration that believes in enforcing the laws \nand in at least doing\n\n[[Page H8852]]\n\na proper investigation on whether what was said in the videos were \ntrue, which certainly indicated orally that there were apparent crimes \ncommitted?\n  Since every life matters, every Black life matters, not just the \nBlack lives that are needlessly taken by a White person, but every \nBlack life matters no matter who takes the life.\n  This article from the Chicago Tribune reports, ``Holiday toll: 8 \nkilled, 20 wounded over Thanksgiving weekend.'' It seems rather \ncallous.\n  The article reads, ``Eight people were killed, including a 16-year-\nold boy, and at least 20 others were wounded in shootings over the \nThanksgiving weekend in Chicago, an increase over last year as the \nnumber of gunshot victims rose above 2,700 for the year.''\n  There were 2,700 gunshot victims in Chicago, when Chicago has such \nstrong gun control laws in place? How could that be? Is it possible \nthat having the toughest gun control laws, like Washington, D.C., has \nhad, doesn't stop violent murders?\n  In fact, is it possible that places that have the strictest gun \ncontrol have become murder capitals? It certainly appears so in Chicago \nand in Washington, D.C.\n  This article from the Chicago Tribune reads:\n  ``Mysean Dunnin, 16, was among the first victims of the long holiday \nweekend. He was shot in the head a few minutes before midnight just \nwest of Kedzie Avenue on Van Buren Street in East Garfield Park, about \na block from his home.\n  ``Police said two people walked up and fired at Dunnin. He was \npronounced dead at the scene.\n  ``Four other people were wounded between 3 p.m. Wednesday and 2:30 \na.m. Thursday.\n  ``Two men were killed and four others were wounded from 1:20 p.m. on \nThanksgiving Day to 3:15 a.m. Friday.\n  ``A 36-year-old man was killed and two people, including a 14-year-\nold boy, were wounded between Friday afternoon and early Saturday \nmorning.\n  ``The most violent stretch occurred Saturday into Sunday, when three \nmen were fatally shot and at least four other people were wounded.\n  ``Father of three, home for the holidays, dies in Back of the Yards \nshooting.\n  ``Between Sunday afternoon and early Monday, an eighth person was \nkilled and six other people were wounded.\n  ``The toll during last year's Thanksgiving weekend'' in Chicago ``was \n5 killed and 14 wounded. That included a fatal shooting inside the \nNordstrom's store on North Michigan Avenue.''\n  With the President's precious ideas on gun control that certainly his \nformer chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, would have in place in Chicago \nsince he has such power to effectuate the passage through the city \nleaders of ordinances for tough gun control, how could this be?\n  The number of homicides is 444. ``So far this year, there have been \nat least 2,740 shootings in Chicago, up more than 400 from the same \ntime last year. The number of homicides is 444, an increase of 42 from \nlast year.'' That is tragic.\n  An article by Charles C.W. Cooke on November 23, 2015, reads, \n``Anyone who would use terror as an excuse to subvert the Second \nAmendment should be tarred and feathered.'' A rather interesting \nposition.\n\n  An article from Charlie Spiering of 30 November 2015 reads, ``In his \ninaugural speech at the COP21 climate change summit in Paris, President \nObama acknowledged the terrorist attacks that occurred in the city \nearlier this month, but warned his fellow leaders not to be distracted \nfrom focusing on the looming threat of global warming.''\n  The President was quoted as saying, ``What greater rejection of those \nwho would tear down our world than marshaling our best efforts to save \nit.''\n  Ignoring the violent terrorism that the Islamic jihadists are \ninfecting upon the world and talking about climate change--and, \nobviously, I mean, most thinking people know it is called ``climate \nchange'' now because ``global warming'' hasn't really been supported \nfor many years now, and, certainly, it is not provable that it was \nmanmade.\n  I do believe in climate change. We have it four times a year in east \nTexas, where I live, so I know climate change is a fact. We know that \nthe weather normally works in cycles.\n  We had a witness before our Natural Resources Committee who knows a \ngreat deal about the climate, and I asked him, is it true that planet \nEarth had to have been warmer during the days of Leif Eriksson's \ncrossing the North Atlantic when the Norse came to Greenland? Is it \ntrue that planet Earth was warmer then? It turns out, according to his \ntestimony, the planet was much warmer then.\n  Now, we don't know what kind of fuel, what kind of carbon emissions \nthose Norse boats were putting into the atmosphere, but I guess you \nwould have to figure those Norse must have really been putting out some \npollution from those ships with the sails on them to have created a \nwarmer planet back then than we have now.\n  Apparently, they were growing crops in places on Greenland where you \ncan't anymore.\n  My friend Ben Shapiro has an article in the Daily Wire entitled, \n``Five Reasons Obama's Climate Change Agenda is Dangerous--'', and part \nof the words are blacked out after that.\n  One reason he has highlighted is because ``we have no idea to what \nextent the Earth is warming.'' And he sets out some data and facts \nthere, resources there or other.\n  Two, ``We have no clue how much human activity causes climate \nchange,'' and I would add ``if any.''\n  Of course, we call it ``climate change'' now because the data did not \nsupport the ``global warming'' that was being used in a fear-mongering \nfashion to scare people. By changing from ``global warming'' to \n``climate change,'' that would allow them to say in the seventies, as \nthey did, that we are at the beginning of a new ice age and then 30 \nyears later say that we are heading toward cataclysmic global warming \nthat will destroy all life on planet Earth.\n  Now, after the long pause in warming that seems to be inexplicable to \nscientists and after the release of private emails and information from \nthe University of East Anglia some years back, it indicated data was \nbeing manipulated so that it reflected things that weren't true about \nso-called global warming or climate change.\n  Ben Shapiro's third point: ``We have no idea how much climate change \nimpacts human life.'' It has discussions and references there.\n  Then, the fourth: ``We have no idea what level of de-development \nwould be necessary to maintain our current climate.''\n  The fifth: ``The solution--destroying carbon-based fuels and \ncapitalism--is the problem.'' He writes, ``The left is in an all-out \nwar with the two greatest forces for fighting poverty in history: \ncheap, carbon-based energy and capitalism.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  ``The same people celebrating the end of the Industrial Revolution \neconomic model seem to forget that that economic model, boosted by \ncarbon-based fuels, have led to a massive drop in global poverty; in \n1990, 1.9 billion people lived under $1.25 per day, as opposed to 836 \nmillion in 2015. That's because of the dominance of capitalism and the \nincreased efficiency of technology. It's certainly not because of \ngovernmental environmental regulations.\n  ``Some on the left seem eager to try out their theory that we can \nmaintain our current standard of living while hopping in a time machine \nback to less usage of carbon, without reference to market efficiencies. \nThis is foolishness. We have time machines; they're called airplanes. \nFolks on the left ought to fly to countries where people don't have \ncoal or oil or natural gas or free markets, and watch them burn cow \nchips for heat to see how lovely and natural that lifestyle actually \nis.\n  ``But President Obama has his goals. How many people will have to \nsuffer or die globally because of them isn't really the issue. After \nall, to question him would make us 'cynical,' he assures us. If \ncynicism means saving lives, then perhaps we all ought to be cynical of \nhis world-conquering, unscientific, redistributionist nonsense.''\n  Going back to February 7, 2015, an article from Christopher Booker \nfrom The Telegraph titled ``The fiddling with temperature data is the \nbiggest science scandal ever,'' he said: ``Two weeks ago, under the \nheadline `How we are being tricked by flawed data on\n\n[[Page H8853]]\n\nglobal warming,' I wrote about Paul Homewood, who, on his Notalotof\npeopleknowthat blog, had checked the published temperature graphs for \nthree weather stations in Paraguay against the temperatures that had \noriginally been recorded. In each instance, the actual trend of 60 \nyears of data had been dramatically reversed, so that a cooling trend \nwas changed to one that showed a marked warming.\n  ``This was only the latest of many examples of a practice long \nrecognised by expert observers around the world--one that raises an \never larger question mark over the entire official surface-temperature \nrecord.\n  ``Following my last article, Homewood checked a swathe of other South \nAmerican weather stations around the original three. In each case he \nfound the same suspicious one-way `adjustments.' First these were made \nby the U.S. government's Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN). They \nwere then amplified by two of the main official service records, the \nGoddard Institute for Space Studies (Giss) and the National Climate \nData Center (NCDC), which use the warming trends to estimate \ntemperatures across the vast regions of the Earth where no measurements \nare taken. Yet these are the very records on which scientists and \npoliticians rely for their belief in `global warming.'\n  ``Homewood has now turned his attention to the weather stations \nacross much of the Arctic, between Canada (51 degrees W) and the heart \nof Siberia (87 degrees E). Again, in nearly every case, the same one-\nway adjustments have been made, to show warming up to 1 degree C or \nmore higher than was indicated by the data that was actually recorded. \nThis has surprised no one more than Traust Jonsson, who was long in \ncharge of climate research for the Iceland met office (and with whom \nHomewood has been in touch). Jonsson was amazed to see how the new \nversion completely `disappears' Iceland's `sea ice years' around 1970, \nwhen a period of extreme cooling almost devastated his country's \neconomy.\n  ``One of the first examples of these `adjustments' was exposed in \n2007 by the statistician Steve McIntyre, when he discovered a paper \npublished in 1987 by James Hansen, the scientist (later turned \nfanatical climate activist) who for many years ran Giss''--or the \nGoddard Institute for Space Studies--``Hansen's original graph showed \ntemperatures in the Arctic as having been much higher around 1940 than \nat any time since. But as Homewood reveals in his blog post, \n`Temperature adjustments transform Arctic history.''\n  Wow, Mr. Speaker, I need to read that again. I had not seen that.\n  ``Hansen's original graph showed temperatures in the Arctic as having \nbeen much higher around 1940 than at any time since.''\n  ``Homewood's interest in the Arctic is partly because the `vanishing' \nof its polar ice (and the polar bears) has become such a poster-child \nfor those trying to persuade us that we are threatened by runaway \nwarming. But he chose that particular stretch of the Arctic because it \nis where ice is affected by warmer water brought in by cyclical shifts \nin a major Atlantic current--this last peaked at just the time 75 years \nago when Arctic ice retreated even further than it has done recently. \nThe ice-melt is not caused by rising global temperatures at all.\n  ``Of much more serious significance, however, is the way this \nwholesale manipulation of the official temperature record--for reasons \nGHCN and Giss have never plausibly explained--has become the real \nelephant in the room of the greatest and most costly scare the world \nhas known. This really does begin to look like one of the greatest \nscientific scandals of all time.''\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I am wondering if it might be possible that there is a \nmainstream media reporter out there--with the New York Times, \nWashington Post, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, one of those that have lost so \nmany of their viewers and readers--that might someday, against all of \nthe criticism like Galileo got and others received, pick up that mantle \nand do a true investigation from a mainstream media outlet, facing the \nbelittling and the criticism of all of the Chicken Littles that are in \nthe mainstream media currently and actually gather accurate data, show \nthe fraud, show the wasted money, show the lost lives, show the \nsuffering by running up the price of energy so high, and show just what \nChristopher Booker talks about as he finished his article. This really \ndoes begin to look like one of the greatest scientific scandals of all \ntime.\n  As the great philosopher Rush Limbaugh once said, ``Follow the \nmoney.'' Many others have said it. If you hear someone saying, ``Let's \nbring Syrian refugees in'' when we know there is no adequate data to be \nassured of who they are, where they are really from, follow the money. \nSee if they are part of those dividing up the 1 billion-plus dollars \nbeing paid to people to bring refugees into the United States.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, when this administration goes about driving up the \nprices of energy as it has, despite its best efforts, gasoline prices \ncame down. The last I saw, they had dropped their approval of \nproduction from Federal land to about 40 percent of grants that had \nbeen approved during the Bush administration's 8 years.\n  Less production is being authorized by this administration. They are \nsiccing the EPA now with these new regulations on the oil and gas \nindustry, which will ultimately--if they are successful and Congress \nisn't able to stop them as we should, the price of gasoline will \nskyrocket as the President said he wanted coal-produced power to \nskyrocket.\n  As one of my senior citizen constituents had told me--I think she \nsaid she was 80--she was born in a home that only had a wood-burning \nstove. Because of the way the cost of energy has gone up, she is \nworried that she may leave this world in a home that only has a wood-\nburning stove. The trouble for her is, if this administration has its \nway, she can't have a wood-burning stove even.\n  You see the cost of home energy going up as dramatically as this \nadministration has forced it and you realize that doesn't really hurt \nthe rich in America to have higher prices for energy. It does hurt \nbusiness. It absolutely does. It means they can't give raises because \nthey are spending that money on higher bills. So people are not keeping \nup with what they should.\n  Then we found out during this administration the unthinkable \noccurred, and the President even admitted it on camera. For the first \ntime in the history of this country ever, after this President's \npolicies had been fully implemented for 5 years, 95 percent of the \nNation's income went to the top 1 percent.\n  The President, who had talked so much about helping the middle class \nand helping the poor, has presided over policies that have made the \nrich--put them in a position where 95 percent of income is going to the \ntop 1 percent. It had never happened before this President's policies, \nwhich have made life difficult for people in America.\n  I mean not for the people that have all the cronyism, crony \ncapitalism, General Electric and all those friends of the President. I \nam talking about the distance between the rich and the poor has gotten \nfarther with fewer people in between. That is tragic.\n  So countries swarm to the global warming conferences. Just watch. \nFollow the money. They hope to leave with an agreement by the United \nStates that will punish American residents and cause them to have to \npay more taxes that will be paid to countries around the world.\n  Of course, they flock to these global warming climate change \nconferences because they think the President is going to do what he is \nhoping to do and start sending checks from the American taxpayers to \nall of these other countries, places where their policies have stifled \ngrowth or they don't have the energy we do. How about sending them some \nenergy? Send them some coal. They will be far better off.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me just remind that you don't have to \npay people to hate you. They will do it for free. We don't have to be \nsending that money overseas.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8853-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8853-H8858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  2015\n                          UKRAINE UNDER SIEGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n[[Page H8854]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as Western Europe strains with more than 1 \nmillion refugees fleeing war in the Middle East and enduring terrible \nconditions, I rise tonight to address another growing humanitarian \ncrisis in Eastern Europe, in Ukraine.\n  The free world has experienced time and again what happens when it \nfails to support innocents caught by fate under the brutal grip of war \nand oppression. Today that reality looms largely over Europe and surely \nover Ukraine, a nation of freedom-seeking people under siege \noutnumbered and outgunned due to Russia's invasion on Ukraine's eastern \nfront. So Europe in the western end as well as the eastern faces major \ndisplacement and humanitarian needs not seen since World War II.\n  Ukrainians are fighting to choose their own path, and surely America, \nwith our moral leadership, can find a way to help the beleaguered \npeople of Ukraine survive the siege and the onset of a bitter winter, \nwith climates that can be unforgiving, with temperatures falling as low \nor more than 25 degrees below zero.\n  To not attend to Ukraine now risks Ukraine accessing to the free \nworld. If one looks at the size of Ukraine in Europe, imagine if \nUkraine could access to be part of greater Europe. That is all held in \nabeyance now and also risks millions more potential refugees fleeing \nfrom Ukraine to Western Europe for sustenance and more.\n  I call on the Obama administration to address the growing \nhumanitarian crisis in Europe, not just on the western end, but on the \neastern end in Ukraine. This is a challenge that can be met. America \nhas done this before. The humanitarian need in Ukraine is immediate and \ngrowing.\n  I include in the Record evidence of this growing crisis by the major \nreligious leaders of Ukraine from all confessions, representing, \nimagine, nearly 90 percent of the faithful of Ukraine. These \ndenominations include Baptist, Pentecostals, Muslims, Reformed Church, \nthe Lutheran Church, Jewish religious organizations, Evangelicals, the \nAutocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Bible Society, \nthe Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, the \nSeventh-Day Adventists, the Christian Evangelical Church. It is a very, \nvery long list.\n  I am going to read this in the Record as well as place it in the \nRecord. This was sent to President Obama. A delegation, over this last \nmonth, from Ukraine, of its top religious leaders presented the Obama \nadministration with a request. Let me read it.\n  ``We, the undersigned of the All Ukrainian Council of Churches and \nreligious organizations and representing Ukraine's diverse religious \ncommunity, appeal to you on behalf of the people of Ukraine to help \naddress the humanitarian catastrophe, Mr. President, gripping our \ncountry. The needs are enormous, ranging from medical supplies to \neveryday items, such as food, water, and clothing.''\n  They don't even ask for new clothing. They are willing to take used \nshoes from the United States of America.\n  ``While the global news media regularly reports on Russia's war \nagainst Ukraine, government reforms and financial challenges, there is \nrarely any mention of the extraordinary dimensions of the human \nsuffering caused by Moscow's aggression. While Ukraine certainly needs \ngreater military, financial, and political assistance, our focus here, \nas religious leaders, must be on the humanitarian aspect.\n  ``As you know, according to the United Nations, over 5 million \npeople''--5 million--``including 1.7 million children, are in desperate \nneed of humanitarian assistance.''\n  I brought a chart to the floor that shows pictures of just a few of \nthese children.\n  ``8,000 people have died and over 17,000 have been injured and \nwounded. There are over 1,390,000 displaced people, including 174,000 \nchildren.''\n  Here is one child whose only dwelling has been in a bomb shelter \nsince the time of his birth.\n  ``The challenges of this human tragedy are overwhelming. Even the \nmost conservative estimates show that over 65 percent of projected \nneeds have yet to be met--even on the level of pledges.\n  ``As representatives of the interfaith community, we witness on a \ndaily basis the challenges and needs of people suffering because of \nthis war. And with the onset of winter, an already dire situation will \nonly get worse. We pray for their lives and for the future of our \ncountry.\n  ``While we are grateful for the assistance provided by the United \nStates Government to date, we know that the need is so much greater. \nThus, we appeal to you,'' President Obama, ``to increase assistance and \nto activate the full potential of the National Guard State Partnership \nProgram and the Partnership for Peace as instruments for alleviating \nthe humanitarian catastrophe. One of the stated goals of the \nPartnership for Peace is to `provide a framework for enhanced political \nand military cooperation for joint multilateral crisis management \nactivities, such as humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping.' Ukraine \nwas the first post-Soviet country to join the Partnership for Peace in \n1993.\n  ``In addition to the assistance provided by the US government, we, \nduring our travels throughout the United States, have come to \npersonally witness the great generosity of the American people \nexpressed through numerous spontaneous initiatives to ship medical and \nhumanitarian supplies to Ukraine.\n  ``Time is of the essence, Mr. President.''\n  They are begging.\n  ``The people of Ukraine need to know that they are not forgotten in \ntheir time for need. The instruments anticipated by the National Guard \nState Partnership and Partnership for Peace programs will allow the \nAmerican people to more effectively and rapidly access and deliver \nalready available medical and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine--\nliterally within days. We each represent distribution networks''--\nthrough their various religious confessions--``that cooperate with each \nother; we now ask for the resources to meet the growing human needs.\n  ``We pray that God grant you guidance, wisdom and bless you and the \ngreat American nation. God bless the United States and Ukraine. \nSincerely.''\n  And I place all their names in the Record.\n  The people of the world must meet this moral imperative. The United \nNations has reported that 2.6 million Ukrainians have been displaced by \nthe current conflict in eastern Ukraine--so unnecessary--because of \nRussia's invasion. A staggering 5 million Ukrainians currently need \nhumanitarian survival assistance.\n  I met with one religious leader who came to Washington. I said: What \nare you finding?\n  He said: Congresswoman, we are in Kharkiv. We need shoes, even used \nshoes, for the children.\n  Currently, less than half of those in need receive any assistance at \nall. If Russian aggression were to trigger a flight of these Ukrainians \nwestward, it would also add to the dangerous, destabilizing stress to \nEurope's already-stretched refugee services as a result of what is \nhappening with the immigration and refugee resettlement from the Middle \nEast.\n\n  The situation in Ukraine is far from contained. According to a recent \nreport by Refugees International, approximately 2 million Ukrainians \nlive close to the cease-fire lines separating Ukrainian and Russian-\nbacked forces.\n  It is hard to see some of these pictures that are on this chart, but \nwhat they basically show are bombed-out buildings, bridges that are \ncompletely destroyed, old women living in buildings where there are no \nroofs or windows in eastern Ukraine, children living in bomb shelters, \nand people just, unfortunately, killed because of Russian shelling.\n  A Ukrainian and Russian peace settlement likely will take a while, \nbut another 2 million people are living under control of Russian-backed \nforces. The basic needs of these civilians go unmet daily. Shockingly, \nmost international aid work has been suspended there, and there are \nhardly any news stories about this. Aid workers have been ejected from \nregions that are called Luhansk and Donetsk by the Russian-backed \nfighters.\n  Some refugees, torn from their villages and towns, have managed to \nstay in Ukraine and survive even after being driven from their homes by \nviolence. How they are doing this, I simply don't\n\n[[Page H8855]]\n\nknow. But these internally displaced are overwhelming the already \nlimited resources of Ukraine's local governments, which are already \nstretched thin by Russia's invasion. These 1.5 million internally \ndisplaced Ukrainians lack durable housing or jobs to pay for food or \nsupport their families.\n  Don't forget, with Russia's invasion, the value of their currency has \njust plummeted. Everything is so much more expensive. How people are \nmaking it, I simply don't know.\n  We often talk about refugees in abstract numbers. But inside these \nnumbers are the stories and faces of individuals. I just wish people \ncould see the eyes of these parents looking into the future that is so \nuncertain and so daunting.\n  Ukrainian children in these conflict zones are being born under \nconditions that most Americans couldn't even imagine, never having \nlived without the imminent threat of death or loss. Many risk becoming \nstateless, as they have been unable to receive birth certificates, \npassports, and school certificates. In looking into the eyes of \nchildren, I am again reminded of the urgency of this crisis.\n  As freedom-loving nations grapple with the Ukrainian crisis, let us \nrecall the nations of the European continent remain America's most \nenduring allies in liberty. To not measure up to meet the current \ninternal challenge for Europe is to walk away from liberty's call at \nfreedom's edge in our time.\n  Existing efforts to assist Ukraine's eastern regions face a daunting \nset of challenges. Roads leading to Ukrainians trapped in separatist-\nheld areas are difficult to navigate. There is a photo here. I mean, \nthey are walking across rubble, down very steep embankments.\n  Making matters worse, many of these routes are now scarred by the \nravages of war. Roads and bridges have been completely destroyed. On \nroads running through conflict areas, Russian-backed fighters require \nregistration by any humanitarian group seeking access to the region. \nCan you imagine? Can you imagine what life is like there?\n  The United Nations is the only aid group allowed to even enter the \nRussian-controlled areas of Ukraine. Even the U.N. was prevented from \ndelivering aid to eastern Ukraine for 3 months as people suffered. And \nthen on November 9, just a couple weeks ago, the U.N. was finally able \nto deliver a convoy of nine trucks carrying vital aid to the city of \nLuhansk, including 10,000 blankets, 10,000 towels, 5,000 buckets, and a \nsimilar number of jerricans and plastic sheets, cement and timber for \nshelter repairs, and other winterization need and domestic items. That \nwas to one town, and it did not completely serve their enormous needs.\n  As the U.N. agency head for Ukraine said: ``This is a small drop in \nthe ocean of needs . . . in these conflict-affected areas.''\n  Can you imagine, millions of people displaced but only 10,000 \nblankets? Millions of people, 10,000 blankets.\n  Delivery of basic medical supplies also faces obstacles. There is a \nshortage of medications that treat critical and common diseases.\n  After his organization was forced out of Donetsk by Russian \noperatives, Dr. Bart Janssens, director of operations at Doctors \nWithout Borders, said the following: ``We are almost the only \norganization providing treatment for tuberculosis in prisons, insulin \nfor diabetic patients, and hemodialysis products to treat kidney \nfailure. Thousands of patients suffering from chronic, potentially \nfatal diseases will now be left with little or no assistance.''\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  This is the situation Ukraine faces in real time. What will the world \ndo? What will the United States do with so many storehouses of used \nclothing, used blankets, or anything to help sustain life there?\n  As temperatures fall across that region, shelter assistance has to be \ndelivered quickly to people living in buildings without windows, \nwithout doors, without roofs, and, most often, without heat. Thousands \nof displaced people need warm blankets, winter clothing, and shoes, as \nwell as coal and heating fuels.\n  If the free world fails to act, it must prepare for the reality that, \ncome spring, we will discover more elderly who are dead, more who are \nill, more children who have fallen into illness and have probably died, \nsimply cut off from assistance, who succumbed to starvation and the \ncold, needlessly adding to the over 8,000 who have already lost their \nlives in this Russian-directed invasion.\n  America, as a nation, has long been one of supporting freedom and \neconomic stability across our world. Let me remind you that in a 1947 \nspeech laying out what would become the Marshall Plan for Europe \nfollowing World War II's devastation, war-weary America stood the test \nof liberty.\n  And one of our greatest Americans, a statesman, a general, and then \nSecretary of State, General George C. Marshall, observed the dire post-\nwar economic conditions in Europe. And despite America's exhaustion \nfrom World War II, he urged American involvement and support of \nEuropean recovery, noting that:\n  ``It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able \nto do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, \nwithout which there can be no political stability and no assured \npeace.''\n  Those words apply to Ukraine today, as they did to Western Europe \nafter World War II.\n  General Marshall continued, saying, ``Our policy is directed not \nagainst any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, \ndesperation, and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working \neconomy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and \nsocial conditions in which free institutions can exist.''\n  He added that struggling nations must take the lead in their own \nrebuilding and that America's role should be a supporting one.\n  It was really remarkable to go back and look at the films of the \nbrilliant airlift from World War II and see what this country did. This \ncrisis is not commensurate with what happens after World War II, but we \nhave a model. We know what to do; we know how to do it. Why aren't we \ndoing it?\n  I include in the Record separate statements from three religious \nleaders who are begging the United States of America and its President \nto pay particular attention to the humanitarian needs of Ukraine: \nremarks by Patriarch Filaret, Ukraine Orthodox Church; the Archbishop \nof Ukraine, Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church; \nand also Rabbi Yaakov Dov Bleich, head of the Jewish faiths that have \npresence in that country.\n\n  Transcript of the Speech by Patriarch Filaret at the National Press \n                        Club on November 9, 2015\n\n                    (Translated live from Ukrainian)\n\n       Dear Friends, we just met with the staff of President \n     Obama. We have handed him a letter signed by leaders of All-\n     Ukrainian Council of Churches and International Organizations \n     of Ukraine leaders of different religious denominations of \n     Ukraine. First of all, I want to emphasize that the All-\n     Ukrainian Council of Churches represents 85% of Ukraine's \n     residence. So our statement is on behalf of all those people.\n       What is that letter about? We are discussing how the \n     humanitarian aid that has been collected for the Ukrainian \n     people here in the United States can be delivered to Ukraine. \n     And we are asking President Obama to implement certain \n     provisions of the Partnership for Peace program.\n       Why are we asking that? Because, today, Ukraine is \n     defending democracy and freedom for the whole world. If \n     Ukraine had accepted Russia's offer and desired to pull it \n     into the Eurasian Union, there would be no war, but Ukraine \n     would have lost its democracy and freedom--it would have \n     become a totalitarian state.\n       The United States is the leader of democracy and freedom in \n     the world. And, today, Ukrainians are giving their lives for \n     this democracy and freedom. So do Ukrainians deserve such \n     support from the United States and Europe in standing against \n     Russian invasion and totalitarianism? I think Ukraine does \n     deserve that.\n       This is why we are making this request for help. We are \n     asking to help deliver the humanitarian aid that the people \n     of the United States have already collected. And we are also \n     asking to increase the levels of assistance of multi-sided \n     assistance.\n       At this time, the war in Eastern Ukraine has not stopped--\n     it only went down in intensity. Putin has diverted the \n     world's attention by going into Syria--this does not mean \n     that he has given up on Ukraine and military warfare may \n     erupt in Ukraine with new strength anytime. So we are \n     asking--please, help. We are giving away our live and you \n     give us the resources, including the humanitarian assistance.\n       Thank you.\n\n[[Page H8856]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\nTranscript of the Speech by Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk at the \n                National Press Club on November 9th 2015\n\n       Dear Friends, I speak on behalf of Ukrainian Greek Catholic \n     Church, which is present in Ukraine and worldwide. I would \n     like to convey to you good news from Ukraine.\n       First good news is that Ukrainian nation is united as never \n     before in its history. You see that righteous society of \n     Ukraine, The Council of Churches and Religious Organizations, \n     which represent 85% of the citizens of Ukraine, are united. \n     Different religions, different churches, religious \n     denominations, but we are the heart of Ukrainian civil \n     society, and we are together.\n       The second good news is that we did not have a civil war in \n     Ukraine. We are facing the foreign aggression against \n     Ukraine. And again, that aggression is a catalyst of \n     Ukrainian unity. Seventy percent of the soldiers who are \n     defending free and independent Ukraine are Russian-speakers. \n     And I think this very important sign, that even those who are \n     in the occupied territories, as Rabbi Bleich mentioned, are \n     not supporting war. Even people in Russia will not support a \n     war. It is why Putin is trying to be silent about that the \n     Russian troop and its presence on Ukrainian territory.\n       The third good news from Ukraine is outstanding solidarity. \n     Today, we have more than two million refugees in Ukraine. But \n     international society, until now, could only help four \n     hundred thousand refugees. But what is happening to the rest? \n     Their Ukrainian fellows are helping them. But our resources \n     are short because economic crisis is striking us in Ukraine. \n     Nevertheless, we are united in our desire to rebuild, to \n     transform Ukraine.\n       The next good news from Ukraine, we all together are \n     fighting against corruption, because corruption it not only \n     political issue, is a deep moral issue. It is a part of the \n     post-Soviet mentality. But we all together are trying to \n     reform and transform the very heart of Ukraine. To transform \n     the interpersonal relationships, because corruptions strike \n     those kinds of relationships between person in Ukraine. But, \n     nevertheless, we are here to be a voice of the millions who \n     are suffering the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe after \n     the Second World War.\n       It is a pity that Ukrainian politicians until now did not \n     declare the state of the humanitarian emergency in Ukraine. \n     Until now we've received an answer that this is a political \n     quest. Nevertheless, Ukraine needs worldwide international \n     support, especially in order to solve the humanitarian \n     situation in our country. So it is why we are here--to speak \n     on behalf of those millions who will suffer terrible winter \n     in few months.\n       But we have a hope in Ukraine. You know, politicians will \n     come and go, presidents will come and go, all political \n     visions will change, but Ukraine will remain, churches will \n     remain. And today we are building our future fostering the \n     reconciliation and cooperation between the nations.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n  Transcript of the Speech by Rabbi Yaakov Dov Bleich at the National \n                    Press Club on November 9th 2015\n\n       Thanks for coming and for showing some interest in what's \n     going on in Ukraine. It is important for us in Ukraine to \n     know that it's not only politicians that get together and \n     talk about Ukraine, but that it interests civil society too.\n       First of all, the message comes from a coalition called the \n     Council of Churches and Religious Organizations of Ukraine, \n     which is a very unique organization anywhere in the world \n     probably, where the Heads of all religions in the country get \n     together and work for the benefit of all of the people of the \n     country.\n       Our message is from civil society, from people to people. \n     We spoke today with politicians because they can do things we \n     can't do. But we can do a lot more than they can. We feel \n     that civil society has an obligation to try help and do what \n     they can. We come together with other NGOs in the United \n     States trying to make things happen, change things. And I \n     want to point something out: the help that we may get paying \n     for transportation of containers of aid that was collected \n     here to send to Ukraine is very very symbolic. The money is \n     not the most important thing.\n       What is much more symbolic is that the people in the United \n     States care about what's happening in Ukraine, they \n     understand the war.\n       The need for help in Ukraine is a direct result of a \n     democratic choice, a choice that the people of Ukraine made. \n     They want to be a part of the western family of nations. They \n     want democracy, they want to be free, they want to be a part \n     of Europe, they want to live like people in the West live. \n     Because of that they are suffering, and it's important for \n     people in the United States to know that the front of the war \n     between democracy, democratic life and brutality, communism, \n     putinism, that front is taking place now in Eastern Ukraine. \n     That fight, which is a fight of entire world for democracy, \n     is taking place right there. It's not only a fight for \n     Ukraine, not only a fight for Ukraine's freedom, it's a fight \n     of freedom over putinism. This is our message.\n       You could see people who are willing to sacrifice \n     themselves for their freedom. People who are sacrificing \n     their lives on the front are not sacrificing for their \n     freedom, they are sacrificing for the freedom of their \n     country, for freedom of their people, for freedom of all \n     peoples throughout the world to have that democratic choice, \n     to choose how they want to live, and to be able to live the \n     way we take for granted here, in the United States.\n       Today, actually, President Poroshenko signed a decree for \n     organizing a committee for the 75th anniversary of Babij Yar. \n     This is important! We don't have to talk about this now, but \n     a year and a half ago we were still trying to counteract the \n     propaganda that was coming out of Russia about the fascism in \n     Ukraine and the anti-Semitism, which is a bunch of baloney. \n     Basically, we won that war.\n       People, most people, understand that Ukrainian Government \n     and Ukrainian people today are not fascists and anti-Semites, \n     they are just people who want to live free, democratically, \n     but part of that is that Ukrainian Government also coming \n     through and showing time and again, proving as much as \n     possible, as many times as possible that Ukrainian people are \n     united no matter what ethnicity, no matter what their \n     background, what their religion is. They want to be free, \n     they want to be democratic. Even the Russian-speaking people \n     want to be free. That was part of the failure of Putin in the \n     east that he didn't have the support. He doesn't have the \n     support of the people in Donbas to become a part of Russia. \n     They are not interested in becoming a part of Russia. They \n     want to be free as well. Everyone wants to be free.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. The United States has more than just a moral and \nstrategic duty to the sovereign people of Ukraine. Twenty years ago, \nthe United States, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and the United \nKingdom came together to sign the Budapest Memorandum.\n  This agreement reaffirmed the common commitment of those signatory \nnations ``to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing \nborders of Ukraine.'' And in return for that promise of protecting \nthose borders, Ukraine dismantled its vast nuclear weapons complex, the \nthird largest in the world.\n  With that memorandum in hand, Ukraine did what it promised, but what \nabout the other signatories to that agreement?\n  Today, the Budapest Memorandum appears to be a hollow promise. It \ncomes as little surprise that Russia would break that promise, but it \ndisappoints me to no end that the free world, led by the United States \nof America, seems reluctant to honor its promises to take a more \neffective role as a coalition of nations and civil society \norganizations to help Ukraine stand on its own in the face of internal \ncarnage perpetrated by Russia.\n  NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Philip Breedlove, \na man who knows an enormous amount about that continent, recently \nexpressed his deep concern that our focus has been pulled away from \nRussia's proxy invasion of Ukraine. ``Folks have taken their eye off of \nUkraine a little bit because of Syria,'' he said.\n  According to him, the situation is similar to how the world lost \nfocus on the Russian invasion of Crimea, which the United States still \nconsiders Ukrainian territory, after Russia invaded eastern Ukraine and \ntriggered the current war.\n  Fighting in the Donbass region of Ukraine has fluctuated, but \nskirmishes continue and Ukrainian territory remains under Russian \noccupation, with no withdrawal in sight.\n  Congress took initial steps to address Ukraine's need last year, just \nabout a year ago, with the Ukraine Freedom Support Act--legislation we \nfought hard to pass and which most of our colleagues voted to support. \nHowever, conditions continue to worsen.\n  A report done by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of \nEurope acknowledges that the fighting in the east, which began in the \nspring of 2014, has resulted in extensive damage to schools and medical \nfacilities, leaving the local population increasingly dependent on \noutside aid. Assistance is needed to meet basic needs and access to \nclean water, which is a problem already for 1.3 million Ukrainians at a \nminimum.\n  Two weeks ago, I sent a letter to Assistant Secretary of State \nVictoria Nuland to call for the United States to work with the \nUkrainian Government and Russia to restore access to humanitarian \nworkers and to allow aid to proceed.\n  In particular, I identified a need for access to--and this is in \nworking with the religious leaders of Ukraine across confessions for \nthese items--winterization activities, including blankets, quilts, \nkerosene, heating stoves; direct\n\n[[Page H8857]]\n\nfinancial assistance to these religious groups to help them help \nothers; water pumping station equipment to prevent freezing; electrical \nrepair kits and tools; coal; batteries; clothing; and everyday \nnecessities, including medical equipment, basic and specialized \nmedicines, emergency medical kits, shoes, socks, long underwear, coats, \nmittens, hats; redevelopment assistance, including economic aid and \ntools as well as equipment to repair homes, bridges, and roads.\n  They don't even request new material. They just request help. I just \nthink to myself, how much is thrown away in landfills across this \ncountry, items that still have good wear and good possibility? How much \nis thrown away at construction sites? And what we can do to help the \npeople of Ukraine? These items are more than just objects to the people \nof Ukraine. They are life itself right now.\n  The people of Ukraine want desperately to stand on their own, access \nto the European continent, and to govern themselves in the light of \nliberty. I have seen it in their eyes. Let us help them weather this \nterrible storm now when they need it most.\n  My heavens, if the United States of America could lead the Berlin \nairlift after World War II in those old, tired planes, sending goods to \nthe people of Europe, to the people of Western Europe, and to give them \nhope and sustenance, you mean to tell me that the America of the 21st \ncentury can't figure this out, especially when Congress has put money \nin the budget of the Department of Defense and the Department of State \nto carry this out, working in cooperation with organizations across \nthis great land?\n  Last month, the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious \nOrganizations, a globally unique coming-together of diverse religious \nfaiths which represent 85 percent of the Ukrainian population, \npresented President Obama with a letter I referenced earlier, appealing \non behalf of the people of Ukraine to help address the humanitarian \ncatastrophe gripping that Nation.\n  Each is a daily witness to the challenges and needs of the people \nsuffering because of this unnecessary, brutal war, where over 8,000 \nhave already been killed; 17,610 wounded--that was a figure as of \nOctober--2.6 million people internally displaced; 5 million in need of \naid, including 1.7 million children, and one in five homes of displaced \nfamilies damaged or destroyed. Surely, the free world can figure this \nout.\n  I do have to say a word about this. A few weeks ago, I stood here in \nWashington with many distinguished Ukrainian leaders, including the \nFirst Lady of Ukraine, Maryna Poroshenko; His Holiness, the Patriarch \nof Kyiv and All Rus'-Ukraine Filaret; and my dear friend and fellow \nUkraine Caucus cochair, Congressman Sander Levin of Michigan, to \ndedicate a memorial here in our Nation's capital to the 1932-1933 \nSoviet Union's forced starvation of between 2.5 million and 7.5 million \nUkrainians whose names are lost to history forever.\n  I think America should also consider doing this humanitarian lift to \nUkraine because, frankly, no place on Earth suffered more in the last \ncentury from brutal tyranny than did Ukraine. Perhaps something is owed \nto those sacrificial people for what they endured and for the spark of \nliberty that still breathes so strongly in their hearts and minds.\n  In marking the brutal tragedy of the forced famine, called the \nHolodomor, I am reminded of the importance of teaching about the cost \nof liberty, the need to fight for it, and the legacy of that \nsacrificial people.\n  Through this memorial, we seek to better guard against any oppressive \nregime that would seek to rule over any people, for, at that time, our \nNation failed to reveal and respond to that ongoing brutality of forced \nstarvation in Ukraine. Had the free world acted then, we might have \nchanged the fate of millions, but that did not happen.\n  Let us not repeat the blindness of the past. America must act with \ndispatch to support the freedom-loving people of Ukraine. Time and \nagain, in moments when the world has found itself at a crossroads, \nAmerican leadership and action has made the difference.\n  We must be prepared to join with others in this effort to save the \nchildren, to save the families, to save the people of Ukraine, and, in \ndoing so, to let liberty march forward. We must do the right thing for \nour brothers and sisters in liberty. America must act, and we must act \nas leaders. Ukraine is waiting. The world is waiting.\n\n  I call upon the President of the United States and the Obama \nadministration to do what is necessary and achievable to meet the \ngrowing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, to relieve the unnecessary \nsuffering of their people, and to prevent a gigantic refugee crisis \nfrom spilling over and impacting European stability.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), who \ncould not be here tonight for this Special Order, supports these \nefforts. His formal statement includes the important role that the \npeople of southeastern Pennsylvania have played in keeping a focus on \nUkraine and this ongoing tragedy and what the United States of America \ncan do at very little cost to the people here by the mobilization of \nthe hearts of the American people to provide humanitarian assistance to \nhelp save Ukraine in our own time and day.\n\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We, the undersigned of the All \n     Ukrainian Council of Churches and religious organizations, \n     and representing Ukraine's diverse religious community appeal \n     to you on behalf of the people of Ukraine to help address the \n     humanitarian catastrophe gripping our country. The needs are \n     enormous, ranging from medical supplies to everyday items \n     such as food, water, and clothing.\n       While the global news media regularly reports on Russia's \n     war against Ukraine, government reforms and financial \n     challenges, there is rarely any mention of the extraordinary \n     dimensions of the human suffering caused by Moscow's \n     aggression. While Ukraine certainly needs greater military, \n     financial and political assistance, our focus here must be on \n     the humanitarian aspect.\n       As you know, according to the UN, over 5 million people, \n     including 1.7 million children are in desperate need of \n     humanitarian assistance. 8,000 people have died and over \n     17,000 have been injured and wounded. There are over \n     1,390,000 displaced people, including 174,000 children. The \n     challenges of this human tragedy are overwhelming. Even the \n     most conservative estimates show that over 65% of projected \n     needs have yet to be met--even on the level of pledges.\n       As representatives of the interfaith community, we witness \n     on a daily basis the challenges and the needs of people \n     suffering because of this war. And with the onset of winter, \n     an already dire situation will only get worse. We pray for \n     their lives and for the future of our country.\n       While we are grateful for the assistance provided by the \n     United States government to date, we know that the need is so \n     much greater. Thus, we appeal to you to increase assistance \n     and to activate the full potential of the National Guard \n     State Partnership Program and the Partnership for Peace (PfP) \n     as instruments for alleviating the humanitarian catastrophe. \n     One of the stated goals of the PfP is to ``provide a \n     framework for enhanced political and military cooperation for \n     joint multilateral crisis management activities, such as \n     humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping.'' Ukraine was the \n     first post-Soviet country to join the PfP in 1993.\n       In addition to the assistance provided by the US \n     government, we, during our travels throughout the United \n     States, have come to personally witness the great generosity \n     of the American people expressed through numerous spontaneous \n     initiatives to ship medical and humanitarian supplies to \n     Ukraine.\n       Time is of the essence, Mr. President. The people of \n     Ukraine need to know that they are not forgotten in their \n     time for need! The instruments anticipated by the National \n     Guard State Partnership and Partnership for Peace programs \n     will allow the American people to more effectively and \n     rapidly access and deliver already available medical and \n     humanitarian supplies to Ukraine--literally within days. We \n     each represent distribution networks that cooperate with each \n     other; we now ask for the resources to meet the growing human \n     needs.\n       We pray that God grant you guidance, wisdom and bless you \n     and the great American nation. God bless the United States \n     and Ukraine!\n           Sincerely,\n         Antoniuk Valery Stepanovich--Chairman of the Union, \n           Senior Bishop, All-Ukrainian Union of Churches of \n           Evangelical Christians--Baptists; Panochko Michael \n           Stepanovich--President of the Union, Senior Bishop, \n           All-Ukrainian Union of Christians of the Evangelical \n           Faith--Pentecostals; Ablaev Emirali--Chairman of the \n           Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Ukraine, Mufti \n           Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Crimea; Ahmad \n           Tamim--Head of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims \n           of Ukraine, Mufti of Zan-Fabian Alexander--Head of the \n           Consistory of the SCRC, Bishop, Transcarpathian \n           Reformed Church; Sergey Mashevskyy--Bishop, German \n           Evangelical Lutheran\n\n[[Page H8858]]\n\n           Church of Ukraine; Yaakov Dov Bleich--President of the \n           Association, Chief Rabbi of Kyiv and Ukraine, \n           Association of Jewish Religious Organizations of \n           Ukraine; Peter Malchuk--Head of the Commission on the \n           Relationship Between State and Church; Raichynets \n           Vasiliy Fedorovich--Senior Pastor, Union of Free \n           Churches of Christians of Evangelical Faith of Ukraine; \n           Macarius (Maletich)--Primate of the Ukrainian \n           Autocephalous Orthodox Church Metropolitan The \n           Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church; Commandant \n           Grigory Ivanovich--President, Ukrainian Bible Society; \n           Sviatoslav (Shevchuk)--Archbishop, The Ukrainian Greek \n           Catholic Church; Marcos (Oganesyan)--Bishop, Ukrainian \n           Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church; Vyacheslav \n           Horpynchuk--Bishop, Ukrainian Lutheran Church; Onufry \n           (Berezovsky)--Metropolitan Ukrainian Orthodox Church; \n           Filaret (Denisenko)--Patriarch Filaret, Patriarch of \n           Kyiv and All Rus-Ukraine, Ukrainian Orthodox Church \n           Kiev Patriarchate; Nosov Stanislav Viktorovich--\n           President, The Ukrainian Union Conference of Seventh-\n           Day Adventists; Padun Leonid Nikolaevich--Senior \n           Bishop, Ukrainian Christian Evangelical Church.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, all Members will have 5 \nlegislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous material into the Record on the topic of this Special \nOrder.\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the \ngentlewoman from Ohio, Ms. Kaptur, for organizing this Special Order \nthis evening and bringing this important alliance with Ukraine to the \nforefront.\n  The Ukrainian heritage, and its people, play a critical role in the \ncultural fabric of Southeastern Pennsylvania.\n  Just this morning, I had the privilege to meet with Ukrainian \nAmbassador to the United States Valeriy Chaly and reaffirm our support \nfor the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and freedom of Ukraine.\n  Mr. Speaker, our relationship with Ukraine is vital to our national \nsecurity interest and we must continue to foster strong bilateral \nrelations as Ukraine continues to face threats to its status as a \nsovereign nation.\n  So long as Russia continues to pose a destabilizing force at \nUkraine's borders and supports rebel groups in Eastern Ukraine, \nCongress and the Administration must remain steadfast in our support \nfor the Ukrainian people and their freedom.\n  The Administration must follow through on the commitment set forth in \nthe Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 to provide Ukraine with much-\nneeded military aid, both lethal and non-lethal.\n  Reportedly, not even half the aid authorized last December has been \ndelivered. Further, a recent article in the Washington Post noted that \nthe quality of the U.S. supplied gear, including Humvees, is ``little \nmore than junk''--there is barely any protection on the windows and \ndoors--while the non-lethal military aid provided to protect Ukraine \nmilitary forces is obsolete.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable and our allies deserve better.\n  In an effort to keep our nation safe and to provide assistance to our \nallies, the National Defense Authorization Act was recently signed into \nlaw. This includes an authorization for $300 million in military aid, \nincluding lethal, to support Ukraine.\n  And currently stalled in the House is bill H.R. 955, that would \nauthorize the Secretary of Defense to provide assistance (including \ntraining, equipment, lethal weapons of a defensive nature, logistics \nsupport, supplies and services) to the military and national security \nforces of Ukraine through the end of the next fiscal year.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to act on this legislation in an \nexpeditious manner and bring it to the Floor for a vote.\n  We cannot let our Ukrainian allies on the frontlines defend their \nfreedom and sovereignty without meaningful support. The Administration \nmust follow through on our word.\n  Again, I thank Congresswoman Kaptur for organizing tonight's special \norder and her unwavering dedication to Ukraine and the Ukrainian-\nAmerican community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/house-section/article/H8858-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The Speaker announced his signature to an enrolled bill of the Senate \nof the following title:\n\n       S. 611.
