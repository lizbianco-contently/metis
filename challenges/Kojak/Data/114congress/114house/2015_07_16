Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deplore the deeply \ndisturbing actions of Planned Parenthood, which has no reservations \nabout using macabre tactics to harvest the lungs, livers, heads, and \nhearts of aborted babies.\n  This week, a video investigation caught the organization's senior \ndirector of medical services eagerly promoting the harvesting of such \nbody parts, purportedly for medical research. The director said she \nholds a daily huddle to determine how best to obtain them from unborn \nchildren scheduled for abortion. Callously discussing a menu of aborted \nbody parts over lunch and red wine demonstrates a new level of \ndepravity.\n  Planned Parenthood's damage control fails to answer two basic \nquestions: Have their affiliates done ``better than break even'' and \nprofited from the sale of baby body parts? And under what medical, \nethical, or legal code is it okay to choose a particular abortion \nmethod to preserve particular organs for harvesting?\n  Nothing can erase what was caught on tape. Trafficking in human body \nparts is a Federal offense. Planned Parenthood receives over half a \nbillion in taxpayer dollars every year.\n  I am calling for a stop to their inhumane practices and support the \nrenewed congressional investigation into the organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5241-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BEST WISHES TO PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W.

It was one of the most rewarding and \ngratifying meetings that I have had.\n  At that meeting, we talked about many things. One of the things that \nI walked away from the meeting with was a sense and spirit of \nbipartisanship and how important it was to be able to work with people \nacross lines.\n  I am honored to tell you that that President was George Bush 41. I \nunderstand that he has suffered an injury. I want him, his family, and \nall to know that I will keep them in my prayers as they move forward. \nHe recently celebrated a birthday, and I wish him many, many more \nbirthdays.\n  God bless you, President Bush, and God bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5241-8", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5241-H5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING MARVIN ``BUTCH'' BADEN\n\n  (Mr. CRAWFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Marvin ``Butch'' \nBaden.\n  Butch began his career in the U.S. rice industry in 1958 as an \n``office errand boy'' at Riceland Foods. He has served in many \ncapacities since that time, including his current role as senior vice \npresident of rice sales at Producers Rice Mill.\n\n[[Page H5242]]\n\n  During Butch's 37 years at Producers Rice Mill alone, he has marketed \nthe equivalent of 1.3 billion bushels of rough rice, which translates \nto about 20 million metric tons of both milled and brown rice.\n  In 1981, when U.S. rice acreage exploded from 2 million acres per \nyear to just under 4 million acres, new market access for U.S. rice was \ncrucial in supporting prices for U.S. rice farmers. Butch was one of \nthe critical pioneers at the time who dramatically expanded the export \ndemand for U.S. rice.\n  Butch was directly involved in the opening of new export markets for \nU.S. rice in the Caribbean, Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria. Butch also \nexpanded U.S. rice exports in Europe, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.\n  With nearly 50 percent of the U.S. rice production required to be \nexported, the fruits of Butch's efforts not only enhanced the returns \nof the farmers he worked for, but the new export demand for U.S. rice \nalso benefited the market prices of all U.S. rice farmers. In all, \nButch has logged nearly 9 million air miles on behalf of the U.S. rice \nindustry.\n  From humble beginnings as an office errand boy, Marvin ``Butch'' \nBaden, through hard work and perseverance, has earned and achieved the \nhighest level of respect and appreciation within the U.S. rice \nindustry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5242-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING DON NEWTON\n\n  (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Don Newton, a proud \n40-year member of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied \nCraftworkers, Local 56, of West Chicago, Illinois--and a friend of \nmine--who passed away recently.\n  There was a time when workers fighting for their rights were met with \nlead pipes and management-paid gangs. Today, they fight for their \nrights with picket lines, elections, and the rule of law and with icons \nlike Scabby, the inflatable rat.\n  Scabby the Rat, a towering, inflatable mascot of labor protests, was \ndreamed up by Don Newton and fellow organizer Ken Lambert during labor \ndisputes of the 1990s. Today, Scabby can be seen throughout the \ncountry, reminding us of the constant struggle for fair wages and safe \nworking conditions and the importance of unity and solidarity in labor \ndisputes.\n  On the front lines of protests, as workers fight to hold on to the \nprotections they need to maintain fair wages and a healthy middle \nclass, Scabby the Rat and the memory of Don Newton will never be \nforgotten; and you can now follow Scabby the Rat on Wikipedia and \nFacebook.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5242-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, this week, President Obama announced a \nnuclear agreement with Iran that falls far short of the commitments he \nmade to the American people.\n  This agreement simply does not stop Iran's quest for nuclear weapons. \nIt lifts an arms embargo against the world's number one state sponsor \nof terror. It also opens the possibility for Iran to acquire ballistic \nmissiles capable of reaching anywhere in the world.\n  The President's agreement ends sanctions, frees up hundreds of \nbillions to help Iran's economy, and will allow an unrepentant Iran to \nfinance terrorism around the world, undermining the safety and security \nof the United States, Israel, and our allies. Never forget Iran is \nresponsible for the deaths of hundreds of American servicemembers, from \nBeirut to Baghdad, and beyond.\n  The initial ``anytime, anywhere access'' standard for monitoring \nIran's nuclear program is replaced with ``managed access,'' where we \nhave to ask permission before entering suspected facilities.\n  This deal does not make the world safer. Far from ending the \npotential of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, it all but \nguarantees one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5242-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MAKE IT IN AMERICA: WHAT'S NEXT?\n\n  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of the Make It \nIn America plan and working to strengthen America's great manufacturing \ncomeback. One of the biggest threats to that comeback is the growing \nskills gap in manufacturing, which is why I and my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle have joined together to lead the Congressional \nInvestment in America's Workforce Caucus.\n  Through initiatives like Make It In America and the CIAW Caucus, we \nare working to expand apprenticeships and on-the-job training, increase \nemployer-provided educational benefits, and provide tax credits for \nbusinesses who provide critical workforce training.\n  Some of the efforts in my district are already seeing results. \nAccording to yesterday's Detroit Free Press, Wayne County, in my \ndistrict, is leading the Nation in new manufacturing jobs added last \nyear. Three other counties in the State of Michigan were added as well.\n  If we keep this up and if we continue to work to close that \nmanufacturing gap, we can make it in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5242-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE PUTTING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IN JEOPARDY\n\n  (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my \nconcerns over Senate Democrats standing in the way of funding our \nnational security. Once again, we find ourselves in a position where \nDemocrats in the Senate are attempting to extort higher Federal \nspending on their social agenda in return for adequately funding our \ntroops.\n  To be clear, this House passed a spending bill with the same proposed \nspending limits that the President of the United States asked for, but \nSenate Democrats are using the 60-vote rule to prohibit this \nappropriation measure from coming to the floor.\n  General Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, recently said:\n\n       Since 2011, global disorder has significantly increased \n     while some of our comparative military advantage has begun to \n     erode.\n\n  We have seen this before, Mr. Speaker, where our security becomes a \npolitical bargaining chip. This is irresponsible, and I respectfully \nrequest my colleagues in the Senate to abandon these tactics.

Mr. Speaker, our veterans have earned the care they are \ndue to receive through the Department of Veterans Affairs. So many men \nand women of the military put their lives on the line every day to \nensure the safety and security of our country.\n  Unfortunately, bad news coming out of the Department continues to \npile up. This week, it was revealed that nearly one-third of the \n847,000 veterans with pending applications for health care may have \nalready passed away.\n  This means, at some point in their lives, over 200,000 men and women \nwho served our country bravely weren't able to access the care that \nthey were promised. These benefits were earned through service, but due \nto mismanagement, they remained in an endless waiting line.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can and must do better for our Nation's servicemen \nand -women. We must continue to institute reforms at the VA to ensure \nthat our veterans receive proper care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5242-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5242-H5284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WESTERN WATER AND AMERICAN FOOD SECURITY ACT OF 2015\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. LUMMIS.

Pursuant to House Resolution 362 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2898.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  0913\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2898) to provide drought relief in the State of California, and \nfor other purposes, with Mr. Hultgren in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis) and the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Huffman) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wyoming.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, the American West is in the midst of a \nsevere drought, especially central California. This problem demands \nswift action, with tens of thousands of trees, plants, jobs, food, and \nlivelihoods at stake.\n  H.R. 2898 will help bring our Western water supply infrastructure \ninto the 21st century, making it more drought resistant. The bill also \naddresses the manmade Federal decisions that are exacerbating the \ndrought.\n  H.R. 2898 ensures scientific transparency in Federal actions that are \nliterally taking water away from people that desperately need it, all \nfor questionable benefit of endangered fish.\n  The bill also requires the deployment of more effective management \ntools like addressing the nonnative fish that are harming the \nendangered fish.\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n  West-wide, the bill takes steps to build new water storage that is \ncrucial to the well-being of Western communities and economies. To \nassist non-Federal projects, the bill creates a one-stop shop for water \nstorage permitting at the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  Oftentimes, Federal agencies overlap or conflict with each other when \nit comes to permitting non-Federal facilities. This provision forces \nthem to sit down with one lead agency, the Bureau of Reclamation, to \nresolve issues and expedite permitting.\n  For Federal projects, the bill creates a streamlined and transparent \nprocess for the Bureau that mirrors the Army Corps' provisions in the \nWater Resource Reform and Development Act of 2014, which was enacted by \noverwhelming bipartisan majorities in both Houses of Congress.\n  To offset the bill's implementation costs and finance new water \nstorage, the bill allows irrigation districts and water utilities to \nprepay their share of the capital costs of Federal water projects.\n  Mr. Chairman, some water users are prohibited from paying off \ncontracts early. This is nonsensical. Congress has lifted the \nrestrictions in piecemeal fashion before, and it is time to dispense \nwith it altogether.\n  One way to efficiently construct new storage is to allow the Bureau \nof Reclamation to make water storage improvements during the course of \nmaking safety improvements. H.R. 2898 allows the Bureau to do just \nthat.\n  Finally, the bill prohibits the Departments of the Interior and \nAgriculture from holding public land permits hostage unless permittees \ngive up their State-endowed water rights. This will put a stop to the \nFederal Government's repeated attempts to grab water rights at the \nexpense of State authority from the Forest Service's interim directive \nfor ski area permits to the Service's ill-fated groundwater directive.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill takes a commonsense approach to solving water \nproblems in the West, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                     Committee on Agriculture,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2015.\n     Hon.

The \n     bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Natural \n     Resources, with an additional referral to the Committee on \n     Agriculture.\n       I ask that you allow the Committee on Agriculture to be \n     discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it \n     may be scheduled expeditiously by the Majority Leader. This \n     discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as \n     precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a \n     conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your \n     request to have the Committee on Agriculture represented on \n     the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to \n     include this letter and any response in the bill report filed \n     by the Committee on Natural Resources as well as in the \n     Congressional Record to memorialize our understanding.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my request, and for \n     your continued strong cooperation between our committees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Rob Bishop,\n                         Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  It was just last winter that we were here on the House floor talking \nabout another so-called drought bill that my Republican colleagues were \nattempting to slam through the House within just a few days of its \nintroduction.\n  This time the bill has a different title, but it is pretty much the \nsame bill. We are back today to consider yet another bill that harms \nWest Coast fisheries and tribal interests, another bill that undermines \nState law, another bill that micromanages the most complex water system \nin the world in a way that benefits a select few at the expense of many \nothers across the State of California, another bill that is going \nnowhere.\n  We have a SAP from the administration. We have a withering three-page \nletter of opposition critiquing the bill from the Department of the \nInterior. The two largest circulation papers in California have both \neditorialized against it. The State of California is on record opposing \nprior versions of this bill.\n  Now, unlike last year, when the House did not allow any amendments to \nthe bill, we are here today with 4 out of 5 Republican amendments made \nin order and 4 out of 24 Democratic amendments made in order.\n  That may seem like marginal progress over the 113th Congress' very \nclosed process, but that is no way to do business and certainly no way \nto get a bill signed into law. With something as complicated and \nimportant as California water, we really should make sure everyone has \na say, and that is what Democrats have attempted to do. We have \nintroduced a drought response bill, H.R. 2983, which is a comprehensive \ndrought bill. It brings everyone to the table.\n  This bill had 6 weeks of public review before even being formally \nintroduced, resulting in substantial crowdsource changes to the bill. \nOur water future deserves that kind of open debate and real solutions.\n  I have been joined by 34 cosponsors on that bill because it provides \nboth short- and long-term investments in water supply reliability, the \nkind of tools that all Western States will need.\n  My bill includes significant resources to support farmworkers and \nothers who\n\n[[Page H5244]]\n\nare out of work, not just lipservice. And I submit that if my \nRepublican colleagues really care about the challenges faced by \nfarmworkers and others affected by this drought, they will join us in \nbacking real solutions that provide meaningful assistance in addition \nto stretching our limited water supplies.\n  Our bill is supported by the Association of California Water \nAgencies, California sanitation agencies, numerous other water \nagencies, environmental groups and stakeholders, and both the L.A. \nTimes and the San Francisco Chronicle have editorialized in favor of \nthe Democratic alternative drought response bill and opposed to the \nbill we are considering here today.\n  Mr. Chairman, let's have some hearings. Despite the importance of \nthis issue, we have held no legislative hearings on drought responses \nin the 114th Congress, not on the majority's bill, not on my \nalternative.\n  Let's have hearings on both bills. Let's see which one produces the \nmost water, which one produces that water more quickly, and which one \nproduces it more cost-effectively and more reliably.\n  I hope that someday, Mr. Chairman, we will be discussing real water \nsolutions in that spirit, vetted in an open hearing, that can actually \nproduce something that will be signed into law, instead of the same \ntired, divisive ideas that pit our State's water users against each \nother.\n  Now, a lot of people have asked me: Why do your Republican colleagues \nrefuse to have serious hearings on their water proposal? I think the \nanswer is pretty clear. Like its predecessors, we are here considering \na bill that, when it is exposed to public scrutiny, simply falls apart.\n  Here's what the Department of the Interior said last week in a letter \nto our committee, in lieu of testimony, of course, because there was no \nlegislative hearing on the bill. They said: ``Instead of increasing \nwater supplies, H.R. 2898 dictates operational decisions and imposes an \nadditional new legal standard. Instead of saving water, this could \nactually limit water supplies by creating new and confusing conflicts \nwith existing laws, thereby adding an unnecessary layer of complexity \nto Federal and State project operations. As a result of this additional \nstandard, we believe H.R. 2898 will slow decisionmaking, generate \nsignificant litigation, and limit the real-time operational flexibility \nthat is so critical to maximizing water delivery.''\n  Although the Pacific Fishery Management Council wasn't given an \nopportunity to actually testify on this bill, again, because we had no \nhearings, they opposed last year's version, and they wrote to us this \nweek to say that they are on record on what appears to be similar \nlegislation. Specifically, they are concerned about the bill's \nprovisions that redirect water away from salmon habitat.\n  The closure of the West Coast salmon fishery in 2008 and 2009 \nrequired $158 million in Federal disaster relief. And, sadly, the Rules \nCommittee did not allow a vote on our amendment to require a full \nPacific Fishery Management Council review of this legislation.\n  There is no question that this bill explicitly preempts State water \nlaw, and it waives and weakens the application of bedrock Federal \nenvironmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act and NEPA, but \nthe Rules Committee did not allow a vote on my amendment to protect \nCalifornia water law from preemption nor my amendment to strengthen the \nwater rights protections in the bill. It seems that the issue of \nstates' rights is simply an inconvenient subject when it comes to \nRepublican water legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, water is a complex subject, but it doesn't have to be \npartisan combat. It doesn't have to scapegoat environmental laws or pit \none region against the other in a zero-sum game.\n  I chaired the California Assembly's Water Committee during the last \ndrought in 2009, and we did it the right way. We held lots of hearings. \nWe brought interests from all over the State together and, in the end, \nalthough it was a lot of work, through that deliberative, transparent \nprocess we produced comprehensive water legislation that was supported \nby Republicans and Democrats from all corners of the State.\n  Last year, Mr. Chairman, a near unanimous California legislature \nagreed on a multibillion-dollar water bond that has created significant \nwater reforms in full public view. If my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle would just give up on the idea of ramming the same \ndivisive ideas through Congress every few months, we too might be able \nto make some progress on solving water problems.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, droughts are nature's fault, but water \nshortages are our fault. They are a deliberate choice we made nearly 40 \nyears ago when we stopped building new dams. We haven't added a major \nreservoir in California since 1979, while the population of our State \nhas nearly doubled.\n  Even before the drought, leftist policies created severe water \nshortages in California's Central Valley, devastating the economy and \ncreating the spectacle of food lines in one of the most fertile \nagricultural regions of our Nation.\n  For 4 years, the House has passed comprehensive legislation to \nresolve this crisis before it became a crisis. For 4 years, Senate \nDemocrats blocked it; but the public has now awakened, and the Senate \nhas changed.\n  The voices we hear in opposition are the same voices that have \ndominated Western water policy these past 40 years. We now know where \nthat leads.\n  This bill doesn't preempt California water law; it protects it by \nforbidding State officials from fulfilling their threats to violate it. \nIt comes at the request of local water agencies that are sick and tired \nof having their water expropriated by ideological zealots.\n  It is time to choose between two very different visions of water \npolicy. One is the nihilistic vision of the environmental left; \nincreasingly severe, government-induced shortages, forced rationing, \nastronomical water prices, and a permanently declining quality of life \nfor our children who will be required to stretch and ration every drop \nof water in their parched homes. The other is a vision of abundance, a \nnew era of clean, cheap, and plentiful water and hydroelectricity; \ngreat new reservoirs to store water in wet years to assure plenty in \ndry ones; a society whose children can enjoy the prosperity that \nabundant water provides, including fresh and affordable groceries from \nAmerica's agricultural cornucopia.\n  Mr. Chairman, we choose abundance.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The alternative vision that we offer is certainly not one of \nausterity and sacrifice; it is one of reality.\n  There was a time when the reclamation program from the Federal \nGovernment proceeded on the assumption that rain follows the plow. It \nwas completely wishful, completely delusional, and we seem to be \nhearing vestiges of that old argument even today.\n  What Democrats offer are real solutions--solutions that have been \nunderfunded by Republicans for too many years, solutions that will \ngenerate more water and more water supply reliability than the \nRepublican alternative we are considering.\n  We continue to hear representations that are simply not correct. The \nclaim that we haven't built a major reservoir in California since 1979, \ntell that to the folks that built Los Vaqueros Reservoir or Diamond \nValley Reservoir or many others.\n  We hear that the doubling of the population in the last few decades \nis what is driving this crisis. Well, in fact, the urban centers where \nthat population has doubled have held their demand flat. The population \nhas gone up. The water consumption has not.\n  We continue to hear that this bill--remarkably, we continue to hear \nthat it doesn't preempt State law. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would refer \nyou simply to the CBO report at page 2, which recognizes that H.R. 2898 \nwould impose intergovernmental mandates by preempting the ability of \nthe State of California to enforce its own water management and \nwildlife preservation laws. There is no question that this bill \npreempts State laws, and saving money by telling Federal agencies they \nno longer have to comply with State laws is no way to make public \npolicy.\n\n[[Page H5245]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the delta \nregion California (Mr. McNerney). He has been a champion on sustainable \nmanagement of our water resources, and I am pleased to have him with \nus.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my strong opposition to \nH.R. 2898.\n  Many of my colleagues here in Washington have told me they don't want \nto get involved in the California water wars, and I don't blame them. I \ndon't want them to get involved in the California water wars, but this \nlegislation will do tremendous harm to the California delta, an area \nthat I am privileged to represent.\n  Let's start with the facts. California is experiencing its driest \nyear on record. In May, there was not even enough snowpack to measure. \nThe United States Drought Monitor measured that about 46 percent of \nCalifornia is in an ``exceptional drought.''\n  The so-called drought bill does nothing to solve California's water \nissues or address drought across the West. Instead, it preempts State \nlaws, reduces management flexibility, eliminates protection for salmon \nand other endangered species, and rolls back our Nation's fundamental \nenvironmental laws.\n  We need to look at real solutions and not waste time and resources \nrecycling old, bad ideas. Moving more water south doesn't answer our \nproblems. It hurts delta farmers and the salmon industry. We can't pick \nand choose our economies. We need to fight for all of them.\n  Let's be clear. My Republican colleagues are basing a lot of their \narguments on the idea that environmental regulations send too much \nwater to the ocean that otherwise could be used by communities. But \naccording to the State Water Resources Control Board, in 2014, 72 \npercent of the delta outflow was required to control salinity so that \nthe delta's water supply did not become too salty for agriculture or \nurban communities across the State.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  If we override these laws, permanent damage will result for \nfishermen, farmers, families, and businesses throughout California. \nWhat I don't understand is why our Republican colleagues keep fighting \nagainst protections that preserve the quality of water for their \nconstituents.\n  The Department of the Interior also opposes this bill because it \nwould ``impede an effective and timely response to the continuing \ndrought while providing no additional water to hard-hit communities.''\n  And California doesn't want Federal legislation to ``weaken State and \nFederal environmental protections . . . preempt State law . . . and \nfavor one region of the State over another,'' which is exactly what \nthis bill does.\n  We are a State known for innovation, and we have to support bold, \nforward-thinking solutions that create new water and don't pit regions \nof California against each other. We should be supporting water \nefficiency, storage, reuse, recycling, water management, innovative \nwater projects, and long-term approaches to water shortages.\n  While this legislation will further disrupt a fragile delta and hurt \nits local economy, I, along with my colleagues, will be pushing for \nsolutions that create more water and respond to the needs of the entire \nState.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I yield the gentleman an additional 20 seconds.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. I want to ask my colleagues in the Great Lakes region \nand the Florida Everglades to pay attention. This bill, if passed, will \nset a new precedent for grabbing freshwater over any environmental \nprotections. Your water could be next.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2898.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis).\n  Mr. Chairman, we have heard today and will hear quite a bit more \nclaims from the opposition, and I think it is high time that we \nreintroduce facts into the debate on California water.\n  My district is the source of much of California's water and home to \nits largest reservoirs, just two of which can hold 8 million acre-feet, \nenough for 32 million people for an entire year. This water is \ndelivered throughout the length of the State, and no other district \nprovides so much for so many.\n  However, even my constituents are facing mandatory rationing and \nfallowed fields. I support this measure because it respects State water \nrights and aids all Californians without favoring any region of the \nState over another.\n  Ask the Bay Area lawmakers, who have expressed so much concern over \n``sparking a water war'' where their water comes from. You will find \nthat their water comes from my district, my colleagues' districts in \nthe Valley, as well as the Sierras.\n  This bill advances planning of five surface water storage projects \nthat would yield enough water for 9.6 million people, projects that \ntwo-thirds of Californians voted to fund with State money just last \nyear.\n  Yet, my disappointment here is that we have so many California \nlegislators today and in the past that oppose anything we try to do to \nenhance the water supply and deliverability in the State of California.\n  What is more, it isn't human water use that is negatively impacting \nlisted species. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service and \nDelta Stewardship Council, 90 percent of endangered winter-run salmon \nare killed and eaten by invasive fish species before they even reach \nthe delta.\n  The opposition, despite all data to the contrary, denies that \ninvasive species are a part of the problem. Years of lawsuits aimed at \nreducing water use haven't helped at all endangered salmon, but this \nbill takes real steps to aid that population. This bill takes action to \nreduce the populations of invasive species.\n  While opponents may claim this bill impacts commercial salmon \nfishing, they won't say that the National Marine Fisheries Service \nfound that commercial ocean fishing reduces the remaining endangered \nwinter-run Chinook population by as much as 25 percent.\n  So there it is right there. 92.5 percent of endangered winter-run \nChinook are killed by invasive species and commercial fishing outside \nof whatever happens in the delta, 92.5 percent.\n  When opponents claim that this bill alters the Endangered Species \nAct, ask them to show you the language where it does so. They can't \nshow you that because it doesn't exist. Believe me, if I could, I would \namend the Endangered Species Act to be more effective, actually, in \nhelping species as well as human needs.\n  In fact, this bill enhances implementation of the ESA by requiring \nimproved population monitoring and invasive species management, \ncomponents that should be universally supportable.\n  Mr. Chairman, let's put a stop to the half-truths and misleading \nrhetoric, such as no hearings being held. We had two hearings as well \nas hearings in the Valley on this bill and its components.\n  The opponents don't believe that we should take any action at all, \nthat nothing is wrong, despite 36 percent mandatory water reductions to \nhomes--such as in my district, like in Redding--thousands of lost jobs, \nand a half million fallowed acres.\n  These drought deniers claim that 38 million people--soon to be 50 \nmillion in California--can prosper with water delivery infrastructure \nbuilt for 20 million people years ago, despite irrefutable evidence \nthat our State's economy has dried up.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is time to take action and pass H.R. 2898.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, by way of clarification, the opposition \ndoes not oppose addressing invasive species that may have impacts on \nour fisheries.\n  What we do agree with, though, is all of the serious science, \nincluding peer-reviewed science, that finds that water diversions are \nthe main challenge and the main impact. And we cannot ignore the \nelephant in the room when we are talking about recovering our \nfisheries.\n  As for this claim that there was some kind of a hearing in the \nValley, Mr. Chairman, not in this Congress and not a real hearing.\n  It doesn't count when you have a Republican swing through Fresno with \na fundraiser and a rally and a press event and no Democratic ranking \nmembers in\n\n[[Page H5246]]\n\nattendance. That is not serious deliberation.\n  We are talking about real hearings where diverse witnesses and water \nexperts and lots of Democrats get to participate in a serious and \nmeaningful way.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Mrs. Napolitano), the ranking member of our Water Resources and \nEnvironment Subcommittee of the T Committee, a champion on water \nissues for many, many years.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I do heavily oppose H.R. 2898. It does create no new \nwet water.\n  I am hearing a lot of rhetoric on all these different things that \nhave happened. I have been on that subcommittee for 17 years, and I \nhave heard it all.\n  I have been to the Central Valley. I have been talking to farmers. \nBut I don't see any of my colleagues on the other side visiting \nsouthern California and checking out how we do things in San Diego and \nLos Angeles, to be able to have hearings with the water agencies and \nall those that are critically affected by what is affecting southern \nCalifornia.\n  Now, this bill has been introduced. There has been no hearing in our \nSubcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. There has been no \nconsultation with Democrats, except one maybe, with no water agency, \nwith State agencies, with cities, and with tribes.\n  It does nothing for farmworkers, the ones who are really affected by \nthe drought and who have no way of being able to have income or other \nway of subsidence.\n  The bill focuses on the Central Valley at the expense of the rest of \nboth northern California and southern California.\n  It requires mandatory pumping to agribusiness, which reduces southern \nCalifornia water deliveries. It creates a complicated and ill-defined \nsystem that is a very poor attempt at protecting State water deliveries \nto southern California.\n  And it is proof, also, that the authors know that the bill will \nreduce deliveries to southern California due to water quality and \nenvironmental problems created with increased pumping to the Central \nValley.\n  This bill affects the entire country, the U.S., by weakening Federal \nenvironmental review laws, by creating unreasonable deadlines for \nenvironmental review when the biggest problem with delayed view is \n``inadequate funding.''\n  California's Natural Resources Secretary, John Laird, states that \nthis bill would ``reignite water wars, move water policy back into the \ncourts, and try to pit one part of the State against another.''\n  California Senator Dianne Feinstein, senior Senator, said the bill \ncontains provisions ``that would violate environmental law.''\n  California Senator Barbara Boxer says the bill ``will only reignite \nthe water wars.''\n  The White House opposes this legislation and will veto it, saying \nthat ``it fails to address critical elements of California's complex \nwater challenges and will, if enacted, impede an effective and timely \nresponse to the continuing drought while providing no additional water \nto the hard-hit communities.''\n  We must work on this water issue in a bipartisan manner to address \nCalifornia's entire State drought.\n  I have introduced H.R. 291, the Water in the 21st Century Act, which \nwould provide actual drought relief to all of California with water \nconservation programs, water recycling projects, groundwater \nimprovement operations, stormwater capture solutions, and \ndesalinization.\n  We need to support long-term solutions with shovel-ready projects \nthat quickly create water.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. There is a $300 million backlog on title XVI for \nrecycled water that would help southern California be able to wean \nitself off of the imported water. Key House Democratic proposals have \nbeen excluded from the bill we are marking up today.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2898.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, 18 hearings in 5 years have been held on \nthis subject. Democrat Members were invited to attend hearings in \nCalifornia. Only one chose to attend.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nGosar).\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of Western Water and \nAmerican Food Security Act.\n  The Obama administration has exacerbated drought conditions in the \nWest by putting the demands of extremist special interest groups ahead \nof hard-working American families.\n  For example, Federal regulations and environmental lawsuits have \nallowed for hundreds of billions of gallons of water to be diverted \ninto the San Francisco Bay in order to protect a 3-inch fish.\n  This has had a dramatic impact, killing thousands of jobs, harming \nour food supply, and leading to unemployement levels as high as 40 \npercent in some communities.\n  H.R. 2898 is a balanced approach for combating drought conditions in \nthe West. The bill protects private water rights and prohibits Federal \ntakings. This legislation streamlines the Federal permitting process \nand will increase water storage capacity.\n  American families are hurting in the West and need some relief. H.R. \n2898 will help ensure a reliable water supply for our citizens and our \nNation's ag producers.\n  I urge adoption of this commonsense bill.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, more clarification is needed. We continue \nto hear about this legendary 3-inch fish that is apparently taking so \nmuch water from Californians.\n  Facts are stubborn things. And the facts are that, over the last 2 \nyears, that 3-inch fish has taken exactly zero water from those who \ndepend on water diverted out of the delta system.\n  As for employment levels, certainly folks are hurting from this \ndrought throughout California and in other Western States.\n  But with reference to agricultural employment, thanks to the \nincredible productivity of our farmers in California, ag employment was \nactually up 2 percent last year, another stubborn fact that needs to be \nremembered so that we can get the context of this bill right.\n  I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nGrijalva), our distinguished ranking member of the Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me \nthe time and for the good work he has done on the water issues in our \ncommittee and for the rational thought he brings to the discussion.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Endangered Species Act is not causing the \nCalifornia drought, period. It is wrong to mislead the people living \nthrough the drought by telling them that the answer is to abolish \nenvironmental laws. It isn't.\n  But here come the House Republicans again with another unfounded \nattack on endangered species that will go extinct without ESA \nprotection.\n  Here they come again, claiming ``power grab'' and ``overreach'' every \ntime that they don't get their way.\n  Here they come again, using a serious water challenge as an excuse to \nchip away at a law they don't support, even if it is unrelated to the \nproblem at hand.\n  Millions of Californians need Congress to take this drought \nseriously. But my friends across the aisle have decided their \nopposition to the Endangered Species Act is more important, and the \ndrought in California is a convenient excuse to dismantle ESA.\n  We recently finished debating the Interior, Environment, and Related \nAgencies appropriations bill that now includes language that would \njeopardize the survival of the African elephant, greater sage-grouse, \ngray wolf, northern long-eared bat, Sonoran desert tortoise, and many \nother endangered species.\n  H.R. 2898 will add the delta smelt and several salmon and steelhead \nruns to the list of species that the House Republicans have decided we \ncan do without.\n  I guess we shouldn't be surprised. After all, the sponsor of this \nlegislation said last month on live television that he would \n``hopefully someday repeal\n\n[[Page H5247]]\n\nthe Endangered Species Act.'' That kind of rhetoric is not \nconstructive, but is a useful glimpse into the real Republican agenda.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  By showing what this bill is actually about, these comments tell us \nRepublicans know that this is a distraction from the real problem. \nCalifornia faces a crippling drought and global warming that will \ncontinue to make the State drier and hotter, and the demand for water \nfar outstrips supply.\n  Californians will have to make some tough choices in this drought, \nbut they do not need to choose to exterminate fish and wildlife \nresources that belong to the American people. Congress should not \nchoose to do so either.\n  People and wildlife can coexist, and the ESA is proving it. Since \n1973, 99 percent of protected species have survived, and the U.S. \neconomy has tripled from just over 5 trillion to more than 16 trillion. \nRestoring delta smelt, salmon, and steelheads will have additional \neconomic benefit for commercial and recreational fishermen.\n  If that isn't enough, Americans are telling us that we have to \nprotect species. Recent polling shows 90 percent of voters support ESA.\n  Sadly, this bill is just another example of House Republicans \nignoring the will of the American people and driving the extinction of \nAmerican fish and wildlife one species at a time.\n  I ask for a ``no'' vote on H.R. 2898.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Valadao), the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Wyoming, who has \nbeen a huge support on this legislation.\n  I hear on the other side that there are no real solutions in this \nbill, real solutions that actually help deliver water; and that \nfrustrates me to no end because there are a lot of solutions that have \na lot of support.\n  We also hear that this delta smelt has had no impact on pumping this \nwater out of the delta, when the Bureau of Reclamation, through their \nown estimates, say about a million acre-feet annually is impacted \nbetween the Central Valley project and the State water project. That is \na government agency that is doing the restricting and holding back the \nwater that is telling us themselves.\n  Then every year in the news, we hear another three fish were caught \nin the pumps. They are looking and counting, and they are already \nstarting to figure out when they are going to turn the pumps off again \nso they can restrict the pumping of those fish.\n  Then we hear this does not have an impact on farmworkers. Farmworkers \naren't looking for your handouts. They are sick and tired of sitting at \nhome and taking a check. They want to work. They want to produce.\n  They want to walk into a grocery store with the money they earned and \npurchase the products that they were involved in growing. To them, that \nis a sign of the American dream. It is a sign of having the opportunity \nto produce and to be a productive member of society and to show their \nfamily and raise their family in an environment that allows them to \ngrow with a little bit of respect and dignity for what they do.\n  Now, as far as the solutions in this bill that they claim don't \nexist, reservoirs are a big deal. That is what holds water so that we \ncan use it for later on in periods like now. We actually asked to \nstreamline the process so we can get those approved quicker.\n  We have asked to end the studies that have been going on for nearly \n15 years. We are 13 years into it, and $150 million of taxpayer money \nhas been spent studying these things to no end. We want to end that. I \ndon't think that is unreasonable. The President seems to think it is, \nbut I don't see how it possibly could be.\n  We target predator species that are actually having an impact on the \ndelta smelt. According to studies, you hear about 95 percent of those \ndelta smelt and salmonoid are being consumed by these predator species. \nWe offer a solution in order to take care of that problem.\n  Real science, we asked for a layer of bureaucracy. My opponent or my \nfriend from the other side seems to think it is a layer of bureaucracy, \nbut we are asking for real science to be put in place to make sure \nthat, when we decide to turn off these pumps to hurt the communities in \nthe Central Valley, to put these people out of work, that real science \nis actually used; and we actually try to verify that things are \nactually accomplishing something when we turn these pumps off.\n  As far as hearings, we have had hearings. We wanted those hearings in \nthe valley. We took the request of our friends on the other side, and \nwe had the hearing right there in Fresno in the heart of the problem so \nthey can see for themselves what this is causing, what effect this is \nhaving in our communities.\n  Like my friend from Wyoming mentioned, we had one person show up; and \nI would like to thank that gentleman for coming, Mr. Costa, and \nspending some time. It is his hometown, so he understands the issue \nwell.\n  This is something that we take very seriously. This bill is a \ncomprehensive bill that covers a lot of different topics, but it also \nhelps deliver real water. I don't know what the difference between wet \nwater and dry water is, but we are looking to deliver real water to the \nvalley.\n  If this didn't deliver real water like they claim, what are they \nafraid of? What is the fear of this legislation passing if it doesn't \ndeliver, in their own words?\n  We are looking to get some water, helping our community and helping \npeople get back to work and grow delicious, wonderful American food \nthat we are very proud of.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I just want to cite testimony from the \nUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service before the State water board \njust a few months ago, February 18, 2015, in which they testified the \ndelta smelt biological opinion has not required mandatory restrictions \non water exports since early 2013, over 2 years ago.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCosta), my distinguished colleague from Fresno.\n  I do not agree with him on this particular bill, but I do want to say \nthat he has been a champion for his district and certainly has great \ncommand of the water issue.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California for \nyielding me 2 minutes.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Western Water and \nAmerican Food Security Act that we are debating here today.\n  Yes, we are debating this issue, and this is not new. What you have \nexhibited here and seen this morning is where the water fault lines lie \nin California, and it also is reflective of many of the Western States.\n  This 4 years of historic drought has pointed out clearly that we have \na broken water system in California. Here we are on the floor, having \nanother debate over whether or not we are going to pass a bill to help \npeople because, at the end of the day, these are people problems, \npeople problems in every region of California.\n  Nowhere have those people been more impacted than in the San Joaquin \nValley, which much of us represent. These are families where parents \nhave lost their jobs, whose children are not able to attend school. \nThese are farmworkers, these are farm communities that have felt the \nmost severe impact of this drought and the water constraints that we \nnow are dealing with.\n\n  My colleagues on the Democratic side argue that this is simply a \ncause of 4 continuous dry years, and while that is partially true, it \nignores that that talking point doesn't recognize that, in fact, we \nhave a broken water system designed for 20 million people.\n  Communities in the San Joaquin Valley have seen their water supply \nreduced long term by 40 percent, and agricultural use has declined over \nthe last 40 years because we are more efficient water users. Some, in \nmy area, have had a zero water allocation the last 2 years. Zero, that \nis no water.\n  This reduced reliability has impacted every region of the State to be \nsure. It has impacted large metropolitan areas like the Silicon Valley, \nLos Angeles, San Diego, as well as the small rural and often \ndisadvantaged communities like those in the valley that I represent.\n  This measure, H.R. 2898, takes a step toward addressing this \nlongstanding imbalance by enhancing scientific management of the water \nprojects in California and then giving it greater\n\n[[Page H5248]]\n\nflexibility. It also provides additional storage.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa).\n  Mr. COSTA. I thank the gentlewoman. It provides additional \nflexibility to increase our water supply. We have to use all the water \ntools in the water management toolbox, and that includes increasing \nstorage capacity, and it is about time that we began doing that.\n  It also tries to address many of the other factors that are \npreventing the recovery of endangered species, like the invasive \nspecies that are the result of a lot of the decline in salmon in \nCalifornia.\n  Let me quote Karen Hesse, an author of ``Out of the Dust.'' She said: \n``The way I see it, hard times aren't only about money or drought or \ndust. Hard times are about losing the spirit and hope and what happens \nwhen dreams dry up.''\n  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I am here to tell you that a lot of the \ndreams are drying up in the people that I represent in the San Joaquin \nValley. This drought is crushing their spirit, making them feel as if \ntheir dreams never become a reality and too often feel like they are \nthe country cousin, literally and figuratively, of the two urban areas \nin southern California and northern California.\n  The solution that California needs is not more talking points, but \nlegislation working together on a bipartisan basis. This legislation \nstarts that process. It is a work in progress. Obviously, it will be \namended.\n  It will be changed as we work with the Senate later this fall.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McCarthy).\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding; and \nI thank my colleague on the other side, Mr. Costa, for his work on this \nin the bipartisan bill. I thank Congressman Valadao for bringing it to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. Chairman, I come from a place that is called, for a very good \nreason, ``America's salad bowl.'' We produce the vegetables; we produce \nthe fruits, and we produce the nuts that feed the Nation.\n  The Nation should know what the people in my district know: Food \ngrows where water flows, and no water equals higher food costs.\n  That is what the signs read across the district if you drive down the \nhighways, but you can see trouble in more than just the signs you read. \nYou see it in the parched farmlands, in the reservoirs that are all but \nempty, and in the faces of those whose jobs have dried up with the \nwater.\n  Now, I am talking about this as a Californian, a native from \nBakersfield, but this isn't a local problem. Half of the produce we eat \nin America is grown in California, and California is the eighth largest \neconomy in the world. When California hurts, the entire Nation hurts as \nwell.\n  This is even bigger than just California. Almost 40 percent of the \nWest is facing a severe drought, and it is undeniably clear that the \nstatus quo is unsustainable.\n  If we do nothing, people will lose their livelihoods; water prices \nalso continue to go up, and America will have to rely more and more on \nforeign food, perhaps from countries that don't have the same labor or \nenvironmental laws that we do.\n  Now, we can't make it rain, but we can't give up either. Some people \nwant to do just that, Mr. Chairman; some believe that our way of life \nhas to change, that it is time to focus on conservation above all and \nmanage our decline. I reject that.\n  If California is in decline, then the American West is in decline, \nand the hope of so many generations is in decline. We will lose that \npioneering spirit that will lead us through the 21st century.\n  Now, we have a bill before us today that rejects the idea that we \nhave reached the heights of the shining city on a hill and that it is \ntime to come back down to a world of limits and of uncertainty. We have \nnever accepted failure; nothing, not even a historic drought, will make \nus start now.\n  Here in the House, we have tried time and again to address this \nproblem. This Congress, the last two Congresses, have addressed it \nbefore we hit a historic drought. Let's not forget, just 5 years ago, \nwe had 172 percent of snowpack.\n  We talk a lot about desalinization, and I support it. What does \ndesalinization do? It takes saltwater and makes it freshwater. Why in \nCalifornia do we allow our freshwater to become saltwater? Shouldn't we \nprotect that first?\n  This bill takes ideas from both sides, as we just heard from \nCongressman Costa and from this side. We designed the bill to move as \nmuch water down south to our farms and to our cities as possible \nwithout making any fundamental changes to the environmental law.\n  In reality, this bill is very simple. It does four things in \nCalifornia. We allow water to flow through the delta. We create a \nprocess to build more storage that has been promised so many years \nbefore but has been held in bureaucratic red tape. We will increase the \nreservoirs, and we will protect the senior water rights and the \nCalifornia State water project.\n  This drought also extends beyond California. That is why this bill \nincludes so many provisions to help our friends in the Western States \nthrough their tough times as well.\n  You see, Mr. Chairman, we have a challenge before us. It is a \nchallenge of nature, yes; but it is also a change of policy, foresight, \nand plain common sense. For decades, our State and country have faced \ndroughts. For years, Californians have endured this drought.\n  Now, we are here today to move forward toward a solution. It is a \nsolution built upon ideas from, yes, Democrats and Republicans. It is a \nsolution that rejects the idea of decline and failure and says with a \nclear voice: We will not let the drought defeat us.\n  California is better than that; the West is better than that, and, \nMr. Chairman, America is better than that. We will not lose hope. We \nwill solve the problem with or without you.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, could I inquire as to the balance of my \ntime?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 8\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from Wyoming has 15\\3/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the majority leader's \nstatements about when freshwater becomes saltwater.\n  I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nThompson), who represents the part of California that understands the \nincredible ecological and economic value of that mixing zone where \nfreshwater becomes saltwater, and represents communities that are on \nthat thin blue line depending on that point at which freshwater becomes \nsaltwater. And if it were compromised, and if that saltwater were \nallowed to intrude by virtue of some of the provisions in this bill, he \nrepresents the front line of communities that would be very adversely \nimpacted.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, he is absolutely correct. In my district, if that \nfreshwater doesn't run through and run out to the ocean, the saltwater \nruns back in. I have two major cities in my district that rely on that \nfor a source of water. If this bill were to pass, their water supply is \nin jeopardy. You can't drink saltwater; it just doesn't work.\n  California is in the middle of a very extreme drought. It is not due \nto a lack of pumping; it is not because of our State's water \nregulations, and it is not because we are putting fish ahead of farms \nand people. It is because there is no rain and there is no snow. No \nbill can make it rain, but this bill makes a bad situation even worse. \nIt is wrong for California. It won't stop the drought; it won't make it \nrain; but it will kill jobs, and it will ruin drinking water for \nmillions of Californians.\n  The State of California won't support this bill because it ignores 20 \nyears of established science and undermines our extensive efforts to \nimplement equal measures to address longstanding water shortages.\n  We have been down this road before in California. We ignored science \nand we diverted water out of the Klamath River, and nearly 80,000 \nspawning salmon died. Communities were devastated and livelihoods were \nlost.\n\n[[Page H5249]]\n\n  This bill also sets a dangerous precedent for every other State in \nour country. California has longstanding water management rules. This \nbill overrides the very system of water regulations that Californians \nthemselves devised to govern our State's water supply. It tells local \nresource managers and water districts how to administer their water \nsupply.\n  If we pass this bill, we are telling every State in America that we \nare okay with the Federal Government undermining local experts and \nState laws from coast to coast. If that weren't enough, this bill also \nundercuts longstanding environmental laws.\n  The legislation we are debating today redefines the standard by which \nthe Endangered Species Act is applied. This will weaken the law, \nincrease the risk of species extinction, and lead to countless lawsuits \nand costly litigation. It is as if the majority is holding wildlife \nresponsible for our lack of rain.\n  You will hear the other side talk about a little fish, the delta \nsmelt, and how we are protecting fish at the expense of people. The \ntruth is, as the gentleman from California mentioned, that protection \nof the smelt hasn't prevented one drop of water from being pumped south \nsince 2013. We haven't pumped more water south because there simply \nisn't enough water. We are in a drought.\n  I am not insensitive to the supply and demand reality of California's \nwater. I understand the concerns of the Central Valley farmers. I am a \nfarmer myself. But if my well runs dry, the solution isn't to steal the \nwater from my neighbors. We need real solutions that are based on \nscience and that work for everyone. This bill is not that solution. It \nis bad for California; it is bad for other States; it is bad for our \nenvironment.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, facts are stubborn things. According to \nthe Bureau of Reclamation, biological opinions involving species did \nreduce Central Valley's exports by 62,200 acre-feet in 2014. Already \nthis year, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, species have reduced \nCentral Valley project waters to farmers by 280,000 acre-feet. Again, \nmy source is the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  At this time, Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Bishop), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, the other day, Topper Shutt in his \nbroadcast, said, ``Today is going to be a glorious day.'' He obviously \nwas talking about the sunshine outside, which means we should have done \nthis bill yesterday so I could be on my deck right now, but that is \nbeside the point.\n  This is, though, a glorious day because we are finally doing a \nsolution that helps people. Instead of just kicking the can down the \nroad again for another year, we are going to find a solution to this \nproblem, this problem of a drought that is affecting the entire West to \nsuch a degree that one would think that Nostradamus' quatrains have \ncome true. But what we are doing here is finding a solution.\n  Many of the opponents of this bill would simply say let's pass more \nrain dances and hope something happens. What we are doing here is \ntaking the advice of our pioneer forefathers and saying what we have, \nsave. Do it as storage. And not just for California, but for the entire \nWest. That is the purpose behind this particular bill.\n  There are some concerns about environmental issues that may or may \nnot have been wise to do in the past. That is not the concern of this \nbill. We are not stopping any of that. What we are doing is finding a \ncreative way to provide for that, but also provide a way of getting \nwater to people where they need it.\n  In the middle of the last century, we did water projects and \nhydropower projects that helped us win the war. Now is the time to do \nwater projects and hydropower projects to help us feed people in this \nNation and in the entire world and to help out areas that have up to 50 \npercent unemployment. I have been down there and I have seen those \nparticular communities, many of them first- and second-generation \nAmericans, minorities who only want to provide a decent living for \nthemselves and for their families and to work.\n  What we need to do is actually solve this problem so we can put \npeople to work to provide food for this country and to provide jobs for \npeople and to help people. That is what this bill is about: finally \nhelping people with creative solutions. If the Romans could build an \naqueduct system to move water, we can build a system to move water that \nactually helps people. This is about people.\n  Pass this bill. Let's move it on. Let's solve the problem.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas), my colleague from Los \nAngeles, a city that, frankly, is pioneering some of the most promising \nwater management strategies we have in California, strategies that are \nreflected in our alternative bill, for which I am grateful Mr. Cardenas \nis a cosponsor. They are stretching water supplies not just using \nimported water wisely, but managing recycled water, groundwater, \ntreating storm water, working on the cutting edge. They deserve Federal \nsupport for those proven strategies, support that our colleagues across \nthe aisle have withheld for too many years.\n\n  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding me \ntime. Thank you for your wonderful work always on these issues.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a failure to communicate, \na failure to communicate our priorities, but, more importantly, as \nlegislators, a failure to work on compromise.\n  California is currently facing a historic drought. We can no longer \ntake water for granted. Every single Californian has been forced to \nexamine how much we truly depend on clean, reliable water in our \neveryday lives. Cities, residents, and businesses around the State are \ncutting back, but it is not enough. Unless the Western United States \nexperiences significant rainfall in the near future, we will see ghost \ntowns in extreme hardship for the most at-risk populations of our \nState.\n  While much of the coverage in the media has been on brown lawns \nacross the State and the rationing that is going on, the real impacts \nthreaten the lives of hard-working families throughout our State.\n  Take a trip through California's Central Valley. There you will see \nthe gravity of the situation. You will see unemployment rates double or \ntriple the national average, forcing families into makeshift dwellings \nthat remind us of the Hoovervilles during the Dust Bowl. These families \naren't thinking of their brown lawns. They are thinking of the fact \nthat they have lost their home. These families want their jobs back. \nThey want to go to work so that they can feed their children.\n  This bill and the various Democratic alternatives are works in \nprogress. We have to find a solution, but this bill is not it.\n  If we are serious about facing the challenges our constituents sent \nus here to solve, I am ready and willing to work with you, and with \nyou, to make the necessary, tough decisions and compromises.\n  I look forward to working with Mr. Costa, whose district is facing \nthe most significant impacts, and Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara \nBoxer to craft a stronger bipartisan and bicameral solution.\n  We have no choice but to find better ways to capture and transport \nwater in all parts of the State to meet the needs of the people and our \neconomy while protecting the environment and delicate species. We must \nnot use this time of need as a way to pick partisan fights. We have to \nfind legislation that protects our environment while we also protect \nCalifornia families.\n  Lives are at stake. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to come together \nand work together.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Calvert), chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior and \nEnvironment of the House Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, here we go again, debating solutions to California's \nwater woes, with each side making similar arguments we have heard for \nyears.\n  In fact, more than a decade ago, I was standing in this very spot, in \nthe middle of the debate of the last significant Western water law that \nCongress has passed. We passed the CALFED law\n\n[[Page H5250]]\n\nin 2004 and hoped that it would help California establish reliable and \naffordable water supplies that would help us get through dry spells \nlike we are currently experiencing.\n  So why are we back here again debating many of the same issues? The \nsimplest answer to that question is we allowed the ``don't build \nanything'' faction in California to block the critical investments we \nneed to make in our State's water infrastructure.\n  The CALFED law authorized feasibility studies for large water storage \nprojects like Temperance Flat, Sites Reservoir, Upper San Joaquin, \nexpanding Los Vaqueros Reservoir and raising Shasta Dam. A decade \nlater, our State's population has grown by 3 million new residents, and \nthose projects are still being studied. Think about that for a second. \nCalifornia's population has grown the same amount as the population of \nthe entire State of Iowa, and we haven't made a significant investment \nin our water infrastructure to accommodate those residents.\n  It is well past time to stop talking about these projects and start \nbuilding them. Thankfully, the bill before us will move us in that \ndirection by requiring our resource agencies to finally complete those \ndecade-long feasibility studies.\n  Of course, building water storage doesn't help us in the short term, \nand it also requires excess water that can be diverted. That is why the \nWestern Water and American Food Security Act injects commonsense and \nscience in the operation of our water infrastructure.\n  When it does rain again, we simply can't afford to make the same \nmistakes we have made in the past and allow millions of gallons to flow \nout to the Pacific Ocean. Those wasted flows don't benefit the \nenvironment, farmers, or California residents, and they must be \ndirected to a higher, better use.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Fortenberry). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, we have a clear choice before us today. We \ncan continue to listen to those who oppose investing in California's \nwater infrastructure and we can believe we can restrict our way out of \nthis problem, or we can recognize that California's situation today is \nfar worse than it should be precisely because of our failure to build \nadequate water storage and restore more science and commonsense into \nour water policies that are operating today.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support the Western Water and \nAmerican Food Security Act so that we can avoid being back here on the \nHouse floor during California's next drought having these very same \narguments.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Garamendi), from the Sacramento Valley.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues.\n  We have been here before. I have listened to my colleagues who are \nthe proponents of this bill over the last 5 years. As the previous \nspeaker said, we have gone down this path before.\n  There really is a solution. Unfortunately, I guess all of us, in one \nway or another, hang on to our past rhetoric and ignore the opportunity \nthat really demands our attention now to develop a comprehensive, good \npolicy for California.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  There is a lot in this bill that goes in the proper direction, and it \nis an improvement over the past bills. There is no doubt about it.\n  The issue of moving forward with the projects that are necessary, \nthat is all good, dams and other kinds of programs and the aquifer \nrestoration. It is a good deal. However, in this bill, there are things \nthat are very, very troublesome.\n  You cannot mandate by law the operations of the water systems in \nCalifornia or anywhere else. You cannot specify how they will be \noperating because you do not know on a day-to-day or a year-to-year or \na month-to-month basis what is actually going to be on the ground.\n  So that portion of the bill that sets out those operating procedures \nshould be removed. Goals, yes. Operating procedures, no. It just won't \nwork.\n  As said by both the Federal and State governments, if you were to \nmove this bill forward into law, you would create chaos in California. \nEvery paragraph, every comma, every word, in California water law--both \nin law and in court decisions--sets the precedent, but, unfortunately, \nthis bill overrides that.\n  We are very close to it. We can put this together. My colleague, Mr. \nHuffman, has a proposal that is comprehensive, and it ought to be \nintegrated into our programs and it ought to be integrated into this \nbill. But the kind of compromise and discussion that is necessary to \ndevelop a law that actually works has not been undertaken.\n  I would urge my colleagues, the proponents of this bill, to slow it \ndown, to let the State and Federal Governments continue to do what they \nare doing, and that is to operate this system to the maximum potential \ndespite the fact that there is very, very little water.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. We can do this, but we have to work together. \nUnfortunately, that has not occurred; so I urge my colleagues, the \nproponents of this bill, to take the time to meet with those of us who \nwill be the losers if this bill moves forward. We can all be winners.\n  I draw your attention to Mr. Huffman's legislation, which is \ncomprehensive, which will work, and which could be integrated into this \nlegislation.\n  In the meantime, I continue to oppose it.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, respectfully, when I was in the Central \nValley in California, I saw chaos. It is already happening, and the \npeople are desperate for a solution.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nNunes).\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, for 7 or 8 years, continually, the \nRepublicans have offered solutions and, continually, nearly all of the \nDemocrats have voted ``no.''\n  This isn't about solutions, because the real solution the left wants \nis to idle over a million acres of farm ground in the San Joaquin \nValley. This is why the forefathers of our State built a system that \nwould withstand a drought of 5 years.\n  Look, we need additional storage, but everyone in this body--anyone \nwho knows anything about water--knows that, if you don't fix the \nplumbing in the delta, if you don't deal with the San Joaquin River \nsettlement and if you don't build a few new storage projects, over a \nmillion acres of farm ground are going to go idle.\n  Those are the facts. Conveniently, most of my friends who are up here \nspeaking on the left live in the coastal areas and get their water--\nthey steal their water--from our area to give themselves pristine \ndrinking water. That is what they do.\n  Now we are going to be left with the chaos that has developed from \nover a million acres of farm ground coming out of production unless the \nSenate can take and act on this legislation quickly.\n  Mr. Chair, in the summer of 2002, shortly before I was elected to \nCongress, I sat through an eye-opening meeting with representatives \nfrom the Natural Resources Defense Council and several local \nenvironmental activist groups. Hoping to convince me to support various \nwater restrictions, they argued that San Joaquin Valley farmers should \nstop growing alfalfa and cotton in order to save water--though they \nallowed that the planting of high-value crops such as almonds could \ncontinue.\n  Then, as our discussion turned to the groups' overall vision for the \nSan Joaquin Valley, they told me something astonishing:\n  Their goal was to remove 1.3 million acres of farmland from \nproduction. They showed me maps that laid out their whole plan: From \nMerced all the way down to Bakersfield, and on the entire west side of \nthe Valley as well as part of the east side, productive agriculture \nwould end and the land would return to some ideal state of nature. I \nwas stunned by the vicious audacity of their goal--and I quickly \nlearned how dedicated they were to realizing it.\n\n[[Page H5251]]\n\n                How to Steal Water and get away with it\n\n  For decades, extreme environmentalists have pursued this goal in \nCalifornia with relentless determination. The method they have used to \ndepopulate the targeted land--water deprivation--has been ruthless and \neffective.\n  Much of the media and many politicians blame the San Joaquin Valley's \nwater shortage on drought, but that is merely an aggravating factor. \nFrom my experience representing California's agricultural heartland, I \nknow that our water crisis is not an unfortunate natural occurrence; it \nis the intended result of a long-term campaign waged by radical \nenvironmentalists who resorted to political pressure as well as profuse \nlawsuits.\n  Working in cooperation with sympathetic judges and friendly federal \nand state officials, environmental groups have gone to extreme lengths \nto deprive the San Joaquin Valley, the heart of much of the U.S. \nagricultural production, of much-needed water. Consider the following \nactions they took:\n  The Central Valley Project Improvement Act: Backed by the NRDC, \nSierra Club and other extreme environmental groups, large Democratic \nmajorities in Congress passed the CVPIA in 1992 after attaching it to a \nmust-pass public lands bill. The act stipulated that 800,000 acre-feet \nof water--or 260 billion gallons--on the Valley's west side had to be \ndiverted annually to environmental causes, with an additional 400,000 \nacre-feet later being diverted annually to wildlife refuges.\n  Smelt and salmon biological opinions: Lawsuits filed by the NRDC and \nsimilar organizations forced the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service to issue, respectively, biological \nopinions on smelt (in 2008) and on salmon (in 2009). These opinions \nvirtually ended operation of the Jones and Banks pumping plants--the \ntwo major pumping stations that move San Joaquin River Delta water--and \nresulted in massive diversions of water for environmental purposes.\n  The San Joaquin River Settlement: After nearly two decades of \nlitigation related to a lawsuit filed in 1988 by the National Resources \nDefense Council, Sierra Club and other environmental groups, San \nJoaquin Valley agriculture organizations agreed to a settlement in \n2006, later approved by a Democratic Congress and signed into law by \nPresident Obama. The settlement created the San Joaquin River \nRestoration Program. The program, which aims to create salmon runs \nalong the San Joaquin River, required major new water diversions from \nValley communities. Despite warnings from me and other California \nRepublicans, agriculture groups naively approved the settlement based \non false promises by the settlement's supporters that Valley water \nsupplies would eventually be restored at some future, unspecified date.\n  Groundwater regulation: In September 2014, California Gov. Jerry \nBrown approved regulations requiring that water basins implement plans \nto achieve ``groundwater sustainability''--essentially limiting how \nmuch water locals can use from underground storage supplies. But these \npumping restrictions, slated to take effect over the next decade, will \nreduce access to what has become the final water source for many Valley \ncommunities, which have increasingly turned to groundwater pumping as \ntheir surface water supplies were drastically cut.\n\n\n                         A Litany Of Hypocrisy\n\n  As radical groups have pursued this campaign to dry up the San \nJoaquin Valley, it's worth noting some of their stunning \ncontradictions, hypocrisies, fallacies and failures:\n  ``There's not enough water in California'': Environmentalists often \nclaim that the California water crisis stems from the state not having \nenough water to satisfy its rapidly growing population, especially \nduring a drought.\n  However, the state in fact has abundant water flowing into the Delta, \nwhich is the heart of California's irrigation structure. Water that \noriginates in the snowpack of the Sierra Nevada Mountains runs off into \nthe Delta, which has two pumping stations that help distribute the \nwater throughout the state.\n  But on average, due to environmental regulations as well as a lack of \nwater storage capacity (attributable, in large part, to activist \ngroups' opposition to new storage projects), 70% of the water that \nenters the Delta is simply flushed into the ocean. California's water \ninfrastructure was designed to withstand five years of drought, so the \ncurrent crisis, which began about three years ago, should not be a \ncrisis at all. During those three years, the state has flushed more \nthan 2 million acre-feet of water--or 652 billion gallons--into the \nocean due to the aforementioned biological opinions, which have \nprevented the irrigation infrastructure from operating at full \ncapacity.\n  ``Farmers use 80% of California's water'': Having deliberately \nreduced the California water supply through decades of litigation, the \nradicals now need a scapegoat for the resulting crisis. So they blame \nfarmers (``big agriculture,'' as they call them) for using 80% of the \nstate's water.\n  This statistic, widely parroted by the media and some politicians, is \na gross distortion. Of the water that is captured for use, farmers get \n40%, cities get 10% and a full 50% goes to environmental purposes--that \nis, it gets flushed into the ocean. By arbitrarily excluding the huge \nenvironmental water diversion from their calculations--as if it is \nsomehow irrelevant to the water crisis--environmentalists deceptively \ndouble the farmers' usage from 40% to 80%.\n  If at first you don't succeed, do the exact same thing: Many of the \nDelta water cuts stem from the radicals' litigation meant to protect \nsalmon and smelt. Yet after decades of water reductions, the salmon \npopulation fluctuates wildly, while the smelt population has fallen to \nhistoric lows. The radicals' solution, however, is always to dump even \nmore water from the Delta into the ocean, even though this approach has \nfailed time and again.\n  The striped bass absurdity: If the radicals really want to protect \nsalmon and the Delta smelt, its a bit of a mystery why they also \nchampion protections for the striped bass, a non-native species that \neats both salmon and smelt.\n  Hetch Hetchy hypocrites: The San Francisco Bay Area provides a \nprimary support base for many environmental groups. Lucky for them, \ntheir supporters don't have to endure the kinds of hardships these \norganizations have foisted on San Joaquin Valley communities.\n  While the radicals push for ever-harsher water restrictions in the \nValley, their Bay Area supporters enjoy an unimpeded water supply piped \nin across the state from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite \nNational Park. This water is diverted around the Delta, meaning it does \nnot contribute to the Delta's water quality standards. Environmental \ngroups have conveniently decided not to subject Hetch Hetchy water to \nany sort of litigation that would cut the supply to the Bay Area.\n  We're from the government, and we're here to help: Government \nagencies that catch smelt as part of scientific population measurements \nactually kill more of the fish than are destroyed in the supposedly \nkiller water pumps.\n  Hitchhiking salmon: The San Joaquin River Settlement is estimated \nalready to have cost taxpayers $1.2 billion--and it's clear to me that \nthe total price tag will likely exceed $2 billion--in a disastrous \neffort to restore salmon runs to the San Joaquin River.\n  Moreover, the settlement legislation defines success as reintroducing \n500 salmon to the river, which means spending $4 million per fish. The \nsalmon, which have not been in the river for more than half a century, \nhave proved so incapable of sustaining themselves that agents have \nresorted to plucking them out of the water and trucking them wherever \nthey are supposed to go. It is a badly kept secret among both \nenvironmentalists and federal officials that this project has already \nfailed.\n  A man-made state of nature: The radicals claim they want to reverse \nhuman depredations in the Delta and restore fish to their natural \nhabitat. Yet the entire Delta system is not natural at all. It's a man-\nmade network of islands that functions only thanks to upstream water \nstorage projects. In fact, without man-made storage projects, canals \nand dams, in dry years such as this the rivers would quickly run dry, \nmeaning there would be no water and no fish.\n\n\n                         A Three-Step Solution\n\n  The radicals have pursued their plan methodically and successfully; \nbetween the CVPIA, the biological opinions, and the San Joaquin River \nSettlement, around a million acres of farmland have been idled. What's \nleft of the water supply is inadequate for sustaining Valley farming \ncommunities: South of the Delta, we now face an annual water supply \ndeficit of approximately 2.5 million acre-feet, or 815 billion gallons.\n  In fact, with the state groundwater regulations announced last year, \nthe radicals are poised to achieve their goal. The depletion of \ngroundwater is a direct effect--and indeed, was an intended result--of \nthe radicals' assault on our surface water.\n  (After all, if farmers, churches, schools and communities can't get \nsurface water, they'll predictably resort to ground water.)\n  But the radicals have perversely cited the groundwater depletion they \nthemselves engineered to justify regulating the groundwater supply. \nThis is the final step in their program, since many farmers will not be \nable to keep growing food if they continue to receive zero water \nallocations and are restricted from tapping enough ground water.\n  The Valley cannot endure this situation much longer, but the good \nnews is that it's not too late to save our communities. Led by the \nValley's Republican delegation, the U.S. House has passed legislation \ntwice that would bring a long-term end to the water crisis. The \nsolution comprises these three simple measures:\n  Return Delta pumping to normal operations at federal and state pumps. \nBecause normal\n\n[[Page H5252]]\n\npumping levels are already paid for, this measure would cost taxpayers \nzero dollars.\n  Fix the San Joaquin River Settlement. Instead of continuing to spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars on an unworkable scheme to recreate \nsalmon runs, we should turn the San Joaquin River into a year-round \nflowing river with recirculated water This approach would be good for \nthe warm-water fish habitat and for recreation, and it would save \ntaxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars that will otherwise go down \nthe salmon-run rat hole.\n  Expedite and approve construction of major new water projects. This \nshould include building the Temperance Flat dam along the San Joaquin \nRiver, raising Shasta dam to increase its reservoir capacity, expanding \nthe San Luis Reservoir and approving construction of the Sites \nReservoir in the Sacramento Valley. Because water users themselves \nshould rightfully pay for these projects, they would cost federal \ntaxpayers zero dollars.\n  These measures would not only end the water crisis, they would \nimprove the environment for fish and wildlife--all while saving \ntaxpayer dollars.\n\n\n                         The Price Of Inaction\n\n  I warned of the likely outcome of the radicals' campaign in my \ntestimony to a House committee back in 2009:\n  ``Failure to act, and it's over. You will witness the collapse of \nmodern civilization in the San Joaquin Valley.''\n  That is indeed the grim future facing the Valley if we don't change \nour present trajectory. The solution passed twice by the U.S. House, \nhowever, was blocked by Senate Democrats, who were supported by the \nadministration of Gov. Brown as well as the Obama administration. These \nDemocrats need to begin speaking frankly and honestly with San Joaquin \nValley communities, and with Californians more broadly, about the \neffects of idling 1.3 million acres of farmland. This will ruin not \nonly Valley farming operations, but will wipe out entire swathes of \nassociated local businesses and industries.\n  The damage is not limited to the Valley. Although residents of \ncoastal areas such as Los Angeles, the Bay Area and San Diego have been \nled to believe they are being subject to water restrictions due to the \ndrought, that's not actually true. As in the Valley, these areas and \nmany others ultimately depend on the Delta pumps for their water \nsupply. If the pumps had been functioning normally for the past decade, \nnone of these cities would be undergoing a water crisis today.\n  And it's a safe bet that Brown's mandatory water reductions will not \nalleviate the crisis, leading to a drastic increase in restrictions in \nthe not-too-distant future. Watering your lawn, washing your car and \ncountless other everyday activities will be banned up and down \nCalifornia. In their mania to attack Central Valley farming, the \nradicals are inadvertently running the entire state out of water.\n\n\n                                Endgame\n\n  Many organizations representing California agriculture, including \nwater districts and--shockingly--even some San Joaquin Valley cities \nand counties, became part of the problem instead of the solution, \nhaving lent no support to the House-passed water bills. Suffering from \na strange kind of Stockholm Syndrome, many of these groups and agencies \nhope that if they meekly accept their fate, their overlords will \nmagnanimously bestow a few drops of water on them.\n  This mousy strategy, which willfully ignores what the radicals are \nreally trying to achieve, hasn't worked out well for growers of almonds \nand other high-value crops. Although the radicals had been promising \nthem a free pass back when the groups met with me in 2002, these \ngrowers have CS now become the radicals' primary scapegoat for the \nwater crisis. This condemnation is reflected in articles such as The \nAtlantic's ``The Dark Side of Almond Use,'' The Guardian's ``Alarm as \nAlmond Farms Consume California's Water,'' and Bloomberg View's ``Amid \na Drought, Cue the Almond Shaming.''\n  Sadly, the end is near for communities whose land will be forced out \nof production. One hopes the affected families will eventually find a \nmore welcome home in some other state where those who wield power \nappreciate folks who grow our food instead of demonize them.\n  But for now, the pitiless, decades-long assault to deprive them of \ntheir livelihoods is hurtling toward its apex. Meanwhile, many of those \ncapable of advancing a solution are content to wring their hands, blame \nglobal warming and continue whistling past the graveyard.\n  Agriculture groups, water districts and municipalities that refuse to \nsupport the two House-passed bills owe their constituents an \nalternative solution that will resolve our water shortfall. Water \nbureaucrats who ignore or oppose the most prominent, viable solutions \nwhile offering no alternative are, in effect, complicit in the \nradicals' long struggle. They should publicly declare which land ought \nto come out of production and which Valley industries should be \neliminated since they have no proposals to steer us away from that \noutcome.\n  The Valley's critical situation today demands unity around \nconstructive solutions. To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, we must all \nhang together, or we will surely all hang separately.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Denham).\n  Mr. DENHAM. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding on this important \nissue.\n  Mr. Chairman, some will say they are not voting for this bill because \nof the challenges they perceive are in it. The biggest problem with \nthis bill is that it doesn't do enough.\n  We need millions of new acre-feet of water. We should be looking at \nthe next generation. I want my kids to farm, but without new water \nsupplies, we continue to see farmers go out of business.\n  That speaks to the security of our food supply as a country. You \ncan't farm with a zero allocation of water, which is why you see the \nhigh unemployment, which is why you see farmworkers who are going to be \nhomeless and without jobs this year, which is why you will see more \nfarms go out of business.\n  This is a battle that has gone on for quite some time, but this bill \ndeals with some very small issues that will be very significant this \nyear.\n  We need to have the full debate about what our country is going to do \nwith its water supplies and the greater storage that we are going to \nneed in the future.\n  Yet, we are dealing with some commonsense issues like predator fish? \nWhy would we try to save fish only to allow them to be eaten by a \nnonnative fish that eats 98 percent of the fish that we are spending \nmillions of dollars to preserve?\n  That is not an environmental solution any more than trucking fish \naround a river because the river can't handle the fish.\n  If you want to be an extremist, be an extremist and deal with the \ncommonsense solution here. This bill moves us in the right direction.\n  This will help farms stay in business, and this will allow us to \ncontinue to have jobs in the Central Valley and a vibrant food supply \nfor the rest of the country.\n  This bill is ripe for passing this morning, and we would ask for a \nbipartisan vote.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Tipton).\n  Mr. TIPTON. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Western Water and American \nFood Security Act of 2015.\n  My Water Rights Protection Act, incorporated as part of H.R. 2898, \nwould uphold State water law and priority-based systems and provide \nwater users with a line of defense from increasingly brazen Federal \nattempts to take private water rights without compensation.\n  These Federal water grabs undermine long-held State water law, \npriority-based systems, and our private priority rights. By extorting \nwater rights from those who hold water rights under State law, the \nFederal Government is overreaching, violating private property rights \nand the U.S. Constitution.\n  Federal land management agency attempts to take or to control private \nwater rights and circumvent State law have put the ski community, \ngrazers, municipalities, and local businesses at risk.\n  These private property rights are vital to Colorado and to the \nWestern U.S. when it pertains to water. Many businesses depend on them \nas collateral to be able to get loans, expand, and create jobs.\n  Water is our lifeblood. Water users need certainty that the Federal \nland management agencies are prohibited from future attempts to take \nprivately held water rights.\n  This legislation offers a sensible approach to preserve those rights. \nI urge its passage.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I was going to put this \nup,\n\n[[Page H5253]]\n\nbut I don't know how to work the tripod very well. But it is a very \nimportant issue, and this is a very important chart because many have \nasked: Why would somebody from Illinois come talk about a bill that has \nto do with water in California?\n  Look at this chart. 99 percent of the almonds, 99 percent of the \ndates, and 99 percent of the kiwis that we eat in central Illinois, in \nmy district, come from the Central Valley of California. All of those \ncrops need water to grow.\n  Now, I want to thank my colleague from California (Mr. Valadao) for \nintroducing this bill. This is important to me because I have seen the \nCentral Valley of California. I understand the importance of this \nindustry to my consumers and as the subcommittee chairman on the House \nAgriculture Committee's Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, \nand Research.\n  The issues we face here--changing policies in Washington, D.C.--\naffect the price of food that my consumers pay back in Illinois and \naffect the many Californians living in the Central Valley who are \ndealing with this tremendous issue.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill. I want to thank all of my \ncolleagues who are here today and encourage them once more.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Mimi Walters).\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chairman, this year marks \nCalifornia's fourth consecutive year of the drought. In California \nalone, over 37 million people are impacted by the drought.\n  The economic cost of the drought is expected to be nearly $3 billion, \nand almost 19,000 agriculture-related jobs will be lost as a result.\n  Our current drought is not the result of a lack of rain. It is the \nresult of failed policies that have mismanaged critical water resources \nthroughout the West.\n  My colleagues and I in the House come before you today with a \nsolution: the Western Water and American Food Security Act of 2015. \nThis vital bill will modernize our water infrastructure into the 21st \ncentury and will ensure that California is well equipped to handle \nfuture drought crises.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to stand with me as we \nwork to provide Californians with the water resources they need.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Knight).\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2898, the Western \nWater and American Food Security Act. And I will give just a couple of \nexamples.\n  I live in the desert of southern California. I am not a northern \nCalifornia person, and I am not a Central Valley person, but I am a \ndesert rat in California who understands water is imperative to all of \nour needs.\n  What is happening in my district right now is a 35 percent reduction \nin water. That is what they are requesting. All of our water companies \nhave come forward and have said that they are raising the rates between \n30 and 40 percent.\n  Now, let me tell you that you cannot reduce your water by 35 percent. \nYou just cannot do it in a single family house. You can reduce. You can \nget down to about 10 or 15 percent. But when you are talking 35 \npercent, it just doesn't happen. That is the life we are living in \ntoday.\n\n  I have been sitting here for about an hour, and I have taken a few \nnotes about what might happen if we pass this.\n  One of the things that hit me was reignite the environmental wars, \nreignite the problems that we are having with water in California.\n  Let me tell you that I don't believe there is a State in the Union \nthat is going through as many adjudications of water than is happening \nin California right now.\n  If we are talking about reigniting the water wars or about reigniting \nthe environmental wars, they are happening today, right now.\n  In my district alone, we have water adjudication that has been going \non for 17 years. If we are talking about reigniting the environmental \nwars, it is happening right now, today. It is not just the delta smelt. \nIt is the environmental impacts that we are putting on fish above \npeople.\n  In my district, again, we have an issue where the Department of Water \nand Power from L.A. cannot release water down a canyon to help the \npeople in the canyon because we have the stickleback fish in there.\n  They are afraid that it is going to harm that fish; so they have \nreduced the water from 1,200 acre-feet a year to 300 acre-feet. The \nenvironmental wars are happening in California today.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. KNIGHT. If we do not do something today, then when? When do we do \nsomething? When do we go back to our constituents and say that we are \nactually working on the number one priority in California? A State \nwithout water is dead.\n  I did a tele-town hall 2 weeks ago. I took 18 phone calls in 1 hour. \nThere were 17 phone calls that were on water, and on one phone call, he \nhad no idea what he was talking about. But 17 phone calls out of 18 \nwere on water. This is the number one priority.\n  If not today, when?\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, we have no more speakers, and we are \nprepared to close.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  We have a bill, unfortunately, that would run roughshod over \nCalifornia State law with respect to water, with respect to the \nmanagement of wildlife.\n  It is a bill that would do harm to the Endangered Species Act and \nother environmental Federal laws. It is a bill that would, indeed, \nignite a water war rather than seriously solve problems on this \nimportant issue.\n  Don't take it from me. Take it from other serious voices that have \nexamined this bill and the Democratic alternative. Take it from the Los \nAngeles Times. Take it from the San Francisco Chronicle. Take it from \nthe Department of the Interior and from the Obama administration, which \nhas issued a veto threat.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  This is the same bill that has passed on party lines each of the last \nfew years, only to be parked in the Senate and go nowhere. It is high \ntime that we start talking to each other and working with each other on \nserious, bipartisan solutions for our water challenges instead of \nplaying party politics. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I would prefer to take it from the farmers \nwho are desperate for water. These are people who have instituted \nconservation measures that cost them millions of dollars, changing \ntheir crops from things like lettuce and tomatoes to almond and \npistachio trees with drip irrigation systems that conserve tremendous \namounts of water. Still, those trees were allowed to dry up and die.\n  Mr. Chairman, to close, I yield the remainder of my time to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Valadao), the sponsor of this bill.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking so many \non both sides of the aisle who worked very hard on this legislation. We \nspent months working on this. We have crafted it throughout the \nbeginning of this Congress, and it has been an important bill. It is \ngoing to continue to be an important bill. We look forward to seeing \nwho has the courage to stand up and actually vote to help the folks of \nCalifornia.\n  When we see the situation that is going on out there in the valley \nand we see the faces of these people standing in the food lines, the \npeople who have worked so hard for so many years to help build farms, \nto help build businesses for their families and we see those \nfarmworkers who have come and had the opportunity to put their kids \nthrough school. Many of them end up in really great places, some of \nthem even in Congress, like myself. You see so many different \nopportunities that come from the valley.\n  When we have a situation like we have today, where we have literally \nbeen cut off from water, we have had years in the past decade where we \nhave\n\n[[Page H5254]]\n\nhad abundance of water and abundance of snowpack, and we still get a \nsmall fraction of the contracted amounts. Now, today, we are down to \nzero.\n  When people speak of conservation, we have got to find a way to \nconserve water, we have got to find a way to save water, absolutely. We \nhave done those things. We have implemented a lot of different \nprograms, from drip irrigation, to change of crops, to even trying to \nbreed better, more drought-tolerant crops.\n  We have done what we can. We do it in our homes; we have done it in \nthe way we live our lives, but at the end of the day, you can't \nconserve anything from zero because zero is nothing. There is nothing \nleft. What it has done to our economy, what it has done to the people \nin the valley, what it has done to the Nation, what it has done to food \ncosts across the Nation, when we look at all the different programs, \nwhen we are looking for a place to save money, food cost is having a \nhuge impact on us all throughout the country.\n  I ask for an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2898 \nbecause it upends decades of state and federal water law and needlessly \npits water users against one another. In the midst of California's \nworst drought in its history, this bill mandates that certain interests \ncome out ahead of others.\n  California is currently in the fourth year of a punishing drought \nthat has forced every resident to conserve water, has caused millions \nof acres of agricultural land to be fallowed, and places us at risk of \nmajor wildfires. But, this crisis should not be used as an excuse to \npermanently upend a century of water law and countless protections for \nthreatened and endangered wildlife.\n  H.R. 2898 will weaken or override decades of state and federal law, \nincluding California state water law and the California Constitution; \nthe state and federal Endangered Species Acts; the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act; and the San Joaquin River Settlement Act. \nThis list should set off alarm bells for any proponent of states' \nrights or cooperative federalism. For over a century, the federal \ngovernment has deferred to state water law whenever possible, but this \nbill unwinds that history entirely.\n  And what do we gain by discarding a century of water law and species \nprotections? According to the Department of Interior which manages the \nDelta collaboratively with the state, this bill ``will not provide \nadditional meaningful relief to those most affected by the drought.'' \nLocal conservationists predict that this bill would cause a complete \nextinction of the Delta smelt and would accelerate the decline of the \nwild salmon and steelhead runs in California which have been an \nimportant part of the Northern California economy since the mid-19th \ncentury.\n  Instead of taking up partisan legislation that will start a new water \nwar in California, Congress should be providing immediate relief to \ndrought-impacted communities and should invest in long-term drought \nresilience measures such as conservation, recycling, and desalination, \nwhich would drastically increase the amount of water available to \nfarmers in the Central Valley.\n  This irresponsible bill would override science-based management of \nthe delicate Delta infrastructure and would gut several of our most \nbedrock environmental laws. For these reasons I strongly oppose this \nlegislation and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I rise to express my strong opposition to \nH.R. 2898, the so-called ``Western Water and American Food Security Act \nof 2015''.\n  I represent a portion of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the \nlargest estuary west of the Mississippi and the source of roughly half \nof California's fresh water. Nearly 25 million Californians rely upon \nthe Delta in one form or another for their drinking water supply. \nAdditionally, many species depend on the habitats in and around the \n700,000-acre estuary for survival. Species in the Delta include birds \nand waterfowl like sand hill cranes, and fish like Chinook salmon, \nCentral Valley steelhead and green sturgeon. Many of these species are \nunique to the Delta and found nowhere else on earth. H.R. 2898 would \ndramatically weaken protections for these ecosystems and for salmon, \nmigratory birds, and other fish and wildlife in California's Bay-Delta \nestuary, as well as the thousands of fishing jobs in California and \nOregon that depend on the health of these species.\n  California's ongoing drought--not federal environmental laws--is the \nprimary reason for low water supplies across the state. California's \ndrought is real, and we need real solutions. However, H.R. 2898 does \nnothing to solve California's severe water shortage or address drought \nacross the West. Instead, this bill preempts state laws, reduces \nmanagement flexibility, eliminates protections for salmon and other \nendangered species, and rolls back our nation's fundamental \nenvironmental laws.\n  H.R. 2898 is not a temporary response to drought. It permanently \namends and overrides the requirements of the Endangered Species Act and \nother federal laws. The bill would also limit National Environmental \nPolicy Act review for water projects, reducing transparency and \neliminating the opportunity for local communities to provide input in \nthe planning process. Moreover, several provisions of the bill would \npreempt state law, including section 313, which would override state \nlaws, federal laws, a court order, and a binding settlement agreement \nto restore the San Joaquin River.\n  This measure would undermine the State of California's groundbreaking \nwork to address the drought through the equitable implementation of \nwater conservation programs, infrastructure improvements, and \ninnovative water recycling initiatives. Water shortages are a result of \nfour dry years, not the landmark environmental protections that this \nbill seeks to undermine. This bill will not make it rain. Permanently \nrepealing proper environmental review will not solve the drought.\n  Ultimately, this bill would not fix our biggest problem--the lack of \nwater--and would instead set a dangerous precedent of federal overreach \nfor our state, and a repeal of America's longstanding and effective \nenvironmental protections. As a Californian and a Delta member, I \nstrongly oppose H.R. 2898, due to the negative impact that this bill \nwould have on my constituents and the environment.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) As established in the Proclamation of a State of \n     Emergency issued by the Governor of the State on January 17, \n     2014, the State is experiencing record dry conditions.\n       (2) Extremely dry conditions have persisted in the State \n     since 2012, and the drought conditions are likely to persist \n     into the future.\n       (3) The water supplies of the State are at record-low \n     levels, as indicated by the fact that all major Central \n     Valley Project reservoir levels were at 20-35 percent of \n     capacity as of September 25, 2014.\n       (4) The lack of precipitation has been a significant \n     contributing factor to the 6,091 fires experienced in the \n     State as of September 15, 2014, and which covered nearly \n     400,000 acres.\n       (5) According to a study released by the University of \n     California, Davis in July 2014, the drought has led to the \n     fallowing of 428,000 acres of farmland, loss of $810 million \n     in crop revenue, loss of $203 million in dairy and other \n     livestock value, and increased groundwater pumping costs by \n     $454 million. The statewide economic costs are estimated to \n     be $2.2 billion, with over 17,000 seasonal and part-time \n     agricultural jobs lost.\n       (6) CVPIA Level II water deliveries to refuges have also \n     been reduced by 25 percent in the north of Delta region, and \n     by 35 percent in the south of Delta region.\n       (7) Only one-sixth of the usual acres of rice fields are \n     being flooded this fall, which leads to a significant decline \n     in habitat for migratory birds and an increased risk of \n     disease at the remaining wetlands due to overcrowding of such \n     birds.\n       (8) The drought of 2013 through 2014 constitutes a serious \n     emergency that poses immediate and severe risks to human life \n     and safety and to the environment throughout the State.\n       (9) The serious emergency described in paragraph (4) \n     requires--\n       (A) immediate and credible action that respects the \n     complexity of the water system of the State and the \n     importance of the water system to the entire State; and\n       (B) policies that do not pit stakeholders against one \n     another, which history shows only leads to costly litigation \n     that benefits no one and prevents any real solutions.\n       (10) Data on the difference between water demand and \n     reliable water supplies for various regions of California \n     south of the Delta, including the San Joaquin Valley, \n     indicate there is a significant annual gap between reliable \n     water supplies to meet agricultural, municipal and \n     industrial, groundwater, and refuges water needs within the \n     Delta Division, San Luis Unit and Friant Division of the \n     Central Valley Project and the State Water Project south of \n     the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and the demands of \n     those areas. This gap varies depending on the methodology of \n     the analysis performed, but can be represented in the \n     following ways:\n       (A) For Central Valley Project South-of-Delta water service \n     contractors, if it is assumed that a water supply deficit is \n     the difference in the amount of water available for \n     allocation versus the maximum contract quantity, then the \n     water supply deficits that have developed from 1992 to 2014 \n     as a result of legislative and regulatory changes besides \n     natural variations in hydrology during this timeframe range \n     between 720,000 and 1,100,000 acre-feet.\n       (B) For Central Valley Project and State Water Project \n     water service contractors south of the Delta and north of the \n     Tehachapi mountain range, if it is assumed that a water \n     supply deficit is the difference between reliable water \n     supplies, including maximum water contract deliveries, safe \n     yield of groundwater, safe yield of local and surface \n     supplies and long-term contracted water transfers, and water \n     demands, including water demands from agriculture, municipal \n     and industrial and refuge contractors, then the water supply \n     deficit ranges between approximately 2,500,000 to 2,700,000 \n     acre-feet.\n       (11) Data of pumping activities at the Central Valley \n     Project and State Water Project delta pumps identifies that, \n     on average from Water Year 2009 to Water Year 2014, take of \n     Delta smelt is 80 percent less than allowable take levels \n     under the biological opinion issued December 15, 2008.\n       (12) Data of field sampling activities of the Interagency \n     Ecological Program located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin \n     Estuary identifies that, on average from 2005 to 2013, the \n     program ``takes'' 3,500 delta smelt during annual surveys \n     with an authorized ``take'' level of 33,480 delta smelt \n     annually--according to the biological opinion issued December \n     9, 1997.\n       (13) In 2015, better information exists than was known in \n     2008 concerning conditions and operations that may or may not \n     lead to high salvage events that jeopardize the fish \n     populations, and what alternative management actions can be \n     taken to avoid jeopardy.\n       (14) Alternative management strategies, removing non-native \n     species, enhancing habitat, monitoring fish movement and \n     location in real-time, and improving water quality in the \n     Delta can contribute significantly to protecting and \n     recovering these endangered fish species, and at potentially \n     lower costs to water supplies.\n       (15) Resolution of fundamental policy questions concerning \n     the extent to which application of the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 affects the operation of the Central Valley Project \n     and State Water Project is the responsibility of Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FACTORING INCREASED REAL-TIME MONITORING AND \n                   UPDATED SCIENCE INTO DELTA SMELT MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Director shall use the best scientific \n     and commercial data available to implement, continuously \n     evaluate, and refine or amend, as appropriate, the reasonable \n     and prudent alternative described in the smelt biological \n     opinion, and any successor opinions or court order. The \n     Secretary shall make all significant decisions under the \n     smelt biological opinion, or any successor opinions that \n     affect Central Valley Project and State Water Project \n     operations, in writing, and shall document the significant \n     facts upon which such decisions are made, consistent with \n     section 706 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (b) Increased Monitoring To Inform Real-Time Operations.--\n     The Secretary shall conduct additional surveys, on an annual \n     basis at the appropriate time of the year based on \n     environmental conditions, in collaboration with other Delta \n     science interests.\n       (1) In implementing this section, the Secretary shall--\n       (A) use the most accurate survey methods available for the \n     detection of Delta smelt to determine the extent that adult \n     Delta smelt are distributed in relation to certain levels of \n     turbidity, or other environmental factors that may influence \n     salvage rate; and\n       (B) use results from appropriate survey methods for the \n     detection of Delta smelt to determine how the Central Valley \n     Project and State Water Project may be operated more \n     efficiently to minimize salvage while maximizing export \n     pumping rates without causing a significant negative impact \n     on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt.\n       (2) During the period beginning on December 1, 2015, and \n     ending March 31, 2016, and in each successive December \n     through March period, if suspended sediment loads enter the \n     Delta from the Sacramento River and the suspended sediment \n     loads appear likely to raise turbidity levels in the Old \n     River north of the export pumps from values below 12 \n     Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) to values above 12 NTU, \n     the Secretary shall--\n       (A) conduct daily monitoring using appropriate survey \n     methods at locations including, but not limited to, the \n     vicinity of Station 902 to determine the extent that adult \n     Delta smelt are moving with turbidity toward the export \n     pumps; and\n       (B) use results from the monitoring surveys referenced in \n     paragraph (A) to determine how increased trawling can inform \n     daily real-time Central Valley Project and State Water \n     Project operations to minimize salvage while maximizing \n     export pumping rates without causing a significant negative \n     impact on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt.\n       (c) Periodic Review of Monitoring.--Within 12 months of the \n     date of enactment of this title, and at least once every 5 \n     years thereafter, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) evaluate whether the monitoring program under \n     subsection (b), combined with other monitoring programs for \n     the Delta, is providing sufficient data to inform Central \n     Valley Project and State Water Project operations to minimize \n     salvage while maximizing export pumping rates without causing \n     a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of \n     the Delta smelt; and\n       (2) determine whether the monitoring efforts should be \n     changed in the short or long term to provide more useful \n     data.\n       (d) Delta Smelt Distribution Study.--\n       (1) In general.--No later than January 1, 2016, and at \n     least every five years thereafter, the Secretary, in \n     collaboration with the California Department of Fish and \n     Wildlife, the California Department of Water Resources, \n     public water agencies, and other interested entities, shall \n     implement new targeted sampling and monitoring specifically \n     designed to understand Delta smelt abundance, distribution, \n     and the types of habitat occupied by Delta smelt during all \n     life stages.\n       (2) Sampling.--The Delta smelt distribution study shall, at \n     a minimum--\n       (A) include recording water quality and tidal data;\n       (B) be designed to understand Delta smelt abundance, \n     distribution, habitat use, and movement throughout the Delta, \n     Suisun Marsh, and other areas occupied by the Delta smelt \n     during all seasons;\n       (C) consider areas not routinely sampled by existing \n     monitoring programs, including wetland channels, near-shore \n     water, depths below 35 feet, and shallow water; and\n       (D) use survey methods, including sampling gear, best \n     suited to collect the most accurate data for the type of \n     sampling or monitoring.\n       (e) Scientifically Supported Implementation of OMR Flow \n     Requirements.--In implementing the provisions of the smelt \n     biological opinion, or any successor biological opinion or \n     court order, pertaining to management of reverse flow in the \n     Old and Middle Rivers, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) consider the relevant provisions of the biological \n     opinion or any successor biological opinion;\n       (2) to maximize Central Valley project and State Water \n     Project water supplies, manage export pumping rates to \n     achieve a reverse OMR flow rate of -5,000 cubic feet per \n     second unless information developed by the Secretary under \n     paragraphs (3) and (4) leads the Secretary to reasonably \n     conclude that a less negative OMR flow rate is necessary to \n     avoid a negative impact on the long-term survival of the \n     Delta smelt. If information available to the Secretary \n     indicates that a reverse OMR flow rate more negative than \n     -5,000 cubic feet per second can be established without an \n     imminent negative impact on the long-term survival of the \n     Delta smelt, the Secretary shall manage export pumping rates \n     to achieve that more negative OMR flow rate;\n       (3) document in writing any significant facts about real-\n     time conditions relevant to the determinations of OMR reverse \n     flow rates, including--\n       (A) whether targeted real-time fish monitoring in the Old \n     River pursuant to this section, including monitoring in the \n     vicinity of Station 902, indicates that a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt \n     is imminent; and\n       (B) whether near-term forecasts with available salvage \n     models show under prevailing conditions that OMR flow of \n     -5,000 cubic feet per second or higher will cause a \n     significant negative impact on the long-term survival of the \n     Delta smelt;\n       (4) show in writing that any determination to manage OMR \n     reverse flow at rates less negative than -5,000 cubic feet \n     per second is necessary to avoid a significant negative \n     impact on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt, \n     including an explanation of the data examined and the \n     connection between those data and the choice made, after \n     considering--\n       (A) the distribution of Delta smelt throughout the Delta;\n       (B) the potential effects of documented, quantified \n     entrainment on subsequent Delta smelt abundance;\n       (C) the water temperature;\n       (D) other significant factors relevant to the \n     determination; and\n       (E) whether any alternative measures could have a \n     substantially lesser water supply impact; and\n       (5) for any subsequent biological opinion, make the showing \n     required in paragraph (4) for any determination to manage OMR \n     reverse flow at rates less negative than the most negative \n     limit in the biological opinion if the most negative limit in \n     the biological opinion is more negative than -5,000 cubic \n     feet per second.\n       (f) Memorandum of Understanding.--No later than December 1, \n     2015, the Commissioner and the Director will execute a \n     Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to ensure that the smelt \n     biological opinion is implemented in a manner that maximizes \n     water supply while complying with applicable laws and \n     regulations. If that MOU alters any procedures set out in the \n     biological opinion, there will be no need to reinitiate \n     consultation if those changes will not have a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival on listed species \n     and the implementation of the MOU would not be a major change \n     to implementation of the biological opinion. Any change to \n     procedures that does not create a significant negative impact \n     on the long-term survival to listed species will not alter \n     application of the take permitted by the incidental take \n     statement in the biological opinion under section 7(o)(2) of \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n       (g) Calculation of Reverse Flow in OMR.--Within 90 days of \n     the enactment of this title, the Secretary is directed, in \n     consultation with the California Department of Water \n     Resources to revise the method used to calculate reverse flow \n     in Old and Middle Rivers for implementation of the reasonable \n     and prudent alternatives in the smelt biological opinion and \n     the salmonid biological opinion, and any succeeding \n     biological opinions, for the purpose of increasing Central \n     Valley Project and State Water Project water supplies. The \n     method of calculating reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers \n     shall be reevaluated not less than every five years \n     thereafter to achieve maximum export pumping rates within \n     limits established by the smelt biological opinion, the \n     salmonid biological opinion, and any succeeding biological \n     opinions.\n\n  TITLE II--ENSURING SALMONID MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIVE TO NEW SCIENCE\n\n     SEC. 201.

The Commissioner and the Assistant \n     Administrator shall fully utilize these authorities as \n     described below.\n       (b) Annual Reviews of Certain Central Valley Project and \n     State Water Project Operations.--No later than December 31, \n     2016, and at least annually thereafter:\n       (1) The Commissioner, with the assistance of the Assistant \n     Administrator, shall examine and identify adjustments to the \n     initiation of Action IV.2.3 as set forth in the Biological \n     Opinion and Conference Opinion on the Long-Term Operations of \n     the Central Valley Project and State Water Project, \n     Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation, issued by the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service on June 4, 2009, pertaining \n     to negative OMR flows, subject to paragraph (5).\n       (2) The Commissioner, with the assistance of the Assistant \n     Administrator, shall examine and identify adjustments in the \n     timing, triggers or other operational details relating to the \n     implementation of pumping restrictions in Action IV.2.1 \n     pertaining to the inflow to export ratio, subject to \n     paragraph (5).\n       (3) Pursuant to the consultation and assessments carried \n     out under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the \n     Commissioner and the Assistant Administrator shall jointly \n     make recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior and to \n     the Secretary on adjustments to project operations that, in \n     the exercise of the adaptive management provisions of the \n     salmonid biological opinion, will reduce water supply impacts \n     of the salmonid biological opinion on the Central Valley \n     Project and the California State Water Project and are \n     consistent with the requirements of applicable law and as \n     further described in subsection (c).\n       (4) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior shall \n     direct the Commissioner and Assistant Administrator to \n     implement recommended adjustments to Central Valley Project \n     and State Water Project operations for which the conditions \n     under subsection (c) are met.\n       (5) The Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner shall \n     review and identify adjustments to Central Valley Project and \n     State Water Project operations with water supply restrictions \n     in any successor biological opinion to the salmonid \n     biological opinion, applying the provisions of this section \n     to those water supply restrictions where there are references \n     to Actions IV.2.1 and IV.2.3.\n       (c) Implementation of Operational Adjustments.--After \n     reviewing the recommendations under subsection (b), the \n     Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary shall direct the \n     Commissioner and the Assistant Administrator to implement \n     those operational adjustments, or any combination, for which, \n     in aggregate--\n       (1) the net effect on listed species is equivalent to those \n     of the underlying project operational parameters in the \n     salmonid biological opinion, taking into account both--\n       (A) efforts to minimize the adverse effects of the \n     adjustment to project operations; and\n       (B) whatever additional actions or measures may be \n     implemented in conjunction with the adjustments to operations \n     to offset the adverse effects to listed species, consistent \n     with (d), that are in excess of the adverse effects of the \n     underlying operational parameters, if any; and\n       (2) the effects of the adjustment can be reasonably \n     expected to fall within the incidental take authorizations.\n       (d) Evaluation of Offsetting Measures.--When examining and \n     identifying opportunities to offset the potential adverse \n     effect of adjustments to operations under subsection \n     (c)(1)(B), the Commissioner and the Assistant Administrator \n     shall take into account the potential species survival \n     improvements that are likely to result from other measures \n     which, if implemented in conjunction with such adjustments, \n     would offset adverse effects, if any, of the adjustments. \n     When evaluating offsetting measures, the Commissioner and the \n     Assistant Administrator shall consider the type, timing and \n     nature of the adverse effects, if any, to specific species \n     and ensure that the measures likely provide equivalent \n     overall benefits to the listed species in the aggregate, as \n     long as the change will not cause a significant negative \n     impact on the long-term survival of a listed salmonid \n     species.\n       (e) Framework for Examining Opportunities To Minimize or \n     Offset the Potential Adverse Effect of Adjustments to \n     Operations.--Not later than December 31, 2015, and every five \n     years thereafter, the Assistant Administrator shall, in \n     collaboration with the Director of the California Department \n     of Fish and Wildlife, based on the best scientific and \n     commercial data available and for each listed salmonid \n     species, issue estimates of the increase in through-Delta \n     survival the Secretary expects to be achieved--\n       (1) through restrictions on export pumping rates as \n     specified by Action IV.2.3 as compared to limiting OMR flow \n     to a fixed rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second within the \n     time period Action IV.2.3 is applicable, based on a given \n     rate of San Joaquin River inflow to the Delta and holding \n     other relevant factors constant;\n       (2) through San Joaquin River inflow to export restrictions \n     on export pumping rates specified within Action IV.2.1 as \n     compared to the restrictions in the April/May period imposed \n     by the State Water Resources Control Board decision D-1641, \n     based on a given rate of San Joaquin River inflow to the \n     Delta and holding other relevant factors constant;\n       (3) through physical habitat restoration improvements;\n       (4) through predation control programs;\n       (5) through the installation of temporary barriers, the \n     management of Cross Channel Gates operations, and other \n     projects affecting flow in the Delta;\n       (6) through salvaging fish that have been entrained near \n     the entrance to Clifton Court Forebay;\n       (7) through any other management measures that may provide \n     equivalent or better protections for listed species while \n     maximizing export pumping rates without causing a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival of a listed \n     salmonid species; and\n       (8) through development and implementation of conservation \n     hatchery programs for salmon and steelhead to aid in the \n     recovery of listed salmon and steelhead species.\n       (f) Survival Estimates.--\n       (1) To the maximum extent practicable, the Assistant \n     Administrator shall make quantitative estimates of survival \n     such as a range of percentage increases in through-Delta \n     survival that could result from the management measures, and \n     if the scientific information is lacking for quantitative \n     estimates, shall do so on qualitative terms based upon the \n     best available science.\n       (2) If the Assistant Administrator provides qualitative \n     survival estimates for a species resulting from one or more \n     management measures, the Secretary shall, to the maximum \n     extent feasible, rank the management measures described in \n     subsection (e) in terms of their most likely expected \n     contribution to increased through-Delta survival relative to \n     the other measures.\n       (3) If at the time the Assistant Administrator conducts the \n     reviews under subsection (b), the Secretary has not issued an \n     estimate of increased through-Delta survival from different \n     management measures pursuant to subsection (e), the Secretary \n     shall compare the protections to the species from different \n     management measures based on the best scientific and \n     commercial data available at the time.\n       (g) Comparison of Adverse Consequences for Alternative \n     Management Measures of Equivalent Protection for a Species.--\n       (1) For the purposes of this subsection and subsection \n     (c)--\n       (A) the alternative management measure or combination of \n     alternative management measures identified in paragraph (2) \n     shall be known as the ``equivalent alternative measure'';\n       (B) the existing measure or measures identified in \n     subparagraphs (2) (A), (B), (C), or (D) shall be known as the \n     ``equivalent existing measure''; and\n       (C) an ``equivalent increase in through-Delta survival \n     rates for listed salmonid species'' shall mean an increase in \n     through-Delta survival rates that is equivalent when \n     considering the change in through-Delta survival rates for \n     the listed salmonid species in the aggregate, and not the \n     same change for each individual species, as long as the \n     change in survival rates will not cause a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival of a listed \n     salmonid species.\n       (2) As part of the reviews of project operations pursuant \n     to subsection (b), the Assistant Administrator shall \n     determine whether any alternative management measures or \n     combination of alternative management measures listed in \n     subsection (e) (3) through (8) would provide an increase in \n     through-Delta survival rates for listed salmonid species that \n     is equivalent to the increase in through-Delta survival rates \n     for listed salmonid species from the following:\n       (A) Through restrictions on export pumping rates as \n     specified by Action IV.2.3, as compared to limiting OMR flow \n     to a fixed rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second within the \n     time period Action IV.2.3 is applicable.\n       (B) Through restrictions on export pumping rates as \n     specified by Action IV.2.3, as compared to a modification of \n     Action IV.2.3 that would provide additional water supplies, \n     other than that described in subparagraph (A).\n       (C) Through San Joaquin River inflow to export restrictions \n     on export pumping rates specified within Action IV.2.1, as \n     compared to the restrictions in the April/May period imposed \n     by the State Water Resources Control Board decision D-1641.\n       (D) Through San Joaquin River inflow to export restrictions \n     on export pumping rates specified within Action IV.2.1, as \n     compared to a modification of Action IV.2.1 that would reduce \n     water supply impacts of the salmonid biological opinion on \n     the Central Valley Project and the California State Water \n     Project, other than that described in subparagraph (C).\n       (3) If the Assistant Administrator identifies an equivalent \n     alternative measure pursuant to paragraph (2), the Assistant \n     Administrator shall determine whether--\n       (A) it is technically feasible and within Federal \n     jurisdiction to implement the equivalent alternative measure;\n       (B) the State of California, or subdivision thereof, or \n     local agency with jurisdiction has certified in writing \n     within 10 calendar days to the Assistant Administrator that \n     it has the authority and capability to implement the \n     pertinent equivalent alternative measure; or\n       (C) the adverse consequences of doing so are less than the \n     adverse consequences of the equivalent existing measure, \n     including a concise evaluation of the adverse consequences to \n     other affected interests.\n       (4) If the Assistant Administrator makes the determinations \n     in subparagraph (3)(A) or (3)(B), the Commissioner shall \n     adjust project operations to implement the equivalent \n     alternative measure in place of the equivalent existing \n     measure in order to increase export rates of pumping to the \n     greatest extent possible while maintaining a net combined \n     effect of equivalent through-Delta survival rates for the \n     listed salmonid species.\n\n[[Page H5258]]\n\n       (h) Tracking Adverse Effects Beyond the Range of Effects \n     Accounted for in the Salmonid Biological Opinion and \n     Coordinated Operation With the Delta Smelt Biological \n     Opinion.--\n       (1) Among the adjustments to the project operations \n     considered through the adaptive management process under this \n     section, the Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner \n     shall--\n       (A) evaluate the effects on listed salmonid species and \n     water supply of the potential adjustment to operational \n     criteria described in subparagraph (B); and\n       (B) consider requiring that before some or all of the \n     provisions of Actions IV.2.1. or IV.2.3 are imposed in any \n     specific instance, the Assistant Administrator show that the \n     implementation of these provisions in that specific instance \n     is necessary to avoid a significant negative impact on the \n     long-term survival of a listed salmonid species.\n       (2) The Assistant Administrator, the Director, and the \n     Commissioner, in coordination with State officials as \n     appropriate, shall establish operational criteria to \n     coordinate management of OMR flows under the smelt and \n     salmonid biological opinions, in order to take advantage of \n     opportunities to provide additional water supplies from the \n     coordinated implementation of the biological opinions.\n       (3) The Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner shall \n     document the effects of any adaptive management decisions \n     related to the coordinated operation of the smelt and \n     salmonid biological opinions that prioritizes the maintenance \n     of one species at the expense of the other.\n       (i) Real-Time Monitoring and Management.--Notwithstanding \n     the calendar based triggers described in the salmonid \n     biological opinion Reasonable and Prudent Alternative (RPA), \n     the Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner shall not \n     limit OMR reverse flow to -5,000 cubic feet per second unless \n     current monitoring data indicate that this OMR flow \n     limitation is reasonably required to avoid a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival of a listed \n     salmonid species.\n       (j) Evaluation and Implementation of Management Measures.--\n     If the quantitative estimates of through-Delta survival \n     established by the Secretary for the adjustments in \n     subsection (b)(2) exceed the through-Delta survival \n     established for the RPAs, the Secretary shall evaluate and \n     implement the management measures in subsection (b)(2) as a \n     prerequisite to implementing the RPAs contained in the \n     Salmonid Biological Opinion.\n       (k) Accordance With Other Law.--Consistent with section 706 \n     of title 5, United States Code, decisions of the Assistant \n     Administrator and the Commissioner described in subsections \n     (b) through (j) shall be made in writing, on the basis of \n     best scientific and commercial data currently available, and \n     shall include an explanation of the data examined at the \n     connection between those data and the decisions made.\n\n     SEC. 203.

FLEXIBILITY FOR EXPORT/INFLOW RATIO.\n\n       For the period of time such that in any year that the \n     Sacramento Valley index is 6.5 or lower, or at the request of \n     the State of California, and until two succeeding years \n     following either of those events have been completed where \n     the final Sacramento Valley Index is 7.8 or greater, the \n     Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation shall continue to \n     vary the averaging period of the Delta Export/Inflow ratio \n     pursuant to the California State Water Resources Control \n     Board decision D1641--\n       (1) to operate to a 35-percent Export/Inflow ratio with a \n     3-day averaging period on the rising limb of a Delta inflow \n     hydrograph; and\n       (2) to operate to a 14-day averaging period on the falling \n     limb of the Delta inflow hydrograph.\n\n     SEC. 305. EMERGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS.\n\n       (a) NEPA Compliance.--To minimize the time spent carrying \n     out environmental reviews and to deliver water quickly that \n     is needed to address emergency drought conditions in the \n     State during the duration of an emergency drought \n     declaration, the Secretaries shall, in carrying out this Act, \n     consult with the Council on Environmental Quality in \n     accordance with section 1506.11 of title 40, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (including successor regulations), to develop \n     alternative arrangements to comply with the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) \n     during the emergency.\n       (b) Determinations.--For the purposes of this section, a \n     Secretary may deem a project to be in compliance with all \n     necessary environmental regulations and reviews if the \n     Secretary determines that the immediate implementation of the \n     project is necessary to address--\n       (1) human health and safety; or\n       (2) a specific and imminent loss of agriculture production \n     upon which an identifiable region\n\n[[Page H5260]]\n\n     depends for 25 percent or more of its tax revenue used to \n     support public services including schools, fire or police \n     services, city or county health facilities, unemployment \n     services or other associated social services.\n\n     SEC. 306. INCREASED FLEXIBILITY FOR REGULAR PROJECT \n                   OPERATIONS.\n\n       The Secretaries shall, consistent with applicable laws \n     (including regulations)--\n       (1) in coordination with the California Department of Water \n     Resources and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, \n     implement offsite upstream projects in the Delta and upstream \n     of the Sacramento River and San Joaquin basins that offset \n     the effects on species listed as threatened or endangered \n     under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.) due to activities carried out pursuant this Act, as \n     determined by the Secretaries;\n       (2) manage reverse flow in the Old and Middle Rivers at \n     -6,100 cubic feet per second if real-time monitoring \n     indicates that flows of -6,100 cubic feet per second or more \n     negative can be established for specific periods without \n     causing a significant negative impact on the long-term \n     survival of the Delta smelt, or if real-time monitoring does \n     not support flows of -6,100 cubic feet per second than manage \n     OMR flows at -5,000 cubic feet per second subject to section \n     103(e) (3) and (4); and\n       (3) use all available scientific tools to identify any \n     changes to real-time operations of the Bureau of Reclamation, \n     State, and local water projects that could result in the \n     availability of additional water supplies.\n\n     SEC. 307. TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR FIRST FEW \n                   STORMS OF THE WATER YEAR.\n\n       (a) In General.--Consistent with avoiding a significant \n     negative impact on the long-term survival in the short term \n     upon listed fish species beyond the range of those authorized \n     under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and other \n     environmental protections under subsection (e), the \n     Secretaries shall authorize the Central Valley Project and \n     the State Water Project, combined, to operate at levels that \n     result in negative OMR flows at -7,500 cubic feet per second \n     (based on United States Geological Survey gauges on Old and \n     Middle Rivers) daily average for 56 cumulative days after \n     October 1 as described in subsection (c).\n       (b) Days of Temporary Operational Flexibility.--The \n     temporary operational flexibility described in subsection (a) \n     shall be authorized on days that the California Department of \n     Water Resources determines the daily average river flow of \n     the Sacramento River is at, or above, 17,000 cubic feet per \n     second as measured at the Sacramento River at Freeport gauge \n     maintained by the United States Geologic Survey.\n       (c) Compliance With Endangered Species Act \n     Authorizations.--In carrying out this section, the \n     Secretaries may continue to impose any requirements under the \n     smelt and salmonid biological opinions during any period of \n     temporary operational flexibility as they determine are \n     reasonably necessary to avoid an additional significant \n     negative impacts on the long-term survival of a listed fish \n     species beyond the range of those authorized under the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973, provided that the \n     requirements imposed do not reduce water supplies available \n     for the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.\n       (d) Other Environmental Protections.--\n       (1) State law.--The Secretaries' actions under this section \n     shall be consistent with applicable regulatory requirements \n     under State law.\n       (2) First sediment flush.--During the first flush of \n     sediment out of the Delta in each water year, and provided \n     that such determination is based upon objective evidence, OMR \n     flow may be managed at rates less negative than -5,000 cubic \n     feet per second for a minimum duration to avoid movement of \n     adult Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) to areas in the \n     southern Delta that would be likely to increase entrainment \n     at Central Valley Project and State Water Project pumping \n     plants.\n       (3) Applicability of opinion.--This section shall not \n     affect the application of the salmonid biological opinion \n     from April 1 to May 31, unless the Secretary of Commerce \n     finds that some or all of such applicable requirements may be \n     adjusted during this time period to provide emergency water \n     supply relief without resulting in additional adverse effects \n     beyond those authorized under the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973. In addition to any other actions to benefit water \n     supply, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Commerce shall consider allowing through-Delta water \n     transfers to occur during this period if they can be \n     accomplished consistent with section 3405(a)(1)(H) of the \n     Central Valley Project Improvement Act. Water transfers \n     solely or exclusively through the State Water Project are not \n     required to be consistent with section 3405(a)(1)(H) of the \n     Central Valley Project Improvement Act.\n       (4) Monitoring.--During operations under this section, the \n     Commissioner of Reclamation, in coordination with the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and \n     California Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall undertake a \n     monitoring program and other data gathering to ensure \n     incidental take levels are not exceeded, and to identify \n     potential negative impacts and actions, if any, necessary to \n     mitigate impacts of the temporary operational flexibility to \n     species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n       (e) Technical Adjustments to Target Period.--If, before \n     temporary operational flexibility has been implemented on 56 \n     cumulative days, the Secretaries operate the Central Valley \n     Project and the State Water Project combined at levels that \n     result in OMR flows less negative than -7,500 cubic feet per \n     second during days of temporary operational flexibility as \n     defined in subsection (c), the duration of such operation \n     shall not be counted toward the 56 cumulative days specified \n     in subsection (a).\n       (f) Emergency Consultation; Effect on Running Averages.--\n       (1) If necessary to implement the provisions of this \n     section, the Commissioner is authorized to take any action \n     necessary to implement this section for up to 56 cumulative \n     days. If during the 56 cumulative days the Commissioner \n     determines that actions necessary to implement this section \n     will exceed 56 days, the Commissioner shall use the emergency \n     consultation procedures under the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 and its implementing regulation at section 402.05 of \n     title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, to temporarily adjust \n     the operating criteria under the biological opinions--\n       (A) solely for extending beyond the 56 cumulative days for \n     additional days of temporary operational flexibility--\n       (i) no more than necessary to achieve the purposes of this \n     section consistent with the environmental protections in \n     subsections (d) and (e); and\n       (ii) including, as appropriate, adjustments to ensure that \n     the actual flow rates during the periods of temporary \n     operational flexibility do not count toward the 5-day and 14-\n     day running averages of tidally filtered daily OMR flow \n     requirements under the biological opinions, or\n       (B) for other adjustments to operating criteria or to take \n     other urgent actions to address water supply shortages for \n     the least amount of time or volume of diversion necessary as \n     determined by the Commissioner.\n       (2) Following the conclusion of the 56 cumulative days of \n     temporary operational flexibility, or the extended number of \n     days covered by the emergency consultation procedures, the \n     Commissioner shall not reinitiate consultation on these \n     adjusted operations, and no mitigation shall be required, if \n     the effects on listed fish species of these operations under \n     this section remain within the range of those authorized \n     under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.).

DEFINITION OF WATER RIGHT.\n\n       In this title, the term ``water right'' means any surface \n     or groundwater right filed, permitted, certified, confirmed, \n     decreed, adjudicated, or otherwise recognized by a judicial \n     proceeding or by the State in which the user acquires \n     possession of the water or puts the water to beneficial use, \n     including water rights for federally recognized Indian \n     tribes.\n\n     SEC. 1103. TREATMENT OF WATER RIGHTS.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall not--\n       (1) condition or withhold, in whole or in part, the \n     issuance, renewal, amendment, or extension of any permit, \n     approval, license, lease, allotment, easement, right-of-way, \n     or other land use or occupancy agreement on--\n       (A) limitation or encumbrance of any water right, or the \n     transfer of any water right (including joint and sole \n     ownership), directly or indirectly to the United States or \n     any other designee; or\n       (B) any other impairment of any water right, in whole or in \n     part, granted or otherwise recognized under State law, by \n     Federal or State adjudication, decree, or other judgment, or \n     pursuant to any interstate water compact;\n       (2) require any water user (including any federally \n     recognized Indian tribe) to apply for or acquire a water \n     right in the name of the United States under State law as a \n     condition of the issuance, renewal, amendment, or extension \n     of any permit, approval, license, lease, allotment, easement, \n     right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement;\n       (3) assert jurisdiction over groundwater withdrawals or \n     impacts on groundwater resources, unless jurisdiction is \n     asserted, and any regulatory or policy actions taken pursuant \n     to such assertion are, consistent with, and impose no greater \n     restrictions or regulatory requirements than, applicable \n     State laws (including regulations) and policies governing the \n     protection and use of groundwater resources; or\n       (4) infringe on the rights and obligations of a State in \n     evaluating, allocating, and adjudicating the waters of the \n     State originating on or under, or flowing from, land owned or \n     managed by the Federal Government.\n\n     SEC. 1104. RECOGNITION OF STATE AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--In carrying out section 1103, the \n     Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture \n     shall--\n       (1) recognize the longstanding authority of the States \n     relating to evaluating, protecting, allocating, regulating, \n     and adjudicating groundwater by any means, including a \n     rulemaking, permitting, directive, water court adjudication, \n     resource management planning, regional authority, or other \n     policy; and\n       (2) coordinate with the States in the adoption and \n     implementation by the Secretary of the Interior or the \n     Secretary of Agriculture of any rulemaking, policy, \n     directive, management plan, or other similar Federal action \n     so as to ensure that such actions are consistent with, and \n     impose no greater restrictions or regulatory requirements \n     than, State groundwater laws and programs.\n       (b) Effect on State Water Rights.--In carrying out this \n     title, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall not take any action that adversely \n     affects--\n       (1) any water rights granted by a State;\n       (2) the authority of a State in adjudicating water rights;\n       (3) definitions established by a State with respect to the \n     term ``beneficial use'', ``priority of water rights'', or \n     ``terms of use'';\n       (4) terms and conditions of groundwater withdrawal, \n     guidance and reporting procedures, and conservation and \n     source protection measures established by a State;\n       (5) the use of groundwater in accordance with State law; or\n       (6) any other rights and obligations of a State established \n     under State law.\n\n     SEC. 1105.

No amendment to the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 114-\n204. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in \nthe report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered \nread, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally \ndivided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be \nsubject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division \nof the question.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. McClintock\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in House Report 114-204.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the table of contents, in the matter regarding section \n     204, strike ``calfed'' and insert ``CALFED''.\n       Page 155, line 19, strike ``All repayment contracts'' and \n     insert ``Except for those repayment contracts under which the \n     contractor has previously negotiated for prepayment, all \n     repayment contracts''.\n       Page 157, line 11, strike ``The following'' and insert \n     ``Except for those repayment contracts under which the \n     contractor has previously negotiated for prepayment, the \n     following''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 362, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. McClintock) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes one technical \nchange to the bill by capitalizing an acronym in the table of contents \nand makes one clarifying change to title IX by ensuring that those who \nhave already negotiated prepayments of their debt to the U.S. Treasury \nare not impacted by provisions in that title.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, although I am \nnot opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, who has the right to close?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) has \nthe right to close.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close. I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, again, I do not oppose this technical \namendment to the bill, but I do want to point out that fixing typos and \nrealphabetizing indexes and other technical changes do not fix the much \ndeeper problems with this bill and do not change the reality that it is \nnot going to become law because it has deep substantive problems that \nneed to be addressed.\n  That is why it is so widely opposed, as it has been in prior years, \nwhen essentially the same bill has been run through on party lines.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Fresno, California (Mr. \nCosta).\n  Mr. COSTA. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.\n\n[[Page H5272]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, while this amendment does make technical changes that \nwere agreed upon in committee, it speaks to, I think, a much larger \nquestion, which is the debate we have been having here, and that is: Is \nthis, in fact, a work in progress? I submit that it is.\n  Obviously, this legislation would not be signed into law under its \ncurrent form, and I think many of those who are supporting the \nlegislation understand that; but we understand that, in fact, there is \na crisis, a drought affecting every region of California.\n  For those of us who feel very strongly about trying to maintain a \nstrong agricultural economy, we know we have to work together. The fact \nis California produces half--half--of the Nation's fruits and \nvegetables, and these are 300 commodities that are so important to not \nonly America's food supply but to a good healthy diet and to ensure \nthat, in fact, we can compete around the world as it relates to \nensuring that America remains independent in producing its own food.\n  There is a lot at stake here. We need to work together as this \nprocess goes along. We will have serious areas of disagreement, but \nthat doesn't mean we can't continue to work together.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close when the \ngentleman is finished.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, again, we don't oppose this technical \namendment, but we wish that there were substantive amendments that \nmight address some of the deep flaws that have prevented this bill from \nhaving any chance of becoming law in prior years and will again this \nyear.\n  I will just close by quoting from the Los Angeles Times. It states:\n\n       A competing Democratic bill, H.R. 2983 by Representative \n     Jared Huffman, has some areas of overlap. Like the Valadao \n     bill, it reasonably calls on the Federal Government to \n     accelerate feasibility studies for a number of proposed dams \n     that have been stuck for years in the planning phase. \n     Republicans, of course, have faith that the dams will pencil \n     out and will be funded. Many Democrats are convinced that the \n     yield numbers--the amount of additional water that would be \n     stored and the associated dollar cost--would be so paltry as \n     to finally put an end to the discussion.\n       In other areas, though, the Huffman bill is starkly \n     different and, frankly, much smarter, focusing on updating \n     Federal water policies and practices that today are firmly \n     rooted in outdated, mid-20th century knowledge and \n     technology.\n\n  There is a lot we could be working on together substantively. We \ncertainly have no problem with the technical changes here, but it is \nhigh time that we have hearings and serious deliberations and \ndiscussions about substance. If we do that, we might just find that \nthere are some common solutions that could become law.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I would simply remind my colleague \nthat, in the 112th Congress, this bill went through one of the most \nexhaustive public processes of any bill heard by Congress.\n  Its genesis was in two public hearings in the Central Valley in 2010 \nand 2011. It was vetted through not one, but two public hearings in \nWashington in which minority Democrats called twice as many witnesses \nas majority Republicans.\n  On the House floor, every Democratic amendment was made in order and \nconsidered. In fact, over the past 5 years, we have held 18 hearings on \nvarious versions of this bill. We consulted 60 water agencies \nthroughout northern and central California, including many in \nDemocratic districts.\n  The bill was taken up again in the 113th Congress and redebated. This \ntime, extensive negotiations took place between House and Senate \nMembers. The fact is there are few issues in this Congress that have \nbeen more thoroughly debated than those encompassed in this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. McNerney\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-204.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 39, line 10, after ``water weed,'' insert ``water \n     hyacinth,''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 362, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple and \nstraightforward but addresses a critical issue affecting the economy, \nthe environment, and the health of the delta as well as other regions \nthroughout the State.\n  This amendment adds water hyacinth to the list of invasive species to \nbe considered for a pilot project established by the bill. The water \nhyacinth is an extremely invasive weed that has taken over the delta.\n  Take a look at the picture. This channel is completely blocked over \nby the weed. It can double in size every 10 days. It has seeds that \nremain buried in sediment and remain viable for 20 years. It is \ndifficult to remove mechanically and to manage through pesticides.\n  The result is what you see here in this picture. It clogs waterways, \npreventing the movement of water through the delta. It negatively \naffects farmers, recreational opportunities, and disrupts the national \necosystem. These effects have only been worsened by the drought.\n  I represent the Port of Stockton. This is the third largest inland \nport in the Nation. The hyacinth affects traffic in and out of the \nport, preventing navigation of the channels at night because of ships \nthat can't navigate between the weeds, the levees, and smaller vessels.\n  This causes unreasonable delays and costs importers approximately \n$200,000 in additional expenses per year. Last year alone, the port had \nto remove more than 2 million tons of the plants. Even Stockton's \nChristmas lighted boat parade had to be canceled for the first time in \nits 35-year history.\n  Eradicating this invasive species will take a holistic approach, \ninvolving stakeholders at all levels. I have heard from the marina \nowners, farmers, environmental organizations, and local communities on \nhow the water hyacinth continues to impact their lives on a daily \nbasis.\n  I was fortunate enough to help secure $1 million in Federal funding \nto help an existing effort between Federal, State, and local partners \nfocused on managing the water hyacinth infestation, but these efforts \nare just the beginning. This amendment ensures that we continue \nbuilding off the current work.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr. Garamendi, Mr. DeSaulnier, \nand Mr. Costa, for joining me on this amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from the delta.\n  This is but one small example of what we ought to be doing, and that \nis working together to solve very, very complex problems. \nUnfortunately, the underlying legislation really is not the result of \nthe kind of interaction that is necessary.\n  Mr. McNerney and I represent the delta. That delta is as large as the \nWestlands Water District, and it also happens to be the largest estuary \non the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere from Alaska to Chile. It is \nabsolutely an essential element in the environment of the entire West \nCoast of the United States; yet the underlying legislation ignores the \nfact that those of us who represent this area have been no part of the \nlegislation.\n  If we work together, we can solve problems such as water hyacinth and \nthe next amendment, which I will be taking up. I want to commend Mr. \nMcNerney for putting forth this amendment and hopefully beginning the \ninteraction necessary to develop a proper water bill for all \nCalifornia.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Mr. McNERNEY. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCosta).\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McNerney) for offering this amendment.\n  Water hyacinth is a significant problem that has impacted the \noperations of both the Central Valley water\n\n[[Page H5273]]\n\nproject as well as the State Water Project.\n  This year, as a result of water hyacinth infestation, pumping at the \nJones Pumping Plant was reduced significantly for periods of time that \nresulted in the loss of water. Local water contractors responded in a \ncollaborative manner to help remove that infestation that we see there, \nover 89,000 cubic yards of hyacinth at a cost of almost $2 million to \nremove it to try to get the operations to continue.\n  Luckily, the capacity at the State pump, Banks pump, provided an \nopportunity to make up the difference. However, we may not be so lucky \nin the future.\n  So I want to support this amendment. It impacts not just cities, \nboaters, and recreationalists, but farmers and the entire region. This \nis a good amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in \nopposition to this amendment, although I am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I, too, represent San Joaquin County, along \nwith Representative McNerney, and believe that this is a solution to a \nbig problem that we share within the delta.\n  This native species is something that needs to be managed and is a \nwelcome amendment to this bill. This amendment rightly focuses on the \ninvasive plant that can have devastating impacts on fish and other \norganisms in the delta.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-204.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 48, after line 19, insert the following:\n       (4) collaborate with the California Department of Water \n     Resources to install a fish screen at the Delta Cross Channel \n     Gates in coordination with operations to protect migrating \n     smelt and salmonids;\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 362, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Garamendi) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, like the previous \namendment, is simple but very important.\n  We heard the discussion from Mr. McNerney and supporters of his \namendment about the water hyacinth and the endangered species that have \nplagued not just the California delta, but other parts of the West.\n  It is important. This amendment is also a small but important \namendment. It deals with a way of providing a fish screen on the Delta \nCross Channel, a very important element in the California water system. \nWhy this hasn't been done before, I don't know.\n  I live within a mile of the Delta Cross Channel, and I have often \nwondered why the agencies have not pursued a fish screen. They have to \nclose the channel gates when the fish are in the river, thereby \nproviding less water through the delta. So this would simply move it \nalong.\n  These two amendments are an example of what we ought to be doing.\n  Mr. McNerney and I represent the delta, which is 700,000 acres, equal \nin size to the area that is the principal proponent of the underlying \nlegislation, that is the Westlands Water District. Both are important \nand critical agriculture areas, both of which need water.\n  The underlying legislation ignores the environmental needs and the \nagricultural needs of the delta, and in a very complex way provides a \nmechanism to take water out of the delta without regard to either the \nenvironmental or the agricultural or the community needs in the area.\n  It is not going to pass. It should never become law. It is an example \nof how not to solve California water problems. The way you solve \nCalifornia water problems are with amendments such as Mr. McNerney's or \nthis amendment that I am putting forth and serious discussions between \nthose of us who represent the delta.\n  I would also like to point out to my colleagues who are proponents of \nthis bill that I represent 200 miles of the Sacramento River, from the \nvery end of it--that is at San Francisco Bay--to an area 199.6 miles \nupriver, including virtually all of the rice industry of California, of \nwhich there are some 600,000 acres, and nearly half of that acreage is \nfallow this year.\n  So the drought isn't just about the impact on the San Joaquin Valley \nsystem, of which we have heard much debate this morning. It is also \nabout the Sacramento Valley north of the delta, where the drought has \nhad a major impact.\n  California needs to work together in the immediate situation, which \nit is actually doing. The Federal and State governments' water policy \nthrough the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation, \nthe Fish and Wildlife Agency--both the State and Federal Government \nhave done yeoman's work, extraordinary work, stretching the water \nsupplies of California. This bill would override that effort and make \nit impossible for them to continue.\n  God help us if the drought goes another year--it could--in which case \nthis bill, if it would become law, all that has been done in California \nover this last 3 years to stretch the water supplies would be pushed \naside.\n  We shouldn't do it that way. We should be working together. Mr. \nHuffman has a good piece of legislation that has already achieved \nstatewide support from water contractors, from those who understand the \nintricacies of this system. We can do it if we sat down together. And \nthat has not happened.\n  For those of us who represent the delta and north of the delta, we \nfind this to be objectionable and we find it to be rather foolish. \nThere is a middle ground. But don't, as this bill does, push aside the \nenvironmental laws, which are the only protections for the largest \nestuary system on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. Don't do \nthat.\n  Why would you destroy the salmon fisheries? Why would you destroy \n700,000 acres and the water supplies for the Bay area? You shouldn't do \nthat. You don't need to do that.\n  There are rational and reasonable ways to solve the California water \nproblem. Some of it is in this bill. The storage systems are good, well \ndone, but don't do that in a way that pushes aside the environmental \nprotections that provide the balance not just for the environment, but \nfor the communities that are affected. Don't do that. We can work \ntogether. Just give us a chance to do so, which you have not thus far \ndone.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from California talks about a \nbill that he is not willing to support, but yet he wants to amend a \nbill that he says is going nowhere.\n  The truth is the bill is going somewhere. This bill is going to move \noff this floor and move into the Senate. It is time for the Senate to \nshow some action. It is time for the two bodies to actually do what \nthey are supposed to do and work together to find a solution for \nCalifornia.\n  To do nothing is criminal. To do nothing will put farms out of \nbusiness, will create much higher unemployment than seen anywhere else \nin the country, and will devastate a food supply that feeds the rest of \nthe Nation and much of the world.\n  Now this amendment in particular has some problems. In conversations \nwith the Bureau of Reclamation, they have not asked for this project \nand they have no money identified for the project. I am unaware of the \nState of California's position as well.\n\n[[Page H5274]]\n\n  Fish screens are hugely expensive projects. They are subject to \ndestruction under high flow events due to debris and restrict \nrecreation.\n  I am concerned that this project is not even feasible. What this \nproject aims to do is make sure that water is not transferred south of \nthe delta. What many of my friends forget is, as I represent San \nJoaquin County, Mountain House, a community--not just farmland--that \ngets a zero allocation, is south of the delta. It actually exports \nwater. So does Tracy, Manteca, Ripon, Escalon, areas in San Joaquin \nthat I represent that are south of the delta.\n  This is not an us against them fight. This is a fight for the \nsurvival of California. And it is not just about an emergency transfer \nof water. It is about the future of California. Do we want to have \nenough water for all of our residents? Do we want our number one \nindustry, agriculture, to be a vibrant industry?\n  We have the opportunity to have greater storage. And we ought to have \nsome commonsense solutions in the process. You talk about wanting to \nsave fish? Why not get rid of the predator fish, or at least go out and \nharvest some of them so they are not eating 98 percent of the fish that \nyou say you are trying to help?\n  There are commonsense solutions in here that will allow us to have \ngreater flexibility, greater storage, and a better plan for the future \nof California. We should not be wasting water and just allowing \nfreshwater to get pushed arbitrarily out to the ocean.\n  This is sound environmental policy that will help us in the future \nand gives us a negotiating point with the Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats actually working together, for a solution that helps us in \nCalifornia.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. LaMalfa\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in House Report 114-204.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 65, strike lines 1 through 6 and insert the following \n     (and redesignate the subsequent provisions accordingly):\n       (2) complete the feasibility study described in clause \n     (i)(II) of section 103(d)(1)(A) of Public Law 108-361 and \n     submit such study to the appropriate committees of the House \n     of Representatives and the Senate not later than November 30, \n     2016;\n       (3) complete a publicly available draft of the feasibility \n     study described in clause (ii)(I) of section 103(d)(1)(A) of \n     Public Law 108-361 and submit such study to the appropriate \n     committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate not \n     later than November 30, 2016;\n       (4) complete the feasibility study described in clause \n     (ii)(I) of section 103(d)(1)(A) of Public Law 108-361 and \n     submit such study to the appropriate committees of the House \n     of Representatives and the Senate not later than November 30, \n     2017;\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 362, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Garamendi) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to offer this amendment with \nmy neighbor to the north, Mr. Walden, which will protect due process \nfor water contractors of the Bureau of Reclamation-operated Klamath \nProject in California and Oregon.\n  The amendment confers applicant status on these contractors, ensuring \nthat they are included in Endangered Species Act consultations that \ncould affect operations of the water projects they rely upon. Applicant \nstatus also ensures that information and alternative actions provided \nby the contractors must be considered when the Bureau considers ESA-\nrelated operational changes.\n  While the Bureau has, in its own words, treated the contractors in a \nmanner similar to applicants since the 1990s, and local Indian tribes \nhave invited contractors to provide information, the Bureau has not \ngranted them the protections and inputs the full applicant status would \nprovide, which is why we need the bill.\n  H.R. 2898 already provides applicant status for the federally \noperated Central Valley Project in California.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. LaMALFA. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DENHAM. I believe the gentleman has two amendments today.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Yes. This first amendment is on the Klamath Project.\n  Are the amendments out of order? They are out of numerical order.\n  Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment on the Sites Reservoir. This \nhelps complete a surface water storage project feasibility study by \naligning the bill's language with the MOU recently signed by the Bureau \nof Reclamation and project stakeholders.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Sites Reservoir has been studied for decades, but stakeholders \nrecently agreed to help fund the study's completion. Last year, \nCalifornia's voters authorized billions in funding for projects like \nSites, but the State cannot determine which projects to invest in until \nthe feasibility studies are complete.\n  This is a key project to help the State prepare for future droughts, \nand the State Department of Water Resources found that it would \ngenerate an additional 900,000 acre-feet of water during drought years. \nThat is enough for 7.2 million people per year.\n  This noncontroversial amendment helps to allow Californians to invest \nin their own water infrastructure, which is a laudable goal that I \nthink we should all support.\n  I have been pleased to sponsor a bill with my colleague, Mr. \nGaramendi, aimed at advancing this project, and I hope I will have your \nsupport today on this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in \nopposition, though I am not opposed to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague from Fresno, California (Mr. Costa).\n  Mr. COSTA. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Chairman, as my colleague mentioned, this amendment updates the \nbill to be consistent with the memorandum of understanding between the \nBureau of Reclamation and the Sites Joint Powers Authority.\n  As has been noted by speakers on both sides, California last year \ncame together, in a bipartisan, overwhelming way, to provide $7.5 \nbillion for improving our water system to provide more funding for the \ntools in our water toolbox to provide greater reliability throughout \nCalifornia; $2.7 billion of that water bond measure was set aside for \nwater storage projects. This is one of the projects that can \nparticipate in that funding.\n  I support this effort because increased storage capacity--both \nsurface, as well as groundwater recharge--is absolutely necessary to \nprovide the additional resiliency and reliability in California's water \nsystem.\n  I support the construction of Sites Reservoir, working in conjunction \nwith increasing the supply of Shasta Reservoir, by increasing that dam, \nwould provide additional water supply, as well as Temperance Flat, as \nwell as the expansion of Los Vaqueros, which is underway by the Contra \nCosta Water District, as well as the expansion of San Luis Reservoir, \nwhich is allowed for in this legislation, as well as increased \ngroundwater banking. All of these are part of the solution.\n  We must expand the storage in the State to reduce the impacts of \nfuture droughts and the population growth; therefore, I support this \namendment.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, again, this is a technical measure to help\n\n[[Page H5275]]\n\nalign the language in H.R. 2898 with the MOU, memorandum of \nunderstanding, that the Bureau of Reclamation has put forward so that \nwe can expedite the studies for the Sites Reservoir project, one that \nwe have needed for a long, long time and will be very helpful towards \nwater solutions for California.\n  I ask for the support of this very simple technical measure, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply aligns the bill with \nthe recently signed MOU with the Bureau of Reclamation regarding these \nstudies. We do not oppose it. It is consistent with an earlier policy \nrider added to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill.\n  Contrary to some of the things we have heard in this debate, I and \nother Democrats are not standing in the way of these storage studies. \nThe delta smelt and the environmental laws are not standing in the way \nof these storage studies.\n  In fact, my own drought bill, H.R. 2983, provides crucial funding and \ndirection to the Bureau of Reclamation to finish CALFED feasibility \nstudies that have the financing possible to be completed within the \nnext 10 years.\n  We do support finishing these studies. Now, some of these projects \nmay pencil out, but I think it has become clear over the many, many \nyears these studies have languished that some of these projects have \nturned into zombie reservoirs which won't go away because project \nproponents have never been forced to fully account for how their \nfinancing will actually work.\n  Many of these projects will not pencil out, but it is high time that \nwe complete the studies, face the reality, and get the information so \nthat we can move on with real water solutions.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Calvert\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in House Report 114-204.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 81, line 3, strike ``3'' and insert ``2''.\n       Page 81, line 12, strike ``and''.\n       Page 81, line 15, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 81, after line 15, insert the following:\n       ``(vi) 1 member shall be a representative of a wildlife \n     entity that primarily focuses on waterfowl.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 362, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Calvert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, in H.R. 2898, we establish an oversight board for the \nCentral Valley Project Restoration Fund.\n  What my amendment does is simple. It adds an additional conservation \nseat to the 11-member board, which will provide parity between the \nenvironmental and user group interests.\n  The advisory board reflects the interests of agriculture, municipal \nand industrial users, power contractors, wildlife refuges, in addition \nto the economic impacts of water operations, so that the Secretary of \nthe Interior will receive recommendations that encompass a broad \nperspective.\n  The reason for my amendment is also simple, to ensure that a more \nbalanced and effective approach is being taken as the Secretary of the \nInterior prioritizes spending levels on projects and programs carried \nout through the restoration fund.\n  Again, in closing, my amendment strikes a better balance between \nconservation and user groups interests on the 11-member board and will \nhelp to ensure that the annual surcharges water and power users \ncontribute will be spent on the most effective methods in habitat \nrestoration and environmental mitigation.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CALVERT. I yield to the gentlewoman from Wyoming.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, we support the amendment and commend the \nauthor for offering it.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in \nopposition, though I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I, too, commend the author for his concern \nabout waterfowl and wildlife. This amendment, by itself, is not \nharmful, but it is important to acknowledge that it doesn't come close \nto curing the problems with this bill that are, in fact, very harmful \nto fish and wildlife.\n  The gentleman's amendment seeks to provide cover in some ways to \nproponents of this bill who are now coming under fire from the \nCalifornia Waterfowl Association and other sportsmen's groups because \nthis bill hurts migratory birds and other wildlife and waterfowl.\n  The California Waterfowl Association is on record opposing this bill \nbecause: ``It would eliminate water supplies for California migratory \nwaterfowl and other wetlands-dependent species.''\n  Other sportsmen's groups also oppose. Trout Unlimited has spoken out \nagainst the bill because it would weaken protections for steelhead and \nsalmon.\n  While I do not oppose this bill, it is important not to suggest that \nthis bill is somehow good for or supported by hunters or sportsmen's \ngroups. It is not.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from \nFresno, California (Mr. Costa).\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a very legitimate concern that my colleagues \nare dealing with in terms of how funds are being spent by the \nrestoration programs and how we provide support for the efforts to \nprovide more accountability and improve the transparency of the \nexpenditures of the fund.\n  I appreciate and support my colleague's amendment to improve the \nmakeup of the advisory board, which I think is important. However, I \nthink that adding one more waterfowl representative needs to be done to \ntry to provide additional balance in terms of the representation of the \nvarious interests on the board.\n  Let me finally say I represent Grasslands, a large part of Grasslands \ndistrict, which is the largest part of the Pacific Flyway in terms of \nalmost 200,000 acres of contiguous wetlands, and they have raised some \nissues as relates to this legislation, and we are going to work those \nout because, in fact, that is a very important part of the Pacific \nFlyway.\n  In addition to that, the flexibility that we create in the underlying \nbill really is, in part, to ensure that we do provide water, even the \nlimited water available, so that we can maintain this important \nhabitat.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank my colleagues for supporting this amendment. It \nis a simple amendment. This is a process, as my friend from California \nhas mentioned. After we move this bill forward today, we will have the \nopportunity, hopefully, to conference with the Senate. Hopefully, they \ncan pass a bill in the Senate, and we can do something good for the \nState of California.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Costa\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in House Report 114-204.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise for an amendment that is before the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n       Page 92, after line 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 611. REPORT ON RESULTS OF WATER USAGE.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Natural Resources \n     of the State of California, shall publish an annual report\n\n[[Page H5276]]\n\n     detailing instream flow releases from the Central Valley \n     Project and California State Water Project, their explicit \n     purpose and authority, and all measured environmental benefit \n     as a result of the releases.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 362, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Costa) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, and the ranking member, since the early 1990s, \nthe Federal and State lawmakers and regulators have made a number of \npolicy choices to implement the Endangered Species Act and Clean Water \nAct and the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. All of these have \nhad good intentions.\n  From the Trinity River, to the Shasta Reservoir, to the San Francisco \nBay Delta, and up to the San Joaquin River, about 3.5 million acre-feet \nof Central Valley Project and California State Water Project have been \nas a result of those acts rededicated for environmental management \npurposes.\n  The Central Valley Project Improvement Act alone, since its \nenactment, has resulted in over 17 million acre-feet of water being \nreprioritized for different needs and for different purposes.\n  It is important to note that this doesn't mean that the water, in \nreprioritization, doesn't continue to serve multiple purposes within \nthe system because it does; but it does mean that the use has been \nprioritized so that, in fact, it must meet environmental objectives \nover that of human needs, which are a distant second to the \nenvironmental uses of this water as a result of the passage of those \nprevious acts.\n  These changes, I believe, have harmed a large number of Californians, \nincluding those from small, rural, and often disadvantaged communities \nthat I represent, as well as to the larger areas that are dependent \nupon this water supply, whether we talk about Santa Clara in Silicon \nValley or Los Angeles, in the metropolitan water district.\n  Approximately 25 million people and 7 of the Nation's top 10 \nagricultural counties have seen their water supply diminish and their \nwater cost escalate over the last 20 years; that is a fact, and as my \ncolleagues say, facts are hard to dispute. The increased cost has been \nthere, and the reduction of the water supply is, in fact, a result of \nthis.\n  Many of the farmers I serve have seen their water supplies diminish \nto 40 percent--40 percent--of their long-term average and have received \nno surface water--no surface water--for the last 2 years.\n  Communities that I have represented have had their drinking wells go \ndry, leaving entire towns without a water supply for drinking or \nbathing. These are incredibly harmful impacts to a very simple \nquestion.\n  We ought to know the benefits. Has society benefited from the policy \nchanges to dedicate the water for these important environmental \npurposes, like preventing the extinction of species, which none of us \nwant to do?\n  The answer, I am sad to say, is it seems to have had not the impact \nthat was intended because the species continue to decline.\n  Unfortunately, though, notwithstanding efforts within the Federal \nagencies, the State agencies, and the National Academy of Sciences, we \ndon't really know. We don't really know because we don't have an \naccurate reporting or accounting of how end-stream flows are used and \nwhat benefit is expected to be achieved by them and whether the benefit \nwas achieved by those flows.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  I would certainly feel a little better knowing that we are increasing \nthe species, the salmonoid in California, notwithstanding the loss of \nwater. In fact, the salmonoid have continued to decline.\n  The dedication of millions of acre-feet of water and the expenditure \nof billions of dollars has resulted in a water supply situation that \nhas never been worse for all of California. Likewise, the condition of \nthe species to which we have dedicated so much has never been so much \nat risk.\n  The latest delta smelt population index is zero, and the status of \nprotected salmon is in serious doubt. While the extinction of these \nspecies isn't probable, given the hatchery-based fish populations, the \npotential loss of wild populations is of grave concern to all of us.\n  One thing that the drought has achieved to make operational \npriorities of the project abundantly clear is that the first priority \nof the projects, besides this cosharing, is flood control. God, I would \npray that it would flood in California. I would love to have what they \nare having in Texas.\n  The second priority is followed by salmon temperature management, \nwhich is very problematic right now as a result of this drought. This \nis followed by protecting the bay-delta water quality--people ought to \nhave good water quality; I want my friends in the bay area to drink \ngood, fresh water--and, finally, any possible deliveries to the \ncommunities for the refuge wildlife, which I spoke to a moment ago, \nthat includes grasslands and other refuges, as well as our farms, our \nfarms that produce the food.\n  I am introducing this amendment to create at least some \naccountability and transparency in the environmental management efforts \nunderway so that we can better understand and so we can measure what is \nworking and what isn't working. That is why this amendment is \nimportant.\n  I ask that it be adopted for all the reasons that I have stated.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Costa).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. LaMalfa\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in House Report 114-204.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, I have another amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 92, line 20, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 611. KLAMATH PROJECT CONSULTATION APPLICANTS.\n\n       If the Bureau of Reclamation initiates or reinitiates \n     consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service under section 7(a)(2) of \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2)), \n     with respect to construction or operation of the Klamath \n     Project (or any part thereof), Klamath Project contractors \n     shall be accorded all the rights and responsibilities \n     extended to applicants in the consultation process. Upon \n     request of the Klamath Project contractors, they may be \n     represented through an association or organization.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 362, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. LaMalfa) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, this is the much anticipated amendment \nhaving to do with the Klamath project that I am offering with my \nneighbor, Mr. Walden, from the north side of the border.\n  The amendment again confers applicant status on those contractors \nthat are involved in the Klamath project, ensuring that they are \nincluded in the Endangered Species Act consultations that could affect \noperations of the water project they rely upon.\n  Applicant status also ensures that information and alternative \nactions provided by the contractors must be considered when the Bureau \nconsiders ESA-related operational changes.\n  While the Bureau has, in its words, treated the contractors ``in a \nmanner similar to applicants'' since the 1990s and local tribes have \ninvited contractors to provide information, the Bureau has not granted \nthem the protections and input that the full applicant status would \nprovide.\n  H.R. 2898 already provides applicant status for the federally \noperated Central Valley Project in California, and this simply ensures \nthat all Federal water contractors in the region receive equal legal \nprotections.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden).\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. \nLaMalfa) for yielding and for working with me on this amendment as \nwell, which will assist our Klamath project farmers in the Klamath \nBasin.\n  As you pointed out, there is a long history of water issues in this \nbasin and there is much work to be done.\n\n[[Page H5277]]\n\nFrankly, a basin-wide, long-term solution is what is most needed. While \nwe are working toward that solution, these issues remain.\n  In the interim, it is critical that we pass this amendment to simply \nformalize the rule of the Klamath project irrigators by giving them \napplicant status for ESA consultations.\n  The Klamath project contractors have existing contracts with the \nBureau of Reclamation, and they are directly affected by Reclamation's \nconsultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National \nMarine Fisheries Service.\n  In recent years, as you mentioned, the Klamath project contractors \nhave provided input to the section 7 consultations through the \ninvitation of the Klamath tribes. I would like to thank the Klamath \ntribes and especially Klamath Tribal Chairman Don Gentry for working \nwith the project contractors through this process.\n  So passing this amendment would only formalize the practice that has \nalready been occurring and ensure the project contractors could \ncontinue this process in the future.\n  To legislatively designate the project contractors as having the role \nof applicants would not change the substantive obligations of the \nBureau of Reclamation under the ESA or the obligations of the wildlife \nagencies to prepare biological opinions.\n  So I would ask my colleagues to join us in formalizing a process that \nhas been sort of informal along the way, but inconsistent at times, and \ngive the consistency there that is important to continue the \ndiscussions that are underway in the basin.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise to claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I am the other neighbor on this Klamath-\nTrinity water system. I didn't have the benefit of working with my \ncolleagues on this legislation.\n  My hope, as we go forward, is that we could be a little more \nneighborly and try to talk with each other and work together on this \nsystem that affects our mutual constituents.\n  Mr. Chair, as if the underlying bill, which includes numerous \nassaults on the Endangered Species Act, is not bad enough, \nunfortunately, this is an amendment that would make it even worse.\n  It plays favorites among stakeholders, elevating agriculture above \nall else at the expense of the environment and other cultural and \neconomic interests.\n  As if the Klamath water contractors don't have things good enough \nwith taxpayer-subsidized water and zero-interest loans, this amendment \nseeks to give them special status and significantly more leverage \nduring the Endangered Species Act consultation process.\n  As long as the project is in place, the Bureau of Reclamation has a \nduty to manage it for the benefit of all stakeholders. That is \nimportant.\n  The interests of the water contractors are certainly no more \nlegitimate than those of the Klamath tribes for whom endangered fish \nare part of their cultural heritage, nor are they more important than \nthe interests of commercial and recreational fishermen, who generate \nhundreds of millions of dollars for the economy and continue to wait \npatiently for the restoration of fish stocks vital to their \nlivelihoods.\n  In addition to being a bad deal for tribes and fishermen, this \namendment is yet another attempt by House Republicans to drive the \nextinction of American fish and wildlife one species at a time.\n  Let's be honest. Giving agricultural interests privileged status in \n``helping'' to determine the fate of endangered coho salmon and \nendangered Lost River and shortnose suckers is nothing short of a death \nsentence for those species.\n  It is past time for my colleagues across the aisle to stop blaming \nthe Endangered Species Act for all of their ills. Fish did not cause \nthe drought, and killing them will not make it go away.\n  The better solution is to make water use more sustainable for \nCalifornians and the environment that they cherish.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, it is a little harder to be neighborly when \nthe facts get twisted around and the intent of the bill is \nmisconstrued.\n  Indeed, this has been a collaborative process with the Bureau, the \ntribes inviting information from those stakeholders that are the water \ncontractors.\n  This would simply confer a status upon them that would make them \nfully at the table as an applicant. It doesn't do anything to change \nthe allocation or any other factor of those water contractors or give \nthem any favorite status.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden).\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I would just say, as somebody who has been \ninvolved in these issues going back to 1999, I have worked with the \ntribes. I have worked with irrigators to prove fish passage and to help \nimprove fish health.\n  So I really take offense to the kind of language you are using here \non the floor because we have done a lot of good to put fish screens in, \nto help improve the survivability of the suckers, to put more water \naside. We have done a lot of good things.\n  So I welcome you to this House, and I welcome you to work with us on \nthese issues, but I have to tell you it is a little offensive in your \ncomments.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Will the gentleman yield for a question?\n  Mr. LaMALFA. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. We could start working together on the Klamath \nrestoration settlement and, moving forward, that legislation.\n  I hope that we can begin to talk together. We have legitimate \ninterests on both sides of the State border and at both ends of this \nimportant watershed.\n  Mr. WALDEN. If the gentleman will yield, I am just saying there is a \nbetter way to have this discussion than hurling the kind of language \nyou are hurling around, because a lot of us have worked, both sides, \nbipartisan, and a lot of work. I open the door to have those \nconversations with you as well.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair reminds the gentleman from Oregon that \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) controls the time.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, the ESA requires us to use the best available \nscience and information and have all the stakeholders able to be at the \ntable, such as having full applicant status, for the Klamath water \nusers.\n  Having them as an applicant just gets more information and more input \nfrom everybody that might be affected by possible ESA decisions.\n  We would love to work in a collaborative, neighborly process around \nhere. When the rhetoric flies so much that accuses us, accuses that \nwater users up there a long time, that have had a promise made to them \nby the Federal Government of being something other than what they are, \nit does make it difficult. And it is the kind of thing that the \nAmerican people, as they view the operations on TV, really get tired \nof.\n  So I would be one that would love to cooperate and get a result. But \non this amendment here, we need this help for those contractors to have \na fair seat at the table.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in House Report 114-204.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 162, line 5, strike ``into the'' and all that follows \n     through line 15, and insert ``for projects that reclaim and \n     reuse wastewaters.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 362, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n\n[[Page H5278]]\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, before I speak to my amendment, I want to \nacknowledge the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano) for her \ninput on this amendment and for her long advocacy for water reuse, \nrecycling, and conservation, and for emphasizing that we need a near-\nterm water-creation strategy, along with a long-term sustainable \nstrategy. H.R. 2898 is not that long-term sustainable strategy.\n  Californians and others across the west need drought relief now. The \nproponents of this legislation know that it will not provide that \nimmediate relief. They also know their bill will never become law.\n  So why are we here today, wasting everybody's time? It is simply \nbecause House Republicans are not going to miss an opportunity to \nattack the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy \nAct.\n  The allegation that environmental laws have restricted dam \nconstruction is patently false. In fact, it was President Reagan who \nfirst sought to help curb the deficit by turning off the tap of easy \nFederal money that had funded multi-billion-dollar boondoggles and pork \nbarrel dam projects.\n  Building new dams takes forever because it doesn't make economic \nsense without heavy government subsidies. Instead of flushing \ntaxpayers' dollars, we should be investing in projects that recycle \nwastewater, create reuse, and provide immediate water supplies.\n  Eight-seven percent of California's wastewater, hundreds of billions \nof gallons of water that could supply the needs of agriculture and \npeople, is lost to the Pacific Ocean each year because we do not have \nenough water recycling projects in place. This is literally an ocean of \nmissed opportunity.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment creates new water for the people of \nCalifornia. If Republicans were serious about solving this drought \nproblem, they would have written a bill that creates new water. Sadly, \nthey have not. Instead, they have written a bill that uses a very real \ncrisis to attack the ESA and NEPA.\n  This bill insults people who are suffering through this historic \ndrought, and it is just the latest example of House Republicans \nblocking public participation in government and driving the extinction \nof American fish and wildlife one species at a time.\n  I agree with my colleagues; this is a manmade drought. It is manmade \nbecause we are not conserving and recycling water that we have and \nbecause we are wasting time on this bill instead of planning to \nincrease water supplies in the short term and in long-term sustainable \nstrategies.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Wyoming is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I said earlier this is a time of \nchoosing between two very different visions. The Democrats offer us a \nvision of scarcity and astronomical water prices. We have been trying \nit their way--it doesn't end well. Our bill serves a different vision \nof abundant water and hydroelectricity at affordable prices--and the \nprosperity and the quality of life that means for every American.\n  Water is plentiful, but it is unevenly distributed over time. We \nbuild reservoirs to store water in wet years so that we have it in dry \nones. We stopped building major reservoirs over 1 million acre-feet 40 \nyears ago because of policies imposed on us by the very same voices \nthat we now hear raised against this bill. The Sacramento River is \nbigger than the Colorado, yet we store 70 million acre-feet on the \nColorado and only 10 million acre-feet on the Sacramento.\n  We will not solve our water shortage until we build more dams. That \nis what our bill does.\n  This amendment would scrap this vision of abundance for more of the \nsame--not more water, only more conservation, more recycling, and more \ndoing with less. Conservation is important in a drought, but \nconservation is the management of a shortage. Managing a shortage does \nnot solve a shortage. Only abundance can do that.\n  Mr. Chairman, when we confuse conservation with supply, as these \nvoices from the left always do, in a real drought, we discover that we \nhave already played that card and we no longer have it available to \nstretch supplies in an emergency.\n  Mr. Chairman, new dams not only mean more abundant water for the \nWest; they provide clean, cheap, and reliable hydroelectricity. They \nprovide flood control to protect regions that would otherwise be \ninundated and uninhabitable. They assure year-round flows of water to \nriparian habitats that would otherwise be desiccated in drought and \ndevastated by flood. All of these benefits would be sacrificed on the \naltar of the environmental left by this amendment.\n  Supply or shortage, that is the question. This bill opens up a new \nera of supply. This amendment takes us further down the road of coping \nwith shortage not as a temporary stopgap, but as a way of life.\n  Well, we have had a taste of that way of life. We have watched our \nlawns turn brown. We have watched our water bills skyrocket. We have \nwatched businesses shut down. We have watched thousands of farmworkers \nthrown out of work. We have seen food lines in the fertile agricultural \nregion of the West. We have had enough.\n  Mr. Chairman, we seek a new future where water and hydroelectricity \nare abundant and inexpensive, where jobs are plentiful, where grocery \nshelves are full, where water police are not knocking on the door \nbecause we have taken too long in the shower, and where our lawns and \ngardens are green again.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Los Angeles Times had an article entitled, \n``Editorial: GOP Water Bill in Congress Should Be Rejected.'' It \ncompared the two pieces of legislation, Jared Huffman's H.R. 2983 and \nthe bill that is on the floor today, H.R. 2898. The conclusion was that \nwe needed a commonsense, comprehensive approach.\n  The article says, ``the Huffman bill is starkly different and frankly \nmuch smarter, focusing on updating Federal water policies and practices \nthat today are firmly rooted in outdated, mid-20th century knowledge \nand technology.''\n  It is a comprehensive approach that my side of the aisle seeks, and \nthis legislation before us today does nothing.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to speak to another important aspect of the \nlegislation, which is the issue of relief. Providing a near-term \nrelief, I think, is essential--that is not to stall a long-term \nsolution, but to provide the relief that everybody has talked about \nthat California and the Central Valley needs.\n  The Central Valley has been described as the ``Salad Bowl'' of \nAmerica. The delicious crops that are grown there are consumed by \nAmericans at a low cost. There is an occasional reference to the people \nthat day in and day out labor to pick those crops and put them on the \ntables of the American people--the farmworkers.\n  Referencing their dire economic and living conditions that they find \nthemselves in right now, the conclusion is that we need to proceed to \npass H.R. 2898 to help these farmworkers and their families. I agree; \nfarmworkers and their families must be a priority for relief. H.R. 2898 \ndoesn't provide any relief to farmworkers and their families.\n  Mr. Chairman, farmworkers need an investment. They need an investment \nin education; they need an investment in housing; they need an \ninvestment in livable incomes, and they need to work on the \nconcentrated poverty that we find. Those areas of farmworker \ncommunities had one of the highest poverty rates in California before \nthe drought; they are at a high poverty rate now with the drought; and \nif we want to change the course of history, we need to deal with that \nissue. We need to continue to restrict pesticide use that harms humans, \nand we need to have working conditions and opportunity available to \nfarmworkers.\n  Farmworkers don't need crocodile tears. They need relief; they need \nattention, and they need investment. They need a relief that is near \nterm and not one dominated by technology and outmoded strategies that \nwill not bring that relief to them. We should be about creating \nopportunity, creating\n\n[[Page H5279]]\n\nimmediate relief, and helping those families not only in the near term, \nbut in the long term.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my time to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Costa).\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for \nyielding the time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to this amendment not because it provides \nadditional water for reclamation and reuse, which I support. I am \nopposed to this amendment because it prevents any of these funds from \nbeing used for storage--groundwater and surface storage water.\n\n  As I said earlier, Californians, by over a two-thirds vote, supported \na significant bond measure last year for that water storage, both \nsurface and groundwater. This amendment would prevent that from \noccurring.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me also talk a little bit about the narrative that \nhas been coming from some of my colleagues that I just firmly reject \nabout this legislation and the underlying bill.\n  This does not--this does not--amend the Endangered Species Act. It \ndoes not provide any kind of a rollback of the endangered species law. \nThat is just false.\n  It does not impact the water quality of the delta or the bay. And do \nyou know why? Because we have a State law in California under Decision \n1641 that requires the State Water Board to monitor the level of \nsalinity in the delta and to protect the water quality for people in \nthe Bay area who derive their water from that source.\n  So how could this legislation impact Decision 1641? It simply cannot.\n  As it relates to the operational flexibility, which has been alluded \nto as the great problem in this legislation, much of that flexibility \nthat we have been urging over 4 years has begun to take place in the \nlast year or 2. This legislation would take that flexibility that they \nfinally have begun to do and put that in practice and codify it in law. \nThat is what this legislation does.\n  I must say, Mr. Chairman, that under the constraints of this \nlegislation, with this greater flexibility, the Secretary of the \nInterior still has the ability to provide the justification, in fact, \nif she feels that this flexibility cannot be implemented.\n  Mr. Chairman, those protections are there. That is what this \nlegislation does. I urge your support.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-204 on \nwhich further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 3 by Mr. Garamendi of California.\n  Amendment No. 7 by Mr. LaMalfa of California.\n  Amendment No. 8 by Mr. Grijalva of Arizona.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Garamendi) on which further proceedings were postponed and on \nwhich the noes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. Holding, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2898) to \nprovide drought relief in the State of California, and for other \npurposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 362, he reported the bill \nback to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the \nWhole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. BERA. I am opposed in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Bera moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2898 to the \n     Natural Resources Committee, with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       After section 610, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 611. PROTECTING THE SUPPLY OF WATER FOR DRINKING AND TO \n                   FIGHT WILDFIRES.\n\n       Under the provisions of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     ensure that there is an adequate supply of water--\n       (1) for residential drinking water that is safe and not \n     tainted with arsenic, salt, nitrates from fertilizers, \n     industrial chemicals, or harmful algae, which become \n     concentrated in diminished water supplies; and\n       (2) to fight wildfires, utilizing water from reservoirs or \n     other surface waters, and to honor Tribal water rights.\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent that we consider it as having been read and we dispense with \nthe reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which \nwill not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, this \nbill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, this amendment is simple. It ensures that we have safe \ndrinking water for our constituents and enough water to fight \nwildfires.\n  It has been hot and dry in California. We are now in the fourth \nstraight year of drought conditions; and, in fact, 95 percent of our \nState has reached severe drought status. This is a problem.\n  We are talking about families; we are talking about farmers, small-\nbusiness owners who are feeling the pain of this prolonged drought \nevery day. It is a crisis, and in a crisis, everyone has to come \ntogether, to work together to find solutions that work for all of us.\n  However, the bill offered today, yet again, undermines the efforts \nthat were taken in California to work together, and instead, it allows \nWashington, D.C., politicians to pick winners and losers and pit \ncommunities against each other. This bill creates no water. It does not \nsolve this crisis, and that is a problem.\n  Look at this picture. This is my home district, Folsom Lake. This is \nwhat it looked like last summer, and this summer, it is worse. In fact, \nFolsom Lake right now is at 42 percent of capacity. By August, it is \nexpected to reach the lowest point in recorded history. Over half a \nmillion people depend on Folsom Lake for their drinking water.\n  We owe it to the families of Folsom, Fair Oaks, Roseville, and all \nacross the State to work together to better manage the water that we \nhave. As currently written, this bill would jeopardize their access to \nsafe water. As water supplies decrease, residential drinking water \nrisks contamination from higher concentrations of nitrates,\n\n[[Page H5282]]\n\narsenic, industrial chemicals, and harmful algae.\n  We owe it to the people in our State to make sure, when they turn on \ntheir taps, they have safe drinking water. Let's work together to find \ncomprehensive solutions, long-term solutions to ensure their access to \nstorage. We have got to work together as Democrats and Republicans, not \npit northern California against southern California. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to give this motion their full \nsupport.\n  I yield to the gentleman from southern California (Mr. Peters), my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, across the West and particularly in \nCalifornia, we are in the fourth year of a prolonged drought that is \nplacing us at increased risk for wildfires.\n  The underlying bill would harm not just one community or industrial \nsector, but would undercut years of existing water policy and put \ncommunities like mine in San Diego in more danger. The images of \ndepleted reservoirs, lakes, and streams drying up abound, with millions \nof dead trees littering our forests. As The New York Times reported \njust yesterday: ``For those who know fire, fuel is now all they see.''\n  We are in the midst of what we expect to be a long and harsh wildfire \nseason. Just since January 1, California fire officials have responded \nto more than 3,300 wildfires, which is a thousand more than the average \nfrom the last 5 years.\n  The lake fire that started just a month ago has consumed an area of \nnational forest roughly the size of San Francisco, and the dozens of \nwildfires that erupted in San Diego last May burned thousands of acres \nand destroyed 65 homes. Projections show that the cost of fighting \nwildfires this year could reach up to $2.1 billion, far above the \nroughly $450 million spent annually in the 1990s.\n  It is not just money at stake. Two of the most deadly wildfires in \nCalifornia history, the Witch and Cedar fires occurred in San Diego and \nkilled 17 people. This is also a matter of life and death.\n  This bill does not make it rain; no one can do that. It simply \nundermines the State of California's water policies to move water away \nfrom one set of communities and into different ones.\n  The motion to recommit requires that, as we make changes to Western \nwater allocations, we ensure there is enough water in reservoirs, \nlakes, and community supplies to make sure that wildfires can be fought \nwhen they occur, which they certainly will. It also ensures that we \nhonor the existing tribal water rights and protect the health of those \ncommunities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit and to oppose \nthe underlying legislation.\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, this is a procedural motion. \nObviously, if it were a serious one, we could have considered it \nanytime in committee or on the floor in the amendment process, but it \nis a procedural motion that is also somewhat flawed.\n  In this particular one, it mentions that nothing will happen until \nthe Secretary shall ensure that something happens. Unfortunately, in \nthis provision of the bill, they don't define Secretary, so I am not \nreally sure which Secretary would have to define something. It could be \nthe secretary of my office if you really wanted it that way. It \nprovides that we are going to have water for drinking and for \nwildfires.\n  Now, some of you may remember that, last week, we actually had a \nforest bill in here which provided for wildfires. We gave them money; \nwe gave them authority; we gave them the tools. It passed with a \nbipartisan vote, but some of our friends who are not voting for this \none weren't voting for that one either. We solved the wildfire issue \nalready, scratched that one off.\n  If you really want drinking water, that is what the base bill does. \nThe entire purpose of this bill is to emphasize the fact that, in this \ndrought, we are trying to help people. The goal is to get water to \npeople so they can work.\n  In an area that has a 50 percent unemployment rate, they can provide \nfood for people. It is important to all of us. It is not as important \nfor me as it used to be, but it is still important for all of us.\n  We actually provide jobs for people in these areas where they \ndesperately need that work. We are doing it. This is about people. This \nis moving water so people can actually be helped, and that is what the \nunderlying bill has to do, and the procedural issues that we are trying \nto hold up this process, they don't actually help people. They may help \nthe process, but they don't actually help people.\n  We need a policy more than the opponents of this bill have, which is: \nLet's pray for rain and hope something happens.\n  We need to do what our pioneer ancestors told us to do and take the \nwater we have and save it and store it, and that is what the underlying \nbill does, not just for California, but for the rest of the West, for \nall of us, where we have these same types of situations.\n  You can vote for the underlying bill, realizing you are helping \npeople. Good grief, 2008, we found water on Mars; we can actually find \nwater for people here in the West.\n  Vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit; support the underlying bill. \nLet's get this bill going through the system so we can actually do \nsomething good for the people of this country.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, \nfor the purpose of inquiring about the schedule of the week to come and \nthereafter.\n  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On \nTuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. for \nlegislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.\n  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning \nhour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet \nat 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected \nno later than 3 p.m.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntomorrow.\n  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 1734, the Improving Coal \nCombustion Residuals Regulation Act, sponsored by Representative David \nMcKinley. This bill is essential to protect and create jobs.\n  If we do not act, the EPA will replace the existing successful State-\nbased regulatory program with harmful new regulations that will cost \nhundreds of thousands of jobs and result in billions of dollars in \nburdensome costs for job creators.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  The House will also consider H.R. 1599, the Safe and Accurate Food \nLabeling Act, sponsored by Representative Mike Pompeo. This bipartisan \nbill will ensure uniform national labeling of foods from genetically \nengineered plants. By addressing the patchwork of conflicting labeling \nlaws, we will fix the growing problem of inconsistent and confusing \ninformation for consumers.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House is expected to consider the \nconference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2016.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his information with respect to \nthe legislation for next week.\n  As the gentleman knows, we have now passed six appropriation bills. \nLast week, consideration of the Interior bill was postponed. The \ngentleman and Mr. Rogers have both made representations that they hope \nto do all 12 appropriations bills.\n  You did not announce any appropriations bills on the schedule for \nnext week. Can the gentleman tell me whether or not he expects to bring \nadditional appropriations bills to the floor prior to the August break?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Yes, it is our intention to get back to the appropriations process as \nsoon as possible. As the gentleman does know, there are some very \nserious and sensitive issues involved. We are in the midst of a \nconstructive and bipartisan conversation on how we can resolve these \nissues. I will be sure to keep the Members updated as the \nappropriations bills are scheduled for continued consideration.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comment, particularly in \nterms of the willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion.\n  As the majority leader knows, there is, on his side of the aisle and \non our side of the aisle, a great concern that the 302 allocations to \nthe Appropriations Committee are insufficient to meet their \nresponsibilities. Mr. Rogers, as you know, your chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, a Member of your side of the aisle from \nKentucky, has characterized the sequestration numbers as unrealistic \nand ill-advised.\n  The Senate has not passed any appropriations bills, as the gentleman \nknows. It is my hope, and I would like to ask the majority leader \nwhether he contemplates any bipartisan discussions with reference to \nhow we might come to an agreement so that appropriations bills could, \nin fact, be enacted, sent to the President, and signed by the \nPresident.\n  The President, as you know, sent down a budget which was paid for, \nwhich had Defense numbers at the numbers that your side of the aisle \nused by utilizing Overseas Contingency Operation funds to bridge the \ngap between the sequester number and the President's number.\n  My question to you is: Is there any contemplation, either before we \nbreak or shortly after we come back--because October 1 will be on us \nvery, very quickly--to have bipartisan discussions, a la Ryan-Murray, \nto get to a number that we can agree on and that we can pass \nappropriations bills, have conferences, and send them to the President \nand be signed, hopefully, before October 1, but if not before October \n1, certainly before December 18?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and his continuous \nquestions throughout the months on this.\n  It is still our intention on this side of the aisle to get our \nbusiness done, uphold the current law which is in place. I know you and \nI have had many debates back and forth that we know that sequestration \nstarted in the White House, and we continue to play by what the law \nstates today and move our bills in a bipartisan manner, with a very \nopen process on the floor where any Member can bring an amendment up, \nand we will continue to use that process as we move forward.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  The majority leader, Mr. Speaker, regularly brings up that sequester \nstarted in the White House. He knows I very severely disagree with \nthat. And he voted for a Cut, Cap, and Balance Act which had in that \nbill--which no Democrat, I think, voted for--sequester. And it was \npassed 5 days before our Republican friends, Mr. Speaker, alleged that \nMr. Lew suggested that to Mr. Reid as a way we could get by the House's \nrefusal, up to that point in time, to extend the debt limit, which \nmeant we couldn't pay our bills. But I don't think that is very useful \nin discussing how we get by this loggerhead that we have met on the \nappropriations process.\n  I served on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years before I became \na leader, and we did pass bills--not always on time, but we had an \nability, Republicans and Democrats working on the Appropriations \nCommittee, working in the Congress, to get our bills done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't know whether you recall. I presume you will \nrecall that when we got to a similar impasse, Mr. Ryan, the then-\nchairman of the Budget Committee, Ms. Murray, the then-chairwoman of \nthe Budget Committee in the Senate, got together and came up with some \nfigures that we could agree on on a bipartisan basis. Until that time, \nwe had the same kind of scenario that we are now confronted with.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my view that, unless we have such a meeting of the \nminds, we are going to put this country in another crisis of our own \nmaking.\n  We, Democrats, are prepared to enter into some sort of an agreement, \nconsistent with Hal Rogers' belief, that we can get to a realistic and \nadvised compromise, not this unrealistic and ill-advised--Mr. Rogers' \nwords, Republican chair of the Appropriations Committee, not mine.\n  And if we don't do so, when we get to September 30, or we get to \nDecember 18, let's not wring our hands and say, How did this happen? We \nwill know exactly how it happened, and it will have happened because we \nrefused to sit down, as the majority leader just said\n\n[[Page H5285]]\n\na few minutes ago, in a bipartisan way to do the people's business in a \nresponsible, collegial way in which we can get to an agreement so the \nbills can be passed.\n\n  I think this argument about who is responsible for sequestration--\nclearly, we have a different point of view--and a bill that passed \nbefore the suggestion was made by Jack Lew so we could get by the \nimpasse and America pay its bills is really not very useful.\n  Mr. Leader, let me go to another subject. The gentleman moved, on two \noccasions, to refer to the House Administration Committee legislation \nwhich related to the use of the Confederate battle flag. Both of those \nissues are now pending in the House Administration Committee. One of \nthem has been there for some 3 weeks now.\n  Can the gentleman tell me whether there is any suggested action by \nthe committee, whether there have been any hearings scheduled, and \nwhether or not we may see that legislation brought to the floor at any \ntime in the foreseeable future?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Just to clarify before I answer your other question on some of your \nother statements, I am concerned about what the rest of the summer \nlooks like. A lot of my concern stems from what I hear on the other \nside of the aisle, especially in the Senate side.\n  As the gentleman knows from his years of working for more than two \ndecades on appropriations, the appropriations process we have today is \nthe most open this House has ever seen. Never in history, while you \nwere on the Appropriations Committee, was it as open a process that any \nMember from any side of the aisle could just offer an amendment, not \neven prewritten, just a closed process.\n  But your comments about sequester, what I am really concerned about \nis the comments of Senator Schumer, Senator Reid, that they were going \nto have the summer of the shutdown, the destruction, that they were \ngoing to shut everything down, and I am concerned about some of your \ncomments that are leading in that direction. I don't want to go there. \nI want to finish our work as we have been doing here.\n  And history, I can't rewrite it. I mean, Bob Woodward, respected \njournalist as we all know from his days back to Watergate, today, in \nhis ``The Price of Politics,'' he wrote of the time in history. \nSequester was not debated here on this floor or created on this floor, \nnot even in the Senate as well. You can read it in his book. It was \ncreated in the White House of this administration. It is the law of the \nland. We will uphold the law of the land and do our work based upon \nthose numbers.\n  Now, the question you had before me was dealing with what we referred \nto House Administration. I have met with the chair and I have met with \nMembers on the gentleman's side of the aisle. We have nothing scheduled \nfor next week, but we are currently working towards solving this, to \nme, a very serious and sensitive issue, and I look forward to getting \nit done and working with you to make it happen.\n  Mr. HOYER. I appreciate the fact that we might be bringing something \nto the floor so that we can express the opinion of this House. As the \nhouse and senate in South Carolina expressed its opinion, it surely is \nappropriate for this House of Representatives, representing the values \nof our country, sworn to uphold our Constitution that stands for \nequality of all, that we can express ourselves and take appropriate \naction. I appreciate the gentleman's view.\n  I have great respect for Mr. Woodward. Mr. Woodward, shortly after \nthat book came out, I called him. He came into my office. We had a \ndiscussion about that representation. I will tell the gentleman that I \nbelieve Mr. Woodward was incorrect. He did not have information I gave \nhim. I don't mean that he necessarily says he is incorrect.\n  But there is no doubt, when you want to talk about history, you \npassed a bill 5 days before the suggestion was made by Jack Lew, which \nwas, presumably, coming out of the White House, to Mr. Reid, the \nmajority leader. Five days before that, you passed, on this floor, a \nbill which was called Cut, Cap, and Balance, which had sequester as \nyour fallback policy.\n  So you are right. You can't change history. That is history. I have \nsaid that a number of times. The gentleman has not corrected me. I \npresume that, therefore, he believes that I am accurate in that \nrepresentation of the timing.\n  But very frankly, that history is irrelevant. What is relevant, as \nthe gentleman and I, I think, both agree, if we don't get to an \nagreement on a number that is as we did in Ryan-Murray--we have done \nthis before. We have done this before. Now, my view is we did it \nbecause you didn't want to have your Members vote on legislation that \nhad numbers that were draconian before the election, but that may be \nonly my personal perspective.\n  But the fact of the matter is the American people expect us to get \ntheir work done. Getting their work done, at minimum, means funding the \ngovernment at appropriate levels. And, again, I would say that Mr. \nRogers does not believe the sequester--I agree with you. It is the law \nof the land. I think it is wrong. I think it is a bad law. It was not a \nlaw that was intended to go into effect. It went into effect simply \nbecause the supercommittee that was established in that same \nlegislation couldn't come out with a solution.\n  In 13 months, the Congress couldn't come out with a solution, and, \ntherefore, on January 1, 2014, we were confronted with these draconian, \nill-conceived numbers, according to Mr. Rogers. Let's not be confronted \nwith those numbers 60 days from now on October 1 where we are unable to \ndo our business. So I would urge my friend, and I would be glad to work \nwith him toward that end.\n  We just passed a bill, Mr. Leader, which I voted for. We passed it on \na bipartisan basis--the majority of my Members voted for it; the \nmajority of your Members voted for it--a highway bill. It was, however, \nI know on our side, and I know that in discussions with you, your \nfeeling as well, that it is not what we ought to be doing.\n  What we ought to be doing is passing a long-term, at least 6-year \nreauthorization bill for the highway program so that Governors, mayors, \ncounty executives, local officials, contractors, and construction \nworkers would all have some confidence that there would be a revenue \nstream to fix our roads, repair our bridges, and build roads where they \nare needed.\n  Can the gentleman tell me whether he believes that there is a plan to \nget to the--and I know he and I have discussed it--but a plan to get \nto, before the December 18 date that the present bill calls for, a \nlong-term highway reauthorization?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for \nhis work and help on passing the highway bill this week.\n  As the gentleman knows, nobody in this House wants to pass a short-\nterm highway bill. We want certainty. We want to make sure the money \ngoes the furthest and in the most efficient and effective way.\n  The reason why we are going to a short-term, December 18, is because \nit is our plan and our intention, together, to be able to find the \nresources to have a highway bill that can be 5 years.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  It is our intention to be able to have that.\n  We have a plan, I believe, we are working towards, and the first step \nwas extending highways to the December 18 date. All we have next is to \npass the Senate.\n  If they pass our highway bill, we will be in the right place, \nprepared to have it done before December, a 5-year that we could all \nwork together in a bipartisan manner to have done.\n  Mr. HOYER. I hope we do that.\n  In the short term, however, we have done another item which we have \nnot reauthorized, and that is the Export-Import Bank.\n  Senator McConnell believes that that has the votes in the Senate, and \nhe believes that the highway bill that we have just sent them is a \nvehicle to add that Export-Import Bank proposal to. And my presumption \nis it will be in that bill when it comes back to us.\n  Hopefully, it will come back within the next few days because, of \ncourse, the highway authorization ends at the end of this month, in \nwhich case there will be no authorization to spend money on the highway \nprogram.\n\n[[Page H5286]]\n\n  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not, if that comes back, it will \nbe on the floor? I have heard some discussion about the fact that the \nSpeaker says it will be on the floor, but the Export-Import Bank would \nbe open to amendment.\n  Would the gentleman tell me whether or not there are any plans along \nthose lines.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me one more time.\n  The gentleman is well aware of how I feel about the Export-Import \nBank, and we have a difference of opinion. I am one who has always \nbelieved in the principle that you should just deal with the subject \nthat is before you.\n  We have passed the highway bill. The best advice I can give to the \nSenate--it is a clean highway bill until December 18--is to pass a \nclean highway bill and move it to the President.\n  Mr. HOYER. I understand that that is the gentleman's desire. I know \nhe is opposed to the Ex-Im Bank reauthorization.\n  As you know, we passed it in a bipartisan fashion when the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Cantor) was the majority leader, and the gentleman \nvoted for it. He has changed his mind. Certainly many of us do that \nfrom time to time.\n  But my question to him is: If they don't do what the gentleman \nsuggests--i.e., a clean highway bill--and they send it back, as, \napparently, Leader McConnell thought that they would do, consistent \nwith his representation to the Senator from Washington State and \nothers--if they add the Ex-Im Bank to that bill and it comes back--I \nknow the gentleman is reluctant to speculate. But we have a very, very \nshort period of time left in this session before the August break.\n  Does the gentleman believe that, if it comes back and is in the \nhighway bill, that we would make the Export-Import Bank portion of that \nbill at least open to amendment?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  And if I just may correct the gentleman, he took the liberty of \nsaying whether I changed my mind. I did vote for the Ex-Im Bank 2 years \nago, but I voted for an Ex-Im Bank that had reform in it. I have not \nseen that reform. I did not change my mind. I kept my principle. The \nsame principle that I have is my best advice to the Senate.\n  I know you want to talk hypotheticals, and I know our colloquy is \nabout next week. But none of that is scheduled for next week.\n  But to the gentleman and to the Senate, my best advice for them is to \npass our clean highway bill and send it to the President.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, the problem with the suggestion the majority leader \nmakes is the Export-Import Bank will be out of business. If that \nhappens, Speaker Boehner has said it is going to adversely affect jobs \nin America. It will adversely affect the ability of small, medium, and \nlarge businesses to sell our goods overseas by people working here in \nAmerica.\n  The Export-Import Bank is about jobs, and to simply let it twist in \nthe wind and let it be unauthorized simply because of inattention, when \nit has the majority of votes on this floor? Mr. Speaker, I have said \nthat over and over again and have not been contradicted.\n  There are 60 Republicans who have sponsored the Export-Import Bank's \nreauthorization. There are 188 Democrats--or at least 185 Democrats who \nwill vote for it. That is 249 votes. All you need is 218. There is no \ndoubt that the Export-Import Bank has the votes to pass this House and \nthe Senate, and, yet, we fiddle while jobs are being burned.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is not good policy for our country. It is not good \npolicy for our workers. It is not good policy for our businesses, for \nour exporters. It makes us uncompetitive with the rest of the world. \nSixty countries have a similar facility. I know in a perfect world \nperhaps that wouldn't exist. But 60 of our competitors around the world \nhave such a facility that make their goods cheaper than we will be \nmaking ours.\n  That is not good sense. It is not good policy. It is not the \nexpectation, I think, of the American people. And it is not the will of \nthis House.\n  I regret that we have not addressed this already. But I certainly \nhope when the Senate--as I expect them to do--adds it to the House \nhighway bill--and I am not sure whether it will be our bill or their \nbill or our bill amended--we may have to go to conference or we may \nhave to get to an agreement.\n  But one way or the other, we ought to adopt the will of this House \nand reauthorize the Export-Import Bank so that we will protect jobs.\n  It was Speaker Boehner who said that it was shortly after we took the \naction we took on June 30 and allowed the Export-Import Bank to expire \nthat we would lose jobs. In fact, that is happening. So I would hope \nthat that would not be the case.\n  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the majority leader this: I \nget a lot of rumors on my side. I know you get a lot of rumors on your \nside. And I sort of smile at them and I say, ``I think not.''\n  But I have had 20 Members today ask me, Mr. Speaker, are we not going \nto be here the last week of July that is presently scheduled. And I \nwould like to clear that up.\n  I yield to my friend for a definitive answer on the schedule for--\nthis is a scheduling question, by the way, as to whether or not, in \nfact, we are going to be here the last week of July.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I smile because the only rumor I heard more of was about Taylor Swift \nin the Capitol the other day.\n  I think this is just wishful thinking of the Members. But the \nAmerican people expect us to get our work done. We have a lot of work \nto get done. No, we will be here, as the schedule says, and we will \nfinish it. But we will not be leaving early.\n  Mr. HOYER. I appreciate the majority leader's clarification. My \nMembers will not necessarily appreciate it, but I understand it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5286-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ADJOURNMENT FROM THURSDAY, JULY 16, 2015, TO MONDAY, JULY 20, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

Mr. Speaker, evidence has been made \npublic that the largest abortion provider in America has been actively \nengaged in the illegal and horrific practice of trafficking of fetal \nbody parts.\n  Planned Parenthood performs over 300,000 abortions annually. This \norganization financially gains from the destruction of innocent, unborn \nchildren and now has been shown to profit from the selling of \nchildren's organs to fetal tissue brokers.\n  Those who defend Planned Parenthood and these evil practices argue \nthese clinics simultaneously provide access to other needed health \nservices. Well, Mr. Speaker, one does not justify the other.\n  Throughout the United States, there is no shortage of faith-based \nhealth service providers that, unlike Planned Parenthood, honor, \nrespect, and care for all women and unborn children. They do not prey \non vulnerable individuals for profit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have joined my colleagues, calling for an \ninvestigation into the trafficking of fetal tissue and activities of \nabortion providers, such as Planned Parenthood, companies that broker \nfetal tissue, and any incentives created by National Institutes of \nHealth funding for research using body parts of unborn children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5286-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5286-H5287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PRIDE PARADE FESTIVAL IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY\n\n  (Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission \nto address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n\n[[Page H5287]]\n\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express \nmy deep concern over the atrocities that recently occurred at this \nyear's pride parade in Istanbul, Turkey.\n  For years, the Turkish LGBT community and their supporters have been \nable to partake in one of the few permitted pride parades in the Muslim \nworld, but this year this peaceful parade was broken up when police \ndispersed the parade with tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons, \nreminiscent of the worst full countertactics of the American civil \nrights movement.\n  LGBT pride gatherings are peaceful, focusing on love and solidarity \nand the human rights of all people, including LGBT people, which is a \nstark contrast to the unnecessary and brutal violence endured by those \nparade-goers.\n  This past May I had the opportunity to visit the brave LGBT activists \nin Turkey and to speak to them about their hopes for a better \ncommunity.\n  As a member of the LGBT community and of the Congressional Equality \nCaucus, I am deeply disturbed by the way in which such a positive \nfestival was received by the Turkish Government.\n  Turkey has long expressed, by its commitments to the Organization for \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe, its dedication to freedom of \nassembly and freedom of speech. Turkey is a NATO ally. Its actions are \nat odds with these previous commitments to freedom.\n  I am urging this Congress to join me in condemning these actions. \nToday we will send a letter signed by more than 50 Members of this body \nto the Turkish Ambassador, expressing our outrage by these actions and \nour support of the Turkish people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5287-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S SALE OF FETAL TISSUE\n\n  (Mrs. LOVE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I stand before this body because I am \noutraged at the recent revelation by a Planned Parenthood director who \nspeaks on video about harvesting an unborn baby's body parts to sell.\n  She details the horrific and barbaric practice of aborting babies in \nsuch a cold, casual way as to preserve certain body parts for sale.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an organization that receives Federal funds to \ndo their work. Is this what the taxpayers are paying for? Is this what \nthey asked for? No.\n  Given Planned Parenthood's official comments on video and the list of \nserious questions that are raised, I am calling for a full \ncongressional investigation.\n  I demand information about Planned Parenthood's donation of fetal \ntissue for research or for any other purpose and for Federal funds to \nbe completely withdrawn.\n  This is not over.

Abortion giant Planned Parenthood has \nexposed itself as a perpetuator of another shocking form of \ntrafficking: the illegal selling and buying of baby body parts and \nintact organs.\n  That is right. It is not enough that Planned Parenthood kills babies \nin the womb. No. It has to profit off the death of its victims by first \ndismembering these unborn children and then selling their organs piece \nby piece to the highest bidder.\n  Enough is enough.

In 2006, NASA launched New Horizons in an effort to \nlearn more about Pluto, the Kuiper belt, and the formation of our solar \nsystem.

Mr. Speaker, as a representative from the 25th \nCongressional District of Texas, it is my pleasure to represent Fort \nHood in the United States Congress.\n  From its state-of-the-art training facilities to its experienced \nleadership and world-renowned reputation, Fort Hood demonstrates 21st \ncentury training for the 21st century soldier. Fort Hood is a treasure \nof Texas, but it is also the gold standard for the Army, the Department \nof Defense, and our Nation's overall national security posture.\n  Last week, in an address to the National Commission on the Future of \nthe Army, I presented my thoughts on the recent troop reduction \nannouncement and how it relates to Fort Hood.\n  If sequestration takes effect in October as planned, the U.S. Army \nwill have to cut 30,000 soldiers in addition to the 40,000 soldiers \nthat will be removed from ranks over the next 2 years. At this level, \nour military may not be able to commit to current deployments, let \nalone successfully take on new challenges.\n  Mr. Speaker, with the expansion of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, the \ninstability of governments in the Middle East, and an aggressive Russia \nand China, I do not believe this is the time to be cutting our Army to \npre-World War II levels.\n  Mr. Speaker, Fort Hood is a resilient community made up of the finest \nsoldiers I have ever met. They have been dealt some serious challenges \nin recent years, and each time, they have overcome them.\n  Fort Hood is the Great Place; even so, Mr. Speaker, it is imperative \nthis Congress relieves the strain the sequester has put on Fort Hood \nand our entire military. It is not fair for our brave men and women to \nsuffer the consequences of our inability to properly govern.\n  I would like to express my gratitude to Fort Hood, the Department of \nthe Army, our soldiers and their families, and fellow Texans.\n  May God bless our troops; may God bless the Great Place, and God \nbless the United States of America.\n  In God We Trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5287-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5287-H5288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE WAR ON POVERTY\n\n  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1\n\n[[Page H5288]]\n\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, over the past four decades, the growth of \nupward mobility in America has stagnated despite the numerous programs \nand trillions of dollars spent on our efforts to reduce poverty.\n  In the wake of a stalemated war on poverty, we need to move beyond \nthe status quo and, instead, look at the tangible impact that local \nleadership is having on the programs and concepts that they have \ncreated to help those who are struggling in our communities.\n  In other words, Mr. Speaker, we need to focus on what works. Our goal \nshould be moving people out of poverty and up the socioeconomic ladder, \nand we can start by turning to our local nonprofit leaders that are \nworking to defeat hopelessness and offering concrete and aspirational \nfutures.\n  Look at AR Kids Read, the volunteer-based literacy initiative getting \nprivate sector volunteers into our elementary schools in Little Rock \nand Pulaski County and guiding third-graders to a successful future by \nworking with them to assure that they read at grade level.\n  Let's look at Our House shelter in Little Rock, which teaches \nfamilies who are struggling with homelessness how to make and sustain \npositive change.\n  Mr. Speaker, by prioritizing innovation and success in our community \nengagement, organizations like these--private, faith-based, and \npublic--working hand in hand can offer our families hope, aspiration, \nand a roadmap toward the pursuit of happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5288-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM\n\n  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK.

The New \nHorizons probe was launched almost 10 years ago; yet NASA was able to \npredict its arrival time within 1 minute only a few thousands miles \nfrom the planet.\n  New Horizon's successful mission reaffirms the leadership role the \nUnited States plays and must play in the future in space exploration. \nThis helps foster innovation and new technology. The space program also \ninspires future generations to pursue degrees and careers in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics.\n  As New Horizons begins the process of transmitting data, we will \nlearn even more about Pluto, as well as the Kuiper belt, on its next \nmission beyond Pluto.\n  Mr. Speaker, NASA's New Horizons team needs to be congratulated for \nits historic accomplishment, and it is one that all Americans can be \nproud of as a testament to America's ingenuity and determination.\n  Once again, NASA has expanded the reach of space exploration, and we \napplaud their efforts and the New Horizons team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/16/house-section/article/H5288-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAPPOINTMENT OF INDIVIDUALS TO UNITED STATES-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY \n                           REVIEW COMMISSION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
