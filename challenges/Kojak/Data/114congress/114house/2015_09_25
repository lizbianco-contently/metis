Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr. \nCalvin Moret, a true American hero and a Louisiana native. Dr. Moret \nwas the last surviving Tuskegee Airman in Louisiana, and he passed away \nthis month at the age of 90.\n  Dr. Moret's story is truly remarkable, and he stood up to hate and \nbigotry with courage and dignity. He fought for this country while \novercoming an incredible amount of racial adversity. He broke barriers, \nand he dedicated his life to service.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Calvin in Monroe, Louisiana, and as a \npilot myself, I can tell you, he was the real deal. It was the \nhighlight of my life to meet him, a true hero that had been ostracized \nby society but still believed so deeply in maintaining the freedoms of \nour country.\n  May we all have the courage Dr. Moret had to stand up for what is \ngreat in this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6231-7", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, reflecting on Pope Francis' historic \nengagement with us here in the House yesterday, he opened with \ngratefulness for our freedom. We know we have that freedom because of \nthe brave that our respective homelands have blessed us with. He spoke \nof the responsibility that we, as leaders, are to help grow a nation \nand the freedom with it. Freedom is essential in that success.\n  Pope Francis said it is for all Americans--not just its \nrepresentatives in this room and others like it--to help sustain \nsociety with action and the service attitude of organizations that are \ntruly helpful for those truly in need.\n  Through faith, not its misuse or extremism, but with humility, with \nthat attitude of service, we are a better people. But it requires \nreligious freedom, a cornerstone of our Nation's founding, indeed, \nimportant enough to be articulated and underlined in the First \nAmendment of our Bill of Rights. With that amendment, it has brought us \npeace and prosperity and helped the USA to be a beacon of hope and \nservice to the world.\n  Hand in hand with that religious freedom goes the respect of innocent \nlife and preserving the family. As Pope Francis closed his remarks on \nthe legacy for our youth, these ideals of life and family are the \nspirit we can all endeavor to pass to our youth, their future of a \ngreat land filled with freedoms and opportunity, that comes with all of \nus at that service. For all of us Americans, that is our job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6231-8", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6231-H6232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    POPE'S MESSAGE OF CHANGE IN CUBA\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, in 1987, I was grateful to \nbe present in Columbia, South Carolina, when Pope John Paul II, as the \nPolish-born Pope, promoted liberation from communism in Europe. \nYesterday, I was grateful to be present with Pope Francis.\n\n[[Page H6232]]\n\n  Prior to arriving in the United States, the Pope visited Cuba. An \nAssociated Press article, as reprinted in The Post and Courier this \nweek, said Pope Francis gave a message that Cubans should ``overcome \nideological preconceptions and be willing to change.''\n  In the communist totalitarian dictatorship of Cuba, only the \ncommunist ideology is allowed to be changed. Hopefully, change will \nlead to freedom, as proven by Pope John Paul II.\n  Change must come to the economy which was stolen from its owners and \nis now held by the Cuban military, which controls over 70 percent of \nall businesses. This corrupt regime impoverishing its citizens has been \npropped up by the Soviet Union and then Chavez of Venezuela. Both have \nnow failed, as Russians and Venezuelans see the failure of Big \nGovernment.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism, \nand God bless a liberated Cuba.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6232-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE GENERIC DRUG MARKET\n\n  (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, we all saw this past week \nas the press reported on a drug that was raised from $13.50 a tablet to \n$750 a tablet. If you spend about 60 seconds with a physician or a \npharmacist, you will find this has been going on for a couple of years \nnow.\n  Very common drugs, Narcan, that our first responders use, and digoxin \nand nitroglycerin that our heart patients use, nitroglycerin has gone \nfrom 8 cents a tablet to $8 a tablet over the last couple of years. The \nsame thing has happened with doxycycline, a generic antibiotic that has \nbeen on the market for years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to ask the FDA and the Federal Trade \nCommission to work together to help stop this fleecing of America and \nwhat is happening in the generic drug market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6232-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AVIAN INFLUENZA AND GEORGIA'S EFFORTS\n\n  (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention \nto the importance of the poultry industry to Georgia and the issue of \nhighly pathogenic avian influenza.\n  Georgia is the Nation's leading poultry-producing State, and my \nhometown of Gainesville proudly claims the title of ``chicken capital \nof the world.'' The poultry industry is critical to the Ninth District \nof Georgia and the State as a whole. The jobs of 138,000 Georgians \ndepend on the poultry industry, and poultry represents almost half of \nGeorgia's entire agriculture sector.\n  Given the scale and importance of the industry to Georgia, it is \ncritically important that adequate attention is paid to the potential \nthreat of bird flu. We saw the devastating impact of a highly \npathogenic AI outbreak earlier this year. It was the worst animal \ndisease outbreak in U.S. history. Now, with birds migrating south for \nthe winter, we have to face the prospect of a disease striking the \npoultry industry again.\n  Mr. Speaker, APHIS has released a fall plan, and I understand that \nUSDA has been in touch with State governments. But we must do more than \nsimply conceptualize a response. We need to take proactive steps to \nprevent the spread and severity of high-path AI.\n  I want to commend Commissioner Black and the Georgia Department of \nAgriculture for their dedication to preparing for a potential outbreak \nand the commitment of thousands of Georgians who depend on the poultry \nindustry.\n  I am calling on all agencies to work closely with Georgia and \nimplement meaningful measures in coordination with State needs and \nrecommendations. We need to shorten response time, install biosecurity \nmeasures, and work to prevent or reduce future outbreaks. We simply \ncannot wait to act. Steps must be taken now to mitigate damages to this \nindustry that is so vital to the economy in northeast Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6232-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6232-H6247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RESPONSIBLY AND PROFESSIONALLY INVIGORATING DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MARINO.

Mr. Chairman, the\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment has been \ncategorized as a technical amendment. We are told the amendment is \ndesigned to clarify the bill, which is being sold as the answer to our \nNation's economic woes.\n  The bill is supposed to streamline government environmental reviews, \nand this amendment is supposed to streamline the underlying bill. \nUnfortunately, the only thing that is being streamlined here are the \nfacts about NEPA.\n  Mr. Chairman, the facts are not in the Republicans' favor. For more \nthan 40 years, NEPA has ensured that federally funded projects are \ncarried out in a transparent and cost-effective manner, while fostering \npublic participation in the decisionmaking process and minimizing \nimpacts to the environment.\n  In fact, NEPA often provides the only forum for citizens to engage in \nmajor Federal actions that affect our health, well-being, and the \nenvironment. NEPA saves millions of dollars and is a tool for \nenvironmental justice. NEPA gave the confederated Salish and Kootenai \ntribal governments and citizen groups an opportunity to engage in the \ndesign of U.S. 93 in western Montana, resulting in a project that \nsuccessfully addressed safety, environmental, family farming, and \ncultural concerns.\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n  NEPA's success stories, where the process saves money and improves \nthe quality of life for people impacted by Federal decisions, go on and \non. My Republican colleagues tend to streamline these stories so we \nnever get a chance to hear them.\n  Here are some facts my Republican colleagues might have missed during \ntheir streamlining:\n  95 percent of all NEPA analyses are completed through categorical \nexclusion, which generally requires only a few days.\n  Less than 5 percent of NEPA actions require an environmental \nassessment, and less than 1 percent require a full EIS. Those projects \nthat do require an EIS tend to be the largest, most complex. The delays \nthat do occur are more likely the result of local opposition, a lack of \nfunding, or changes in the project's scope.\n  Agency data, interviews with agency officials, and available studies \nshow that most NEPA analyses do not result in litigation; yet, the \nunderlying bill seeks to restrict judicial review, and the manager's \namendment would create a judicial bar to the courthouse doors before a \nparty could seek judicial review.\n  Typically, there have been fewer than 100 cases per year nationwide \nin the last decade even though the NEPA review process is applied to \ntens of thousands of government actions each year and tens of thousands \nmore that are classified as exempt from review based on categorical \nexclusions.\n  NEPA is not a barrier to development. It is a tool for better \ndecision-making. The only reason to avoid NEPA or to weaken it is so \nthat you can make decisions less carefully. This is the purpose of the \nlegislation.\n  Apparently, the bill itself was not drafted very carefully; so, we \nhave a manager's amendment to fix all the errors. This manager's \namendment is just more proof that my Republican colleagues should leave \nNEPA alone because their understanding of how it works and what it does \nis, unfortunately, too streamlined.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \nHouse Report 114-261.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 14, line 11, insert after the period at the end the \n     following: ``No alternative may be deemed feasible if the \n     alternative does not adequately address risks associated with \n     flooding, wildfire, and climate change.''\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Lowenthal) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As my fellow Californian Ronald Reagan once said, ``There you go \nagain.'' Attacks on NEPA have become almost a common, weekly occurrence \nin this Congress, and H.R. 348 is just the latest iteration.\n  We should really call this bill the VAPID Act because it is tired, \nunimaginative, and a ploy to undermine one of our bedrock environmental \nlaws: NEPA.\n  My amendment would not fix all of this bill's problems, but it \ncertainly would inject some small sense of fiscal responsibility into \nthis legislation that seemingly has been designed for wasting \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Restricting the ability of the public to comment on proposed projects \nvirtually guarantees more lawsuits and more hastily approved projects \nthat\n\n[[Page H6237]]\n\ncould turn into embarrassing boondoggles.\n  Particularly in the face of climate change, we must take special care \nto ensure that the future value of projects is considered. This means \nthoroughly evaluating the risks associated with more frequent and \nintense wildfires as well as flooding caused by stronger storms and \nhigher sea levels.\n  Doing these reviews will not delay projects. As was pointed out by \nthe ranking member, it is a fact that 95 percent of all NEPA analyses \nare completed through categorical exclusions, which generally require \nonly a few days to process.\n  Less than 5 percent require an environmental assessment, and less \nthan 1 percent require a full environmental impact statement, or an \nEIS.\n  Those projects that do require an EIS tend to be the largest and most \ncomplex, and delays that do occur are more likely the result of local \nopposition, a lack of funding, or changes in the project's scope, not \ndue to NEPA.\n  Making sure that roads aren't wiped out by a future storm surge or \nthat activities in our national forests don't spark fires or that \ngovernment-financed and -permitted actions are resilient to climate \nchange is the least we can do to protect taxpayers and the environment.\n  To do this, we need to keep NEPA strong, not weaken it by making \ngovernment actions less transparent. The current NEPA process allows \nfor the full consideration of the costs and the benefits of proposed \nactions and leads to environmentally and economically sound outcomes.\n  I urge a ``yea'' vote on my amendment because the threats associated \nwith climate change and related natural hazards are too great for this \nHouse to continue to ignore.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, by its terms, the amendment brands \ninfeasible--and, thus, barred from further evaluation--project \nalternatives that do not appear at the outset of the review process to \nadequately address risks associated with flooding, wildfire, and \nclimate change. With all due respect, that puts the cart before the \nhorse.\n  The bill is intended to allow the review of alternatives that are \ntechnically and economically feasible. It is entirely possible that, \nduring the course of review, a technically and economically feasible \nalternative that appears initially to be inadequate to address these \nrisks could, on further review, be found to be adequate or to be \nimproved to be adequate. It might even ultimately be found to be the \nbest alternative under review.\n  Why should we prematurely end the evaluation of alternatives that \ncould ultimately prove adequate with regard to these types of risks?\n  This does not prevent the review process. What it does prevent is \nsomeone waiting to get in at the last moment, which has been 5 or 6 \nyears later, to jam the system up in court, therefore crushing jobs and \nletting regulation run rampant.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I just want to comment that risks due to \nflooding, to stronger storms, to climate change are not putting the \ncart before the horse. I am simply asking that we don't waste \ntaxpayers' money by not considering these risks. This is a fiscally \nsound amendment, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \nHouse Report 114-261.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 15, after line 21, insert the following:\n       ``(6) Low-income and communities of color analysis.--The \n     evaluation of each alternative in an environmental impact \n     statement or an environmental assessment shall identify the \n     potential effects of the alternative on low-income \n     communities and communities of color.''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the National Environmental Policy Act, or \nNEPA, is a 45-year-old law which stands, basically, for two things: \nthat the Federal Government should consider alternatives before taking \naction that can impact people's lives and that the public should have \nthe opportunity to comment on those alternatives before a final \ndecision is made.\n  House Republicans oppose both of these simple principles and so they \nattack NEPA time after time, year after year. The bill before us today \nis just a rerun of those attacks.\n  My amendment, unfortunately, cannot fix this bill. In fact, my \namendment is really just proof of what is so dangerous about the RAPID \nAct. Among the critical issues that can be addressed through our \nexisting NEPA process is ensuring environmental justice.\n  Bills like the one we are considering today seek to short-circuit \nthat process; so, they seek to short-circuit environmental justice \nconcerns. My amendment would put environmental justice considerations \nback in the process created by this legislation; but we would not even \nneed this amendment if Republicans would just leave NEPA alone.\n  Twenty-one years ago President Bill Clinton issued his executive \norder on environmental justice. After decades of hard work, struggle, \nsome victories along the way, the promise of environmental justice for \nall communities remains unfulfilled.\n  While environmental toxins and pollution know no class or race, low-\nincome communities and communities of color bear a disproportionate \nshare of adverse environmental consequences.\n  Low-income communities and communities of color are routinely \ntargeted to host facilities that have negative environmental impacts, \nsuch as landfills, refineries, chemical plants, freeways, and ports.\n  Seventy-eight percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of a \ncoal-fired power plant. Nearly one out of every two Latinos lives in \nthe country's top 25 most ozone-polluted cities.\n  For decades, these communities have been battling environmental \ninjustices and have been seeking to build healthy, livable, and \nsustainable communities.\n  NEPA recognizes that, when the public and Federal experts work \ntogether, better decisions are made. We have not solved the problem \nyet, but the solution is a more inclusive, more rigorous use of the \nNEPA process, not these constant, industry-friendly attacks on the law.\n  Every person has the right to live, work, and play in a healthy and \nsafe environment; yet, too often, the health of too many Americans is \ndetermined by their race, class, ZIP code, and street address.\n  It is unfortunate and inefficient to have to come down here to \nprotect these issues one by one for each and every Republican bill that \nis presented.\n  The adoption of my amendment would keep H.R. 348 from destroying the \nprogress we have made on issues for communities of color, but it \ndoesn't solve the problem.\n  A far better approach would be to drop H.R. 348 and to instead invest \nin making NEPA stronger and more inclusive than ever.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nam not opposed to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H6238]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, among those who suffer most unfairly from \npoor government decision-making are the communities the gentleman's \namendment addresses. For example, growing research shows that the costs \nof new regulations often have regressive effects on those with lower \nincomes. When poor government decision-making occurs in the permit \nreview process, similar unfair effects may occur.\n  The gentleman's amendment guards against this by requiring agencies \nto identify and reveal the potential adverse effects of project \nalternatives on low-income communities and communities of color. Once \nidentified and revealed, of course, any such effects may be avoided, \nminimized, or mitigated.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA.

Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Gallego) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment \nto the RAPID Act, a misguided bill that will disempower local leaders, \nincluding tribal leaders, and threaten the health and safety of our \ncommunities and their communities.\n  As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, time and time again I \nhave witnessed the Republican majority siding with big business and \ngutting bedrock environmental safeguards that for decades have \nprotected our families and our natural heritage.\n  My Republican friends claim that this bill is intended to protect the \ninterest of our States and Native American tribes.\n  Mr. Chair, we already have a law on the books for that purpose. It is \ncalled the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, and it works. At \nits heart, NEPA ensures that our government is accountable to the \npeople.\n  This critical law has protected the environment for more than 40 \nyears without imposing arbitrary deadlines or limiting vital public \ninput.\n  It guarantees the public an opportunity to review and comment on \nactions proposed by the government, enabling important perspectives \nthat would otherwise go unnoticed. In this way, NEPA can actually serve \nas a check on Big Government.\n  Unfortunately, the RAPID Act promises the opposite, a deeply flawed \nprocess that would diminish the voice of State, local, and tribal \ncommunities.\n  The RAPID Act will also establish a new regulatory framework that \npurposely overrides the NEPA review process, limiting public input and \nconsequently undermining the quality and integrity of Federal agency \ndecisions.\n  Among its many dangerous provisions, the bill will also trigger the \nautomatic approval of construction projects if agencies miss arbitrary \ndeadlines, regardless of the complexity or hazard posed by such \npotential projects.\n  Though the bill includes some extremely limited and narrow exceptions \nfor these deadlines, as it is currently written, it fails to extend \nthose deadlines for our local communities.\n  My amendment would simply create a new good cause exception that \nwould allow a deadline to be extended if a request is made from a \nlocal- or State-elected official or a local tribal leader.\n  While my amendment does not fix all the problems in the underlying \nbill, it ensures that, if this bill should pass, our local and tribal \nleaders will continue to be empowered, as they are currently under \nNEPA.\n  I support the goal of reducing red tape, but stripping away the \nability of our local communities to have their voices heard is \nundemocratic and unacceptable. Mr. Chair, special interests don't need \nus to fight for them. Our communities do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and to stand with our \nlocal and tribal leaders when it comes to projects in their own back \nyards that impact their homes, families, and business.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow agencies to \nescape the bill's streamlined permitting deadlines simply because an \nelected State or local official or a local tribal official asks for an \nextension.\n  The amendment contains no requirement that a Federal agency find the \ncompelling basis for an extension or even a significant basis or even \nany substantive basis at all.\n  On the contrary, all that a recalcitrant Federal agency, a project \nopponent, or anyone else would need to defeat an efficient permitting \ndecision is to find an elected State or local official or a local \ntribal official willing to put in an extension request for them.\n  The potential for abuse of this proposed provision by those who only \nseek delay for delay's sake or who seek to kill worthy projects \noutright is obvious.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gallego).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GALLEGO.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in \nHouse Report 114-261.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I hope that we will find common ground \non really responding to a great concern that I think all Americans \nshould be concerned about.\n  Although this bill is called the RAPID Act, were it to become law, in \nthe present form, a permit or license for a project would be deemed \napproved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or \nlicense within 90 to 120 days. That is a short period of\n\n[[Page H6239]]\n\ntime for complex regulatory structures that deal with complex \nindustries.\n  An industry that I represent in Houston, Texas, the energy industry, \nhas complex needs and, as well, complex impacts and consequences if we \ndo not deal with the agencies responsible, if the DOE, for example, \ndoes not do its due diligence.\n  Now, let me say this, Mr. Chairman. These particular permits are done \nsooner than 90 to 120 days. But what this bill says is, if the agency \nis engaged in a very complex deliberative thought process, then, if \nthey reach that deadline and they still have not finished, they are \nthen, if you will, throwing to the side all of the safety issues and \nissues dealing with the protection of the American people under the \nbus.\n  My amendment strikes the provision, deeming approved any project for \nwhich an agency does not meet the deadlines contained in the bill.\n  I can appreciate some of the frustrations through the review process \nby the National Environmental Policy Act, but the cure is not this \nbill.\n  If a Federal agency has failed to approve or disapprove a project or \nmake the required finding, we are in trouble. Babies are in trouble \nwith formula. Senior citizens are in trouble with various \npharmaceuticals. They are in trouble. And then, if we run up against \nthe deadline, there is no response.\n  Second, frequently there are times when it is the case that the \ncomplexity of the issues, as I said, warrant us to do so. In other \nwords, what this bill is saying is: To heck with reason and good \njudgment. We do not care. To heck with protecting the American people. \nWe do not care.\n  As I listened intently and intensely to the Pope's words yesterday, I \noffer this quote: Moses provided us with a good synthesis of your work. \nYou are asked to protect--and speaking to us--by means of the law, the \nimage, and likeness fashioned by God on every human face.\n  This bill smacks in the face of that instruction. I believe that this \namendment is worthy of passing.\n  Mr. Chair, if H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, were to become law \nin its present form, a permit or license for project would be \n``deemed'' approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the \nrequested permit or license within 90-120 days.\n  My amendment strikes the provision deeming approved any project for \nwhich agency does not meet deadlines contained in the bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I can appreciate some of the frustrations expressed by \nmany of our friends across the aisle when it comes to review process \nmandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).\n  But the cure they propose in H.R. 348 is an example of a medicine \nthat is worse than the disease.\n  Under H.R. 348, if a federal agency fails to approve or disapprove \nthe project or make the required finding of the termination within the \napplicable deadline, which is either 90 days or 120 days, depending on \nthe situation, then the project is automatically deemed approved by \nsuch agency.\n  This creates a set of unintended consequences.\n  First, as an agency is up against that deadline and legitimate work \nis yet to be completed, it is likely to disapprove the project simply \nbecause the issues have not been vetted.\n  Second, frequently there are times when it is the case that the \ncomplexity of issues that need to be resolved necessitates a longer \nreview period, rather than an arbitrary limit.\n  So if H.R. 348 were to become law the most likely outcome is that \nfederal agencies would be required to make decisions based on \nincomplete information, or information that may not be available within \nthe stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would \nhave been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time.\n  In other words, fewer projects would be approved, not more.\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 348 ostensibly seeks to make a minor procedure \nadjustment to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n  In reality, however, H.R. 348 would radically transform the NEPA \nreview process, and not for the better either.\n  For more than 40 years, NEPA has been the law of the land and has \nprovided a remarkably effective framework for all types of projects \n(not just construction projects) that require federal approval pursuant \nto a federal law, such as the Clean Air Act.\n  For these reasons, I urge all Members to support the Jackson Lee \nAmendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, the American people desperately need new \njobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, America's labor \nforce participation rate remains mired among historic lows.\n  Almost 94 million Americans who could work are outside the workforce. \nThat is more than the population of all but 12 of the world's countries \nand more than every other country in the Western Hemisphere, except for \nBrazil and Mexico.\n  We face this historically low rate not because Americans don't want \nto work, but because so many Americans have despaired of any hope of \nfinding a new full-time job and have abandoned the workforce.\n  The RAPID Act offers strong help to reverse this tragedy, restore the \nhope, and produce millions of new jobs. We must pass the bill, not \nweaken it, to provide these new high-wage jobs.\n  The gentlewoman's amendment would weaken the bill in one of the worst \npossible ways. It would remove the clear consequences in the bill for \nagencies that refuse to follow the bill's deadlines. That consequence \nis to deem permits approved if agencies refuse to approve or deny them \nwithin those deadlines.\n  Mr. Chairman, the bill provides 4\\1/2\\ years for agencies to complete \ntheir environmental reviews for new permit applications and reasonable \nand additional time for agencies to wrap up final permit approvals or \ndenials after that; 4\\1/2\\ years is more time than it took the United \nStates to fight and win World War II.\n  If agencies can't wrap up their environmental reviews in that much \ntime and then meet the bill's remaining deadlines, there is something \nterribly wrong with the agencies.\n  The prospect of facing a default approval at the end of the \nsubstantial time the bill grants is an eminently reasonable way to \nassure that agencies will conduct full reviews and wrap their work up \nin time to make up or down decisions on their own.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am so glad my colleague mentioned \nthe question of jobs.\n  Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I am very glad my colleague mentioned \njobs because none of us here are fighting against jobs.\n  In fact, I happen to be supporting the full employment legislation \nthat my good friend, Congressman John Conyers, has offered and I have \njoined.\n  We are not here speaking against jobs. We are speaking for the \nAmerican people.\n  We are trying to explain the complexity of the permitting process. \nWhether it is for drilling, whether it is to deal with construction, \nwhether it is to deal with complex environmental issues that have to be \naddressed impacting the American people or, for example, whether it is \ndealing with the Volkswagen company that saw fit to do the technology \nto undermine viable rules that the American automobile industry was \ncomplying with, definitely impacting jobs, I would have hoped that we \nwould have had a process of permitting or a process of determining \nwhether the Volkswagen company was violating these rules that were here \nto help the issue of pollution and other issues here, but also \nundermining the jobs of our own American companies.\n  Let me say that the Jackson Lee amendment, in essence, is to suggest \nthat there is a lot of complexity that my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle with the RAPID Act--the very name of it suggests that we are \nthrowing judgment to the wind.\n  All we want to do is to move forward, even if they are ill. And we \ndon't want the taxpayer dollars that have asked these workers in these \nagencies who have the expertise from the DOE, to the FDA and beyond--\nFood and Drug Administration, Department of Energy--to protect us.\n  I believe, Mr. Chairman, that my amendment, by eliminating the 90 to \n120, deeming it approved in the midst\n\n[[Page H6240]]\n\nof a crisis when it is not fit to be approved, is an amendment that \nthis body should pass.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment because I am \nhere to protect the American people and to do justly, as has been given \nto us in a wonderful message yesterday by Pope Francis.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I want to just give a couple of examples of \nthe timing factor that we are seeing that the agencies just are not \nexecuting properly.\n  Cape Wind Project: For more than 12 years--12 years--they were \nwaiting for permits to build an operation that would create jobs and \nrenewable energy. 12 years.\n  Orange County toll road in Orange County, California: There was a 12-\nyear delay there as well. The project was extended tens of millions of \ndollars because of the delay there, and jobs were lost because of that.\n  Charleston Harbor, Savannah Port dredging project: Again, there was a \ndecade of delays in permitting because agencies are just sitting \naround, not taking the job responsibly. They never would survive in \nprivate industry if they operated under those conditions.\n  So those are a few examples of the cost in dollars and cents and the \njobs that are lost because of these agencies not performing their \nresponsibilities.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n\n                Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mrs. Dingell\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in \nHouse Report 114-261.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 25, line 4, insert before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, unless the project would limit access to or \n     opportunities for hunting or fishing, or impact a species \n     listed as an endangered species or threatened species under \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Dingell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA as we frequently \nshorthand it, is one of our bedrock conservation laws, and it has a \nsimple premise: look before you leap. Its timelines are designed to \nprovide transparency and public participation in government. H.R. 348 \nwould move us in the opposite direction.\n  My amendment would not fix all of the problems with this bill, but it \nwould allow hunters, anglers, and wildlife enthusiasts to continue to \nenjoy the benefits that NEPA provides.\n  Several recent stories help explain the benefits of NEPA, including \nthe following:\n  Recently, a plan to improve U.S. 23 in my home State of Michigan was \nmodified to avoid the largest loss of wetlands in our State's history. \nNot only will this help improve the biodiversity of the region, but it \nwill also preserve that habitat for migratory waterfowl prized by \nhunters. This land could have been lost and hunters would have had \ntheir access reduced if not for the robust comment process that NEPA \nprovides.\n  There are similar stories across the country. In 2013, changes to the \nArmy Corps of Engineers' plan to increase storage capacity at the John \nRedmond Reservoir in Kansas were needed to protect prime deer and \nturkey hunting areas, as well as avoid the destruction of a local boat \nramp providing fishermen access to the lake.\n  In 2004, sportsmen's groups from across the country banded together \nduring the NEPA review process and caused BLM to withdraw a proposal to \nallow oil and gas drilling along the Rocky Mountain Front in Montana.\n  The list goes on and on, but the point is that none of these positive \noutcomes would have been achieved without a strong NEPA process that \nencourages public participation instead of limiting it.\n  Furthermore, the habitats utilized by game and sports fishermen are \nthe same as those utilized by endangered fish, wildlife, and plants. \nDestroying one destroys the other, which is why NEPA must allow for a \nthorough review of potential impacts to listed species.\n  My amendment would ensure these protections will be preserved so \nhunters, fishermen, and American wildlife will continue to benefit from \nthem. There is absolutely no legitimate reason to limit public \noversight of taxpayer-funded projects.\n  NEPA shines a light on proposed government actions and helps local \ncitizens provide new information and ideas, improve projects, and \nensure sustainable decisionmaking. It helps Federal authorities \nconsider a range of alternatives, often resulting in lower costs to the \npublic, something I am sure everyone here supports.\n  NEPA is a quintessentially American, quintessentially small-\ngovernment law. It reinforces the rights of people to hold their \ngovernment accountable. A host of environmental groups have endorsed my \namendment, but I am particularly pleased to have the support of Trout \nUnlimited, because my amendment would help protect the rights of \nanglers. If you hunt, you fish or have constituents who do, you should \nsupport a strong NEPA and vote for my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, one of the linchpins of the RAPID Act is \nits set of provisions that: deem a permit approved if the permitting \nagency refuses to meet the bill's reasonable deadlines; and, prohibit a \ncourt from overturning a permit approval simply because the permit was \ndeemed approved when deadlines expired before action was taken.\n  If we do not include consequences like these in the bill, how will we \never ensure that recalcitrant, foot-dragging Federal agencies will \nachieve the bill's goal of streamlined permit decisions?\n  The amendment, however, removes all consequences for agencies' foot-\ndragging so long as the projects at issue would either limit access to \nor opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact an endangered or \nthreatened species. That is in the bill. The amendment's sponsor offers \nno sound reason to do this.\n  The bill does not require projects with these kinds of impacts to be \napproved. It just requires that permitting decisions, up or down, be \nreached after, at most, 4\\1/2\\ years of environmental review. Surely \nthat is enough time to review all kinds of projects, including those \nthat limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact \nendangered or threatened species.\n  To make matters worse, the bill would allow agencies to drag their \nfeet without consequences even if a project had a beneficial impact on \nan endangered or threatened species. Why should we allow delay for \nthat?\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I want to quickly respond to the comments \nmade by my colleague on the other side of the aisle.\n  We often hear that NEPA is a scapegoat for projects being delayed, \nbut as the GAO and others have found, outside issues, including the \ncomplexity of the project, local opposition and, most importantly, \nfunding issues are almost always the cause of delays.\n  If we adequately funded highway and infrastructure projects, we \nwouldn't be seeing so many delays the majority is\n\n[[Page H6241]]\n\nso concerned with. NEPA is a convenient excuse, but the facts simply \ndon't support the claim that it is the root cause of projects being \ndelayed.\n  We should not be limiting the public's ability to comment on \ngovernment decisions; but, instead, we should be enhancing them. This \nbill does the opposite. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment \nand oppose the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, my colleague forgets to mention the fact \nthat the lead Federal agency in this is responsible for maintaining a \nschedule, just like we do in private industry, just like we do in our \nown homes. That agency is responsible for going to the States and to \nthe locals and other Federal agencies to make sure things are being \ndone. Unfortunately, here in D.C., and sometimes at the State level, \nthe left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, and this is \nmaking agencies responsible for that. It is just common sense.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Peters\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in \nHouse Report 114-261.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 27, strike line 11 and all that follows through page \n     28, line 4, and redesignate provisions accordingly.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Peters) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, before I entered public service, I practiced \nenvironmental law for 15 years in large firms, in a government office, \nand in my own firm. Through that experience, I learned firsthand of the \nfrustration that many businesses and local governments face when they \ntry to navigate overly complex and underly responsive permit processes.\n  I also know from experience that time is money, and often a business \nseeking a permit is paying dearly to hold a property or to service a \nloan while it waits for that permit to be issued. That is why I have \noften said that for applicants, ``no'' is the second best answer. Tell \nus ``no'' or tell us how, but don't string us along.\n  That is why I appreciate the spirit of the RAPID Act. I don't think \nit is the perfect answer. Frankly, I don't think it will become law. I \nam working on some other streamlining strategies that I think are \nsuperior and might have the bipartisan support that both would get them \nthrough this Chamber and the Senate and get them signed into law by \nPresident Obama.\n  As I told my colleagues on the Committee on the Judiciary, I will \nvote for the RAPID Act if Congress adopts my amendment and does not \npass restrictions on considering the role of greenhouse gasses and \nclimate change on our environment.\n  My amendment would simply eliminate subsection (k) of the bill, a \nsection that explicitly prohibits any consideration of the social cost \nof carbon. For too long we have heard that we have to choose between a \nprosperous economy and a clean environment. San Diegans and people \naround the country know that is a false choice.\n  We can and we must provide economic opportunity and clean air and \nclean water for future generations. That means providing businesses and \ncommunities with regulatory certainty to help them plan and invest in \nthe future, and it also means that we use this streamlined process, \nwith tight and reliable deadlines, to analyze the economic, \nenvironmental, and social costs of carbon dioxide emissions.\n  As highlighted in former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's bipartisan \nRisky Business report, accounting for the social cost of carbon and \npreparing for climate change is just smart business practice. The costs \nof carbon include financial losses from sea level rise. If we continue \non our current path of carbon emissions, by 2050, between 66 and 106 \nbillion dollars worth of existing coastal property will likely be below \nsea level nationwide. Eighty-seven percent of all Californians live in \ncoastal counties, and 80 percent of the State's GDP is derived from \nthose counties.\n  Climate affects energy supply costs. Greenhouse gas-driven changes in \ntemperature, catalyzed by burning fossil fuels, would require us to \nbuild new power generation facilities to help cool homes and businesses \nthat Risky Business estimates will cost residential and commercial \nratepayers as much as $12 billion a year.\n  That is $12 billion that could be used by families to put their kids \nthrough school or buy a home, or by businesses to hire more employees.\n  Climate affects the cost of national defense. In 2014, the Pentagon \nissued a report on the security risks associated with profound changes \nto global climate and the environment. The report found that climate \nchange poses an immediate threat to national security. That will put \nadditional upward pressure on our already-stressed defense budget.\n  Climate affects agriculture, water supply, fire preparedness. In \nCalifornia, the largest agriculture producing State in the country, we \nare in the fourth year of what has been one of the worst droughts in \nrecorded history. Communities across the State are facing water \nshortages. Dry conditions have extended our fire season to be nearly a \nyear-round concern.\n  Given the stakes associated with carbon emissions on coastal \nproperty, energy, defense, our food supply, fires, and our quality of \nlife, shouldn't we at least understand the long-term costs associated \nwith the project?\n  This bill could hold the line on responsiveness and provide long-term \ncertainty to businesses without burying our collective heads in the \nsand on the costs of carbon, one of the main environmental impacts this \nenvironmental law must confront. By stripping out subsection (k) and \nallowing us to consider the real costs of carbon on our economy, my \namendment rejects the false choice between a prosperous economy and a \nhealthy climate. We can and we must have both.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, the amendment seeks to strike the bill's \nprohibition against agency use in permitting reviews of the Obama \nadministration's pronouncements on the social costs of carbon, but this \nprohibition was adopted last term for a very good reason.\n  The administration's social cost of carbon estimate is junk science. \nTo be specific, multiple commentators on the administration's findings \nabout the social cost of carbon argue that carbon's social cost is an \nunknown quantity, that social cost of carbon analysts can get just \nabout any result they desire by fiddling with nonvalidated climate \nparameters, made-up damage functions, and below-market discount rates, \nand that social cost of carbon analysis is computer-aided sophistry, \nits political function being to make renewable energy look like a \nbargain at any price and fossil energy look unaffordable, no matter how \ncheap.\n  Junk science and sophistry has no place standing between hard-working \nAmericans and new, high-paying jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 30 seconds remaining.\n\n[[Page H6242]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have two responses. One, this is not \nPresident Obama's agenda. This is the agenda of a bipartisan report, \nRisky Business, the Department of Defense, and a number of other people \nwho have recognized this is a real problem we have to confront.\n  Second, I would say to the gentleman: Let the science work itself out \nthrough the process. There is plenty of science that is questioned in \nthe NEPA process. There is no other point at which this body has \nprevented a discussion of any content except here.\n  Let the process work it out. I will be with you on your timelines. We \nwill get businesses the certainty that they deserve.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Mr. MARINO. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania and fellow member of the Judiciary Committee for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. The social cost of carbon is a \nflawed concept that should play no role in the environmental \ndecisionmaking process.\n  It is based on speculative formulas and has no basis in reality. \nFormulas can easily be manipulated to support any costly regulation.\n  The social cost of carbon is a political tool the Obama \nadministration uses to impose its extreme agenda on the American \npeople.\n  It is also another way that the administration tries to use secret \nscience and data to justify questionable rulemaking. Speculating on the \nsocial cost of carbon should be restricted, not expanded.\n  For these reasons, an agency should not use the social cost of carbon \nin its environmental review or in its environmental decisionmaking \nprocess.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Peters).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in \nHouse Report 114-261.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 28, line 1, insert after ``substantially related \n     document,'' the following: ``the draft guidance entitled: \n     `Revised Draft Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies \n     on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects \n     of Climate change in NEPA Reviews' (79 Fed. Reg. 77801), or \n     any successor thereto or substantially related document,''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense \namendment that will protect American jobs and our economy by \nprohibiting Federal agencies from being forced to follow job-killing \nand unlawful draft guidance that sneakily seeks to implement Federal \npolicies that pave the way for cap-and-trade-like mandates.\n  Congress and the American people have repeatedly rejected cap-and-\ntrade proposals pushed by this President and his Big Government allies.\n  Knowing he can't lawfully enact a carbon dioxide tax plan, President \nObama has chosen to circumvent Congress and is now seeking to address \nclimate change by playing loose and getting creative with the Clean Air \nAct as well as through an unlawful guidance issued in December 2014.\n  The underlying bill already prohibits Federal agencies from utilizing \nthe social cost of carbon valuation. Furthermore, the social cost of \ncarbon valuation was rejected four times by this very body last \nCongress.\n  My simple, clarifying amendment adds to the Obama administration's \nrevised draft guidance for greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of \nclimate change that were issued by the White House in December 2014 to \nthe definition for social cost of carbon in the bill.\n  This straightforward amendment is common sense, as this deeply flawed \nguidance instructs agencies to include a controversial measurement of \nthe social cost of carbon into their analyses and is the Obama \nadministration's latest tool for attempting to implement this terrible \nnew model that has consistently been rejected by the House.\n  Roger Martella, a self-described lifelong environmentalist and career \nenvironmental lawyer, testified at the May 2015 House Natural Resources \nCommittee hearing on the revised guidance and the flaws associated with \nthe social cost of carbon model, stating:\n  The `` `social cost of carbon' estimates suffer from a number of \nsignificant flaws that should exclude them from the NEPA process.\n  ``First, projected costs of carbon emissions can be manipulated by \nchanging key parameters such as timeframes, discount rates, and other \nvalues that have no relation to a given project undergoing review. As a \nresult, applying social cost of carbon estimates can be used to promote \npre-determined policy preferences rather than provide for a fair and \nobjective evaluation of a specific proposed federal action.\n  ``Second, OMB and the other federal agencies developed the draft \nSocial Cost of Carbon estimates without any known peer review or \nopportunity for public comment during the development process. This \nprocess is antithetical to NEPA's central premise that informed agency \ndecision making must be based on transparency and open dialogue with \nthe public.\n  ``Third, OMB's draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates are based \nprimarily on global rather than domestic costs and benefits. This is \nparticularly problematic for NEPA reviews because the Courts have \nestablished that agencies cannot consider transnational impacts in NEPA \nreviews.\n  ``Fourth, there is still considerable uncertainty in many of the \nassumptions and data elements used to create the draft Social Cost of \nCarbon estimates, such as the damage functions and modeled time \nhorizons. In light of the lack of transparency in the OMB's process, \nthese concerns over accuracy are particularly problematic.''\n  Mr. Martella's testimony was spot on. Congress, not Washington \nbureaucrats at the behest of the President, should dictate our \ncountry's climate change policy.\n  These sweeping new changes that are seeking to be implemented by the \nWhite House did not go through the normal regulatory process, and there \nwas no public comment.\n  Furthermore, the Obama administration has refused to answer pivotal \nquestions about this guidance and even failed to send a witness to a \nMay 2015 hearing on this matter.\n  While the Obama administration acknowledged the draft guidance is not \nlegally enforceable, you best believe that Federal agencies that \nreceived the 31-page revised guidance will treat this document like it \nwas signed into law by the President.\n  Unfortunately, this administration just doesn't get it and continues \nto try to circumvent Congress to impose an extremist agenda that is not \nbased on the best available science.\n  Worse yet, the model utilized to predict the social cost of carbon \ncan easily be manipulated to arrive at any desired outcome.\n  The House has rejected the social cost of carbon numerous times. I \nask all those to join me once again in rejecting this flawed proposal \nand protecting jobs right here in America.\n  I commend the chairman and the committee for their efforts on this \nlegislation and for recognizing that the NEPA process is in desperate \nneed of reform.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Gosar \namendment\n\n[[Page H6243]]\n\nbecause it would weaken a critical part of the National Environmental \nPolicy Act.\n  The Council on Environmental Quality recently issued draft guidance \nunder NEPA detailing how Federal agencies should consider the effects \nof greenhouse gas emissions.\n  This NEPA guidance is a commonsense and perfectly legal step toward \nreducing the Federal Government's contribution and vulnerability to \nglobal warming. It is smart planning that accounts for risk and will \nsave taxpayers money, something I am sure that everyone here can \nsupport.\n  Furthermore, the guidance will only increase NEPA's effectiveness as \na tool for environmental justice, helping communities that cannot \nafford expensive lobbyists to protect their homes and values. \nClimate change is hitting low-income communities and communities of \ncolor the hardest.\n\n  Instead of blocking progress, we should congratulate President Obama \nand CEQ on issuing this incredibly important and long overdue draft \nguidance to Federal agencies and urge them to issue a final version as \nsoon as possible.\n  And, for the record, my understanding is CEQ did have a witness at \nthe hearing that was just referred to.\n  This guidance makes clear that Federal agencies must factor \ngreenhouse gas emissions and climate change into their decisions and \nwill produce better, more informed and more efficient outcomes.\n  Efforts to convince the American people we have nothing to do with \nclimate change--or, as Pope Francis said in words the American people \nunderstood yesterday: air pollution--will not slow the pace of actual \nclimate change, and it will harm our economy, public health, and \nnational security. That is why this is a bad amendment.\n  We urge you to vote against it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  The Earth's climate has been changing since the beginning of time, \nand that is something that we can all agree on.\n  MIT researchers recently reported that there was a massive extinction \nsome 252 million years ago that coincided with a massive buildup of \ncarbon dioxide. While the cause of the massive buildup is unknown, it \nis safe to say that man did not exist and he still can't explain it.\n  You can take all the carbon-producing applications, whether it be \noil, coal, or volcanic action, and they still can't get the models to \npredict. So we are leading the blind with the blind.\n  I ask for all Members to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to read an excerpt from Pope Francis' \naddress to us yesterday that really stood out to me: ``I call for a \ncourageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps, and to avert \nthe most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by \nhuman activity. I am convinced that we can make a difference, and I \nhave no doubt that the United States--and this Congress--have an \nimportant role to play.''\n  I take that call by our Pope very seriously. There are even reports \ntoday that China is going to announce a cap-and-trade program.\n  By considering this bill and this amendment, Congress is not playing \na constructive role.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Gosar amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I support the amendment.\n  It is bad enough that agencies already take too much time to conclude \nconstruction permit reviews.\n  It is even worse for them to draw out the process on the basis of \njunk science.\n  And that is precisely what the Obama administration's pronouncements \non the ``social sost of carbon'' appear to be.\n  The Obama administration's current ``social cost of carbon'' estimate \nis plagued by defects including the lack of full scientific peer \nreview, robust public comment, and full compliance with federal \nrequirements for influential scientific assessments.\n  Subsection (K) of the bill prohibits the use of the administration's \n``technical update of the social cost of carbon for regulatory impact \nanalysis under Executive Order No. 12866,'' as well as successors to \nit.\n  The gentleman's amendment makes crystal clear that agencies also may \nnot rely on administration ``guidance'' documents intended to \nfacilitate agencies' use of the prohibited technical document.\n  I urge my colleagues to suport the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in \nHouse Report 114-261.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 31, beginning on line 4, strike ``subsection (p)'' and \n     insert ``subsections (q) and (r)''.\n       Page 31, line 17, insert after ``141).'' the following:\n       ``(r) Exception for Certain Projects.--This subchapter does \n     not apply in the case of any project that could be a \n     potential target for a terrorist attack or that involves \n     chemical facilities and other critical infrastructure.''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, although we have been debating for a \nlong period of time, let me say to my colleagues to remind them--and I \nsee my good friend, Chairman Goodlatte, on the floor--that this \nlegislation amends the National Environmental Policy Act with good \nintentions.\n  However, what this bill will do is actually strip out critical input \nfrom Federal, State, local agencies, and the public, jeopardizing both \nthe environment and public safety--let me repeat that--jeopardizing the \nAmerican people, environment, and public safety.\n  The bill sets new, tight deadlines for environmental review, \npermitting, and licensing decisions and simply, as I said earlier, \nthrows wisdom and good judgment to the wind.\n  I serve as a senior member on the Homeland Security Committee. And so \nI rise today with my amendment that improves the bill and helps to \nprotect the homeland by carving a limiting exception for construction \nprojects that could be potential targets for terrorist acts, such as \nchemical facilities, nuclear power plants, and other critical \ninfrastructure.\n  Let me offer the comments of the Congressional Budget Office. They \nhave no basis for estimating the number of construction projects that \ncould be expedited or the savings that would be realized in this bill.\n  Of course, those who support it use that as their main Rock of \nGibraltar, if you will, their main point of argument that this is a \ngood bill. A good bill in the face of terrorism?\n  Director Comey has indicated that he has determined that there are \nongoing investigations of suspected terrorist cells operating in all 50 \nStates. Yet, we want to expedite this process when it is determining \nissues dealing with our national security to a certain extent.\n  This issue deals with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which \nthe Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit said shall account \nfor the potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its \nenvironmental review process.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Are you going to rush them along?\n  The NRC has also imposed stringent antiterrorism requirements on its \nlicenses through 10 CFR section 73, which outlines security \nrequirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and \nmaterials.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment covers nuclear power plants and, as well, \nchemical facilities to not rush the process to protect the American \npeople.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H6244]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nThis amendment denies the benefit of the bill's permit streamlining \nprovisions to any and all projects that could be terrorist targets or \ninvolve chemical facilities or other critical infrastructure. That \nincludes projects that would help to protect those infrastructures and \nfacilities from terrorist attacks or other adversities.\n  Why would we want to delay permitting decisions on projects that \nwould help to protect us?\n  The bill, moreover, already provides up to 4\\1/2\\ years for agencies \nto complete their environmental reviews for new permit applications and \nreasonable additional time for agencies to wrap up final permit \napprovals or denials after that.\n  As I have said before, if agencies can't wrap up their environmental \nreviews in that much time and then meet the bill's remaining deadlines, \nthere is something terribly wrong with those agencies.\n  Mr. Chairman, new projects, whether they be infrastructure projects \nthat make a dam stronger or make a highway safer or make a nuclear \nfacility less vulnerable to attack, are all important things to do, and \nwe should do them with expedition, not take longer rather than shorter \nto get them done, because all the time that we are spinning our wheels \nwith the permitting process that can take 20 years or more, we are more \nvulnerable during that time.\n  Almost all new infrastructure projects are better than what they are \nreplacing, and that should be our guiding principle. Get these things \ndone expeditiously. It will make us safer. It will make us a better \neconomy. It will create more jobs.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. \nThe gentleman from Virginia has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, quite the contrary to my good friend from Virginia, \nwhat this amendment does is protects the process of the NRC to fully \nreview the potential impacts of terrorism on Federal construction \nprojects involving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities as well.\n  In addition, I think when we hear the names Chernobyl, Fukushima, and \nThree Mile Island, we understand the vast and devastating impact of \nsuch an incident that may be caused or driven by terrorism.\n  I would not want to limit the NRC, which has been given court \nauthority by law to investigate and provide an investigation, thorough \ninvestigation, on the impact on chemical and nuclear plants, and we \nhave it restricted. It takes more than 4 years to build a nuclear \nfacility.\n  So are you suggesting that the facility, then, can go on and be built \nfor 10, 20 years, and we shut off the NEPA that has the \nresponsibilities for the American people? I don't think that is \nappropriate.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me suggest that the American people from the Alaska \nWilderness League, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the \nWestern Environmental Law Center are against this bill.\n  I will place this into the Record.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Executive Office of the President, Council on \nEnvironmental Quality is opposed to this bill, and I will insert this \ninto the Record.\n  I just want to mention that, of course, the President has issued a \nveto threat. Where this bill is going, I do not know. But the main \nthing I would like to say to my colleagues is: Can't we stand together \nunited around the question of national security?\n  My amendment specifically indicates that this issue of terrorism \nshould be a simple carve-out, and I would ask you to do so.\n  Let me also bring in the comments of the Pope as indicated yesterday:\n\n       If politics must truly be at the service of the human \n     person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy \n     and finance. Politics is, instead, an expression of our \n     compelling need to live as one in order to build, as one, the \n     greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices \n     particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, \n     its goods, its interests, and its social life.\n\n  The interest of the American people is to accept the Jackson Lee \namendment--to carve out an exception in this bill that is opposed by \nthe President and all other aspects of goodwill people here dealing \nwith the environment--to deal with this issue.\n  Might I remind you, Mr. Chairman, of the Volkswagen scandal. If a \nmore robust process had been in mind, 11 million owners of \nVolkswagens--and 400,000 in the United States--might be in a better \nplace.\n  This is a good amendment dealing with the safety and security of the \nAmerican people. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee \namendment.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk; it is \nlisted in the Rule as Jackson Lee 9.\n  Many of us wear a number of hats with dual committee assignments; I \nam a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and the Ranking \nMember of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland \nSecurity, and Investigations.\n  This perspective and these responsibilities have given me a special \nappreciation for the difficult and challenging times we live in and the \nimportance of not taking precipitous actions that could put the \nsecurity of our homeland at risk.\n  Mr. Chair, if H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, were to become law \nin its present form, a permit or license for project would be \n``deemed'' approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the \nrequested permit or license within 90-120 days.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment improves the bill and helps to protect the \nhomeland by carving a limited exception for construction projects that \ncould be potential targets for terrorist attacks such as chemical \nfacilities, nuclear power plants, and other critical infrastructure.\n  In particular, I think it is important to note that the FBI Director \nComey recently indicated that there are ongoing investigations of \nsuspected terrorist cells operating in all of the 50 states.\n  All federal agencies are subject to the environmental decision making \nrequirements under NEPA.\n  This includes the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the \nCircuit of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held ``shall account for \nthe potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its \nenvironmental review process.''\n  The NRC has also imposed stringent anti-terrorism requirements on its \nlicenses pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Section 73, which outlines security \nrequirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and \nmaterials.\n  A nuclear power plant is, a chemical facility covered by the Jackson \nLee Amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, we should not limit the ability of the NRC to fully review \nthe potential impacts of terrorism on Federal construction projects \ninvolving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities, as would be the \ncase were H.R. 348 to become law.\n  Worse still, H.R. 348 would automatically deem construction projects \napproved even where the NRC needs more time to complete its review of \nthe environmental risk and/or the potential vulnerability of a critical \ninfrastructure facility to terrorist attack.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment ensures the rushed and dangerous approach \nto the NEPA approval process embodied in H.R. 348 does not adversely \nimpact the security of the homeland from the risk of terrorist attacks \non nuclear facilities or other critical infrastructure construction \nprojects.\n  In short, the Jackson Lee Amendment provided added protection to keep \nAmericans safe.\n  I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amendment.\n                                               September 17, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members \n     and activists, we are writing to urge you to oppose H.R. 348, \n     the misleadingly named ``Responsibly and Professionally \n     Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Instead of improving \n     the permitting process, the bill will severely undermine the \n     National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and, consequently, \n     the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions.\n       The National Environmental Policy Act plays a critical role \n     in ensuring that projects are carried out in a transparent, \n     collaborative, and responsible manner. NEPA simply requires \n     federal agencies to assess the environmental, economic, and \n     public health impacts of proposals, solicit the input of all \n     affected stakeholders, and disclose their findings publicly \n     before undertaking projects that may significantly affect the \n     environment. Critically, NEPA recognizes that the public--\n     which includes industry, citizens, local and state \n     governments, and business owners--can make important \n     contributions by providing unique expertise. NEPA also\n\n[[Page H6245]]\n\n     gives a voice to the most impacted and underrepresented, \n     especially to the most vulnerable communities who usually \n     have to bear the most burden of where federal projects are \n     proposed in the first place. However, H.R. 348 strikes at \n     these core purposes of NEPA by systematically prioritizing \n     speed of decisions and project approval over the public \n     interest.\n       Studies on the causes of delay in the permitting process \n     reveal that the primary cause of delay is not the NEPA \n     process. Rather, as multiple studies by the Government \n     Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service \n     have pointed out, the principal causes of delay in permitting \n     rest outside the NEPA process entirely and are attributable \n     to other factors such as lack of funding, project complexity, \n     and local opposition to the project. The RAPID Act ignores \n     the true causes of delay, and instead, focuses on \n     institutionalizing dangerous ``reforms'' that restrict public \n     input, limit review of the environmental and economic impacts \n     of projects, and that create more, not less, bureaucracy. \n     Provisions in the RAPID Act, such as the following, will \n     create more delays in permitting, result in less flexibility \n     in the process, and tilt the entire permitting process \n     towards shareholder interest, not the public interest. For \n     example, the bill:\n       Places Arbitrary Limitations on Environmental Reviews--\n     Section 560(i) of the bill threatens to undermine NEPA's goal \n     of informed decision-making and the agency's role of acting \n     in the public interest. It sets arbitrary deadlines on \n     environmental reviews of permits, licenses, or other \n     applications--regardless of the possible economic, health, or \n     environmental impacts. Consequently, it puts communities at \n     risk by promoting rushed and faulty decisions.\n       Limits Consideration of Alternatives--Section 560(g) \n     strikes at what CEQ regulations describe as ``the heart of \n     the NEPA process'' by restricting the range of reasonable \n     alternatives to be considered by an agency.\n       Creates Serious Conflicts of Interests--Section 560(c) \n     blurs the distinct roles of private entities and agencies in \n     agency decisions by allowing private project sponsors with \n     stakes in the decision to prepare environmental review \n     documents which creates inherent conflicts of interest and \n     thus jeopardizes the integrity of the decision-making \n     process.\n       Leading to Unanticipated Delays--The bill forces \n     stakeholders into court preemptively simply to preserve their \n     right to judicial review. The bill also limits the public's \n     judicial access to challenge and address faulty environmental \n     reviews which in turn is likely to increase the controversy \n     and the amount of litigation derived from the permitting \n     process which in turn could add to project delays.\n       Denies the Impacts of Climate Change--Section 560(k) of the \n     bill prohibits any considerations of the Social Cost of \n     Carbon (SCC), which the EPA and other federal agencies use to \n     estimate the economic damages associated with specific \n     projects and their related carbon dioxide emissions. The tool \n     is critical for the public to understand the true benefits \n     and costs of a project. Ignoring climate change puts critical \n     infrastructure, tax payer dollars, and local communities at \n     risk.\n       Provisions such as these and many more in the RAPID Act \n     will only serve to increase delay and confusion around the \n     environmental review process. We believe compromising the \n     quality of environmental review and limiting the role of the \n     public is the wrong approach.\n       Far from being broken, the National Environmental Policy \n     Act has proven its worth as an invaluable tool. It ensures \n     that the public, developers, and agencies have a reliable \n     template for consistent and fair proposal assessment for \n     major projects that may impact federal resources. The RAPID \n     Act contradicts and jeopardizes decades of experience gained \n     from enacting this critical environmental law. Further, it \n     tips the balance away from informed decisions and public \n     oversight, jeopardizing the public's ability to participate \n     in how public resources will be managed. Please oppose this \n     unnecessary and overreaching piece of legislation and vote \n     ``no'' on the RAPID Act.\n         Alaska Wilderness League, American Rivers, Center for \n           Biological Diversity, Citizens for Global Solution, \n           Clean Air Task Force, Clean Air Council, Clean Water \n           Action, Conservation Colorado, Conservatives for \n           Responsible Stewardship, Defenders of Wildlife, \n           Earthjustice, EDF Action, Environmental Law and Policy \n           Center, Epic--Environmental Protection Information \n           Center, Energy Action Coalition, Friends of the Earth, \n           Gulf Coast Center for Law & Policy, Green Latinos, \n           Kentucky Heartwood, Klamath Forest Alliance, Klamath \n           Siskiyou Wildlands Center, League of Conservation \n           Voters, Los Padres ForestWatch, Marine Conservation \n           Institute, Montana Environmental Information Center, \n           National Parks Conservation Association, Natural \n           Resources Defense Council, New Energy Economy, New \n           Jersey Sierra Club, Oceana, Ocean Conservation \n           Research, Public Citizen, Rachel Carson Council, Safe \n           Climate Campaign, Sierra Club, Southern Environmental \n           Law Center, Southern Oregon Climate Action Now, \n           SustainUS, Union of Concerned Scientists, Western \n           Environmental Law Center, The Wilderness Society.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President Council on \n           Environmental Quality,\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2015.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman,\n     House Committee on the Judiciary.\n     Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member,\n     House Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: I am \n     writing to you to provide the Council on Environmental \n     Quality's (CEQ) views on H.R. 348, the ``Responsibly and \n     Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' \n     Although the bill purports to streamline environmental \n     reviews, we believe the legislation is deeply flawed and will \n     undermine the environmental review process. If enacted, these \n     changes could lead to more confusion and delay, interfere \n     with public participation and transparency, and hamper \n     economic growth.\n       The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed \n     into law by President Richard Nixon after passing Congress \n     with overwhelming bipartisan support. NEPA ushered in a new \n     era of citizen participation in government, and it required \n     the government to elevate the consideration of the \n     environmental effects of its proposed actions. It remains one \n     of the cornerstones of our Nation's modern environmental \n     protections.\n       NEPA is as relevant and critical today as it was in 1970. \n     NEPA focuses and informs decision makers, policy makers, and \n     the public on alternatives and the tradeoffs involved in \n     making decisions. Today, we take for granted that \n     governmental decision making should be open and transparent, \n     that government actions should be carefully thought out and \n     their consequences explained, and that government should be \n     accountable. Prior to the enactment of NEPA, this was not \n     always the case. H.R. 348 would undo more than four decades \n     of transparent, open, and accountable government decision \n     making.\n       The Administration believes that America's economic health \n     and prosperity are tied to the productive and sustainable use \n     of our environment, and the President has stressed these \n     principles since his first day in office. NEPA remains a \n     vital tool for the Nation as we work to protect our \n     environment and public health and continue to grow our \n     economy.\n       The President also takes seriously the need for efficient \n     permitting and decision making by Federal agencies. American \n     taxpayers, communities and businesses deserve nothing less. \n     However, we reject the notion that NEPA and other Federal \n     environmental laws and regulations hinder job creation.\n       For example, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has \n     found that 96.5 percent of federally funded highway projects \n     are approved under the least intensive, shortest and quickest \n     layer of NEPA analysis, namely categorical exclusions (CEs). \n     CEs can take as little as a few days to a few months to \n     complete, not years, and are usually done concurrently with \n     other aspects of the project review process so that the \n     entire review process is completed quickly. Only 0.3 percent \n     of FHWA projects require a full environmental impact \n     statement (EIS), the most detailed study under NEPA. When \n     there are project delays, they are typically caused by \n     incomplete funding packages, project complexity, changes in \n     project scope, local opposition, and low local priority, or \n     compliance with other laws and requirements facilitated by \n     the NEPA process, but rarely NEPA itself. An investigation by \n     the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the NEPA process \n     in federally funded highway projects bore this same point \n     out.\n       Within the Administration, we have prioritized improving \n     the environmental review process and continue to make \n     advancements in this space that will improve interagency \n     coordination and synchronization of reviews to increase \n     decision-making speed; improve project siting and project \n     quality; expand innovative mitigation approaches; and drive \n     accountability and transparency through the expanded use of \n     an online permitting dashboard. For example, under Executive \n     Order 13604, the interagency infrastructure permitting \n     steering committee established the permitting dashboard, \n     which makes project schedules transparent to the public and \n     is designed to improve the timeliness and environmental \n     outcomes of the permitting process. This was followed by a \n     Presidential Memorandum to Federal Agencies on May 17, 2013 \n     to modernize Federal infrastructure review, permitting \n     regulations, policies and procedures to significantly reduce \n     the time it takes to permit infrastructure projects. In \n     addition, CEQ has taken several steps to improve and make \n     more efficient Federal agency decision making.\n       This year, the Administration released an updated ``how-\n     to'' handbook (also known as the Red Book), Synchronizing \n     Environmental Reviews for Transportation and other \n     Infrastructure Projects, to improve and modernize NEPA and \n     other types of reviews, such as those required under the \n     Endangered Species Act (ESA), the National Historic \n     Preservation Act (NHPA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \n     (MSA), and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), by \n     providing information to facilitate more widespread adoption \n     of concurrent reviews. More synchronized reviews by Federal \n     permitting agencies will lead to more effective and efficient \n     environmental reviews and projects with reduced impacts to\n\n[[Page H6246]]\n\n     the environment as well as savings of time and money.\n       CEQ also initiated a NEPA Pilot Program in March 2011 to \n     solicit ideas from Federal agencies and the public about \n     innovative time- and cost-saving approaches to NEPA \n     implementation. Under this process, CEQ is working to \n     identify additional innovative approaches that reduce the \n     time and costs required for effective implementation of its \n     NEPA regulations.\n       H.R. 348 would make a number of considerable changes to \n     Federal agency regulatory review, permitting, and \n     environmental analysis that undercut the core principles \n     embodied in NEPA, including reasoned decision-making and \n     public involvement. The legislation seeks to implement these \n     changes to Federal agency decision making under the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The passage of this \n     legislation will lead to two sets of standards by which \n     Federal agencies would be expected to comply, one for \n     ``construction projects'' under the APA and one for all other \n     Federal actions, such as rulemaking or planning, under NEPA. \n     This would lead to confusion, delay, and inefficiency.\n       Moreover, the legislation would direct agencies, upon the \n     request of a project sponsor, to adopt State documents if the \n     State laws and procedures provide environmental protection \n     and opportunities for public involvement ``that are \n     substantially equivalent to NEPA.'' In our view, it is \n     difficult to determine whether a State statute is \n     substantially equivalent to NEPA and the legislation contains \n     no requirement for agencies to determine if the State \n     documents are adequate for NEPA purposes. More importantly, \n     the State document may have looked at a different purpose and \n     need for the project, a different set of alternatives than \n     the Federal agency would have looked at, and relied on \n     different standards for analysis. The State, for example, may \n     not have looked at the same factors that Federal agencies are \n     required to consider, such as environmental justice and \n     wetlands protection. Finally, no two State processes are \n     alike, compounding confusion for projects that cross State \n     lines. Thus, a Federal agency's reliance on State documents \n     may lead to inconsistencies between Federal projects and \n     agencies, different environmental goals and protections, \n     confusion among the public, and unclear results for \n     businesses and project applicants.\n       The legislation also establishes arbitrary deadlines for \n     the completion of NEPA analyses. Factors such as feasibility \n     and engineering studies, non-Federal funding, conflicting \n     priorities, local opposition, or applicant responsiveness are \n     just a few examples of delays outside of the control of an \n     agency. Arbitrary deadlines and provisions that automatically \n     approve a project if the agency is unable to make a decision \n     due to one of the factors described above will lead to \n     increased litigation, more delays, and denied projects as \n     agencies will have no choice but to deny a project if the \n     review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed \n     deadlines.\n       These comments illustrate a few of the many concerns we \n     have with the legislation. The Administration would be happy \n     to provide the Committee with a more thorough and exhaustive \n     list of our substantive concerns with the legislation at the \n     request of the Committee.\n       In closing, when properly implemented, NEPA improves \n     collaboration, consensus, accountability, and transparency \n     surrounding government decision-making and actions. Our \n     Nation's long-term prosperity depends upon our faithful \n     stewardship of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and \n     the land that supports and sustains us. Our country has been \n     strengthened by the open, accountable, informed, and citizen-\n     involved decision-making structure created by NEPA, and our \n     economy has prospered.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Christy Goldfuss,\n\n                                                Managing Director,\n                                 Council on Environmental Quality.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nsay to my colleague from Texas that this bill is about national \nsecurity.\n  The gentlewoman is right. We can all agree on the importance of \nnational security and protecting our security, but making sure that \nwhen projects are planned they are implemented within a reasonable \nperiod of time. And we are talking about years--not days or weeks or \neven months--years for a permitting, years for examination to make sure \nthat these are done carefully, but not decades, as happens now with a \nnumber of different projects that have been discussed over the last 2 \ndays that, in their current state, without the kinds of repairs, \nwithout the kinds of increased improvements, without the kinds of \nadditional safety and security protections that new projects bring \nonline, we are more vulnerable, not less. I fear that the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas' amendment would do just that.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank my good friend for yielding to me.\n  Maybe we can work together on this amendment because it is a simple \ncarve-out. It should be narrow. It clarifies that the bill's provision \ndoes not apply to environmental reviews or permitting on other \nagencies' decisions that could deal with potential terrorist attack \ntargets, such as chemical facilities and other critical infrastructure. \nI don't think that that is something that the gentleman and myself \nwould disagree with and, particularly, the nuclear plants, which take a \nlonger period of time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Reclaiming my time, I would say to the gentlewoman \nthat the bill allows lots of time for each stage of the permitting \nprocess to cover and discover ways to make a project more secure, to \nmake it safer, to improve it in a variety of different ways; and that \nthe gentlewoman's amendment would harm the ability to do that, not \nhelp, because it would slow down the process under which we would have \nthese new projects able to begin construction and then be completed.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in \nHouse Report 114-261.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add, at the end of the bill, the following:\n\n       (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the \n     amendments made by this Act shall have the effect of changing \n     or limiting any law or regulation that requires or provides \n     for public comment or public participation in an agency \n     decision making process.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment \nis simple. It protects the right of the public to comment.\n  This amendment reads: ``Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by \nthis Act shall have the effect of changing or limiting any law or \nregulation that requires or provides for public comment or public \nparticipation in an agency decision making process.''\n  Now, yesterday, Mr. Chairman, the Pope, right here in this very room, \ncalled on each of us to pursue a common good, which he told us requires \na courageous and responsible effort. And certainly, if we are going to \nprotect the common good, it requires that we protect the right of the \npublic to comment on projects that have an adverse impact on our \nprecious environment, right there where they live.\n  This amendment would restore the right of any member of the public to \ncomment on construction projects that may have an environmental impact; \nand because of that, I don't expect any opposition to this amendment, \nMr. Chairman.\n  Like a number of well-respected environmental groups, I oppose H.R. \n348, the so-called RAPID Act, which threatens public health and safety \nby putting a thumb on the scales of justice in favor of private sector \nbusinesses in the project approval process.\n  It is yet another antiregulatory measure whose only design is to \ngrease the wheels of the approval process of projects that are \nenvironmentally sensitive.\n  Aside from creating duplicative and costly requirements that pertain \nto certain types of projects, the RAPID Act would also limit the right \nof the public to comment on these projects.\n  This bill does that in two ways: first, by reducing opportunities for \npublic input, and secondly, by fast-tracking\n\n[[Page H6247]]\n\nthe approval process through arbitrary deadlines.\n  Through an open, flexible, and timely process, NEPA empowers the \npublic to weigh in on decisions. That means that the local farmer who \nowns land that would be affected by a Federal construction project--\nlet's say a nasty pipeline like Keystone--it ensures that that local \nfarmer would have the ability and would stand on local footing with the \nconstruction industry and with the Federal Government.\n  My amendment is vital to ensuring that the RAPID Act does not shut \nthe public out of the process. I am sure that all minds agree that that \nis reasonable. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to this \namendment.\n  I do share, however, the interest of the gentleman from Georgia in \npromoting the common good, as mentioned by Pope Francis when he spoke \nin this Chamber yesterday. But the common good is people coming \ntogether to improve their lives by creating improved infrastructure for \ntransportation, whether that is highways or mass transit, for \ndelivering energy resources to places where that energy needs to be \ndelivered, to improving the shipping lanes so that goods can be shipped \nto and from this country and within this country in ways that make it \neasier for consumers to receive the energy, the products, the \ntransportation that they need and deserve.\n  The RAPID Act will create jobs by ensuring that the Federal \nenvironmental review and permitting process works like it should. It \nwill also make sure that these infrastructure projects that deliver the \ncommon good will do so in a reasonable period of time, so people won't \nhave to wait 20 years, like we heard yesterday from the gentleman from \nTexas, about simply lowering the draft, the 8 feet lower, for ships to \nget up the waterway in east Texas to deliver goods and pick up goods \nfrom ports in that part of the country. Why 20 years to make a decision \nabout dredging 8 feet from a waterway?\n  The RAPID Act is drafted to make agencies operate efficiently and \ntransparently. That is not happening in so many, many instances. But, \nit does not prevent citizens from participating in that process. In \nfact, the bill makes sure that agencies provide the public with \nreasonable public comment periods. It authorizes up to 60 days of \npublic comment on Environmental Impact Statements, up to 30 days of \ncomments on environmental assessments and other documents, and grants \nthe lead agency authority to negotiate extensions or provide them on \nits own ``for good cause.''\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  This is more than fair. By comparison, the National Environmental \nPolicy Act, which has been cited many times on the other side of the \naisle, only requires agencies to allow 45 days for public comment--not \nthe 60 days provided in the RAPID Act--on draft environmental impact \nstatements and 30 days for public comments on final environmental \nimpact statements.\n  The RAPID Act also reasonably requires that a person comment on an \nenvironmental document before challenging it in court and bring any \nsuit within 6 months as opposed to 6 years. Opponents should not be \nable to delay a project indefinitely by playing ``hide the ball'' with \nagencies or by resting on their rights.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I would like to respond. First, in the narrowed circumstances in \nwhich an agency may supplement an environmental impact statement under \nthe bill, the lead agency ``may'' solicit comments from agencies and \nthe public for not more than 30 days beginning on the date of the \npublication of the supplement.\n  CEQ regulations require an agency to provide for a 45-day public \nreview and comment period, although there is also a provision in the \nCEQ regulations that allows CEQ to approve alternative procedures for \nsupplemental EISs if circumstances warrant a deviation from the normal \nprocess.\n  Secondly, under the bill, each participating agency is to limit its \ncomments on a project to areas within the authority and expertise of \nthe agency and identify statutory authority for their comments.\n  It specifically prohibits the lead agency from acting upon, \nresponding to or including any document that is ``outside of the \nauthority and expertise of the commenting participating agency.''\n  This is inconsistent with the CEQ regulations, which allow all \nagencies--whether local, tribal, State, or Federal--to comment on any \nsubstantive issue relative to the NEPA analysis, just as all members of \nthe public should be able to do.\n  So, finally, I would just point out that, if we are talking about \nefficiency and if we are talking about the common good, it does the \npublic no good to cut out public comment from this process. If we can \nagree on that, then we can agree that this amendment is a good one. \nWith that, I ask for its approval.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will be postponed.\n  The Committee will rise informally.\n  The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas) assumed the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6247-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed with an amendment in which the concurrence \nof the House is requested, a bill of the House of the following title:\n\n       H.R. 1020.

Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. KUSTER. I am opposed in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Kuster moves to recommit the bill H.R. 348 to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       Page 31, line 17, insert after ``112-141).'' the following:\n       ``(r) Protecting Local Communities, Private Property Rights \n     and Tribal Sovereignty.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this section, the provisions of this section shall not apply \n     in the case of a project described in paragraph (2), or an \n     environmental document pertaining to such a project.\n       ``(2) Project described.--A project described in this \n     paragraph is any project that--\n       ``(A) affects the safe drinking water supply or air quality \n     of local communities that are located near the project;\n       ``(B) involves condemnation or infringing the private \n     property rights of American citizens; or\n       ``(C) affects the health, safety, or sovereignty of Native \n     American tribes.\n       ``(s) Making It in America and Providing Jobs for \n     Unemployed Workers.--Any environmental document approved \n     pursuant to this act shall assess whether a construction \n     project--\n       ``(1) will utilize equipment and materials manufactured in \n     the United States; and\n       ``(2) will result in the hiring of unemployed workers, \n     including veterans, who are actively seeking work and for \n     whom unemployment taxes were paid during prior employment.''.\n\n  Ms. KUSTER (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Hampshire?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New Hampshire is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can all agree on the need to ensure that construction \nprojects are completed in a timely and effective manner without the \nneed for unnecessary review or red tape.\n  No one can argue that our current permitting system is perfect. But \nthe bill before us today is yet another misguided Republican attempt to \nundermine critical environmental protections that we all rely on.\n  This legislation will splinter and unnecessarily accelerate the \npermitting process in a way that impairs the ability of agencies to \neffectively evaluate the impacts of a given project.\n  Consequently, the bill will weaken the ability of our constituents to \nunderstand the impacts of proposed projects and effectively limit their \nvoice in the permitting process.\n  This is particularly true for low-income and minority communities \nthat too often are faced with a disproportionate share of pollution and \nenvironmental contaminants.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, we are intimately familiar with \nthe need for strong public input in permitting processes.\n  As the permitting moves forward on different energy infrastructure \nprojects, I have been working aggressively to ensure that the views of \nmy constituents are heard.\n  I am concerned that the permitting process under this legislation \nwill make it more difficult for effective environmental review to move \nforward in New Hampshire.\n  That is why I am offering my amendment today to help provide some \nadditional protections to safeguard human health, the environment, and \nproperty rights.\n  Specifically, this amendment would exempt from the requirements in \nthe bill any project that would negatively affect the drinking water \nsupply or air quality of nearby communities.\n  It also ensures that construction projects covered under the \nlegislation cannot violate the sovereignty of Native American tribes.\n  These provisions would at least ensure that we are limiting the most \ndangerous consequences of this legislation.\n  Additionally, the amendment requires that any environmental documents \nproduced pursuant to the legislation include information about whether \na project will use equipment and materials manufactured in the United \nStates and whether it will create jobs for U.S. workers, including our \nveterans.\n  Like so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have been \nintently focused on what we can do to grow and expand U.S. \nmanufacturing jobs and create good-paying middle-class jobs right here \nin America and, in particular, as a member of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, how we can serve our veterans.\n  The reporting requirement in this amendment will help generate \ngreater awareness for how we utilize American-made machinery and \nproducts in our construction processes.\n  I urge support for my amendment to make sure that this bill does not \nharm the health of our constituents and to take an important step \ntoward job creation and hiring of veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I rise in opposition to the motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, after President Obama's ill-conceived \nstimulus bill failed, he blamed its failure on the lack of shovel-ready \nconstruction projects. President Obama was even quoted in the press to \nhave joked about it. ``Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we \nexpected,'' he said.\n  Hard-working Americans desperate for jobs didn't think that was \nfunny. They still don't. They are watching us right now, wanting to \nknow if we can deliver meaningful reform that will create jobs. Let's \nsend a message to them today that we can and we will.\n  For years now the President's Jobs Council's recommendation that we \nstreamline the Federal permitting process has been staring the \nPresident in the face.\n  Just last term President Obama stood in this House and promised \naction to ``slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process . . \n. so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as \npossible.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the RAPID Act is precisely the legislation to do that. \nIt is exactly what our private and public sector leaders have called \nfor. It is what millions of American workers yearning for new work and \nhigher wages need.\n  True to form, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsupport this motion to recommit in an attempt to stop this legislation. \nThey can't yet bring themselves to say, ``Yes, we can'' to the cutting \nof bureaucratic red tape and obstruction.\n  But this motion to recommit is the exact mirror image of everything \nthat is wrong with the Federal permitting process and keeps jobs from \nthe American people.\n  It is nothing but a fabricated argument, a procedural device, a tried \nand true tactic of delay--an excuse for Members of Congress to duck a \nvote and not make a needed decision that will bring millions of good, \nhigh-paying jobs to the people of this country.\n  The bill does not require a project to be approved, only that an \nagency timely decide whether or not to approve it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion and vote for the \nRAPID Act.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, all of us today are stunned by the dramatic and \ncourageous decision of the Speaker of the\n\n[[Page H6255]]\n\nHouse, John Boehner, to retire at the end of October.\n  We thank him for his tireless work, his conservative leadership of \nthe Republican Conference for 9 years, his distinguished service as \nSpeaker of the House for nearly 5 years, and for his long service to \nthe people of this great country.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-\nminute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5-minute \nvote on the passage of the bill, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 175, \nnoes 229, not voting 30, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 517]\n\n                               AYES--175\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as \nNational Suicide Prevention Month. This month is especially important \nto think about what needs to be done to help our at-risk veterans.\n  From 1990 to 2010, a veteran committed suicide almost every hour of \nevery day. This is completely unacceptable and signifies a clear need \nfor action to prevent suicide and to treat those who are suffering.\n  Veterans have risked their lives and sacrificed tremendously for our \nNation. But the disturbing reality is that far too many of our veterans \nwho fought for our freedom are not free when they return. They are \ntrapped in their own minds.\n  We cannot afford to be bystanders any longer. Mr. Speaker, it is past \ntime we stand by our veterans and everyone else who is suffering. It is \nincumbent upon all of us to reach out to those who may need help and \nerase the stigma surrounding mental illness.\n  Together, with an increased focus on the very real, invisible wounds \nof war, we can better serve our returning heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6256-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6256-H6257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING BILL LOCKYER\n\n  (Mr. SWALWELL of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Bill \nLockyer of Hayward, California, who, tomorrow, will have part of the \nSan Francisco Bay Trail named for him.\n  Bill, who went to college and started his political career in the \nEast Bay, is a dedicated public official who spent many years working \nfor the people of California. This includes service in the State \nlegislature as State attorney general and as State treasurer.\n  Among his many successes was his work to protect our environment, a \nhighlight of which is championing the San Francisco Bay Trail. He came \nup with the idea for the trail, introduced the legislation, and got \nsupport from both Republicans and Democrats.\n  It has been 28 years since Bill's idea became law and, thanks to his \nefforts, we have 340 miles of trail around the bay. It provides \nopportunities for recreation, education, and transportation for area \nresidents every day.\n  When finished, 500 miles of trails will surround and connect people \naround the San Francisco Bay area. It is a wonderful gift to future \ngenerations.\n  At a ceremony tomorrow, a portion of the trail will be named for \nBill. This is a fitting tribute to a tremendous public servant and one \nwithout whom we wouldn't have had this tremendous trail.\n  Congratulations, Bill, on this well-deserved honor.\n\n[[Page H6257]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6257-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   CENTRE COUNTY YOUTH SERVICE BUREAU\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I was \nproud to announce grant funding for the Centre County Youth Services \nBureau, an organization in my district which operates an emergency \nshelter, assisting youth, ages 12-17, who are homeless, runaways, or at \nrisk for either of these conditions due to difficult circumstances at \nhome. This grant funding allowed the shelter to continue to operate 24 \nhours a day, providing a safe haven for these young men and women.\n  The shelter is just one of my initiatives that the Centre County \nYouth Services Bureau is responsible for. The organization, which was \nfounded in 1968, also is involved in a variety of community-based, \nfamily-based, and residential programs intended to improve the lives of \nfamilies across Centre County and the surrounding area.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend the Youth Services Bureau and all the staff in \ntaking the initiative to apply for this grant funding, and I know that \nthey are going to be able to see the results of this award for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6257-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SAVE UKRAINE NOW\n\n  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. KAPTUR.

Abdul Shalabi, a \nbodyguard for Osama bin Laden, is now a free man thanks to our \ngovernment.\n  But this isn't the first time known terrorists have been freed. There \nis the notorious Taliban Five; and at least one of these terrorist \nprisoners has allegedly started communicating with his old terrorist \nbuddies in the Middle East.

Isn't that lovely.\n  The administration has its priorities backwards.

Mr. Speaker, having access to sound financial advice can \nmake a big difference in the lives of Americans.

Unfortunately, those that will be most harmed from this rule \nwill be families of modest means.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have worked on this issue for years, and I continue to \nhear from Minnesotans sounding the alarm for what this will mean for \nthose who are planning for their future.\n  I urge the Department of Labor to reconsider this rule or to delay it \nuntil we can find a more commonsense alternative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6257-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      YAKIMA UNION GOSPEL MISSION\n\n  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE.

In 2014 alone, the Union Gospel Mission \nhelped over 1,200 of its 1,400 clients find work and permanent housing.\n  Additionally, the Union Gospel Mission operates the Madison House \nYouth Center, providing year-round tutoring, college preparation, \nmeals, and activities for high-risk, inner-city youth.\n  Please join me in thanking the Yakima Union Gospel Mission for its \nunrelenting commitment to serving our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/house-section/article/H6257-7", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6257-H6258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  (Mr. HARDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HARDY.

Many things have happened this week, and more \nwill come in terms of further explanations about our leadership and \nabout our direction, but one thing we know that occurred is a mighty \nstatement of balanced injustice. I will paraphrase the words of Pope \nFrancis, when he said to us that politics requires more than \ndivisiveness; and he said ``the greatest common good: that of a \ncommunity which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in \njustice and peace, its goods, its interests, its social life''--an \ninstruction on the goodness of our Members, no matter what their party.\n  So in these next couple of weeks, I would ask that we look \ncollectively together about working to pass a budget that is fair and \njust and that helps the needy: comprehensive immigration reform, \nhelping the homeless, and helping veterans who have suffered, Mr. \nSpeaker, some hundreds of thousands who died waiting for hospital \nservices.\n  I think we can do better.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, after 41 years in uniform, General \nMartin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \nhighest-ranking military officer in the land, retires today.\n  More than once this year, we on the Armed Services Committee have \nexpressed our gratitude for his service and bid General Dempsey \nfarewell as he testified before our committee for what we expected \nwould be his final hearing; but, time and time again, world events \nbrought him back to us.\n  That underscores what a consequential job General Dempsey has had. \nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the senior military \nadviser to both the legislative and executive branches of government. I \nam personally very grateful for his willingness to spend time, formally \nand informally, with members of our committee discussing our country's \nsecurity, providing his best military advice on an unprecedented \nspectrum of serious and diverse threats during an era of declining \nresources and when Congress and the President have very different views \non national security policy. All of that has been a tremendous \nchallenge.\n  In his four decades of dedicated service, General Dempsey has led our \nforces against threats far different from those we faced when he left \nhis native New Jersey to become a West Point cadet. Instead of Soviets \nin the Fulda Gap, General Dempsey has had to confront a newly \naggressive Russia, an expanding China, Iranian-backed instability in \nthe Middle East, as well as ISIS and al Qaeda.\n  And those are just some of the threats we can see. General Dempsey \nhas also had to face increasing cyber attacks on our military and our \ncountry, the threat posed by diseases like Ebola in an increasingly \nmobile world, and a tremendous amount of change within the military, \nitself.\n  In honoring him and his service, we also honor, through him, those \nwho have served under him. To meet the challenges that the United \nStates faces around the world and to meet our sacred obligations to our \nservicemembers and their families requires a commitment to service and \nsacrifice that separates America from the rest of the world and \nseparates those who serve in the military from much of our own \npopulation. It takes something special.\n  For having that ``something special'' and for serving our Nation with \nhonor and distinction for 41 years, I know I speak for my colleagues in \nthanking General Martin Dempsey and his wife, Deanie, for their service \nto our country as they move into the next phase of their life together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will now extend my remarks with further discussion of \nthe career of General Martin Dempsey.\n  General Dempsey's career has been a lesson in dedication to country \nand selfless service.\n  A career armor officer, he has commanded at every level--from Platoon \nLeader to Combatant Commander--and his assignments have carried him and \nhis family across the United States and around the world.\n  As a company grade officer, he served with the 2nd Cavalry in Europe \nand the 10th Cavalry at Fort Carson. Following troop command, he earned \nhis Masters of Arts in English from Duke University and was assigned to \nthe English Department at West Point. He subsequently earned additional \nadvanced degrees from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College \nand the National War College.\n  In 1991, General Dempsey deployed with the Third Armored Division in \nsupport of Operation Desert Storm. He later commanded a battalion in \nGermany and then served as the Army's ``senior scout'' as the 67th \nColonel of the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment--the Brave Rifles--before \nreporting to the Joint Staff as an assistant deputy director in the J-5 \nand later as a Special Assistant to the 14th Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff.\n  In 2003, General Dempsey commanded the 1st Armored Division in \nBaghdad and returned to Iraq in 2005 as the Commanding General of the \nMulti-National Security Transition Command--Iraq. From 2007 to 2008, he \nwas the Deputy Commander and then Acting Commander of U.S. Central \nCommand, and from 2008 to 2011, he commanded U.S. Army Training and \nDoctrine Command.\n  Appointed to serve as the Army's 37th Chief of Staff, General Dempsey \nled his beloved Army a short 149 days before being tapped to serve as \nthe 18th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In that capacity, and \nas the Nation's highest-ranking military officer, he has served as the \nprincipal military advisor to the President, the Secretary of Defense, \nthe National Security Council, and Congress.\n  General Dempsey's job has required him to coordinate and build \nconsensus among the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint \nStaff, the Services, and the Combatant Commands. He has also developed \nimportant relationships with military leaders in other nations.\n  He has guided the Joint Force in executing an extraordinary range of \nglobal responsibilities, from counter-terrorism and crisis response, to \nsupporting our allies, building partner capacity, and humanitarian \nassistance. His efforts to strengthen key alliances, bolster new \npartnerships, and more closely integrate the military with other tools \nof national power and influence are commendable.\n  General Dempsey's tenure as Chairman has been marked by significant \ntransitions in military operations and personnel in an increasingly \ndynamic and unpredictable security environment.\n  A firm believer in constantly learning and growing, General Dempsey \nguided the Joint Force to study, learn, and incorporate lessons learned \nover the past 14 years. In addition, recognizing the shifting nature of \nthe security environment and our ability to respond to it, General \nDempsey led a paradigm shift in how we posture and employ this Joint \nteam around the world.\n  At the same time, the past few years have witnessed exponential \ngrowth of the cyber threat against our Nation, and General Dempsey has \npushed the expansion of our cyber capabilities in response. He has \nchampioned the rapid development of our cyber forces, and implemented \nthe Joint Information Environment to optimize and better defend our \nmilitary's information technology infrastructure. These initiatives \nwill be critical to the future security of our Nation.\n  As principle steward of the military profession, he renewed an \ninternal commitment to\n\n[[Page H6259]]\n\nstrengthen the Profession of Arms and reinvigorated education, \ntraining, and leader development. He managed historic decisions, \nincluding reforms to General and Flag Officer ethics, and Department-\nwide improvements in Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. His \nstewardship set conditions to preserve the strength of the all-\nvolunteer force and to ensure service members departing the military \nsuccessfully transition back into their communities.\n  As he retires, General Dempsey should take great pride in his role in \nensuring our military remains the best supported, best trained, best \nequipped, and best led force on the planet.\n  With over four decades of dedicated service to our Nation, General \nDempsey and his family deserve our most heartfelt gratitude and \nadmiration. He and Deanie have our very best wishes for the next phase \nand the challenges and opportunities it will inevitably bring.
