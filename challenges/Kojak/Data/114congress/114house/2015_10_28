BOEHNER, THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the Speaker of the \nHouse, John Boehner.\n  Speaker Boehner and I, as some would note, do not always agree. We \nhave been on opposite sides of this floor and on opposite sides of \ndebate many times. However, that is behind us for John Boehner.\n  In all of the years I have served with him, Speaker Boehner has shown \nme the same kindness, grace, and friendship that he has shown so many \nof his House colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  John Boehner is a gentleman in the truest sense of the word and is a \nleader who, even in the act of stepping back from his position in the \nleadership, has always put the best interests of our country first.\n  When it came time to make difficult decisions, even in the face of \nstrong opposition from some in his own party, Speaker Boehner was \nwilling to work across the aisle to make sure that this House was \nachieving its most fundamental responsibilities to those we had the \nhonor of serving.\n  We did not have a catastrophic default on our debt--at least twice--\nin large part because of John Boehner's determination not to let it \nhappen. Millions of children benefitted from the forms of No Child Left \nBehind because John Boehner, the chairman of the committee, put \nchildren's interests first and worked in partnership with the late \nSenator Ted Kennedy and Congressman George Miller.\n  That was in the best traditions of a President Bush-sponsored piece \nof legislation--a Republican chairman, a Democratic chairman, and a \nranking Democrat working together on behalf of our country's interest.\n  John Boehner worked to keep his Conference and this House marching \nforward down a productive path. History will be the judge of his \nsuccess as the leader of his party, but all of us who have had the \nhonor of serving with him will judge him as we know him--a considerate \nand thoughtful individual, who is a patriot and who cares deeply about \nthis House and the Nation it serves.\n  I want to thank him, as I would hope all of our Members would and, \nfrankly, those Members who served with him, but who are not in this \nHouse now, for his service and for his friendship.\n  I want to wish him well and wish him luck out there on the golf \ncourse, where I am sure he will be spending a lot more time--I am going \nto be envious of that--in addition to the time that he will spend with \nhis family and in continuing to serve his community, his State, and his \nNation.\n  John Boehner served his country and this House of Representatives \nwith fidelity and responsibility, and we should all thank him for that.\n  We wish the Speaker and his wife, Debbie, well as they embark on a \nnew phase of their lives. He has served his country well. I am \nconfident that he will continue to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7257-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7257-H7258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DEBT CEILING BILL FINANCIALLY IRRESPONSIBLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, Benjamin Franklin advised: ``When \nyou run in debt, you give to another power over your liberty.''\n  Washington is in the middle of an epic battle between elected \nofficials who, on the one hand, are financially responsible, have the \nunderstanding and backbone needed to prevent an American bankruptcy, \nheed the wisdom of Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, and fight out-of-\ncontrol debt that threatens our liberty, and you have those elected \nofficials who, on the other hand, are financially irresponsible and are \ntoo weak to resist spending money America does not have, has to borrow \nto get, and can't afford to pay back.\n  This week Congress faces yet another last-second debt deal, \nnegotiated in secret, sprung at the last moment, that fails the \nAmerican people by not fixing the cause of the debt ceiling problem: \nout of control deficits.\n  Earlier this year America's Comptroller General and the nonpartisan\n\n[[Page H7258]]\n\nCongressional Budget Office warned Congress and President Obama that \nAmerica's current financial path is ``unsustainable,'' meaning that \nAmerica faces a debilitating insolvency and bankruptcy unless we get \nour financial house in order.\n  The CBO issued two other dire warnings:\n  First, America's debt service costs will increase by, roughly, $600 \nbillion in 10 years. For perspective, $600 billion is more than what \nAmerica spends on national defense, which begs the question: Where will \nthe money for that additional $600 billion debt payment come from?\n  Second, the CBO warns that, by 2025, America will face an unending \nstring of annual trillion-dollar deficits, deficits that can only end \nin a debilitating American insolvency and bankruptcy.\n  Mr. Speaker, economic principles don't care if you are a family, a \nbusiness, or a country. If you borrow more money than you can pay back, \nyou go bankrupt.\n  There are good and bad ways to raise the debt ceiling. Today's debt \nbill is bad because it not only fails to restrain America's spending \naddiction, it makes things worse by increasing spending by $80 billion.\n  I have been in Congress since 2011, when America's debt blew through \nthe $14 trillion mark. Now America's debt is $18 trillion. This debt \ndeal blows America's debt through the $19 trillion mark, meaning \nAmerica's bank account will soon be $5 trillion weaker than it was in \n2011.\n  Rather than fixing America's deficit problem while we still have the \nfinancial ability to do so, this debt deal kicks the can down the road \nto 2017, when America will be financially weaker and less able to rise \nto the financial challenge that threatens us.\n  Mr. Speaker, today's debt bill is akin to a sick patient going to the \nemergency room and getting pain-killing drugs that make the patient \nfeel better, yet does nothing to cure the disease that kills him. In \nthe real world, that is medical malpractice. Similarly, today's debt \nbill that makes America feel good, but does nothing to cure our debt \ndisease, is governing malpractice.\n  President George Washington advised Congress: ``No pecuniary \nconsideration is more urgent than the regular redemption and discharge \nof the public debt. On none can delay be more injurious.''\n  George Washington's advice in 1793 is prudent today. Congress and \nPresident Obama must balance the budget before America's debt burden \nspirals out of control, before it is too late to prevent the \ndebilitating insolvency and bankruptcy that awaits us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I exhort Washington to rise to the challenge and be \nfinancially responsible when raising the debt ceiling. The first step \nis to defeat this debt bill that not only fails to fix a time-critical \nproblem, but that actually makes America's spending addiction $80 \nbillion worse. America's future as a great Nation and a world power \ndepends on it.\n  I will vote against this debt deal. I urge my colleagues to be \nfinancially responsible--do the same--and insist that the debt ceiling \nbe raised only if we simultaneously fix America's addiction to deficit \nspending. Today's debt ceiling bill fails that benchmark. It threatens \nAmerica. It should be defeated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7258-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we are in the process of wrapping up a \nbudget agreement that is welcome since it protects against default on \nthe national debt and prevents draconian cuts for disability payments \nand unfairness in Medicare premiums for our senior citizens; but it \ncontinues a downward spiral in government spending for essential items \nthat would improve America's infrastructure, education, medical \nresearch, and much more. Yet, at the same time, we are continuing on \nautopilot with some of the largest expenditures for generations to \ncome.\n  We had an announcement yesterday that we will be replacing the next \ngeneration of stealth bombers for our nuclear triad--up to 100 of \nthem--at an estimated cost of over $550 million each, and that is just \nthe estimated shelf price, the opening bid, plus another $20 billion in \ndevelopment costs.\n  Our history of developing weapons of this magnitude is that from the \nopening bid, the price is likely to spiral much higher in the future. \nThe same contractor, Northrop Grumman, which won this bid, could only \nbuild 21 B-2s out of a planned 132 as the costs spiraled to over $1 \nbillion a plane.\n  This comes at a time when we are committed to spending over $1 \ntrillion in the coming decades in upgrading our nuclear fleet. Think \nabout it: 12 new ballistic missile submarines, up to 100 new long-\nrange, nuclear-capable bombers, 642 new land-based ballistic missiles, \n1,000 new nuclear-capable, long-range standoff cruise missiles.\n  And why are we doing this in the first place?\n  Think for a moment. These weapons that we have already are far in \nexcess of anything America will ever need--a destructive capacity to \nobliterate any nation multiple times over--yet, we are moving ahead \nwithout ever discussing this spending here on the House floor as to \nwhether or not it is what we need.\n  Think about the security threats of today in terms of an inability to \nwithstand the devastating impacts of climate change on our communities, \nthe threats from ISIS, different challenges of encroachment from Russia \nand China--not nuclear attack, but moving ahead in building artificial \nislands, invading neighboring countries. These are threats now--the \nTaliban, international terrorism--and we are committed to spending vast \nsums on weapons that we are never likely to use and are useless against \nthe real threats we face.\n  We don't need 454 land-based nuclear missiles now. These end up \nthreatening us. Look at the recently released information about the \nstand-down around Russian paranoia in 1983 regarding NATO exercises. We \ndidn't realize how panicked they were or the steps that they took. That \nis the real threat from nuclear weapons, accident or miscalculation.\n  Consider the opportunity costs of vast sums of money that we are \ntying up that could be used for other purposes, including strengthening \nour military for today's threats or helping our veterans or our \ncommunities on what is bearing down upon them or equipping our citizens \nto function in this century.\n  We just had a fascinating lesson when the Export-Import Bank was \nfreed from the iron grasp of the committee and was allowed to actually \nbe debated on the floor of the House. It had been bottled up for years. \nIt had never had that sort of attention. We had more time and energy \nspent on the Ex-Im Bank over the last 50 hours than, probably, the last \n50 years--certainly, in the last 50 months.\n  What would happen if Congress actually addressed and debated the \nwisdom of our current nuclear policies and the vast sums of money that \nare being spent on autopilot that will be chewing a hole in the budget \nto the detriment of the Department of Defense and everything else?\n  There is a lesson to be learned, and I hope someday Congress will \nlearn it, because there is a path for a stronger, safer America, for \nmore meaningful, targeted military spending, and for a balanced, \nthoughtful budget prioritization. If Congress does its job in the open, \ncollectively, the decision becomes easier and the results become \nbetter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7258-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7258-H7259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n           CONGRATULATING STUDENTS AT NATIONAL FFA CONVENTION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nrecognition of the students from Pennsylvania participating in this \nweek's National Future Farmers of America, or FFA, convention in \nLouisville, Kentucky.\n  ``I believe in the future of agriculture.'' Those are the first words \nfrom the FFA creed. The Pennsylvania group is among 60,000 FFA members \nat this week's convention, participating in a variety of competitions \nand stressing the importance of agriculture to our Nation.\n\n[[Page H7259]]\n\n  Among Pennsylvania's State officers attending the convention is Tony \nRice. Tony is a student at the Pennsylvania State University's main \ncampus in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, and Tony is one \nof 52 national officer candidates traveling to Louisville.\n  Each year, six student members are selected as national officers of \nthe FFA. These young men and women travel as many as 100,000 miles per \nyear, stressing the importance of agriculture, agriculture education, \nand the FFA. Candidates are judged upon their ability to be effective \ncommunicators and team players.\n  Over the past years, Tony Rice has met with more than 12,000 high \nschool students to address the important role that agriculture plays in \nPennsylvania's economy as Pennsylvania's number one industry.\n  Now, I not only commend Tony Rice for his dedication to the future of \nthis industry but also his fellow FFA members and the educators who \nhave helped these young people, who will be the agricultural leaders of \ntomorrow, succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7259-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        END CHILDHOOD HUNGER NOW\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest health challenges \nfacing our country right now is hunger. We have a hunger problem in the \nUnited States of America.\n  For far too long, we have minimized the problem. Some have even \nignored the problem. In short, our response has been inadequate. And we \nhave failed to view hunger as a health issue, which it is. For our \nNation's youngest and most vulnerable, our children, the negative \neffects of childhood hunger are pervasive and long-lasting.\n  So last week I was pleased to see the American Academy of Pediatrics \nrelease its newest policy statement which, for the first time, \nrecommends that pediatricians screen all children for food insecurity. \nThe new recommendations consist of two simple questions for \npediatricians to ask parents of young children at their annual well \nvisit to identify and address childhood hunger. It also recommends that \npediatricians become more familiar with our robust system of antihunger \nprograms at the Federal, State, and local levels. When pediatricians \nknow more about these antihunger programs and the resources they \nprovide, they will be better prepared to help families in need.\n  Pediatricians are among the most respected, if not the most \nrespected, voices on children's issues; and I hope that, with the AAP's \npolicy statement, more people will start paying attention to the \ndevastating effects of childhood hunger on America's future.\n  It is shameful that childhood hunger even exists in this country, the \nrichest country in the world, that one in five children lives in a food \ninsecure household, that 17.2 million households in this country \nstruggle with food insecurity, that the only reliable healthy meals \nsome kids receive are the ones they get through school breakfasts or \nlunches. Their mothers and fathers are forced to skip meals so that \ntheir kids can have more to eat because the family simply cannot afford \nto put enough food on the table.\n  The harmful effects of hunger on children are well documented: for \nexample, children who live in households that are food insecure get \nsick more often, recover more slowly from illness, have poorer overall \nhealth, and are hospitalized more frequently.\n  Children and adolescents affected by food insecurity are more likely \nto be iron deficient, and preadolescent boys dealing with hunger issues \nhave lower bone density. Early childhood malnutrition is also tied to \nconditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life.\n  Lack of adequate healthy food can impair a child's ability to \nconcentrate and perform well in school and is linked to higher levels \nof behavioral and emotional problems from preschool through \nadolescence.\n  I have personally heard from pediatricians who see kids in the \nemergency room come in for a common cold that has become much worse \nbecause they don't have enough to eat, and their immune systems have \nbeen compromised. Stories like these are heartbreaking.\n  Mr. Speaker, we know that consistent access to adequate nutritious \nfood is one of the best medicines for growing, thriving children. \nChildren's Health Watch, a national network of pediatricians and child \nhealth professionals, found that, in comparison to children whose \nfamilies were eligible but did not receive SNAP, young children whose \nfamilies received SNAP were significantly less likely to be at risk of \nbeing underweight or experiencing developmental delays.\n  If Members of Congress are not swayed by the moral arguments for \nending childhood hunger, they ought to be swayed by the economic ones. \nEnsuring that our kids have access to enough nutritious food saves \nmoney in the form of reduced healthcare costs and helps them become \nmore productive contributors to our economy later in life.\n  Mr. Speaker, without our robust Federal antihunger programs, there \nwould no doubt be more hungry children in this country.\n  The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and \nChildren, or WIC, provides nutritious food and support for children and \nmothers. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is our \nNation's premiere antihunger program and helps millions of low-income \nfamilies afford to purchase food every month. About half of all SNAP \nrecipients are children. And our school breakfast and lunch programs, \nsummer meals, and Child and Adult Food Care Programs all provide \nnutritious meals to children in community, child-friendly settings.\n  We can't forget about the incredible work our food banks, food \npantries, and other charities do to provide healthy food for low-income \nchildren and their families. Despite the incredible work that they do, \ncharities cannot do it alone. The demand is simply too great. Charities \nneed a strong Federal partner to end hunger in this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, for a while now, I have been urging the White House to \nconvene a White House conference on food, nutrition, and hunger. We \nought to bring antihunger groups, pediatricians, business leaders, \nteachers, hospitals, farmers, nonprofits, faith leaders, and \ngovernmental officials together to come up with a plan to end hunger in \nthis country once and for all. I can think of no more compelling reason \nto end hunger now than for the health and well-being of America's \nchildren.\n  In closing, I commend the American Academy of Pediatrics for working \nto solve hunger as a health issue and addressing how it affects our \ncountry's greatest resource: our children. We can and we should do more \nto end hunger now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7259-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7259-H7260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ISIS MUST GO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Guess what? He is still there.\n  It has been 789 days since President Obama drew the red line in the \nsand, so to speak, and told Assad not to use chemical weapons on his \nown people. Well, he ignored that. And he used chemical weapons, and he \ncontinues to use chemical weapons and kill his own people.\n  What we are seeing in Syria--the rise of ISIS, the refugee crisis of \ntens of thousands of people, children having to migrate northward to \nget out of Syria, the civil war--are all the direct results of the \nPresident's unwillingness to stand by his word.\n  Now Russia is in Syria.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Farr) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, October is Dyslexia Awareness Month. It is \npart of the broader Learning Disabilities Month. This is the time we \nfocus on learning disabilities, particularly in our students and our \nown children and many who suffer from learning disabilities.\n  I am emphasizing Dyslexia Awareness Month because I have dyslexia. \nGrowing up, it was very hard being a student that couldn't read well, \ncouldn't spell, couldn't write. I was very ashamed of that. I was shy. \nI didn't know how to ask for help, but I had a lot of support in my \nhome.\n  My mother and father didn't really know how to treat it. We didn't \neven know how to diagnose it in the early ages. I became withdrawn and \nembarrassed to go to class, particularly to get up and to have to read \nin front of the class and to spell in front of the class. I still have \ntrouble doing that. Thanks to loving parents and to supportive \nteachers, I am here.\n  I share my story because we need to remove the stigma attached to \nlearning disabilities. No student should have to sit in silence being \nashamed, being afraid to ask for help.\n  I had a high school biology teacher, Enid Larson, a person whom I \nactually wanted to grow up and be like and be a high school biology \nteacher, who taught me I could accomplish anything. I think I studied \nsciences because so much of science was memorization and not having to \nwrite a lot of papers and not having to read in front of the class.\n  I pass that same message along because one in five children with \nlearning disabilities or attention issues has to know that it is not \nbecause they have a low IQ. They don't. In fact, some of the brightest \npeople in history have had these learning disabilities. It isn't \nbecause you are different. It means that you are unique. It means that, \nwith the right help, support, and love, you can accomplish many things. \nYou can cope with your disability.\n  Many Members of Congress are dyslexic or have children who are \ndyslexic, and so many that we have actually formed a Congressional \nDyslexic Caucus. I am urging you to ask your Member of Congress, if \nthey have not been a member of that caucus, to join it.\n  I ask for you to ask your school districts what help they are \nbringing to kids with disabilities and particularly for dyslexic \nstudents.\n  I encourage the students to speak out. You may be shy about reading, \nbut that shouldn't be affecting your speaking. You should speak out \nabout what you feel and what you want.\n  Dyslexia is a reading and spelling disorder, but you can develop \ncoping skills. With that, you can overcome your shame and your shyness. \nAfter all, many of us in Congress have done that, and that is why I am \nspeaking today and not reading.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7260-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FISHER CENTER FOR ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH FOUNDATION'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

To date, the Fisher Center has raised tens of millions of \ndollars in private funds in the quest to find a cure for this \nheartbreaking disease that affects millions of families across the \ncountry and around the world.\n  Mr. Zachary Fisher created the foundation in 1995, with the single \nmission of finding a cure for Alzheimer's through scientific discovery. \nSince then, the research scientists at the Fisher Center for \nAlzheimer's Research at Rockefeller University, led by Nobel laureate \nDr. Paul Greengard, have made remarkable strides, advancing \ngroundbreaking research. But there is, of course, much more work to be \ndone to defeat this debilitating disease.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I rise to recognize the foundation's leadership in \nthe fight to cure Alzheimer's, I must also recognize Mr. Fisher's many \nother charitable endeavors that have transformed and touched the lives \nof those who serve our Nation in uniform.\n  Mr. Fisher was deeply committed to supporting the men and women of \nour Armed Forces, and our veterans as well. In that light, he founded \nthe Fisher House Foundation, which provides housing to the families of \nour veterans and our servicemen while a loved one receives medical \ntreatment. Additionally, Mr. Fisher founded the Intrepid Sea, Air & \nSpace Museum in New York City.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  But the cause for which I rise today is to urge my colleagues once \nagain and to urge the Nation once again to focus on the profound need \nto increase Alzheimer's research and to recognize the equally profound \nwork that the Fisher Center has done to ultimately advance and find a \ncure.\n  With 5.3 million Americans suffering from Alzheimer's, we must do \nmore. Left unchecked, Alzheimer's will continue to dramatically impact \ncountless lives and families across the country. Left unchecked, \nAlzheimer's could cost our Nation $1.1 trillion annually by 2050.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in the fight to find a \ncure for Alzheimer's, and I rise today to thank the Fisher Center \nFoundation for leading this charge by funding groundbreaking research \nto finally end this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7260-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7260-H7261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRESERVING OUR PLANET\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \ndirect our attention to the importance of preserving our planet and \nwhat we should do to address the issue of the changes going on in our \nclimate.\n  Protecting our environment and addressing climate change are issues \nwhich are important to all of our cities across the United States. In \nfact, at a very local level, many of our communities are working on \nthese issues because they face them directly head on.\n  For the Latino community, like other communities, we are family-\noriented, and we want to provide a better future for our generations to \ncome. That includes leaving our planet better--better--for our \ngrandchildren and their children.\n  As the Latino population continues to increase in the United States--\nwe are about one out of every four, and they say that in another 30 or \n40 years, we will be one out of every three Americans--our exposure to \nclimate change and the risks of pollution are even more important \nbecause our ZIP Codes--where we live, where the Latino community \nlives--are where we are highest at risk.\n  It is estimated that close to 50 percent of all Latino Americans live \nin counties that frequently violate ground-level ozone standards. It \njust doesn't affect Latinos, by the way. Asian Americans tend to also \nlive in those ZIP Codes.\n  What that means is that we are breathing dirtier air than most \nAmericans, and we have more respiratory illness. Poor environmental \nprotections affect the food that we feed our children, the air that our \nfamilies breathe, and the water that we drink.\n  Since I was elected to Congress almost 20 years ago, I have worked \ntirelessly to work in Orange County--where I live and where I \nrepresent--to help get some green projects in, both in Orange County \nand in California.\n  For example, I have fought to maintain the funding for the Pacific \nCrest Trail, which serves residents of the entire West Coast and \nvisitors from around the world. Of course, I am an avid hiker; so, I \nlove that trail.\n  In fact, in this Congress, I cosponsored legislation which would \npermanently extend the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which ensures \nthe conservation of national parks, rivers, and streams. It provides \ngrants to local parks and to recreation projects.\n  One of the things it does is try to ensure that, for example, \nCalifornia, being so long in length, you could start at the southern \nportion of California and actually walk through wilderness all the way \nto the Oregon border.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a bipartisan program. That is \nwhy it kind of distresses me a little bit\n\n[[Page H7261]]\n\nthat we, as a Congress, haven't funded it, because it is incredibly \nimportant, especially in urban areas, such as my district, where there \nis little natural environment left and where we need open space and \ngreen parks.\n  It is where Latinos go to have their barbecues. It is where we have \nour family gatherings. It is incredibly important to us. Sometimes we \nlive in pretty cramped conditions, and we need that outdoor space, even \nif it is in an urban area. Places like Pearson and Pioneer Park in my \nhometown of Anaheim or Centennial Park in Santa Ana or our beautiful \nSanta Ana Zoo have all been made possible by the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  Mr. Speaker, do you know what the total cost to taxpayers for these \nwonderful developments are? Zero. The land and water conservation comes \nat no cost to the taxpayer, but it benefits them immensely. And, still, \nthis House has failed to fund this. It expired on September 30.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is another example \nof a commonsense--commonsense--bipartisan program on which this House \nhas neglected to act.\n  So I ask the Members of the House, can you go back to the people of \nyour district and say to them: Oh, I don't really care about your \nparks. I don't really care about the environment. I don't care about \nwhere you hang out with your families? This Congress has to act. We \nshould act together on this because it is incredibly important to our \nfamilies.\n  I will leave you with a quote, another one from one of my favorite \npeople, His Holiness Pope Francis: ``I call for a courageous and \nresponsible effort to `redirect our steps' and to avert the most \nserious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human \nactivity. I am convinced that we can make a difference.'' I am sure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7261-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed a bill of the following title in which the \nconcurrence of the House is requested:\n\n       S. 754.

It \nis critical that we understand that the battle against this disease \ndoes not end when the pink ribbons go away.\n  I fully understand the vital role leaders play here in Washington \nevery day in supporting groundbreaking research and that we must fight \nfor better treatments, finding a cure, and ultimately defeating breast \ncancer. Let's work together to end it once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7261-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OUR NATION'S MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, for too long we have neglected mental \nhealth in our Nation, leaving many to suffer with little hope. Nowhere \nis this seen more clearly than in our rural communities.\n  According to reports, more than 60 percent of rural Americans are \nliving in areas that are experiencing shortages in mental health \nprofessionals. More than 90 percent of practicing psychologists and \npsychiatrists in this country work exclusively in metropolitan areas. \nMore than 65 percent of rural Americans rely solely on their primary \ncare providers for mental health care. In most rural communities, the \nprimary mental health crisis responder is a law enforcement officer, \ndespite not being a medical specialist.\n  All across rural America patients continue to face longer wait times, \ndifficulty accessing care, and long-distance travel just to access \nsubpar care by professionals, through no fault of their own, not even \nadequately trained to diagnose and treat mental health issues. In \nShasta County, in my district, there is evidently only one psychiatrist \nin the area, while there is an estimated 4,000 patients with mental \nhealth needs.\n  In addition, the lack of mental healthcare facilities, such as the \nshortage of inpatient beds and space, leaves patients stuck with longer \nwait times in the emergency room before they can even see a health \nprofessional with no other options.\n  While the President's healthcare law attempted to make strides in \nthis area by including behavioral health coverage, this system is \nfundamentally and fatally flawed.\n  While continuing to throw Federal funding at it may serve as a \ntemporary Band-Aid for the symptoms of this crisis, it does nothing to \naddress the root of the problem. One-size-fits-all, top-down systems do \nnot work, especially in rural America.\n  If we continue to stand by the status quo, our rural patients will \ncontinue to suffer and, in many unfortunate cases, end up suicidal, \nhomeless, or in prison, placing an even greater financial burden on our \ncommunities.\n  For this reason, I am proud to support H.R. 2646, the Helping \nFamilies in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015. I thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania for introducing this sorely needed bill. It is said the \nfirst step to fixing a problem is acknowledging there is one, and that \nis exactly what this bill does.\n  We spend approximately $130 billion on mental health every year, yet \nour country still faces a shortage of nearly 100,000 psychiatric beds. \nThree of the largest mental health hospitals are, in fact, criminal \nincarceration facilities.\n  For every 2,000 children with a mental health disorder, only one \nchild psychiatrist is available. Outdated HIPAA privacy laws continue \nto prevent families and doctors from getting their loved ones and \npatients the care they need.\n  Our mental health system is broken, but it certainly does not have to \nbe. H.R. 2646 is a great step in rebuilding the system to one that \nworks to empower patients and families with the access to care and \nservices they need.\n  It brings accountability to the system to ensure every Federal dollar \nis going to evidence-based standards, improves quality, and expands \naccess to behavioral health in our community health clinics while \nadvancing telepsychiatry in areas with limited access to mental health \nprofessionals, and, importantly, ends the outdated prohibition on \nphysicians volunteering at clinics and federally qualified health \ncenters.\n  In addition, it provides more beds for those in need of immediate \ncare or those experiencing a crisis and improves alternatives to \ninstitutionalization so patients can access the treatment they need, \nwhile it helps us decrease the incarceration rates, homelessness, and \nrecurring ER visits. These are just a few of the sorely needed reforms \nincluded in H.R. 2646.\n  I want to stand today to thank my colleague, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Murphy), for his leadership in introducing this bill \nand urge my colleagues to lend their support of this responsible \nmeasure to help fix this broken system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7261-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7261-H7262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ISSUES OF CONCERN TO ALL AMERICANS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Breast \nCancer Awareness Month. As a breast cancer survivor, I want to add to \nmy sisters and brothers my appreciation for their strength and \ndetermination and my respect to those families whose loved ones did not \nsurvive the battle.\n  I am very grateful that, out of this awareness, we have begun to \nfocus on more research for breast cancer remedies and solutions. I \nintroduced a bill\n\n[[Page H7262]]\n\ndealing with triple-negative breast cancer, which is the most deadly \nbreast cancer and impacts women and minority women to the extent that \ntheir lifespan is shortened.\n  I rise today to indicate and to ask for renewed commitment by this \nCongress to focus on more research to bring an end to the forms of \nbreast cancer that have been so deadly, in particular, to women.\n  I want to thank the U.S. Department of Defense for working with me on \nproviding and supporting legislation that I offered and introduced to \nprovide the research, but also the care for military women who have had \nbreast cancer during their service in the United States military.\n  It is also Domestic Violence Month, and I acknowledge again the \nprivilege I had to serve on the Committee on the Judiciary and to work \nwith Chairman Hyde in the early stages of introducing and reauthorizing \nthe Violence Against Women Act. So many strides have been made.\n  In particular, I want to acknowledge the many agencies in Houston \nthat have helped women--and, in some instances, men--who have been \nvictims of domestic violence and abuse, in particular, the Houston Area \nWomen's Center that has provided service. I served on the board \npreviously, and I appreciate their service. We want to say to those \nwomen--and maybe men--do not suffer alone. Seek help and seek help now.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Mr. Speaker, today we will be looking at the culmination of \ndiscussions that have presented themselves as a budget that would end \nsome form of sequester and would raise the debt limit until March 15, \n2017.\n  As a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, I am committed \nto certain principles that I believe help all of America, and those \nare: the end to sequestration; the saving of Social Security, Medicaid, \nand Medicare; not eliminating any executive orders or toxic riders \nundermining, for example, the issues of dealing with our broken \nimmigration system; and the evenness of defense and non-defense \nsequester relief. We have begun that journey.\n  I also made a commitment to my seniors that we would fight against \nthe horrific increases that were about to take place under Medicare \npart D. Those numbers were going to be onerous and burdensome on our \nseniors, and I will offer them in just a moment.\n  In addition, let me say that the compromise generates $80 billion of \nsequester increases over 2 years, with the increase split evenly \nbetween defense and non-defense programs, and an additional $16 billion \nin discretionary funding over a 2-year period. I am hoping that this \nwill help many.\n  As I indicated, I am supporting breast cancer research. It will help \nthe National Institutes of Health. It will help fill the seats for so \nmany parents who need Head Start resources for their children.\n  Having traveled with my congressional colleagues, I know that \ndiplomatic security is a vital component to protecting our Foreign \nService officers. And then it will improve, if you will, the day-to-day \nfunctions of this government.\n  I am glad, as I indicated, with respect to the Medicare part B \npremiums, that we will not see the 54 percent increase that I think was \nthe number, and that the increase will be somewhere around 18 to 20 \npercent. We want it to be zero.\n  I want my seniors to know that we are continuing to fight as your \nincreases in prescription drugs and service under Medicare part D \ncontinue to go down. And, might I just add, that I believe it is \nimportant, in addition, that we negotiate the decreasing price of \nprescription drugs. If you talk to any individual, what they will say \nis their highest cost, part of their highest cost, whether it is \nseniors or families, is the cost of prescription drugs. So I think it \nis very important.\n  I think I want to look more into, Mr. Speaker, the Social Security \ndisability fix that is in this budget to ensure that no one sees any \nloss and cuts in their benefits. We just can't stand for that. Social \nSecurity recipients, as much as people want to clarify them as some \nhaving perpetrated fraud, they do not, Mr. Speaker.\n  As I close, let me say I want to protect those who are disabled. We \nare going to continue to look at this, even down to the moment of \nvoting, to make sure that the budget brings about success and help and \nnot harm.\n  I ask my colleagues to be deliberative in this debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7262-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7262-H7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LET'S KEEP OUR ATHLETES HEALTHY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to all the \nstudent athletes, the parents of student athletes, athletic trainers, \nand coaches out there: Sports build character. I want to make sure we \nare using technology, science, data analytics, and best practices to \nkeep our student athletes practicing, performing, and competing in a \nsafe and responsible manner.\n  I recall, as a former high school and college athlete, the pregame \nand prepractice routines that my coaches used to require before we \ncould start to play. And while sports provide great enjoyment for \nathletes, fans, and coaches, they also pose health risks; some of them \nare unavoidable, but some are preventable.\n  By utilizing data and technology, we can establish best practices so \nour athletes can remain healthy and compete, and our sports teams can \nsucceed. We can do that and still make certain injuries more \npreventable in the process.\n  In 2015, we have watches that provide real-time data on our heart \nrate, caloric intake, and blood pressure to smartphones that can then \nbe shared with coaches, parents, and physicians; and that is just an \nApple iWatch or a Fitbit.\n  Data analytics and sports go hand in hand these days, from \nmathematical algorithms as to what quarterback will be most successful \non a Sunday afternoon, to the data of building a winning baseball team.\n  Today's athletic success is fueled by skills, knowledge, and \nteamwork, both on and off the field. Just as we find ways to \nincorporate technology and data to ensure our next generation of \nathletes can remain healthy and playing well into old age, we must also \nencourage investments in the research, innovation, and technology to \ncontinue to build upon these already great achievements.\n  One aspect of this can be found in using data analytics to better \nunderstand athletic injuries in our children and student athletes: for \nexample, preemptively identifying vulnerabilities and assessing the \nlasting impact of other injuries so we can design equipment and enforce \nrules to most effectively avoid the likelihood of such injuries, but do \nso without compromising the integrity of the competitive sports we all \nenjoy watching or participating in.\n  Health professionals, coaches, trainers, and parents can utilize this \ndata to bring about greater awareness of sound practices that can keep \nour student athletes healthy and in the game, not on the sidelines.\n  Every preseason we read in our local newspaper about a student \nathlete who suffered a concussion during football or soccer practice. \nIn 2013 alone, over 1.2 million children visited emergency rooms for \nsports-related injuries, and nearly 8 percent of these emergency room \nvisits were concussion-related.\n  Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to introduce H. Res. 112, a \nresolution, the Secondary School Student Athletes' Bill of Rights, \nwhich encourages greater communication, coordination, and teamwork \namong coaches, parents, teachers, and medical professionals to ensure \nthat our children receive adequate training, safe equipment and \nfacilities, and immediate, on-site injury assessment.\n  The very data and tools we use to generate information like RBIs or \nyards per carry can be used to study incidence of injury, the impact of \ncertain dietary habits on developing athletes, better training \npractices, and a host of ways to improve the safe and responsible \nathletic experience for our youngest athletes.\n  With the support of over 100 diverse organizations dedicated to \nimproving the health of our student athletes, including the National \nAthletic Trainers Association, the American Football Coaches \nAssociation, the American Heart Association, the National Association \nof State Boards of Education,\n\n[[Page H7263]]\n\nand the American Academy of Pediatrics, H. Res. 112 is just one step \ntowards encouraging and emphasizing the use, sharing, and incorporation \nof data and innovation in improving the safety of athletes and avoiding \ninjury.\n  While that effort deals with on-the-field success of our student \nathletes, just as important is making sure we are giving our next \ngeneration the tools they need in innovation and analytics. In \nCongress, we should enable continued research by making a commitment to \nproviding the next generation of innovators with the tools to learn, \ndevelop, and ultimately succeed.\n  Indeed, STEM skills, the foundation of innovation, lies in a dynamic, \nmotivated, and a well-educated workforce equipped with science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics. As a member of the \nCongressional STEM Caucus, I will continue to be an advocate for \ncontinued funding of STEM curriculum in schools so that we can equip \nthe next generation of scientists and mathematicians with the tools to \nsucceed. STEM classroom lessons can be applied to sports and the data-\ncollection process. Our STEM students will play a major role in leading \nthe way for greater success on the field.\n  The bottom line, we must all work together to continue to keep our \nfavorite athletes and our children and our teams on the field and in \nthe game, prevent injuries, and encourage lifelong habits that will \nallow our children to lead healthier lives. By encouraging the use of \ntechnology, we can ensure our student athletes, our athletic trainers, \nour parents, and our coaches have the tools needed to keep our athletes \nhealthy and on the field instead of on the sidelines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7263-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RESULTS OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Sometimes we win, and sometimes we \nlose. But I thought it was worth spending a moment this morning to take \na look at how the Iran nuclear deal is going. We are 10 days since the \ndeal has been formally adopted, and here is the update:\n  The Supreme Leader has already begun redefining and testing the \nagreement. Earlier this month, Iran tested its new ballistic missile. \nThe missile has a 1,000-mile range, can carry a 1,600-pound payload. \nThe only practical use for this ballistic missile is to carry a nuclear \nwarhead.\n  The day after the test, Iran convicted The Washington Post journalist \nthey have been holding. The day after that, Iran arrested, apparently, \nan American businessman.\n  In recent weeks, Iran has begun partnering with Russia to undermine \nour policy and goals in Syria. And, of course, Iran continues to hold \nthe four Americans.\n  This deal was predicated on Iran changing its rogue behavior. We are \n10 days into this deal, and so far, I have to say, we are not off to a \nvery good start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7263-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7263-H7264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that constituents \nknow why their Members vote for and against different things.\n  Yesterday, we saw the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, and \nI voted ``no'' on that. Of course, I, like probably every single Member \nof Congress, have businesses in the district that I represent that use \nthe Export-Import Bank to further their business, hire their employees, \nand help their community.\n  So why would somebody vote against the Export-Import Bank? I am here \nto tell you why.\n  We have a tradition in America of a free-market value and its wanted \nstanding in the world. It is not by a corrupt system of cronyism and \npolitical favor, and that is what the Export-Import Bank is to me.\n  Unfortunately, while many small businesses in every community use the \nExport-Import Bank, fully 98 percent of businesses don't use the \nExport-Import Bank to do their exporting--98 percent. But that is not \nreally the issue. The issue is other things.\n  For instance, between 2007 and 2014, more than 51 percent of all Ex-\nIm subsidies benefited just 10--10--corporations. One in particular \nbenefited from $66.7 billion in subsidies during the past 7 years.\n  We can't fix Social Security, and we can't afford our military. But \nwe can sure afford for 10 corporations to get 51 percent, because it is \nnot really about the small business in your community, generally \nspeaking. As a matter of fact, foreign firms that receive most of Ex-Im \nfinancing are large corporations that primarily purchase exports from \nU.S. conglomerates, not from Main Street businesses.\n  Five of the top 10 buyers are state-controlled and rake in millions \nof dollars from their own governments, in addition to Ex-Im Bank \nsubsidies that the taxpayers are on the hook for.\n  Five of 10 are involved in exploration, development, and production \nof oil or natural gas, these foreign firms collecting subsidies from \nAmerican taxpayers at the same time that this administration is \nrestricting domestic oil and gas operations right here at home. \nConsequently, the Federal Government has doubly disadvantaged U.S. \nenergy firms through excessive regulation and Ex-Im Bank subsidies \ngranted to foreign competitors.\n  Now, sometimes in Washington it is not what you know, but it is who \nyou know. Of the 16 members of the Ex-Im Bank's 2014 advisory \ncommittee, half, fully half, were executives at companies or unions \nthat directly benefited from Ex-Im financing during their term--fully \nhalf.\n  Does that sound remotely suspicious to anybody?\n  Another five members represent companies or unions that received Ex-\nIm assistance shortly before they joined, and I will give you an \nexample.\n  Since 2011, former Energy Secretary and New Mexico Governor Bill \nRichardson has held a seat on Spanish energy company Abengoa's \ninternational advisory board. Shortly after joining the firm, Mr. \nRichardson was appointed to the Ex-Im advisory board, right around the \nsame time the two Ex-Im Bank loans benefiting Abengoa were issued. \nFascinating coincidence. Those taxpayer-backed loans totaled around \n$150 million.\n  Supporters of Ex-Im argue that the advisory committee members being \nassociated with their beneficiaries is a positive feature. To the \ncontrary, I think it shows that a corporate cronyism atmosphere exists \nat Ex-Im and will continue to exist at Ex-Im.\n  The office of the IG and the GAO, the Government Accountability \nOffice, repeatedly document mismanagement, dysfunction within Ex-Im, \nincluding inefficient policies and procedures to guard against waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Fully 124 investigations have been initiated between October 2007 and \nMarch 2014, as well as 792 separate claims involving more than $500 \nmillion, and 74 administrative actions since April of 2009 in which \nbank officials were forced to act internally on the basis of \ninvestigations by the inspector general.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reported that Ex-Im programs actually \noperate at a deficit, because we also are told that it makes the \nAmerican taxpayer money; but we don't really know, because they use \ntheir own accounting system not used anywhere else. Actually, the CBO \nsays that will cost taxpayers $2 billion in the next decade.\n  And you wonder why certain Members of Congress don't vote for this \nthing. It is not about the small businesses in our communities that are \ntrying to do a good job and play by the rules, because they are doing a \ngood job and playing by the rules. But there is a bigger issue here. \nThere is more to the story.\n  The new bill that we just passed guarantees an audit every 4 years--\nevery 4 years. But keep in mind that Ex-Im currently has around 30 open \ninvestigations, 75 years of combined prison time, 90 criminal \nindictments and complaints, 49 criminal judgments, more than $223 \nmillion in court-ordered fines and restitution, and I could go on.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Ex-Im Bank doesn't do everything it could for small \nbusiness, but it does a lot for people that\n\n[[Page H7264]]\n\nknow people in this town. That is why it must be reformed or ended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7264-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 UNRWA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, for years, I have been pushing for the \nUnited States to reexamine its relationship with UNRWA, the U.N. Relief \nand Works Agency.\n  UNRWA employs individuals affiliated with Hamas, a U.S.-designated \nterrorist organization that openly and loudly incites violence against \nIsrael; yet the United States--which means the U.S. taxpayer--sends \nnearly $300 million a year to this organization, to UNRWA without \nquestioning, without scrutiny.\n  Just last week, the U.N. quietly suspended several individuals after \nallegations of incitement were brought forth from the NGO U.N. Watch. \nAnd we thank U.N. Watch for carefully looking over this organization.\n  These allegations, Mr. Speaker, are just the tip of the iceberg. We \nmust not continue to send taxpayer dollars to UNRWA--again, that is the \nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency--and, subsequently, to \nindividuals tied to the terror group Hamas in violation of our laws.\n  That is why, Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, I reintroduced my bill \nthat would stop all U.S. contributions to UNRWA until the organization \npurges its payroll of individuals who incite violence against Israel \nand until that organization ends all its affiliations with Hamas. Is \nthat really too much to ask, that we should demand that before U.N. \nagencies get one penny of U.S. taxpayer money that they must not incite \nviolence and that they must no longer affiliate themselves with a U.S.-\ndesignated terrorist organization?\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this measure, to sign on as \ncosponsors, and to lead in the effort to fight the incitement to \nviolence against Israel.\n\n\n                        Honoring Jacinto Acebal\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary south Floridian and one of the most highly decorated \nveterans of the Vietnam war, my dear friend Jacinto Acebal.\n  Just last January, Mr. Acebal--or ``Ace,'' as we all call him--was \ndiagnosed with larynx cancer. The news hit Ace like a ton of bricks; \nand, like so many others diagnosed with this horrible disease, the \nchances of a favorable outcome looked disheartening.\n  However, no stranger to tough situations, Ace made a commitment to \nhis family that he was not going without a fight. After a total of 8 \nchemotherapy sessions, 33 radiation treatments, and 3 different \nsurgeries, Ace is no longer bedridden and has been declared cancer-\nfree.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Jacinto ``Ace'' \nAcebal on this incredible milestone and wishing him many years of good \nhealth throughout his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7264-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

That number is nearly 1,100 more than the total number of \nAmerican soldiers who were killed in Iraq and Afghanistan over the same \ntime period.\n  Despite this fact, many domestic abusers can still legally purchase a \ngun. There is no Federal prohibition to prevent the sale of a gun to \nsomeone convicted of a misdemeanor crime in a dating partner \nrelationship or someone convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Protecting Domestic \nViolence and Stalking Victims Act, which Congresswoman Lois Capps has \nintroduced, to close these loopholes immediately.\n  Let's get to work to end this epidemic and protect the lives of women \nacross our country during Domestic Violence Awareness Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7265-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                OXI DAY\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because 75 years ago this week, \nthe Nazis were sweeping through Europe with frightening ease. This was \nthe backdrop on the early morning of October 28, 1940, when the Axis \nforces requested a meeting with the Greek Prime Minister, Ioannis \nMetaxas.\n  The Axis' agenda for the meeting was a short one. They came with only \none simple demand: Greece must unconditionally surrender and allow the \nAxis forces unfettered use of strategic military sites or the Greek \npeople would face war.\n  The Axis forces clearly underestimated the resolve of the Greeks. \nPrime Minister Metaxas shocked the Axis powers by giving his now famous \none-word answer: ``Oxi.''\n  While others in Europe were choosing to stay out of the conflict in \nhopes that they would be spared, the Greeks willingly inserted \nthemselves into the fray, costing hundreds of thousands of Greek lives, \nbut saving millions by continually stifling the Axis forces.\n  Greece's refusal saved countless lives as Greek forces fought \nheroically; but Greece paid a terrible price as well, losing \npractically an entire generation of men and women.\n  As we remember Oxi Day and the bravery of the Greek people, let us \nalso remember the millions of Greeks who perished so that Hitler might \nbe stopped.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7265-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRINITY RIVER MISSION\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY.

In addition, by introducing \nkids to a variety of fruits and vegetables at a young age, we can teach \nthem how to eat healthy over the long term.\n  We are fortunate in my district to have farmers who grow some of the \nbest food in the world.

Mr. Speaker, the month of October is Breast Cancer \nAwareness Month, and I rise today to call attention and awareness to \nthis disease and to recognize the many women and men in America who are \nfighting it.\n  The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 230,000 women \nand 2,350 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year and over \n40,000 women and men will, sadly, lose their battle.\n  Every day brilliant researchers in our country are working towards a \ncure. We must honor their commitment with full funding of the National \nInstitutes of Health to ensure that we are meeting our commitment to \nthem and the millions of lives affected by cancer each year.\n  That is why I supported the 21st Century Cures bill that passed the \nHouse earlier this year with a majority of each party in support. That \nis also why I am renewing my call to double NIH funding over the coming \ndecade to recruit, retain, and invest in the people and research that \nwill save lives, grow our economy, and save us trillions.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for the ``moonshot,'' as our Vice President \ncalled it earlier this week. It is time for this Congress to make \ncuring cancer its signature priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7266-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LET'S CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES\n\n  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. DEUTCH.

That is just one of the findings from Politico \nmagazine's recent ``What Works'' survey of mayors from across the \ncountry.\n  In red States and in blue States in every part of this country, 90 \npercent of mayors say they want stronger background checks, 86 percent \nsay they want the gun show loophole closed, and 78 percent want those \nsubject to restraining orders barred from ever buying guns. It is no \nsurprise why.\n  America's mayors witness up close the gun violence that plagues our \ncountry every day. They know the victims of the homicides, the \nsuicides, the accidental shootings, and the domestic gun violence that \nleave families forever shattered. They know how hollow the gun lobby \nsounds when it says there is nothing we can do to prevent more \ntragedies, and they know that it is within the power of this Congress \nto fix the laws that do not work and to save the lives that need not be \nlost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7266-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ACUPUNCTURE FOR HEROES AND SENIORS ACT\n\n  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California.

Here in the U.S., the demand \nfor acupuncture has grown significantly in recent years.\n  In fact, about 4 in 10 American adults use alternative medicines. \nWhen other treatments may not help, acupuncture can treat chronic pain, \nmental health issues, substance abuse, and many other illnesses.\n  I will never forget hearing the testimony of a woman who had severe \nback pain, but did not want invasive surgery, as suggested by her \ndoctor, and possible addiction to morphine. Instead, she sought \nacupuncture, and it worked for her.\n  Indeed, the National Institutes of Health indicates that, for some \nmedical issues, acupuncture can provide the needed relief. It is my \ngoal to make this treatment available to all Americans, including \nseniors, our brave servicemembers, and respected veterans.\n  Today I am introducing a bill to do just that. This bill, the \nAcupuncture for Heroes and Seniors Act, will expand access to \nacupuncture services to these communities because they deserve to have \nall the tools at their disposal to live long and healthy lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7266-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING DANNY KORNEGAY\n\n  (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. ROUZER.

He also finishes about 8,000 to 10,000 head of hog per year.\n  My family and I have known Danny for many years.

Mr. Speaker, October is National Farm to School Month, \nand I want to talk today about the recent gains our schools have made \nin connecting students with local food.\n  Across the country, the Farm to School movement has inspired over \n40,000 schools to spend more of their food dollars locally, to create \nhealthier meal options, and to teach students about growing and \npreparing local food. These efforts have brought numerous benefits, \nlike new markets for local agricultural producers, better nutrition for \nstudents, and less food being thrown away in the trash.\n  I am proud that schools in my State of Maine have helped lead the \nway; but, like others, they encounter many challenges in replacing \nhighly processed food with fresh ingredients.\n  The USDA Farm to School grants have eased that transition for many \nschools by helping them make needed changes in procurement, facilities, \nand training. As we celebrate Farm to School efforts this month and \nlook toward child nutrition reauthorization, I encourage my colleagues \nto support increased funding for this program so more communities can \nreap the benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7267-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING MAJOR PHYLLIS PELKY\n\n  (Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico.

Mr. Kimble and his wife, Jan, lost their \ndaughter Jamie, an only child, to domestic violence in 2012.\n  Jamie, a 31-year-old graduate of the University of North Carolina and \nrising star at Coca-Cola Consolidated, worked up the courage to leave \nher boyfriend, who was controlling and emotionally abusive. Just 3 \nmonths after leaving him, he took her life and then he took his own in \na murder-suicide.\n  While Jamie can no longer share her story, her parents--Mr. and Mrs. \nKimble--wanted me to share it with you today to shed light on the \ntragedy that often emerges from domestic violence.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the Teach Safe Relationships Act because I \nbelieve including safe relationship behavior curriculum in sex \neducation will help combat domestic violence.

Mr. Speaker, last evening, I voted against reauthorizing \nthe Export-Import Bank, a Federal entity that financially backs \npurchases of American goods and services by providing taxpayer-backed \nloans and loan guarantees to foreign companies and governments.\n  While the Ex-Im Bank can help American industry break into foreign \nmarkets, too often it underwrites purchases by companies that directly \ncompete with domestic companies, placing them at a significant \ndisadvantage. For example, when foreign airlines purchase aircraft at \nlower costs with Ex-Im Bank backing, they are able to charge lower \nfares and outcompete our domestic airlines.\n  The Federal Government should ensure that competition occurs on a \nlevel\n\n[[Page H7268]]\n\nplaying field, without tilting it toward one side or another.\n  Furthermore, Ex-Im Bank supporters used a discharge petition to bring \nthis bill to the floor, a parliamentary tactic which limits the use of \namendments and creates an end run around the normal committee process \nthat should apply to every measure considered by Congress.\n  It is the American public that shoulders the risk of these loans, \nand, at the very minimum, they deserve an honest debate on this floor \non the best way to move forward in promoting our exports abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7268-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BIPARTISAN BUDGET AGREEMENT\n\n  (Mr. CONNOLLY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CONNOLLY.

It restores \ncritical funding for our Nation's defense and domestic priorities in a \nbalanced fashion, sparing us from the mindless meat-ax cuts of \nsequestration.\n  Under previous Republican budget proposals, spending on domestic \nprograms would have fallen to its lowest level in 50 years. It is the \nthreat of uncertainty, of those indiscriminate cuts, that has held back \nour economy.\n  This agreement also pulls us back from the brink of defaulting on our \nNation's credit. Although I am astounded at how some of our colleagues \ncontinue to advocate for such a catastrophe, it would send a shock wave \nthrough the global economy. We avert that in this agreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, governing is about the art of compromise. Today's \nagreement, not perfect, represents that principle. I hope your \nsuccessor and, frankly, more of the Members on your side of the aisle, \nwill embrace that spirit moving forward in this Congress so, once \nagain, we can start delivering for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7268-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7268-H7271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1314, \n       ENSURING TAX EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL ACT\n\n  Mr. COLE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported \na rule for consideration of H.R. 1314, the Bipartisan Budget Agreement \nof 2015. The rule makes in order a motion offered by the majority \nleader that the House concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 1314, with \nan amendment consisting of the text of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement \nof 2015. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and \ncontrolled by the majority leader and the minority leader.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to start with a phrase I often share with my \nfellow Members: In a negotiation, you are always going to get less than \nyou want and give up more than you would like. I think that is a \nfitting way to describe the bill we find ourselves presented with \ntoday. In an era of divided government, that is the reality we find \nourselves in.\n  At the beginning of the negotiation, the President demanded a clean \ndebt ceiling increase with no changes and no conditions. In addition, \nhe wanted more spending and higher taxes. Given that, I think the deal \nthat we have before us is a testament to our leadership's ability to \nnegotiate.\n  As I said yesterday, Mr. Speaker, nobody is going to be popping \nchampagne corks at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue over this bill. It \nis what most things are in divided government, in a system of checks \nand balances, and in an era of polarized politics. It is a deal that \nleaves both sides unsatisfied, but it is a deal that avoids default, \nprevents a government shutdown, and adequately funds our military. \nMoreover, it reforms and funds the Social Security Disability Insurance \nFund, saving it from bankruptcy, and prevents a crippling increase in \nthe premiums paid by many people who receive Medicare part B.\n  There are any number of provisions that Members on both sides can \npoint to as reasons to oppose this legislation. I, myself, would have \nnegotiated a different deal. But in determining one's support for this \nlegislation, I encourage Members to look at what the alternative would \nbe, and that is this: the first default on our Nation's debt in the \nhistory of this country, significant cuts to our military in a time \nwhen we need our military the most, and an almost 50 percent increase \nin Medicare premiums for many of our seniors. That is the reality of \nwhat happens if we do nothing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by a number of provisions in this \nlegislation. First, just like the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, this \nlegislation sets forth 2 years of budget certainty for the \nAppropriations Committee. That certainty puts us on a path to ensure \nconsideration of full-year spending bills for the next 2 years, just as \nwe were able to accomplish this past fiscal year.\n  In addition, this budget certainty provides the needed investment for \nour military. With the ongoing conflicts across the Middle East, \nRussian activity in Eastern Europe, and Chinese claims in the South \nChina Sea, it is clearer now than ever that America needs a robust \nmilitary.\n  Mr. Speaker, most importantly, all these discretionary spending \nincreases are fully paid for by offsets in mandatory programs.\n  In addition to these critical investments, the legislation before us \nmakes a number of commonsense, structural reforms to SSDI, like \nrequiring a medical review before awarding benefits, and expanding \nCooperative Disability Investigations units to investigate \nsophisticated fraud schemes before benefits are awarded. These reforms \nboth ensure that the disability trust fund will be able to pay full \nbenefits and ensure that those who truly are disabled have access to \nthis important program.\n  Beyond that, Mr. Speaker, this legislation realizes over $30 billion \nin Medicare savings within the budget window and countless billions in \nyears to come.\n  I am pleased to again be talking about the real drivers of our debt: \nthe two-thirds of our government spending that is on autopilot. If we \nare unable to deal with these mandatory programs, they will end up \nbankrupting us.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation suspends the debt ceiling \nthrough March 15, 2017. Since its inception in 1917, 20 debt limit laws \nalso included a change in fiscal policy. I am pleased that this debt \nlimit increase is yet again accompanied by mandatory reforms.\n  Of course, Mr. Speaker, I would have preferred stronger reforms, but, \nin this era of divided government with a\n\n[[Page H7269]]\n\nDemocratic President and a Republican Congress, no one will be able to \nget everything they want.\n  The President wanted a clean debt limit increase. Congress wanted \nsignificant entitlement reforms. What we are left with is a compromise \nwhich lowers the trajectory of our debt, but also assures the world \nthat the United States will pay its bills.\n  While not a perfect piece of legislation, I believe this moves us in \nthe right direction and funds critical priorities for our Nation. I \nurge support for the rule and the underlying legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am here to do my part of the rule. I \nthank the gentleman from Oklahoma, my friend, for yielding me the time, \nand I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Bipartisan Budget \nAgreement before us. Instead of the brinksmanship and short-term \nstopgaps that we have seen, we have, I am glad to say, a 2-year budget \nagreement that eases the burden of the damaging sequester cuts, \nprotects seniors, affirms the full faith and credit of the United \nStates, and provides much-needed economic stability and security to our \nNation.\n  This agreement provides relief from 90 percent of the sequester's \ncuts for the next 2 years. While we should eliminate the sequester in \nits entirety, this is a welcome respite from the sequester's grip, \nensuring a renewed investment in research, infrastructure, and early \nchildhood education.\n  The agreement also includes a clean way to pay the debts that \nCongress has already incurred and will eliminate the threat of a debt \nlimit standoff for the next 2 years.\n  We should remember that the last time politics were played over the \ndebt limit, our credit rating was downgraded for the first time in our \nhistory and our economy suffered.\n  Because of this agreement, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that the certainty that this budget agreement creates \nwill encourage the growth of 340,000 new jobs in 2016 alone.\n  The Los Angeles Times Editorial Board wrote this morning that the \nbudget agreement will provide ``a welcome measure of stability at a \ntime of increasing anxiety about the global economy.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the text of the editorial from \nthe Los Angeles Times entitled ``John Boehner's Last Deal Leaves \nCongress Better Off.''\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Oct. 28, 2015]\n\n          John Boehner's Last Deal Leaves Congress Better Off\n\n       In a parting gift to the conservatives who hectored him out \n     of office, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) negotiated \n     a budget agreement with Senate leaders and the Obama \n     administration that increases federal spending and raises the \n     debt ceiling in exchange for--well, not much that Republicans \n     covet. There are no big changes in entitlements, no defunding \n     of Planned Parenthood. Yet this backroom deal delivers the \n     goods that matter most: It will avert the risk of a shutdown \n     until after the next president takes office, providing a \n     welcome measure of stability at a time of increasing anxiety \n     about the global economy.\n       Boehner had said he wanted to ``clean the barn'' for his \n     replacement--most likely Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.)--which \n     meant disposing of four divisive issues with rapidly \n     approaching deadlines. The federal government is days away \n     from hitting its borrowing limit. Federal agencies are slated \n     to run out of funding in early December. The Social Security \n     trust fund for disability benefits is expected to be empty by \n     late 2016. And millions of elderly and disabled Americans \n     face a whopping 52% increase in their Medicare Part B \n     premiums at year's end.\n       The compromise negotiated by congressional leaders and the \n     White House would resolve all of these issues in the time-\n     honored way: giving everyone much of what they want, then \n     paying for it with budget gimmicks. The debt ceiling would be \n     suspended until March 2017, the budget caps lifted for two \n     fiscal years, disability benefits assured through 2022 and \n     Medicare premium increases made less dramatic. Without these \n     steps, Congress risks defaulting on debts, forcing a \n     government shutdown and delivering a painful financial blow \n     to vulnerable Americans. None of those outcomes should even \n     be contemplatable, and yet Congress' record of dysfunction \n     over the last four years makes them all real possibilities \n     absent a deal like the one Boehner negotiated.\n       Obviously, it would be better for Congress to make real \n     choices about spending instead of relying on accounting \n     legerdemain to make the numbers look good. The proposed fix \n     for disability insurance, for example, would take the money \n     out of a fund for future retirement benefits; that's a \n     reprieve, not a solution. But when Congress ignores a problem \n     until the last minute, it takes real solutions off the table, \n     leaving lawmakers to choose between pragmatism and the sort \n     of posturing that dissident House Republicans have made their \n     stock in trade. Credit Boehner with opting for one last deal \n     rather than showing the country again that the House GOP's \n     reach exceeds its grasp.\n\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, this agreement avoids the harmful cuts to \nMedicare and Social Security beneficiaries by reforming tax compliance \namong hedge funds and private equity funds, ensuring that people in the \ntop bracket pay their fair share.\n  The agreement also limits any increase in the Medicare part B \npremiums for 2016, protecting millions of seniors from a roughly 50 \npercent rate hike. It does this by spreading out the cost of \nreplenishing the Medicare trust fund over a number of years, and it \nprevents this kind of rate hike from happening again in 2017.\n  The health savings included in this agreement focus on well-\ndocumented areas of overpayment and improved program integrity, \nclearing out waste in the system.\n  What's more, the agreement avoids the deep cuts to Social Security \nDisability Insurance benefits that would occur at the end of next year, \nensuring it continues to pay benefits without reducing benefit levels \nor imposing new eligibility restrictions. Social Security Disability \nwill survive, but with reforms to ensure accountability and fiscal \nprudence that are long overdue.\n  These are good steps forward. The agreement represents significant \nprogress for hardworking American families, and for the next 2 years, \nwe have come out of the sequester's shadow. Together, we have found a \nway forward to confront the challenges we face as a nation.\n  This agreement is the first bipartisan budget bill we have seen in \nquite awhile. It serves as a roadmap that will lead us through the \nappropriations process; but until we finish that process, we are still \non the path toward a government shutdown.\n  However, with the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank yesterday \nand now the introduction of this budget agreement, I am hopeful that \nthis House can make progress on issues that are important to America \nand to our economy. We have sort of grown accustomed to governing by \ncrisis with stopgap measures that do harm to the Nation.\n  When John Boehner assumed the Speakership, he promised an open \nprocess for all Members; but what we have seen is that one party has \nbeen consistently shut out and only allowed to participate in fits and \nstarts, which silences half the voices of our Nation. We have seen \npoliticized select committees and political maneuvers, and we hope that \nthe cries to the Speaker-in-waiting for open legislative process will \ninclude both parties and include all voices.\n  This agreement, with a 2-year outlook, with input from leadership \nfrom both Chambers of Congress and the White House, has, perhaps, \nmarked a turning point. Only time will tell.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to make a couple of points. First, I want to thank my \ngood friend for her work on this and her cooperation. I agree with many \nof the points she made, certainly about the fact that I hope this \nheralds a new beginning.\n  Worth noting, we did have a budget agreement 2 years ago, and that \nworked pretty well for a couple of years. I am pleased to see that this \nfollow-on agreement is here before us today. I think it will give us 2 \nyears of stability.\n  My friend will understand if I take mild exception with some of her \nremarks about being shut out of the process. Those of us who were here \nin the minority on the Republican side of the aisle certainly remember \nnot being allowed to offer amendments to the Affordable Care Act, \nseeing the stimulus act come to the floor with no committee, and, \nfrankly, having the long-time practice of appropriations bills coming \nunder open rules totally suspended.\n  But, in the spirit of cooperation today, I will leave it at that. \nLet's look\n\n[[Page H7270]]\n\nahead. I think my friend is exactly right when she suggests this bill \nnot only solves some important issues that are in front of us in a \nbipartisan way, a give-and-take way, but creates an opening and an \nopportunity going forward.\n  I really think, if we get this rule passed--and I am sure we will--\nand we get the underlying legislation passed--I am sure we will be able \nto do that as well--that next year offers us an opportunity to do what \nwe have not done around here, really, since 2006, and that is see every \nsingle appropriations bill come to the floor under an open rule so that \nMembers on both sides can participate in the most important process of \ngoverning ourselves, and that is the appropriation of the taxpayers' \ndollars for the functioning of government.\n  If we can build on this and achieve that, I think a lot of people on \nboth sides of the aisle who are concerned about regular order and who, \nfrankly, have never seen it work will have an opportunity to watch it \nwork.\n  I would suggest the fact that we already have an agreement as to what \nthe top-line number will be on what we spend in the normal \nappropriations process might make it easier for a lot of the votes to \nbe more bipartisan.\n  Frankly, I know that is certainly possible in my committee, the \nAppropriations Committee, and I think that is something that Members \nare genuinely looking for: an opportunity to debate priorities and \ndiscuss, but also to come together when there is common ground.\n  Again, I want to look at this bill. I know there will be some \ncontroversy about it today and there will be some people who would have \nliked to have done some things differently. Frankly, I suspect every \nMember would like to do things differently.\n  But the reality is we are in a period of divided government. We do \noperate in a system of checks and balances. It has been an \nexceptionally polarizing political environment. The fact that, with all \nof those challenges, the Speaker, the majority leader, the President, \nand the respective minority leaders of both Chambers could come \ntogether and find enough common ground to accomplish the things that \nthis accomplishes is something that we ought to laud, not to disparage.\n  I look forward to working with my friend. I look forward to this \nbecoming the foundation for a much more productive 2016, where we can \ndo something we have not done for a long time, and that is operate \nunder regular order throughout the entire appropriations process. That \nis going to be my New Year's resolution after we get an omnibus done.\n  I think this will set the ground for getting that done by early \nDecember and we can have stability next year and an opportunity to \nlegislate the way I think most Members, regardless of party or \nphilosophical point of view, want to legislate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good \nfriend and the ranking member on the Rules Committee for yielding to me \nand for her extraordinary leadership for the State of New York and for \nso many issues before this body.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for this 2-year \nbudget bill and the exemplary bipartisan cooperation that made it \npossible. Although this bill is by no means perfect, it is a good bill. \nIt is good for the economy and good for the country.\n  It will ensure our Nation maintains the full faith and credit of \nglobal financial markets. It protects millions of Americans from an \nenormous Medicare premium increase. It frees us from the uncertainty \nthat roils markets and worries businesses, both big and small.\n  While I support the compromise, I would like to raise some concerns \nabout its impact on hospitals in the district that I represent.\n  The bill puts restrictions on which hospital-affiliated facilities \ncan be considered outpatient departments and reimbursed at hospital \nrates.\n  Under the bill going forward, acquired facilities that are a certain \ndistance from the main campus of hospitals will be reimbursed, but at a \nlower rate. They will be reimbursed for services as a regular doctor's \nvisit. Existing sites will be grandfathered, but those that are under \nconstruction will be exempted and charged the lower rate.\n  This will be a challenge in areas, like the district that I \nrepresent, where increasing demand collides with the lack of physical \nspace to cause scattered hospital-affiliated facilities. I hope to work \nwith my colleagues to improve the changes made to these outpatient \nservices Medicare payments.\n  I commend all who have worked with such goodwill on this budget. I \nurge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to say I think my good friend from New York makes an excellent \npoint. There are going to be some issues like this that I think we need \nto look at very carefully in the coming weeks and perhaps find some \ncommon ground on. In an agreement of this magnitude, occasionally we \nare going to have some problems.\n  I have some other areas of concern in some of the offsets, \nagricultural crop insurance being one of them. I suspect, in the coming \nweeks, perhaps we can find some common ground on these issues. I \ncertainly hope so.\n  Of course, if we get an omnibus spending bill done, which this is the \nfoundation or the predecessor for, then we will have a vehicle where \nperhaps we can address some of the concerns that my friend raises and \nas I know others have in different areas with respect to this \nagreement.\n  Again, I want to thank my friend for bringing the issues forward. I \nthink they are important to air and make note of. I just pledge that I \nwill do what I can to see if we can find some common ground here and \niron out some of these knotty problems that we have.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. COLE. I certainly yield to my friend.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for \nyielding. I would like to underscore my appreciation to you and the \nranking member for your willingness to work on correcting this.\n  I believe a correction could literally save taxpayer dollars and be \nmore efficient. The willingness to work together for better government \nfor our country is, I think, a good step forward.\n  I thank the leaders on the other side of the aisle for approaching \nthis in a bipartisan, cooperative spirit, as you are showing on the \nfloor today. It is better for our country and certainly better for the \nbudget in all respects.\n  Thank you very, very much. I am extremely appreciative.\n  Mr. COLE. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend \nagain. I again express my appreciation for the point that she raises \nand the willingness to work together.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. My \nscheduled speakers have not arrived, and I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. Speaker, today we have before us a 2-year budget agreement that \nprotects seniors, invests in job training, and eases the burden of the \nsequester.\n  However, unless we see the process through with the appropriations \nprocess, we are still on a path toward shutdown, which is not what the \nAmerican people want from Congress and what the economy can't stand.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this bipartisan agreement, for \nthe rule, and the underlying bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to just reiterate a number of points that I \nopened my remarks with.\n  First, I don't think this is a perfect bill. I doubt that anybody on \nthis floor does. However, it is the only deal that can be considered in \nthe timeframe we have before the debt limit is breached.\n  Secondly, the deal ensures an appropriate level of discretionary \ngovernment spending for the next 2 years, a level that robustly funds \nour military and ensures America's security.\n  Finally, this deal is fully paid for and includes mandatory offsets \nthat will build over time, further decreasing the trajectory of our \nexpanding debt, shifting the burden to where the true drivers of the \ndebt are and where the supercommittee was intended to actually\n\n[[Page H7271]]\n\nfind cuts and brings us back to fiscal balance.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, Mr. Speaker, I also want to add a \npersonal tribute, if I may, to our Speaker. This is probably the last \nsignificant piece of legislation that this body will pass under Speaker \nBoehner's leadership. He was instrumental in forging it.\n  I know there are many people who are critical of particular aspects \nof this deal or about the process. Indeed, our Speaker himself has used \nrather colorful language in expressing his opinion of the process by \nwhich we arrived at this agreement.\n  However, I think it is worth noting that, in the finest traditions of \nthis House and the institutions that we all cherish, the Speaker, the \nPresident, the majority leader, the minority leader in the House, the \nminority leader in the Senate, came together, put aside differences, \nand found common ground.\n  In doing so, they solved some really difficult issues for us. They \ndealt with an impending default to make sure that didn't happen. They \ndealt with a potential government shutdown or at least bought us the \ntime to deal with it between now and December 11.\n  They made sure that the additional discretionary spending that they \nboth agreed to was offset by a variety of means. They included a really \nimportant reform in the Social Security disability system that, again, \nwill keep it from going bankrupt and help millions of Americans who \nneed help.\n  Finally, they also made sure that millions of Americans who are \nfacing literally 50 percent rate increases under Medicare part B will \nnot have those increases. That is no small achievement.\n  And John Boehner, for 25 years in this institution, from a freshman \nto the highest pinnacle that we have, the Speakership, has operated \nwith integrity and has operated from principle, but has never been \nafraid to try and find common ground for people with different points \nof view. I, for one, appreciate the manner in which he has led our \nHouse, the manner in which at the very last minute he continues to work \nfor the good of the American people and to reach across the aisle to \nfind common ground with those with opposing views and opposing partisan \naffiliations.\n  I appreciate the manner in which he has dealt with our own \nConference, which is the largest since 1928, and, consequently, \nprobably the most fractious. He has worked with Members of differing \nopinion and found common ground and brought us together.\n  So I just, again, speaking for myself, want to say how much I have \nenjoyed, throughout my entire career, having had the opportunity to \nserve with Speaker Boehner, first as a freshman member on his committee \nwhen he chaired Education and the Workforce, then at the leadership \ntable when he became the leader of our party, and, finally, just as \nanother Member who admires and appreciates his many, many \naccomplishments, his character, and the manner in which he has led.\n  So, with that, Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the Speaker of the \nentire House, Mr. Boehner, for his distinguished service to this \ninstitution and to this country and for being a valued friend and a \nperson that I genuinely admire and I think people on both sides of the \naisle genuinely admire.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

and\n       (13) to take into account conditions relating to religious \n     freedom of any party to negotiations for a trade agreement \n     with the United States.\n       (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--\n       (1) Trade in goods.--The principal negotiating objectives \n     of the United States regarding trade in goods are--\n       (A) to expand competitive market opportunities for exports \n     of goods from the United States and to obtain fairer and more \n     open conditions of trade, including through the utilization \n     of global value chains, by reducing or eliminating tariff and \n     nontariff barriers and policies and practices of foreign \n     governments directly related to trade that decrease market \n     opportunities for United States exports or otherwise distort \n     United States trade; and\n       (B) to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier \n     elimination agreements, including with respect to those \n     tariff categories covered in section 111(b) of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).\n       (2) Trade in services.--(A) The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States regarding trade in services is \n     to expand competitive market opportunities for United States \n     services and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of \n     trade, including through utilization of global value chains, \n     by reducing or eliminating barriers to international trade in \n     services, such as regulatory and other barriers that deny \n     national treatment and market access or unreasonably restrict \n     the establishment or operations of service suppliers.\n       (B) Recognizing that expansion of trade in services \n     generates benefits for all sectors of the economy and \n     facilitates trade, the objective described in subparagraph \n     (A) should be pursued through all means, including through a \n     plurilateral agreement with those countries willing and able \n     to undertake high standard services commitments for both \n     existing and new services.\n       (3) Trade in agriculture.--The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States with respect to agriculture is \n     to obtain competitive opportunities for United States exports \n     of agricultural commodities in foreign markets substantially \n     equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign \n     exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and \n     more open conditions of trade in bulk, specialty crop, and \n     value added commodities by--\n       (A) securing more open and equitable market access through \n     robust rules on sanitary and phytosanitary measures that--\n       (i) encourage the adoption of international standards and \n     require a science-based justification be provided for a \n     sanitary or phytosanitary measure if the measure is more \n     restrictive than the applicable international standard;\n       (ii) improve regulatory coherence, promote the use of \n     systems-based approaches, and appropriately recognize the \n     equivalence of health and safety protection systems of \n     exporting countries;\n       (iii) require that measures are transparently developed and \n     implemented, are based on risk assessments that take into \n     account relevant international guidelines and scientific \n     data, and are not more restrictive on trade than necessary to \n     meet the intended purpose; and\n       (iv) improve import check processes, including testing \n     methodologies and procedures, and certification requirements,\n\n     while recognizing that countries may put in place measures to \n     protect human, animal, or plant life or health in a manner \n     consistent with their international obligations, including \n     the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and \n     Phytosanitary Measures (referred to in section 101(d)(3) of \n     the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(3)));\n       (B) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or \n     other charges that decrease market opportunities for United \n     States exports--\n       (i) giving priority to those products that are subject to \n     significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major \n     producing countries; and\n       (ii) providing reasonable adjustment periods for United \n     States import sensitive products, in close consultation with \n     Congress on such products before initiating tariff reduction \n     negotiations;\n\n[[Page H7274]]\n\n       (C) reducing tariffs to levels that are the same as or \n     lower than those in the United States;\n       (D) reducing or eliminating subsidies that decrease market \n     opportunities for United States exports or unfairly distort \n     agriculture markets to the detriment of the United States;\n       (E) allowing the preservation of programs that support \n     family farms and rural communities but do not distort trade;\n       (F) developing disciplines for domestic support programs, \n     so that production that is in excess of domestic food \n     security needs is sold at world prices;\n       (G) eliminating government policies that create price \n     depressing surpluses;\n       (H) eliminating state trading enterprises whenever \n     possible;\n       (I) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules to \n     eliminate practices that unfairly decrease United States \n     market access opportunities or distort agricultural markets \n     to the detriment of the United States, and ensuring that such \n     rules are subject to efficient, timely, and effective dispute \n     settlement, including--\n       (i) unfair or trade distorting activities of state trading \n     enterprises and other administrative mechanisms, with \n     emphasis on requiring price transparency in the operation of \n     state trading enterprises and such other mechanisms in order \n     to end cross subsidization, price discrimination, and price \n     undercutting;\n       (ii) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial \n     requirements, such as labeling, that affect new technologies, \n     including biotechnology;\n       (iii) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions, \n     including restrictions not based on scientific principles in \n     contravention of obligations in the Uruguay Round Agreements \n     or bilateral or regional trade agreements;\n       (iv) other unjustified technical barriers to trade; and\n       (v) restrictive rules in the administration of tariff rate \n     quotas;\n       (J) eliminating practices that adversely affect trade in \n     perishable or cyclical products, while improving import \n     relief mechanisms to recognize the unique characteristics of \n     perishable and cyclical agriculture;\n       (K) ensuring that import relief mechanisms for perishable \n     and cyclical agriculture are as accessible and timely to \n     growers in the United States as those mechanisms that are \n     used by other countries;\n       (L) taking into account whether a party to the negotiations \n     has failed to adhere to the provisions of already existing \n     trade agreements with the United States or has circumvented \n     obligations under those agreements;\n       (M) taking into account whether a product is subject to \n     market distortions by reason of a failure of a major \n     producing country to adhere to the provisions of already \n     existing trade agreements with the United States or by the \n     circumvention by that country of its obligations under those \n     agreements;\n       (N) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the \n     World Trade Organization have made meaningful market \n     liberalization commitments in agriculture;\n       (O) taking into account the impact that agreements covering \n     agriculture to which the United States is a party have on the \n     United States agricultural industry;\n       (P) maintaining bona fide food assistance programs, market \n     development programs, and export credit programs;\n       (Q) seeking to secure the broadest market access possible \n     in multilateral, regional, and bilateral negotiations, \n     recognizing the effect that simultaneous sets of negotiations \n     may have on United States import sensitive commodities \n     (including those subject to tariff rate quotas);\n       (R) seeking to develop an international consensus on the \n     treatment of seasonal or perishable agricultural products in \n     investigations relating to dumping and safeguards and in any \n     other relevant area;\n       (S) seeking to establish the common base year for \n     calculating the Aggregated Measurement of Support (as defined \n     in the Agreement on Agriculture) as the end of each country's \n     Uruguay Round implementation period, as reported in each \n     country's Uruguay Round market access schedule;\n       (T) ensuring transparency in the administration of tariff \n     rate quotas through multilateral, plurilateral, and bilateral \n     negotiations; and\n       (U) eliminating and preventing the undermining of market \n     access for United States products through improper use of a \n     country's system for protecting or recognizing geographical \n     indications, including failing to ensure transparency and \n     procedural fairness and protecting generic terms.\n       (4) Foreign investment.--Recognizing that United States law \n     on the whole provides a high level of protection for \n     investment, consistent with or greater than the level \n     required by international law, the principal negotiating \n     objectives of the United States regarding foreign investment \n     are to reduce or eliminate artificial or trade distorting \n     barriers to foreign investment, while ensuring that foreign \n     investors in the United States are not accorded greater \n     substantive rights with respect to investment protections \n     than United States investors in the United States, and to \n     secure for investors important rights comparable to those \n     that would be available under United States legal principles \n     and practice, by--\n       (A) reducing or eliminating exceptions to the principle of \n     national treatment;\n       (B) freeing the transfer of funds relating to investments;\n       (C) reducing or eliminating performance requirements, \n     forced technology transfers, and other unreasonable barriers \n     to the establishment and operation of investments;\n       (D) seeking to establish standards for expropriation and \n     compensation for expropriation, consistent with United States \n     legal principles and practice;\n       (E) seeking to establish standards for fair and equitable \n     treatment, consistent with United States legal principles and \n     practice, including the principle of due process;\n       (F) providing meaningful procedures for resolving \n     investment disputes;\n       (G) seeking to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes \n     between an investor and a government through--\n       (i) mechanisms to eliminate frivolous claims and to deter \n     the filing of frivolous claims;\n       (ii) procedures to ensure the efficient selection of \n     arbitrators and the expeditious disposition of claims;\n       (iii) procedures to enhance opportunities for public input \n     into the formulation of government positions;

and\n       (ii) with respect to labor, decisions regarding the \n     distribution of enforcement resources are not a reason for \n     not complying with a party's labor obligations; a party to a \n     trade agreement retains the right to reasonable exercise of \n     discretion and to make bona fide decisions regarding the \n     allocation of resources between labor enforcement activities \n     among core labor standards, provided the exercise of such \n     discretion and such decisions are not inconsistent with its \n     obligations;\n       (C) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading \n     partners to promote respect for core labor standards (as \n     defined in section 111(7));\n       (D) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading \n     partners to protect the environment through the promotion of \n     sustainable development;\n       (E) to reduce or eliminate government practices or policies \n     that unduly threaten sustainable development;\n       (F) to seek market access, through the elimination of \n     tariffs and nontariff barriers, for United States \n     environmental technologies, goods, and services;\n       (G) to ensure that labor, environmental, health, or safety \n     policies and practices of the parties to trade agreements \n     with the United States do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably \n     discriminate against United States exports or serve as \n     disguised barriers to trade;\n       (H) to ensure that enforceable labor and environment \n     obligations are subject to the same dispute settlement and \n     remedies as other enforceable obligations under the \n     agreement; and\n       (I) to ensure that a trade agreement is not construed to \n     empower a party's authorities to undertake labor or \n     environmental law enforcement activities in the territory of \n     the United States.\n       (11) Currency.--The principal negotiating objective of the \n     United States with respect to currency practices is that \n     parties to a trade agreement with the United States avoid \n     manipulating exchange rates in order to prevent effective \n     balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair \n     competitive advantage over other parties to the agreement, \n     such as through cooperative mechanisms, enforceable rules, \n     reporting, monitoring, transparency, or other means, as \n     appropriate.\n       (12) Foreign currency manipulation.--The principal \n     negotiating objective of the United States with respect to \n     unfair currency practices is to seek to establish \n     accountability through enforceable rules, transparency, \n     reporting, monitoring, cooperative mechanisms, or other means \n     to address exchange rate manipulation involving protracted \n     large scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n     markets and a persistently undervalued foreign exchange rate \n     to gain an unfair competitive advantage in trade over other \n     parties to a trade agreement, consistent with existing \n     obligations of the United States as a member of the \n     International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.\n       (13) WTO and multilateral trade agreements.--Recognizing \n     that the World Trade Organization is the foundation of the \n     global trading system, the principal negotiating objectives \n     of the United States regarding the World Trade Organization, \n     the Uruguay Round Agreements, and other multilateral and \n     plurilateral trade agreements are--\n       (A) to achieve full implementation and extend the coverage \n     of the World Trade Organization and multilateral and \n     plurilateral agreements to products, sectors, and conditions \n     of trade not adequately covered;\n       (B) to expand country participation in and enhancement of \n     the Information Technology Agreement, the Government \n     Procurement Agreement, and other plurilateral trade \n     agreements of the World Trade Organization;\n       (C) to expand competitive market opportunities for United \n     States exports and to obtain fairer and more open conditions \n     of trade, including through utilization of global value \n     chains, through the negotiation of new WTO multilateral and \n     plurilateral trade agreements, such as an agreement on trade \n     facilitation;\n       (D) to ensure that regional trade agreements to which the \n     United States is not a party fully achieve the high standards \n     of, and comply with, WTO disciplines, including Article XXIV \n     of GATT 1994, Article V and V bis of the General Agreement on \n     Trade in Services, and the Enabling Clause, including through \n     meaningful WTO review of such regional trade agreements;\n       (E) to enhance compliance by WTO members with their \n     obligations as WTO members through active participation in \n     the bodies of the World Trade Organization by the United \n     States and all other WTO members, including in the trade \n     policy review mechanism and the committee system of the World \n     Trade Organization, and by working to increase the \n     effectiveness of such bodies;

DESIGNATING SMALL HOUSE ROTUNDA AS ``FREEDOM \n                   FOYER''.\n\n       The first floor of the area of the House of Representatives \n     wing of the United States Capitol known as the small House \n     rotunda is designated the ``Freedom Foyer''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the motion \nshall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the \nmajority leader and the minority leader or their designees.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) and the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Van Hollen) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on the further \nconsideration of H.R. 1314, and that I may include tabular material on \nthe same.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today to present the House amendment to the \nSenate amendment to H.R. 1314, the Bipartisan Budget Agreement of 2015, \nan agreement that helps advance this Nation toward our goals of fiscal \nstability, strong national security, and entitlement reform.\n  These are goals that we have been advocating for years, ones that \nwill secure significant long-term savings, provide our economy with the \ncertainty needed to grow and prosper, and ensure the readiness of our \nmilitary to meet current and emerging threats.\n  First, this agreement prevents the economic damage of a default, \nwhich could happen as early as next week, by suspending the debt limit \nthrough March 2017.\n  Next, the agreement includes the first significant reform to Social \nSecurity since 1983. These structural reforms will help maintain the \nsolvency of vital Social Security trust funds by closing loopholes, \nincreasing program integrity, and cracking down on fraud, resulting in \n$168 billion in long-term savings. The agreement also finds savings in \nother mandatory programs, including over $30 billion in Medicare \nentitlement savings.\n  As I have said many, many times before--and I have heard it said many \ntimes by others here on the floor--mandatory and entitlement programs \nmake up two-thirds of the Nation's budget and are the primary drivers \nof our deficits and our debt. In fact, we have saved $195 billion on \ndiscretionary spending in these last 4 years. In the meantime, the \nentitlement-mandatory side of the budget continues to zoom skyward.\n  Reforms to these programs are necessary and overdue, and I hope that \nthis bill today paves the way for additional action in the future.\n  This bill also repeals a flawed provision of the President's \nhealthcare law, eliminating the automatic enrollment mandate that \nforces workers into employer-sponsored healthcare coverage that they \nmay not want or need.\n  Finally--and, in my opinion, most importantly--this agreement \nprovides for new top-line spending caps for the next 2 years. This will \nroll back the harmful, automatic, meat-ax approach of sequestration \ncuts which gut important Federal programs and slice the good with the \nbad, including slicing into our military strength.\n  A 2-year plan, why is that so important? Well, it provides much-\nneeded certainty to the appropriations process and to the Defense \nDepartment and all the other agencies of the government, ensuring our \nability to make thoughtful, responsible funding decisions over that \ntime.\n  Having established agreed-upon, top-line numbers for both fiscal 2016 \nand 2017 will allow Congress to do its work on behalf of the American \npeople and avoid a harmful government shutdown or the threat thereof. \nThis is particularly crucial when it comes to our national security. It \nprovides the Pentagon with the certainty needed to plan for the future, \nmaintain readiness, and provide for our troops.\n  These adjustments are fully offset by mandatory spending cuts and \nother savings, not through tax increases, as the administration \nproposed in its budget submission earlier this year.\n  These new levels do not undermine our remarkable success in limiting \nFederal discretionary spending. Since 2011, as I have said before, we \nhave reduced discretionary spending--that is what we appropriate here \non the floor--by $175 billion. We remain on track to save taxpayers \nmore than $2 trillion if you extrapolate those numbers through 2024.\n  With passage of this important agreement, my committee stands ready, \ncoiled, poised to implement the details of this deal, going line by \nline through budgets and making the tough, but necessary, decisions to \nfund the entire government in a responsible way.\n  We will begin work with our Senate counterparts as soon as this bill \nis signed.\n  We have our eye on the December 11 deadline, and it is my goal to \ncomplete our appropriations work ahead of that date to avoid any more \ndelays, continuing resolutions, or shutdown showdowns that hurt \nimportant Federal programs, our economy, and, coincidentally, the trust \nof the people in the Congress.\n\n[[Page H7303]]\n\n  I want to thank and commend our leaders for their courage, their \ntenacity, and their resolve. While I know that this deal is not \nperfect, there are things I would change if I had the chance. The \nprocess by which it emerged is less than ideal. I believe, still, it is \nin the best interest of the country that we move forward with this \narrangement.\n  This agreement takes steps in the right direction, from finding \nsavings in our entitlement programs to protecting our economy from a \ndangerous default, to providing for the future of the Nation through \nfunding certainty.\n  These are goals that I believe we can all get behind. So I ask my \ncolleagues to support this bipartisan agreement today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to start by joining the comments of the \nchairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Mr. Rogers, in \ncongratulating all those who came together to iron out their \ndifferences and produce this agreement.\n  It is not a perfect agreement, but it is far better than the \nalternative, the alternative which we would have seen which would have \nproduced great damage to the economy, as opposed to this agreement, \nwhich will help boost economic growth and make important national \ninvestments.\n  What a difference a week makes, Madam Speaker. Just last week, we had \non the floor of this House a bill that would have jeopardized the full \nfaith and credit of the United States. It was a piece of legislation \nthat says the United States Government only has to pay some of its \nbills, doesn't have to pay all of its bills. That would have been an \nawful precedent that would have put the economy at risk.\n  Even worse, it said, well, when we decide which bills we are going to \npay, we are first going to pay all the bondholders, like China and the \nfolks on Wall Street, rather than our soldiers and our veterans and the \ndoctors who provide Medicare to our seniors. I am glad we have gotten \nbeyond that, Madam Speaker.\n  This will ensure the full faith and credit of the United States. It \nwill also lift the very damaging sequester caps that have been put in \nplace that, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, \nwere going to slow down economic growth over the next couple years.\n  Instead, we are going to be able to make some vital investments in \nkey areas: in education, in scientific research, in transportation, and \nin military readiness. Now, I know those decisions are going to be left \nto Mr. Rogers and the appropriators, and I wish them all the best in \nmaking those decisions. I hope we come back by mid-December with an \nagreement to go forward without further threats of government shutdown.\n  This agreement at least provides the room and space to make those \nimportant investments. It also prevents a looming 20 percent cut in \nSocial Security disability benefits and provides that reassurance to \nmillions of Americans who otherwise would have been on the edge.\n  It prevents what would have been a whopping increase in Medicare part \nB premiums for millions of seniors around this country, who would have \nbeen stretched extremely thin and probably not been able to make all \ntheir payments--whether they were mortgage payments, rent payments, or \nfood payments--at the same time they were facing those huge Medicare \npart B premium increases. So that was addressed as well.\n  Now, like Mr. Rogers, there are lots of things that I would like to \nhave seen in this bill that are not included; but on balance, this is \nan important step forward, certainly a great improvement over where we \nwere just a week ago.\n  So, again, I want to express my gratitude to everybody who helped \nmake this possible.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the distinguished chairman of the \nHouse Committee on Rules.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, last night in the Committee on Rules we \nlooked at this bill. We talked about it and its importance to the \nNation.\n  Madam Speaker, first let me say that this is an agreement between the \nWhite House, the Senate, and the House. This is an agreement that we \ncan move forward on and avoid many destructive things that might have \nhappened not only to the American people and the economy, but, really, \nour own credibility. Our ability to work together at this very careful \ntime is important so that we show the American people that this can \nhappen.\n  There are a lot of things that I agree and disagree with that were \nsaid. First of all, harm the economy? Good gosh, when you only have a 1 \npercent GDP growth, the President has already done that with massive \ntax increases. The President has done that with rules and regulations. \nWe are trying to make sure that what we are doing in this bill is to \nstick to the Republican plan.\n  What is the Republican plan? It has been--going into our sixth year--\nthat we are going to hold government spending flat. We do that \nessentially not only with a CR, which we will do again in a few weeks, \nbut through effective use of sequestration. What we have done is been \nable to take the sequestration dollars and to utilize them in such a \nway that, as the chairman was speaking about, we are pulling in \nmandatory spending.\n  We believe, after 5 years of staying flat with government spending, \nthat we are in a more dangerous world than ever, and our military must \nhave more money, our security operations must have more money. What we \nare going to do is to look at the entire process, come up with an idea \nabout bringing in more money that funds our security, that funds our \nmilitary, and offsets that so that we can do this by looking at long-\nterm mandatory spending that will bring in over 170 billion dollars' \nworth of savings over the mirror that we look at, over the timeframe \nthat is important for the American people to have confidence that we \nwill not bankrupt this country and that we can continue.\n  Now, the bottom line to this whole exercise is that what we have done \nis worked together. Working together, we now have a plan to move \nforward; and we will simply go to the next exercise, and that is \nfunding the government for the year.\n  The Republican plan is simple. We are not going to give this \ngovernment one extra penny to put us into a bankruptcy circumstance, \nbut we are asking also, back, that the President of the United States \ngive us an opportunity to grow our economy. Taxes are too high, and we \nhave too many rules and regulations; but the Republican Party will \nstick to our plan, and that is what we are doing here.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), the distinguished ranking member \nof the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, first and foremost, this bill takes the \nimportant step of protecting the full faith and credit of the United \nStates. We will pay our obligations--and not only to foreign \nbondholders, but to our citizens, whether veterans or our children--\nunlike the Republican majority bill last week.\n  It protects millions of seniors from a 50 percent increase in their \nmonthly Medicare part B premiums and spreads out the cost of paying for \nthe fix over a number of years. It ensures that all 11 million \nAmericans that rely on Social Security disability insurance won't see \ntheir benefits cut by 20 percent. It is fiscally responsible, while not \nundermining or changing the structure of vital programs in any way.\n  Let me repeat that. It is fiscally responsible, while not undermining \nor changing the structure of vital programs in any way.\n  It ensures, in Social Security, a uniform national process for \ndisability evaluations, and it closes a loophole used mostly by higher \nincome individuals to receive higher Social Security benefits than \nintended. It regularizes payments in Medicare for care given in \noutpatient facilities.\n  Finally, the agreement raises the spending caps for 2 years for \ndomestic\n\n[[Page H7304]]\n\nspending, not only for defense priorities, as some have earlier \nproposed. I just want to repeat that so it is clear. The agreement \nraises the spending caps for 2 years for both domestic and defense \nspending. That means we can better fund critical domestic programs that \nwere cut under sequestration, increasing support for education, health \nresearch, food safety, job training, and health care for veterans.\n  This was a product of a lot of effort, of Members, of staff in \nvarious committees, the leadership on a bipartisan basis working with \nthe administration. I just want to leave expressing my support and \nexpressing we will truly have a broad, bipartisan vote for this bill \ntoday.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen), the distinguished \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Defense of the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Madam Speaker, I will be brief.\n  I rise in support of the agreement before us this afternoon.\n  Madam Speaker, as my colleagues are aware, the Department of Defense \nand the intelligence community have borne the brunt of our efforts to \nreduce the budget deficit and control our burgeoning national debt. \nUnder the Budget Control Act of 2011, roughly half of all the \ndiscretionary spending reductions were taken from programs in the \nnational security area.\n  My colleagues, 2011 was a different time. The security environment \nhas changed significantly. Since that time, threats from terrorist \ngroups and nation-states have risen dramatically. The security spending \nreductions envisioned 4 years ago seem extremely unwise and dangerous \ntoday.\n  In this agreement, the Department of Defense will receive additional \nresources, badly needed resources: $30 billion this year, and $15 \nbillion next year. But almost more important, this agreement gives the \nPentagon and our intelligence community predictability, certainty, the \nability to organize and plan its activities for 2 years. It also gives \nour soldiers and their families a degree of certainty that they will be \nsupported as they do the work of freedom.\n  Senior leaders of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines--and the \nDepartment itself--will now be able to plan as to how they will \nconfigure, equip, train, sustain, and deploy our forces in the most \neffective and efficient manner possible. This ability will result in \nbudget savings and a more effective fighting force.\n  Madam Speaker, this agreement is by no means perfect, but this \nagreement does require support because it provides predictable funding \nfor our Nation's security at a time of changing and growing defense. \nEvery Member ought to support it.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom the great State of Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the very distinguished \nranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Bipartisan \nBudget Agreement.\n  I am very encouraged that this agreement includes provisions from my \nbill, H.R. 2391, the Medicaid Generic Drug Price Fairness Act, which I \nintroduced back on May 18. My legislation requires generic drug \nmanufacturers to provide rebates to Medicaid when they raise prices \nfaster than the rate of inflation.\n  My legislation will help Americans get lifesaving prescriptions they \nneed. It will save $1 billion over 10 years, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Just this morning, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation issued a \nreport finding that this issue, the skyrocketing prices of prescription \ndrugs, is the number one healthcare priority for the American people. \nThe report found that 77 percent of those surveyed, including \nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents, identified the issue as their \ntop health concern overall.\n  This legislation is a strong and welcome step to help keep drugs \naffordable, but we must do more. We need to investigate drug companies \nthat are taking advantage of the American people by jacking up their \nprices just to boost corporate profits and make their executives rich.\n  Over the past month, press reports have been filled with almost daily \naccounts of drug company executives trying to justify the obscene price \nincreases while lining their pockets. My colleagues may have heard \nabout the so-called ``pharma bro'' Martin Shkreli, who increased the \nprice of a drug that treats life-threatening infections from about $14 \nto $750 overnight. He then called his price gouging ``a great thing for \nsociety.''\n  My colleagues also may have heard about Michael Pearson, the CEO of \nValeant Pharmaceuticals, which increased the prices of two drugs used \nto treat heart failure and hypertension by 212 percent and 525 percent \non the same day it acquired them. This company is currently obstructing \ncongressional oversight and refusing to provide documents relating to \nits increases.\n  I am very pleased to support this budget bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of it.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the distinguished chairman of \nthe House Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker, if one takes into account the effects \nof inflation, we cut our military budget 21 percent from 2010 to 2014.\n  Madam Speaker, I think everybody in this body will acknowledge the \nworld is not 21 percent safer today than it was just 4 years ago.\n  As a matter of fact, if you look around the world, whether it is the \ngrowth of ISIS into more countries or the continued challenge of al \nQaeda and its various affiliates, to the morass of Syria with historic \nRussian re-insertion today, to China building islands in the South \nPacific, to North Korea's saber rattling, to Iran intentionally \nviolating an agreement it made on its missile testing just after the \nU.S. ratified the nuclear deal, to daily cyber attacks, the world is \ngrowing increasingly dangerous.\n  Into that danger we send men and women who wear the uniform of the \nUnited States to meet that danger. Yet, we cut their budget 21 percent.\n  We saw last week the President of the United States used them as a \npolitical bargaining chip to try to force Congress to comply with his \ndomestic agenda.\n  The bottom line for me, Madam Speaker, is our troops deserve better \nthan that. That is the reason I support this Bipartisan Budget Act of \n2014. It stops the cuts in defense.\n  It increases the money going to our troops. It prevents them from \nbeing used as a bargaining chip in the future because it sets the \nmilitary budget for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 so that that \nis decided. They can't be used as leverage for some other agenda. I \nthink that is the sort of stability and predictability they need and \nthat they deserve.\n  I think the great question, Madam Speaker, is: If not this, then \nwhat?\n  We know that this budget agreement at least comes close to meeting \nwhat the President has asked for on defense and comes close to the \nCongressional budget, within $5 billion.\n  Now, that is not enough money to repair all the damage that has been \ndone over the past 5 years, but it is in the ball park. If we do not \napprove this budget, then what?\n  Well, then we are back to continuing resolutions and sequester, which \nmeans, for example, the Army has said they will have to cut another \n40,000 troops out of their ranks on top of the 70,000 they have already \ncut.\n  Now, that is just a sampling of what not passing this bill could well \nmean. If we go back to CRs and the sequester level, it would be drastic \nreductions to the military, a much less safe world for the United \nStates and its interests.\n  I believe that this measure, on that basis alone, deserves our \nsupport.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I agree with the gentleman that the investments in military readiness \nare important. I also believe the investments to help our economy grow \nand invest in education and scientific research are important.\n  What the President said to the Congress is what the vast majority of \nthe American public believed, that it is\n\n[[Page H7305]]\n\nvital to have a strong national defense. But a strong national defense \nrequires a strong economy. It requires an educated workforce. It \nrequires investments in innovation and technology. It requires a 21st \ncentury infrastructure.\n  So I am pleased that the President insisted that we make investments \nnot just in the military, but also vital investments to help the \neconomy grow, grow more jobs, which are estimated to be in the range of \n350,000 in 2016 alone. So those are vital investments that also help \nstrengthen America.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York \n(Mrs. Lowey), somebody who has been on the front lines of making those \nimportant investments for our country, the very distinguished ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, as ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I rise to support this bipartisan legislation that ensures \nthe full faith and credit of the United States and sets a path to a \nresponsible appropriations process this year and next.\n  Since the beginning of this year's appropriations process, Democrats \nhave called for relief from damaging, austerity-level budget caps so \nCongress can invest in our Nation's future.\n  Unfortunately, the majority's budget resolution and appropriation \nbills would have strangled economic growth and not met our Nation's \nneeds with cuts to Pell Grants that help families pay college tuition \nand law enforcement grants, for example. The list goes on and on.\n  From the start of the appropriations process, I urged my majority \ncolleagues to negotiate reasonable spending caps that protect our \neconomy and national priorities.\n  I am pleased these talks finally happened and resulted in this \nbipartisan package that provides an additional $40 billion for defense, \n$40 billion for non-defense, over 2 years. These investments are \ncritical.\n  Upon its passage, I look forward to working together in a similarly \nresponsible manner to reach bipartisan consensus on the spending bills \nto avoid a government shutdown in mid-December.\n  I urge passage of this bill so we can immediately begin our \nappropriations work, already overdue.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, may I inquire of the time \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 15\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Maryland has 19 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Transportation and Housing and Urban Development.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I thank the chairman.\n  Madam Speaker, I, in essence, only want to make four brief points. \nNumber one is that, I, too, have concerns with lots of parts of this \nbill. There are parts that I wish were different. I think all of us do. \nBut there are a number of reasons why I think it is important that we \nmove forward on this legislation.\n  Number one, this helps avoid a devastating hit to senior citizens in \nthe district that I represent and, frankly, senior citizens across the \nentire country that deserve to be protected by those of us that \nrepresent them up here in Washington.\n  Number two, when we are able to move forward on the appropriations \nprocess, which this legislation will allow us to do, that is a way that \nallows every Member of this House to have input. Every Member of this \nHouse has been part of that process.\n  So for those of us who believe in regular order and inclusiveness and \nin making sure that every Member has a word and a say as to how we move \nforward, this bill will allow us to move forward on that very open \nprocess.\n  Lastly--and we have heard this before--it is no secret that the world \nhas gotten a lot more dangerous, and you have heard the numbers. We are \ndevastating our military at a time when we are asking them to do more \nand more and when the world is becoming more and more dangerous.\n\n  So let me just leave with this last, final point. Are we going to \nallow our military to continue to receive cuts at a time when they \nshould actually be helped and should actually have increased spending \nor are we going to permit the devastating of our men and women in \nuniform, of the U.S. military, at this time in our history?\n  My dear friends, I, for one, am not going to sit back, if I can do \nanything about it, and allow the U.S. military to be devastated by more \nbudget cuts.\n  So, therefore, I respectfully urge a ``yes'' vote on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), a distinguished member of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time.\n  I plan on voting for this bill, but I am not here to pound and \ncelebrate that.\n  It does things that are good. It lifts the debt ceiling and puts us \nin a position where we don't have to fear defaulting on America's \ndebts. It avoids ruinous cuts in Medicare part B, and disability \ninsurance benefit cuts won't go down.\n  But the fact is no one here, no one in this room, can say that this \npiece of legislation that we are looking at now is going to advance \nAmerica, bring us progress that we actually really need.\n  Do you know that, since 2012, we have seen 640 fewer National \nInstitutes of Health grants? We haven't been making the investments we \nneed in embassy security, housing, health care, education. We are not \nadvancing America.\n  This is not a progress budget. This is a survival budget. And we need \nto survive; so, I'm going to vote for this piece of legislation.\n  But we must come to the moment in time when we are looking to advance \nour country, to move forward and offer real leadership to the world, \nrather than just obsessing over how much we can cut and how much we can \ntake.\n  The fact is that the Progressive Caucus offered a budget. It meets \nour minimal conditions, but it doesn't advance our real progress that \nwe need.\n  We have principles that we have been talking about that are about \npushing this country forward: child nutrition, affordable care, college \neducation, housing, transit. This is what is going to make our country \nstrong.\n  This budget keeps us above water, keeps us from defaulting on our \ndebts, and that is a good thing. But can't we do more?\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Issa).\n  Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I am a member of the majority.\n  When the majority brings a bill to the floor, you normally start off \nwith ``yes'' and hope to stay there. In this case, I started off with \n``likely'' and didn't arrive at a ``yes.'' So, reluctantly, I am going \nto vote ``no'' on this bill.\n  I am not going to vote ``no'' because of what it seeks to do. I am \ncertainly not going to vote ``no'' knowing that we need to fund our \ntroops in the field in a war that has dragged on for 15 years and now \nhas re-ignited.\n  But I am going to vote ``no'' because of how this bill is paid for. I \nhave done as much as I can as long as I can to tolerate how we \n``score'' things.\n  At the risk of being wrong, I will remind people that I am only as \ngood as the information that my staff has given me. But according to \nCBO, $2.5 billion worth of this pay-for comes from premium payments \nthat are accelerated, meaning we are robbing from the future to pay for \ntoday.\n  Another one comes from extended pension smoothing, $9 billion. This \nis a time-shifting on money over 10 years. Again, we are robbing from \nthe future to pay for this year.\n  Another one, $4 billion, comes from Social Security disability. But \nit is a double count. It has already been scored elsewhere previously.\n  And $5 billion comes from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This will \nbe the third time this year that we have brought a bill saying we are \ngoing to sell this oil at its low price.\n  Ultimately, the real question is: Aren't we selling off an asset \ntoday to pay for current expenses?\n  $3.5 billion will come from FCC bandwidth sales. I can live with \nthat. I'm not thrilled with it. I think we should make more bandwidth \navailable to the public so that, in fact, space we can all use without \npaying would be available.\n  But here is the one that really broke me: Extending the Medicare \nsequester\n\n[[Page H7306]]\n\nrate saves $14 billion, but the one-time saving is based on an \noccurrence in the year 2025.\n  So, in closing, Madam Speaker, I will not sell our future for this \nyear's budget; and, therefore, I recommend a ``no'' because of the pay-\nfors on this budget.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Vermont (Mr. Welch), somebody who has been very focused on making \nsure we keep the full faith and credit of the United States.\n  Mr. WELCH. I thank the gentleman.\n  Madam Speaker, there are a few reasons why this agreement deserves \nour support:\n  First, it is good public policy. This finally unleashes the shackles \nof the sequester that have prevented Congress from making decisions \nand, instead, just had across-the-board cuts. The gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Rogers) is going to have an opportunity for his \nAppropriations Committee--Republicans and Democrats--to do its job.\n  Second, it averts enormous increases in Medicare part B premiums.\n  Third, it keeps Social Security disability funds solvent through \n2022, and there are a number of other things.\n  The second major reason why this is so important is this: It is an \nagreement. We have finally come together, through the leadership of \nSpeaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi, to legislate. We have been part of a \nlegislative body that is on strike, that hasn't legislated. We cannot \nunderestimate the power that is unleashed by the capacity of this \nCongress to give certainty to the American people and to our agencies \nas to what comes ahead and what they have to do.\n  Secondly, what Speaker Boehner did--and I am so indebted to him, as \nall of us should be--is that he took out of the hands of those of us in \nCongress two weapons which, when used, are very destructive, and those \nare: the threat of shutting the government down, and the threat of \ndefaulting on America's full faith and credit. We can't do that.\n  And Speaker Boehner, to his credit, when there was the Planned \nParenthood dispute about funding and he was in favor of cutting \nfunding, he opposed shutting down government to achieve that goal.\n  We have suspended the debt ceiling through 2017, which means this \nbody is going to have not just the opportunity, but the responsibility \nto do its job.\n  Finally, what we have seen here, when Speaker Boehner reached out to \nLeader Pelosi, is that he had in the minority leader a willing partner \nwho was willing to sit down, work hard, and reach an agreement. That \nsets the foundation for progress ahead.\n  I wish the best success to Speaker-to-be Ryan. He has willing and \nable partners in the whole Caucus to make progress for America.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford), the distinguished former \nGovernor of South Carolina, who is a Member of this great body.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Madam Speaker, I will say to the chairman from Kentucky \nthat I am absolutely sympathetic in the way that he and others in the \nleadership are really caught between a rock and a hard place.\n  If you think about 100 members of the defense community saying, \n``Wait a minute. We won't vote for it unless we get more there''; folks \nin the AG community saying, ``We don't like this particular \nprovision''; advocates of Medicare saying, ``We have got to have a bit \nmore here,'' the realities of a debt ceiling, a President who said, ``A \nclean ceiling or nothing at all,'' I mean, they really have been \nbetween a rock and a hard place.\n  But that having been said, we are still left at the end of the day \nwith a $1.5 trillion problem that has grown on top of an $18 trillion \nproblem; and I, therefore, believe that the simple notion is the key to \ngetting out of a hole is to quit digging. Fundamentally, I believe that \nthis bill does more digging than not. And I say that from three \ndifferent points:\n  One, there is a process question. In fairness to the chairman and \nothers, in some ways, this was handed to them, and I think that there \nare serious questions that any of us should have with regard to \nprocess.\n  Two, it does remove the caps. As draconian as they are, they \nrepresent the only piece of financial restraint in Washington, D.C., \nthat has encumbered this entity. That, I think, has a lot to do with \nthe fiscal restraint that we have seen on domestic discretionary \nspending.\n  And finally, as my colleague from California just pointed out, there \nis borrowing from Peter to pay for Paul. And if you look at where \ndisability insurance is getting money from the standpoint of old age \nsurvivors, if you look at the bandwidth question, if you look at the \nstrategic oil question, if you look at pension smoothing and a whole \nnumber of other areas, you are left with this larger question of this \nstill does not solve the problem of this upward trajectory that we have \nwith regard to spending in this place.\n  Therefore, I would remind everyone of what Admiral Mike Mullen said, \nwho is the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said that \nthe greatest threat to our civilization was the national debt. At the \nend of the day, this bill compounds it; and for that reason, I would \nrespectfully encourage a ``no.''\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), a distinguished member of the Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, today's effort is a moment of satisfaction \nbut not delectation. This stands before us as a testament that Congress \ncannot be dictated to by a minority of the majority. This institution \ncannot work based upon the principle that a minority of the majority \ncan dictate the outcome of legislative life.\n  I am glad we are finding common ground and common purpose. It is \nsimilar to the Congress that I joined a lot of years ago.\n  But rather than a moment of gloating, we should all take a look at \nwhat has happened to the process that once governed this institution. \nAnd my plea to the new Speaker of the House is going to be: Remember \nthat the committee system is the vertebra of Congress. It is within the \nstructure of the committee system that we find the way forward.\n  And to Speaker Boehner, a good man and a good friend who leaves here \nin the next couple of days, congratulations, as well as to Leader \nPelosi, Leader McConnell, and Leader Reid. But the sad commentary is \nthis could never have happened if they didn't take it upon themselves \nto do the actual negotiation. The polarization in this institution \nwould have prevented that.\n  We cannot keep taking America to the financial precipice. We need \nsome predictability, some confidence in building the economy. By \nembracing this proposal, we allow that opportunity to perhaps happen. \nWe take default off the table. The full faith and credit of the United \nStates will not be impugned. We will not allow the country to be \nhijacked by extremist views.\n  I say to those here, that small number that want to dictate the \noutcome of what happens in this institution: Pay some attention to the \nskill and the art of legislating as opposed to just the talking points \nthat lend themselves to the incendiary commentary that flows from this \ninstitution now. Work with both sides to try to find an outcome that \nthe American people can look at as having accomplished with some pride.\n  We look at this institution with great regard, and what has happened \nto it is a shameful exercise in allowing this rule that prevents us \nfrom moving forward because of the advances that are made by a minority \nof the majority.\n\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and his hard \nwork over the years on the budget.\n  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to stand today to support this agreement. \nIt allows us to limp along. There is no shutdown for now. We avoid the \ndamage of default. There is a slight relaxation in sequestration. There \nis equity for seniors and the disabled.\n  There was a time when many of these provisions would not necessarily \nbe a cause for celebration, but it is today.\n\n[[Page H7307]]\n\nThis is a signal accomplishment for stability.\n  I take my hat off to Speaker Boehner, Leader Pelosi, the Senate \nleadership, and the President and his team for delivering an agreement \nthat came together for Congress at relatively warp speed, working \nbehind the scenes for days. It wins the House some breathing space, not \nlurching from crisis to crisis, and I hope that we take advantage of \nthis achievement.\n  This was an important week here on Capitol Hill:\n  We have made a transition on the Republican side with a new Speaker, \na friend that I respect and admire, the gentleman from Wisconsin, Paul \nRyan. I look forward to working with him.\n  It was important that the House was able to work its will on the Ex-\nIm Bank. We found a piece of legislation supported not just \noverwhelmingly by the House, but by a majority of Republicans, bottled \nup in committee by a minority, and it broke loose. I think that is \nimportant.\n  I hope this breathing room allows us to do one other thing, and that \nis to prioritize our budget requirements. We are going to spend over $1 \ntrillion in the years ahead on nuclear weapons that we cannot afford to \nuse and can't afford to buy. We can do better for the American people, \nand I hope this agreement allows us to do so.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Fattah), a distinguished member of the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Speaker, I am one who comes to this floor to \nsupport this agreement. It means the great work that we are doing on \nthe Appropriations Committee--working with my colleagues, like Chairman \nRogers and Tom Cole from Oklahoma--the work we are doing on brain \nhealth-related issues, the creation of a process to map the human \nbrain, to create a national brain observatory, to help lead the world \nin an area in which we can finally find answers to a whole range of \ndiseases going forward. We will be able to move our appropriations \nbills on a whole range of issues--from youth mentoring, to housing, to \nhealth care--because the Congress and its leadership have come \ntogether.\n  So I commend both sides, and I commend the White House. I am pleased \nthat this agreement has happened.\n  Yesterday I announced a $10 million TIGER grant for Philadelphia. \nThis agreement means that there will be other Members who will be \nmaking said announcements out in the future because we will be doing \nthe work that helps keep America number one in the world.\n  For all of our challenges, we have the most powerful Nation in the \nworld. This agreement helps to move us forward, and I am here to \napplaud it and to vote in favor of it.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Pelosi), somebody who knows how to lead, who knows \nhow to get things done, who knows how to find common ground, and who \nwas a vital part of bringing us to the progress we are making today, \nthe Democratic leader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) for \nyielding and for his kind words, and I return the compliment to him.\n  To the staff of the Budget Committee, the staff of the other \ncommittees of jurisdiction on both sides of the aisle who enabled this \nimportant agreement to come forward, thank you very much.\n  Madam Speaker, today we are proud to come to the floor with \nlegislation that moves America forward, affirming the full faith and \ncredit of the United States of America, as our Constitution says should \nnever be in doubt, and passing a budget agreement that creates jobs, \nprotects seniors, and invests in our future.\n  Today we cast our votes for a bipartisan budget package that \nrepresents significant progress for hardworking American families.\n  Throughout the budget process, I am proud that Democrats have been \nunited by our values and our determination to win progress for those \nhardworking American families. We showed we had the votes and the \nresolve to sustain the President's vetoes of funding bills that did not \nmeet the needs of those people.\n  Working with our Republican colleagues on a compromise enabled us at \nlong last to bring to the floor a bill, a bill with which we have \nbroken the sequester stranglehold on our national defense and our \ninvestments in good-paying jobs and the future of America.\n  In this agreement before the House, we achieve equal funding; we \nhonor the principle of parity between defense and domestic priorities. \nWe achieve equal funding increases for defense and domestic \ninitiatives, amounting to $112 billion over the next 2 years. We \nprevent a 20 percent cut in disability benefits for millions of people \nin 2016 and extend the solvency of the Social Security Disability \nInsurance program. We prevent a drastic increase in Medicare part B \npremiums and deductibles for millions of seniors next year. And we \naffirm the full faith and credit of the United States is nonnegotiable \nand unbreakable, with a clean debt limit suspension.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  We push through the gridlock to provide more economic certainty and, \naccording to the Council of Economic Advisers, create an additional \n340,000 jobs in 2016 alone.\n  Budget and senior groups and groups for disability are lining up in \nstrong support of this agreement. As AARP wrote to congressional \nleaders--I'm sure you saw this, Mr. Rogers, and thank you for your \ncourageous support of this legislation, our great chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee--AARP wrote, ``AARP strongly supports the \nbipartisan agreement you have reached to avert deep reductions in \nSocial Security Disability Insurance benefits in 2016, and to address \nthe imminent spike in Medicare Part B premiums which many older \nAmericans would otherwise experience. Your efforts to reach across the \naisle and together find sensible solutions to significant problems are \nappreciated and commended.''\n  Working together, Madam Speaker, Democrats and Republicans, we have \nfound a way forward for the American people. I thank the Republican \nleadership for their partnership in reaching this agreement.\n  Again, I thank the staffs of the committees of jurisdiction: the \nBudget Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, the Appropriations \nCommittee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and others. I commend our \ncolleagues for speaking out on this important agreement.\n  Let us pass this agreement. Let's vote ``yes'' today together. Let us \npass this agreement, move swiftly to keep government open, and make \nprogress for the American people.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I hope it is a big strong \none.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, might I inquire of the \ngentleman how many speakers he has remaining?\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I have about four more speakers.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Hoyer). He is somebody who has been a key leader on \nbudget and fiscal issues, someone from the great State of Maryland, and \nour distinguished Democratic whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlelady.\n  I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding. I thank him for his \noutstanding leadership as ranking member of the Budget Committee on \nfiscal stability and fiscal responsibility and his willingness to lead \nin ensuring that America invests in its future.\n  I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I think I quote \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee as much as I quote any \nother Member: Unrealistic and ill-advised. Those two words of his \nrelating to the sequester are emblazoned on my frontal lobe, and I \nthank him for that statement.\n  Madam Speaker, this agreement represents a bipartisan effort to \nprevent a catastrophic default and lessen the chance of a government \nshutdown in December--lessens the chance. It doesn't preclude it. It \nshows what is possible when Democrats and Republicans work together to \nget something done in a bipartisan way.\n\n[[Page H7308]]\n\n  This has been a unique week. The Export-Import Bank passed with a \nmajority of Republicans and an overwhelmingly majority--all but one--of \nDemocrats. This is going to pass, in my view, with overwhelming numbers \nof Republicans and overwhelming numbers of Democrats voting for it. \nThat is what Americans want, and that is what they expect. They want us \nto work together, not always agree with one other, but to work \ntogether.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill replaces the sequester, that ill-advised \npolicy that is hurting our country. It replaces it for 2 years and does \nso with parity for defense and non-defense sequester relief. It \nprotects Medicare part B beneficiaries from seeing higher premiums, and \nit saves the Social Security Disability Insurance program from \ninsolvency. All of those are worthwhile objectives.\n  This legislation will give us a chance to work on a long-term \nsolution to our fiscal challenges over the next 2 years. This \nagreement, like Ryan-Murray, is a short-term agreement, and the end of \nit comes sooner than we expect.\n  Congress ought not to wait until this agreement is about to expire 2 \nyears from now to act. We should get to work right now on a big, \nbipartisan deal to put America's fiscal house back in order and enable \nour Nation to afford investments in a stronger economic future.\n  Americans are not looking for a rickety bridge to 2017, but a sturdy \none that can carry us into a stronger economic future. Businesses \nacross the country are clamoring for long-term certainty, for Congress \nto find a way to replace the sequester and remove the uncertainty that \nit has created and continues to create.\n  So I hope, Madam Speaker, the history that is written about this \nlegislation is that it was a bipartisan first step towards securing the \nkind of long-term agreement all of us know we must achieve.\n  I had the opportunity to serve with Mr. Rogers for a couple of \ndecades on the Appropriations Committee. He and I have served in this \nCongress together for a long period of time.\n  He is a responsible leader in the Congress of the United States, and \nI quote him because his perspective and mine are the same--although we \ndiffer on many issues--and it is that we owe it to the American people, \nwe owe it to America, and we owe it to future generations to create the \nfiscal stability that will allow the Appropriations Committee, very \nfrankly, to again become the center of decisionmaking, which it was for \nmany of the years that I served on it.\n\n  Too often now we ignore the Appropriations Committee whose job is to \nset priorities and to apply the resources of our country to those \npriority items. If we don't adhere to that process, that will not \nhappen.\n  Madam Speaker, in closing, we need to get a long-term fiscal \nresolution. This is a short term. I will support it. It is good for the \ncountry. But we need a long-term solution. I thank the chairman, and I \nthank the ranking member, Mr. Van Hollen, my friend, who has done such \na terrific job.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Ranking Member, let me thank you. And to the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, let me thank you as well.\n  This was a tough call. And I do want to thank the leadership, Speaker \nBoehner, and our leadership, Leader Pelosi, Whip Hoyer, and, of course, \nour ranking member of the Budget Committee, and the Ways and Means \nleadership as well. This is an important step forward because I can say \nto my constituents: We fixed some of your pain and your anguish.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill quickly provides $80 billion, but I am so \ngrateful that part of that deals with the plussing up of non-defense \ndiscretionary funding: child care, National Institutes of Health, and \nother very important issues.\n  My seniors, I think it is very important to note that your Medicare \npremium part B will not go up in a 50 percent increase in 2016 and \nthere will be less deep cuts in Social Security, more jobs being \ncreated, and as well we will have the opportunities, as I indicated, to \nincrease NIH funding.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional \n10 seconds.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. What we must be careful of is that we do not \nincrease any mandatory minimums and some of the penalties that are in \nplace, and we must be careful that we do protect Social Security and \nMedicare. We will continue to monitor this for a budget that will lift \nthe debt ceiling until 2017 and have this country stand on its feet and \npay its bills.\n  Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding and I rise to \nspeak on the rule and the underlying legislation, which is the Senate \nAmendment to H.R. 1314, the ``Bipartisan Budget Agreement of 2015.''\n  The bill before us is not perfect--far from it--but it is a modest \nand positive step toward preventing Republicans from shutting down the \ngovernment again and manufacturing crises that only harm our economy, \ndestroy jobs, and weaken our middle class.\n  I have reviewed the agreement carefully and have concluded that on \nbalance the good outweighs the bad for the following reasons:\n  1. The agreement provides $80 billion of significant sequester relief \nover the next two years for both defense and non-defense priorities, \nwhich is nearly 90 percent of the relief requested by the President in \nhis 2016 budget;\n  2. The Bipartisan Budget Agreement prevents a roughly 50 percent \nincrease in the Medicare Part B premium in 2016, protecting thousands \nof seniors in my congressional district, and millions more across the \ncountry, from cost increases;\n  3. The Bipartisan Budget Agreement avoids deep cuts to Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance (DI) benefits that would occur at the end \nof next year;\n  4. Hundreds of thousands of American jobs will be created over the \nnext two years due to the avoidance of manufactured budget crises;\n  5. The Bipartisan Budget Agreement provides additional resources and \nthe funding stability needed to protect our homeland, counter future \nthreats, and take care of our troops while preventing deep cuts that \nwould result from locking in sequestration;\n  6. The agreement is paid for in a balanced way that avoids harmful \ncuts to Medicare or Social Security beneficiaries; and\n  7. Prevents a catastrophic default and protects the full faith and \ncredit of the United States and by suspending the national debt limit \nuntil March 15, 2017.\n  But as with any compromise there are some things in the agreement \nthat I support and some things that I do not.\n  For example, while providing $80 billion in relief over two years, \ninstead of abolishing sequestration, as I would prefer, the agreement \nretains the sequestration principle and extends its applicability for \ntwo additional years, until 2025.\n  Of this $80 billion, $50 billion will be available in FY 2016 and $30 \nbillion in FY 2017, to be equally divided and allocated by the House \nand Senate Appropriations Committees among the various federal agencies \nand programs.\n  This modest increase in discretionary domestic funding holds open the \npromise of increased investments in critical areas such as basic \nresearch in health and science, education, veterans' medical care, and \njob training.\n  And these investments are desperately needed if we are to position \nour nation to prevail in an increasingly interconnected economy.\n  Madam Speaker, in the absence of this agreement, we would have to \nrely upon a full-year continuing resolution which would result in $1 \nbillion less in NIH funding and nearly 1,000 fewer NSF grants than \nunder the President's budget.\n  Were we to operate under a continuing resolution through the end of \nFY 2016, per-pupil education funding would fall to the lowest levels \nsince 2000, and Head Start would be flat-funded, which would mean \nroughly 17,000 fewer children served than in 2014.\n  Madam Speaker, a full-year CR at sequestration levels would mean $1 \nbillion less than the President requested for veterans' medical care \nrelative even though all of us here agree that our veterans deserve \nmore, much more, support than they have received.\n  The Bipartisan Budget Agreement will allow us to provide funding for \njob training for two million more workers than would be possible if we \ncontinued to operate through the end of FY 2016 under a continuing \nresolution subject to sequestration.\n  Madam Speaker, I strongly support the provision in the Bipartisan \nBudget Agreement that prevents an increase of nearly 50 percent in the \nMedicare Part B premium for 2016 and 2017 by spreading out the cost of \nreplenishing\n\n[[Page H7309]]\n\nthe Medicare Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund over a number of \nyears.\n  Without Congressional action, the monthly 2015 Part B premium of \n$104.90 would increase by $54.40 in 2016 to $159.30 for beneficiaries \nnot held harmless (i.e., those who did not receive an increase in their \nSocial Security benefits).\n  The Bipartisan Budget Agreement maintains the hold harmless provision \nin current law and prevents a dramatic premium increase on \nbeneficiaries not held harmless by setting a new 2016 basic Part B \npremium for the beneficiaries not held harmless at $120, which is the \namount the Part B premium would otherwise be for all beneficiaries in \n2016 if the hold harmless provision in current law did not apply.\n  To replenish the Medicare Trust Fund, in 2016 there would be a loan \nof general revenue from the Federal Treasury, which will be repaid \nbeginning in 2016 by an additional $3 surcharge in the monthly Part B \npremium of beneficiaries not subject to the hold harmless.\n  Madam Speaker, it is worth noting that a functioning, effective \nfederal government is critical to people with disabilities who \ndisproportionately rely on government services to live, learn and work \nin their communities.\n  That is why I also strongly support the provision in the Bipartisan \nBudget Agreement that avoids deep cuts to Social Security Disability \nInsurance.\n  Specifically, the agreement ensures that the Social Security \nDisability Insurance program will continue to provide the full benefits \nthat workers have earned, preventing a 20 percent cut that would have \nbeen applied to workers and their families at the end of 2016.\n  Madam Speaker, another reason I support the Bipartisan Budget \nAgreement is that it eliminates the temptation of House Republicans to \nonce again resort to the brinksmanship politics of defaulting on the \nnational debt.\n  The full faith and credit of the United States is too valuable a \nnational asset to be trifled with, as Alexander Hamilton, the nation's \nfirst and greatest Treasury Secretary, understood.\n  In 1789, in the dawn of the nation's birth, Hamilton recognized and \nacted upon the belief that the path to American prosperity and \ngreatness lay in its creditworthiness which provided the affordable \naccess to capital needed to fund internal improvements and economic \ngrowth.\n  According to Hamilton, the nation's creditworthiness was one of its \nmost important national assets and ``the proper funding of the present \ndebt, will render it a national blessing.''\n  But to maintain this blessing, or to ``render public credit \nimmortal,'' Hamilton warned that it was necessary that ``the creation \nof debt should always be accompanied with the means of \nextinguishment.''\n  In other words, to retain and enjoy the prosperity that flows from \ngood credit, it is necessary for a nation to pay its bills.\n  Defaulting on the national debt would vitiate the full faith and \ncredit of the United States, cost American jobs, hurt businesses of all \nsizes, and do irreparable damage to the economy.\n  On the other hand, suspending the national debt until March 15, 2017, \nis estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to create 340,000 \nadditional American jobs in 2016 alone and more than 500,000 job-years \nin 2017.\n  Additionally, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors \nforecasts that the indirect effect of increased certainty and \nconfidence could further boost job creation and economic growth above \nthese estimates.\n  What is more, increased long-term growth and rising middle-class \nincomes can be expected to result from the greater investments in human \ncapital and infrastructure made possible by the Bipartisan Budget \nAgreement.\n  Madam Speaker, perhaps the most immediate benefit of the Bipartisan \nBudget Agreement is that it paves the way for the House and Senate to \nreach agreement on the FY2016 spending bills needed to keep the federal \ngovernment open and avoid another disastrous shutdown like the one \nHouse Republicans inflicted on the nation in October 2013.\n  That shutdown lasted 16 days, cost the economy $24 billion, and \ninflicted untold harm on federal employees and the people they serve.\n  Madam Speaker, the past several years have been an extraordinary time \nin America.\n  We have seen the Legislative and Executive Branches of our government \nand the constitutional balance that the framers of the Constitution \nintended regarding matters related to public purse tested.\n  It is extraordinary when a matter that should be dealt with in the \nregular order of the business of the House and Senate becomes a matter \nso grave that a broad and diverse coalition call on Members of this \nbody to do what we were elected to do: manage the business of the \npeople through cooperation and compromise.\n  That is why we have heard from a broad and diverse range of American \nvoices, including the AARP, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nEducation Association, and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human \nRights, calling for the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement.\n  By supporting the Bipartisan Budget Agreement we can show the \nAmerican people that we understand that we were sent here to address \ntheir problems and concerns by working together to reach agreement that \nresponsibly makes the investments needed to keep our nation competitive \nin a global economy and enables all of our people to reach their \npotential and realize their dreams.\n\n  Updated II: Some of the Key Groups Supporting the Bipartisan Budget \n                               Agreement\n\n                           (October 28, 2015)\n\n       AARP: ``On behalf of our 38 million members and as the \n     largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization representing the \n     interests of Americans age 50 and older and their families, \n     AARP strongly supports the bipartisan agreement you have \n     reached to avert deep reductions in Social Security \n     Disability Insurance benefits in 2016, and to address the \n     imminent spike in Medicare Part B premiums which many older \n     Americans would otherwise experience. . . . By finding a \n     sensible solution to keep premiums manageable for over 16 \n     million beneficiaries, Congress is helping to prevent \n     financial hardship for many beneficiaries at a time when \n     there is no Social Security cost of living adjustment.  . . . \n     Finally, AARP appreciates that the agreement modifies \n     sequestration for discretionary programs for fiscal year \n     2016. The higher discretionary cap may prevent unwise cuts to \n     countless programs serving older Americans. Sequestration \n     relief for many health care, nutrition and supportive service \n     programs is critically important to seniors as funding for \n     them has declined over the past decade despite substantial \n     increases in population requiring this assistance.''\n       Center for Medicare Advocacy: ``Congress is considering the \n     Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. This proposed budget agreement \n     would reduce an expected spike in the Medicare Part B \n     deductible and premiums for 2016. . . . We are glad people \n     who rely on Medicare can breathe a bit easier--knowing that \n     premiums and deductibles will not skyrocket next year.''\n       Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities: The Consortium \n     for Citizens with Disabilities' (CCD) Fiscal Policy Task \n     Force commends the House and Senate leadership for \n     negotiating the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA). . . . We \n     commend the negotiators for reaching a deal that provides \n     relief from sequestration and raises the budget caps for \n     discretionary programs in Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017. The \n     package provides welcome stability in the appropriations \n     process and avoids a devastating 20% benefit cut in 2016 for \n     Social Security Disability beneficiaries and their \n     families.''\n       Federation of American Hospitals: ``The Federation of \n     American Hospitals acknowledges that it is incumbent upon \n     Congress to act on the debt ceiling and establish a federal \n     budget. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 agreement, which \n     accomplishes these goals, includes Medicare cuts as offsets. \n     . . . The FAH understands that Congressional leaders did \n     their best to minimize the effects of these cuts on the \n     hospitals that care for the nation's seniors. By extending \n     without increasing the overall effect of the Medicare \n     sequester and focusing a limited payment change on certain \n     physician-hospital arrangements, the bill is carefully \n     crafted to meet its objectives.''\n       American College of Physicians: ``The American College of \n     Physicians is pleased that today's proposed bipartisan budget \n     agreement will provide two years of relief from existing \n     `sequestration' level spending caps that could result in cuts \n     to programs that are vital to the nation's healthcare, \n     including the National Institutes of Health, Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality, and Primary Care Training \n     Programs authorized by Section 747 of Title VII of the Public \n     Health Service Act. . . . We [also] strongly support the \n     proposal to ensure all new hospital acquisitions of private \n     physician practices would only be eligible for Medicare \n     payments equal to those for the same care services provided \n     in the freestanding, community-based setting.''\n       American Academy of Family Physicians: ``On behalf of the \n     Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), which represents 120,900 \n     family physicians and medical students across the country, I \n     write in support of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. . . . \n     The AAFP notes that the bill will make two important reforms \n     to Medicare. First, the bill will mitigate an anticipated \n     spike in 2016 in premiums and deductibles for America's \n     Medicare Part B enrollees, which will help avoid disruption \n     in access to physicians' services to seniors. Second, the \n     bill removes an incentive in the Medicare hospital outpatient \n     payment system that has driven health systems to purchase \n     Physician practices, in turn increasing healthcare costs \n     without any corresponding benefit to patient care.''\n       Chamber of Commerce: ``The U.S. Chamber of Commerce . . . \n     urges Congress to pass the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 \n     (BBA2015) to bring certainty to next year's appropriations \n     process, raise the debt limit through March\n\n[[Page H7310]]\n\n     15, 2017, strengthen America's national security, and \n     constructively resolve a handful of other outstanding \n     issues.''\n       NETWORK: A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby: \n     ``NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby is \n     encouraged to hear that a budget deal has been reached that \n     will surpass sequester budget caps for the next two years and \n     raise the debt ceiling to prevent a default on our nation's \n     financial obligations. . . . We are encouraged by the White \n     House and Congressional leaderships' work on the proposed \n     budget deal that lifts the caps on non-defense spending. \n     Unaddressed, sequester would have caused hardship for many \n     hardworking and vulnerable people in our nation.''\n       The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights: ``We \n     applaud the White House and congressional leaders who \n     negotiated the budget deal introduced late last night for \n     their hard work in crafting a bipartisan, two-year bill that \n     will raise the caps on spending for both defense and non-\n     defense discretionary spending and provided needed relief for \n     underfunded programs that serve our communities.\n       Robert Greenstein, Center for Budget and Policy Priorities: \n     ``If approved by Congress, the new budget deal from the White \n     House and congressional leaders will mark a significant \n     achievement by an otherwise polarized Washington. . . .

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on \nthis side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland has 3\\3/4\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Lee), a great member of the Budget Committee.\n  Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, first, let me thank our ranking member, \nCongressman Van Hollen, for yielding and for his tremendous leadership \non the Budget Committee.\n  Also, to Leader Pelosi and to Speaker Boehner, I just have to thank \nyou for demonstrating that we can work together in a bipartisan way on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1314, which is the \nbipartisan budget agreement of 2015. Let me just say, as a member of \nthe Appropriations and Budget Committees, I really know how difficult \nit has been to get us to where we were today. So thank you very much.\n  This budget deal, though, is not perfect. It averts a shutdown and \nprevents a catastrophic default on the Federal debt. Most importantly, \nthough, it provides relief from the sequester and it begins--it \nbegins--to invest in the American people through programs like food \nstamps, a safety net which many, many people need until they are \nthrough this economic recession.\n  We must do more to create good-paying jobs for individuals who want \nto work. This begins to invest in early childhood education and in \npublic housing.\n  This agreement also prevents a massive hike in healthcare costs for \nour seniors. So while this agreement is an important step forward, much \nwork remains.\n  It is past time that we start addressing the priorities of the \nAmerican people, including passing bipartisan comprehensive immigration \nreform, making education affordable and accessible from pre-K through \ncollege, investing in workforce training through our community \ncolleges, and building pathways out of poverty.\n  So, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this \nagreement so we can get Congress back to work putting people first. The \nAmerican Dream has really turned into a nightmare for so many. \nHopefully, our action today will give people hope that the American \nDream may be achievable. But we must do more.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the\n\n[[Page H7311]]\n\ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a terrific new \nMember of Congress.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank the \ngentleman.\n  Madam Speaker, for the cynics who believe that nothing can happen in \nWashington and that we are permanently doomed to disarray, this has \nbeen a very bad week.\n  First, with the Export-Import Bank, we see a majority of Republicans \nand an overwhelming majority of Democrats come together and reach a \nbipartisan compromise, and now here again with this big budget \nagreement, something that would avoid the catastrophic default, the \nfirst in American history if it were to happen.\n  Madam Speaker, I don't agree with everything that is in this bill, \nbut I agree with the majority of it. It is about time this body stopped \nallowing the 10 or 20 percent we disagree with to block the 70, 80, and \n90 percent we agree with. This is a step in the right direction. This \nis progress. This is what we need to do more of. I am proud to support \nit.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time remains on \nthis side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland has 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Where we close is where we started. As we all recognize, this \nagreement is not perfect, but it certainly beats the alternative and is \na positive step forward.\n  It ensures the full faith and credit of the United States. We will \npay our bills on time. It prevents damaging sequester cuts to our \neconomy and allows us to invest more in education, in scientific \nresearch, and military readiness.\n  It prevents a 20 percent cut to Social Security Disability \nbeneficiaries, and it prevents a whopping Medicare part B increase for \nmillions of American seniors.\n  So, again, while many of us would like to see more--and I agree with \nthose who have said that we need to invest more and address many of the \nother big issues our country faces--this is a positive step forward.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to thank everybody who helped come together to \nmake it possible. I urge its adoption.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  Madam Speaker, it has been my goal, as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee for these 4 years, to get us back into regular order.\n  When I first came here and for many years thereafter, we passed 12 \nindividual appropriations bills funding the entire government, but \nseparate bills so that every Member had a chance to dissect each of \nthese bills, offer amendments, debate them, fight them, promote them, \nwhat have you, but at least everyone had their day in court.\n  Then somehow we got off on a tangent to where we could not \nappropriate separate bills. So at the end of the fiscal year, we had no \nchoice but to pass what is called a continuing resolution, which means \nwe just continue spending as we had for the last year, regardless of \nthe needs of the moment.\n  That is a terrible way to do business. Agencies, particularly the \nmilitary, would not have a way to plan their work or to make orders or \nto deploy troops and the like, a terrible way to do business. We lurch \nfrom one crisis to another, it seems.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  My goal has been just to get back to that business of appropriating \n12 separate bills so that we don't need a CR. We hear current needs. In \na CR, you are spending money on projects no longer needed, but, \nnevertheless, they are required to spend the money, for example. A \nterrible waste of money.\n  So to get back on track, the appropriations process, our committee \nneeds to have a top line number to which we appropriate. We have not \nbeen getting that number for one reason or the other. But now in this \nbill, not only are we getting a number for fiscal '16, which we will \nnow use to write an omnibus appropriations bill for current needs and \nfinish it by September 11, the deadline, we will do that, but it will \nbe made up of the bills that have passed both the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees and in conversations between the two bodies.\n  Not only do we have the number for fiscal '16, but we have it for \nfiscal '17, and that is very important. It gives us a year to plan our \nwork to try to marshal through 12 separate bills for the first time in \nmany, many years so that we, with the Senate, can send to the President \n12 bills that have the polish and the content put into it and on it by \nthe Members of our bodies, the House and the Senate. That is my goal. \nThat is why I am so strong for this bill. That is the biggest thing in \nit from my perspective.\n  It is important that we are helping our folks who are on Social \nSecurity Disability to take the worry away from them that they have \nthat that fund will be drying up, which it will be. It is great that we \nare taking care of the problem with Medicare benefit increases, the \ninterest on Medicare. It is important, very important, of course, that \nwe avoid the default in our debt ceiling coming up momentarily. All of \nthese things you have heard about in this debate are great.\n  But for me, the 2 years that we have now to get back on regular order \nand stop lurching from crisis to crisis, to stop that business, this \nbill will give us that great chance.\n  I urge Members to support the bill. It is a good one. It is not \nperfect, not ideal, by any stretch of the imagination, but it is the \nbest we can do with what we have, and the alternative would be \ndisaster. I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, today the House is scheduled \nto consider the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 which would increase the \ndiscretionary spending caps for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 set in the \nBudget Control Act of 2011 and would include offsets over 10 years. \nWhile the legislation would provide funding certainty for discretionary \nprograms in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, it has some concerning \nprovisions as explained below.\n  The bill provides additional resources for base discretionary non-\ndefense spending far in excess of the levels in the fiscal year 2016 \nbudget conference agreement (S. Con. Res. 11). The amount of base \nnondefense discretionary increases for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 are \n$30 billion and $15 billion, respectively, above the levels approved by \nCongress just over 5 months ago when the budget conference agreement \nwas adopted. The bill also provides an additional adjustment through \nthe Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) \ncategory of $14.9 billion for the State Department and International \nAffairs budget category, which is $7.9 billion--more than double--what \nthe President requested in his FY16 Budget. If this adjustment becomes \nlaw, it will allow non-defense budgetary resources to be shifted from \nthe base discretionary category, which has spending limits, to the OCO/\nGWOT category which has no spending limits. When both the base and OCO/\nGWOT increases for non-defense are considered, the total non-defense \nincrease for 2016 and 2017 is $37.9 billion and $22.9 billion, \nrespectively, above the budget conference agreement.\n  The bill also includes language that directs the Senate to file \nbudget allocations in fiscal year 2017 at levels consistent with the \ndiscretionary amounts included in the bill and at the Congressional \nBudget Office baseline amounts for all other spending, unless a budget \nconference agreement is reached. This provision makes it highly likely \nthat regular order for the budget process in the Senate will be \ncircumvented and that the Senate will not offer a new budget in fiscal \nyear 2017. If this outcome occurs, it will further erode the integrity \nof the Congressional budget process by preventing a fiscal year 2017 \nbudget from being adopted that reflects the will of the Majority in the \nHouse and Senate. It also means reconciliation will not be available \nfor fiscal year 2017 and Congress will no longer have a balanced budget \nagreement in place.\n  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Bipartisan \nBudget Agreement of 2015. While I have concerns about portions of the \nbill, including the impact it may have on some of our hospitals, there \nare important provisions in the bill that are essential to protecting \nthe well-being of many Americans.\n  For example, the bill provides two years of sequester relief, and \nallows us to increase our investments in critical areas, including \neducation, housing, healthcare, transportation, homeland security, and \ndefense. The agreement also suspends the debt limit until March\n\n[[Page H7312]]\n\n15, 2017. This will allow us to get back on track and plan for the \nfuture rather than continue governing from crisis to crisis.\n  The measure keeps Medicare Part B premium costs down for millions of \nseniors and protects all Medicare beneficiaries from the projected \nincreases in their deductibles.\n  I am encouraged by this framework and hope that as the bill moves \nthrough the process, some of the areas of concern will be worked out \nand that we will be able to pass bipartisan appropriations measures for \nfiscal years 2016 and 2017. I urge my colleagues to support the \nBipartisan Budget Agreement for the good of our country.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the previous question is ordered.\n  The question is on the motion to concur by the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Rogers).\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.

In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to\n\n[[Page H7313]]\n\nSudan is to continue in effect beyond November 3, 2015.\n  The crisis constituted by the actions and policies of the Government \nof Sudan that led to the declaration of a national emergency in \nExecutive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997, and the expansion of that \nemergency in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006, and with respect \nto which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13412 of \nOctober 13, 2006, has not been resolved. These actions and policies \ncontinue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, I have \ndetermined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency \ndeclared in Executive Order 13067 with respect to Sudan.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, October 28, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7313-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1730\n                      HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2643, offered by my good friend and fellow Texan, \nMr. Williams, is commonsense bipartisan legislation that will address \nthe unintended consequences of the SAFE Act.\n  This bill passed the Committee on Financial Services by a vote of 57-\n0. Before I get into the details of this bill, I would like to thank \nthe Texas Banking Commissioner, Charles Cooper, for his help and \nguidance as the committee considered this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2643 helps ensure a safe consumer financial \nmarketplace by facilitating the licensing of certain financial services \nproviders.\n  Congress authorized the creation of the National Mortgage Licensing \nSystem and Registry, the NMLS, to provide a mechanism for licensing \nnationwide of financial services providers.\n  The mission of NMLS is to improve interstate coordination information \nsharing among regulators, increasing efficiencies for industry and \nenhanced consumer protection.\n  Currently, the greater utility NMLS is frustrated by the FBI's \ncurrent statutory incapacity to enhance the platform by allowing \nadditional financial service providers, other than mortgage loan \noriginators, to be licensed under this system.\n  When processing licenses, authorized State regulating agencies should \nhave access to the most up-to-date criminal background information from \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation. For certain classes of financial \nproviders, that is not occurring.\n  The FBI should not be hindered from bringing the same efficiency to \nthe criminal background checks of financial services personnel that the \nNMLS brought to the mortgage loan originators.\n  By enabling the State license agencies to obtain these background \nchecks, this bill will make the licensing process more efficient and \npotentially help qualified businesses get up and running more quickly.\n  By enhancing the authority to process criminal history records for \nlicensing of financial service providers beyond mortgage loan \noriginators, this bill ensures that State financial regulators have the \nnecessary tools to exercise effective oversight.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear that this bill only affects financial \nservices businesses which are already required to conduct background \nchecks and which cannot currently use the NMLS system by Federal law.\n  H.R. 2643 has the potential to reduce the time it takes to complete \nbackground checks from anywhere between 2 days and 2 weeks to 24 hours \nunder the expanded NMLS.\n  At the end of 2014, there were 20,386 professionals registered in the \nsystem. Nationwide there was a need to conduct over 105,000 background \nchecks outside of the system.\n  It is estimated that this bill will reduce the number of background \nchecks conducted outside the NMLS system by 80 percent and reduce the \nadministrative and regulatory burden of State banking examiners to \nconduct them.\n  In closing, I want to make two points. First, no authority to conduct \nbackground checks is created by this legislation. Second, no new \nlicensing requirements are created by this legislation.\n  I want to again thank the gentleman from Texas for his hard work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                       Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hensarling: I am writing concerning H.R. \n     2643, the ``State Licensing Efficiency Act of 2015'' which \n     was referred to your Committee as well as the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n       As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions \n     in H.R. 2643 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our \n     Committee from further consideration of this bill so that it \n     may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for \n     consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with \n     our mutual understanding that by forgoing consideration of \n     H.R. 2643 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over \n     subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and \n     that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and \n     involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward. \n     Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of \n     an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks \n     that you support any such request.\n       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding, and would request that you include a copy \n     of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record \n     during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in \n     advance for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                  Committee on Financial Services,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2015.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your October 27th \n     letter regarding H.R. 2643, the ``State Licensing Efficiency \n     Act of 2015.''\n\n[[Page H7314]]\n\n       I am most appreciative of your decision to forgo action on \n     H.R. 2643 so that it may move expeditiously to the House \n     floor. I acknowledge that although you are waiving action on \n     the bill, the Committee on the Judiciary is in no way waiving \n     its jurisdictional interest in this or similar legislation. \n     In addition, if a conference is necessary on this \n     legislation, I will support any request that your committee \n     be represented therein.\n       Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter and this \n     letter in our committee's report on H.R. 2643 and in the \n     Congressional Record during floor consideration of the same.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                               Jeb Hensarling,\n\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2643, and I am proud to \nbe an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  I want to briefly say a few words about Mr. Williams' bill, H.R. \n2643, the State Licensing Efficiency Act of 2015.\n  This legislation is extremely important. I am proud that this bill is \na product of a bipartisan effort, a bipartisan effort that, in the last \nCongress, I was privileged to work with the Committee on Financial \nServices chair emeritus, Chairman Bachus, on this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, the clock ran out on the last Congress. So I am very \npleased that Mr. Williams has taken up this legislation and gotten it \nto the floor.\n  It just makes all the sense in the world to streamline criminal \nbackground checks. I want to thank Mr. Williams and thank my colleague, \nMr. Neugebauer, for championing this legislation.\n  I urge adoption of this bill. I have no further speakers on this \nbill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), the primary author of this \nbill.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I \nwould also like to thank my colleague, Ms. Moore, for her hard work on \nthis. I appreciate it.\n  H.R. 2643, the State Licensing Efficiency Act, will expand the \nState's ability to use a federally accepted registry, the Nationwide \nMultistate Licensing System, to expedite background checks.\n  For many State-licensed financial service providers, the current \nbackground check process is inefficient, but this registry has a proven \ntrack record of being effective while also reducing regulatory burden.\n  Under the SAFE Act, the current NMLS, developed by State banking \ncommissioners, has been used to oversee the mortgage industry since \n2008. To date, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors has channeled \nover 1.3 million fingerprint checks of mortgage loan originators.\n  Citing an absence in Federal law, the FBI has prevented its use to \nconduct background checks for other financial services, including money \ntransmitters, debt collectors, pawnbrokers, and check cashers.\n  Whereas a State wishing to conduct a criminal background check \nthrough traditional means may wait several weeks and sometimes even \nmonths for their response, NMLS communicates directly with the FBI and \noften receives the same results, as we have heard, in just 24 hours.\n  H.R. 2643 would expand the current system to include those financial \nservice providers who are already licensed by the State and require a \nFederal background check.\n  The NMLS provides increased collaboration between State banking \ndepartments, reduces the risk of bad actors by preventing them from \ncontinuing to operate, and improves the safety and soundness of the \nfinancial system as a whole. In short, NMLS provides an added level of \nassurance to community banks that their business customers and vendors \nare operating legally.\n  Supported by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, expanding the \nuse of NMLS provides State regulators a secure and efficient means by \nwhich to conduct background checks on license applicants.\n  I want to be clear. As we have heard in the past, this bill does not \ncreate any requirements for background checks or fingerprints, but \ngreatly increases efficiency and transparency.\n  In addition, by no means does this bill encourage States to require \nor mandate States to license or register any additional class of \nfinancial service providers.\n  This act authorizes only State-licensed loan originators and other \nState-licensed financial service providers to be processed through NMLS \nfor background checks authorized under the laws of the State. Simply \nput, by expanding its use, NMLS will save industry and, ultimately, the \nconsumer money.\n  At the end of 2014, there were around 20,386 professionals registered \nin the NMLS system. Those individuals, as we have heard, required over \n105,000 background checks outside the NMLS system. If our bill becomes \nlaw, we would reduce that number by 80 percent because we would be \nusing one system instead of 50, saving industry $1.1 million by \nremoving duplicate background checks.\n  Finally, in my home State of Texas, the expansion of NMLS is \nsupported by State Banking Commissioner Charles Cooper, who we talked \nabout tonight. I want to take a moment to thank Commissioner Cooper for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  In addition, I want to thank my own staff and the staff of CSBS, who \nhave worked tirelessly to support our efforts in pushing this \nlegislation through. Without them and the support of my colleagues on \nthe committee and Chairman Hensarling, none of this would be possible. \nI thank Chairman Neugebauer, and I thank Ms. Moore.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2643.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2643.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7314-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7314-H7316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1745\n                 SOCIAL MEDIA WORKING GROUP ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and \nextend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 623, as \namended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  As disasters become more frequent and severe, it is critical that \nemergency managers and citizens take advantage of new technologies to \nsend and receive critical information.\n  Social media has become an essential tool in the preparedness, \nresponse, and recovery for all hazards, whether natural or manmade. We \nsaw how critical social media was in relaying information following \nHurricane Sandy, the Boston Marathon bombing, and, just a few weeks \nago, during Hurricane Joaquin and the historic flooding in South \nCarolina. Social media helps reach people in need, helps get the right \ninformation into the hands of the public, helps organize volunteers, \nand can be a source of critical on-the-ground information to \ndecisionmakers.\n  H.R. 623, as amended by the Senate, would require DHS to establish a \nsocial media working group to enhance the use of social media to \nsupport preparedness, response, and recovery of all hazards. This group \nwill be required to report to Congress on an annual basis on its \nfindings, emerging trends, and best practices.\n  I commend the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) for sponsoring \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 623, the DHS Social Media \nImprovement Act of 2015, was introduced by my good friend and colleague \nfrom Indiana, Congresswoman Susan Brooks.\n  The bill, Mr. Speaker, was referred to the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure and to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity. This bill codifies the Department of Homeland Security's \nSocial Media Working Group to enhance the use of social media during \ndisasters and other events, and to provide guidance and best practices \nin emergency preparedness and response. Social media, especially \nTwitter, Facebook, and YouTube, can play a critical role in \npreparedness, response, and recovery operations during emergencies.\n  Emergency managers at all levels use social media to warn those in \nharm's way of impending natural hazards. Social media is also used to \ninform survivors on how to access disaster assistance and tips for \nspeedier recoveries. Equally important, Mr. Speaker, social media has \nbeen used to coordinate and manage assistance from nonprofits and \nvolunteers who want to help in recovery efforts.\n  More and more, we are seeing individuals take to social media during \nemergencies. Individuals have used social media to help identify \nlocations where assistance may still be needed and to raise awareness \nof impending hazards. They have also used it, Mr. Speaker, to \ncommunicate with loved ones who may be impacted by an event as well as \nreconnect pets with their owners. This has certainly been the case in \nthe great Hoosier State.\n  This last summer, Mr. Speaker, will go down as the wettest summer in \nIndianapolis history. Rainfall in July broke a 140-year-old record in \nour great city, making it the wettest month ever recorded, and social \nmedia helped keep residents informed in real time. In Indianapolis, the \nNational Weather Service, Department of Homeland Security, and local \nbroadcasters routinely used social media to post updates on ever-\nchanging weather conditions.\n  The very unique benefit of social media alerts is that you don't have \nto be right next to a radio or TV to be informed; you can virtually be \nanywhere. This summer, when dangerous flooding covered many roads in \nour city, social media exploded with pictures of flooded roadways and \nstranded motorists. This nontraditional tool enabled people to know \nwhere major problems were located and to avoid danger with the famous \ncatchphrase, ``Turn Around Don't Drown.''\n  The existing DHS Social Media Working Group provides recommendations \non how to use social media before, during, and after emergencies. This \nworking group, Mr. Speaker, consists of emergency responders, NGOs, \nnonprofits, and Federal agencies.\n  I support the provisions in today's bill to broaden the group's \nmembership to include private sector representatives and to require \nconsultation with nonmembers.\n  To ensure accountability, this requires an annual report to Congress \non important issues, such as best practices and lessons learned. It \nwould also provide recommendations on how to improve the use of the \nsocial media\n\n[[Page H7316]]\n\nplatform for emergency management purposes.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, we recognize the importance of this platform \nfor emergency management. I would be remiss not to remind our \ncolleagues of the need to authorize the Integrated Public Alert and \nWarning System, also known as IPAWS.\n  As the committee of primary jurisdiction over IPAWS, the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee unanimously approved the \nBarletta-Carson IPAWS authorization bill back in April and ordered the \nbill reported. It is past time for this bill to be considered in the \nHouse.\n  Despite the Senate's inadvertent omission of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee, I support this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I urge \nour colleagues to do the same to approve this measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), the sponsor of this bill.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n623, the DHS Social Media Improvement Act of 2015.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his management of \nthe bill and, also, my good friend and colleague from the State of \nIndiana, Congressman Carson. Both of us have served in public safety in \nthe past, and so it is especially gratifying that he is managing the \nbill as well this evening.\n  Social media, as we have heard, is transforming the way the Nation is \ncommunicating before, during, and after terrorist attacks, natural \ndisasters, and other emergencies. There are countless examples from \nrecent events of how citizens are turning to Facebook, Twitter, \nInstagram, and even Snapchat for public safety information, to comfort \nsurvivors, tell loved ones they are safe, and request assistance.\n  As has already been mentioned, citizens of South Carolina used social \nmedia to communicate with first responders, friends, and families after \nheavy rainfall caused destructive flash flooding across the State.\n  Additionally, a quarter of Americans--let me repeat, a quarter of \nAmericans--got information about the devastating terrorist attack at \nthe 2013 Boston Marathon bombing from Facebook and Twitter.\n\n  Citizens are not the only ones using social media during and after an \nemergency. First responders are proactively using social media as a \nforce multiplier to get vital information out. For example, immediately \nfollowing the terrorist attack and during the manhunt, the Boston PD \nutilized social media as a way to communicate with and solicit \ninformation from citizens and visitors.\n  These are just a few of the hundreds of examples that demonstrate the \nprevalence of social media use before, during, and after an emergency.\n  In the 113th Congress, I served as the chair of the Committee on \nHomeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, \nand Communications. The subcommittee held two hearings that focused on \nthis new phenomenon, and I learned at that time that while the Nation \nis making great strides in this area, gaps and challenges remain.\n  One of the key takeaways, however, was that during and after a \nterrorist attack, natural disaster, or other emergency, there is still \na need for better communication between the public and the private \nsectors, specifically, with how to utilize social media as a \ncommunication tool.\n  So last year, I was proud to work with the ranking member, \nCongressman Payne, to find ways to better utilize social media during \ndisasters by leveraging both public and private resources and \nexperiences.\n  The bill passed with overwhelming support last Congress and, after \nreintroduction this Congress, I am pleased to say, in February, the \nHouse again resoundingly agreed to its passage.\n  H.R. 623, while authorizing and enhancing the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's existing social media group, essentially what it does is it \nensures that best practices and lessons learned on the use of social \nmedia during terrorist attacks or disasters are being discussed and \nshared with Federal, State, and local first responders, nongovernmental \norganizations, academia, and the private sector.\n  Currently, the Virtual Social Media Working Group is made up \nprimarily of State and local officials, and they are doing great work \nand developing guidance. However, this bill will increase the group's \nstakeholder participation, particularly among the private sector and \nthe Federal response agencies.\n  So by including private sector groups like Google and Twitter and \nFacebook, we know it will improve coordination and relief efforts. \nAlso, as we have already heard, it will require the group to submit an \nannual report to Congress highlighting best practices, lessons learned, \nand any recommendations. Finally, this bill will require the group to \nmeet, in person or virtually, at least twice a year, and will not be a \nfinancial burden on the Department.\n  I appreciate the swift action of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 455, the Northern Border \nSecurity Review Act, and urge its passage. This legislation would \nrequire the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a much-needed \nthreat analysis of current and potential threats along our Nation's \nvast northern border.\n  As a former Federal prosecutor on both the northern border in New \nYork and the southern border in El Paso, Texas, not to mention my time \nas a Federal prosecutor on the island of Puerto Rico, I have seen \nfirsthand the challenges our Nation faces to counter violent drug \ntrafficking organizations, organized crime syndicates, and human \ntrafficking that transit across our Nation's border.\n  While great attention is justifiably given to the challenges of \nsecuring our southern border, ensuring the safety of our vast northern \nborder is also critical to our Nation's security. It has been well \ndocumented that several major terrorist plots have been discovered and \ndisrupted along the northern border in recent years.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Ahmed Ressam, the so-called millennium bomber, was entering \nWashington State from Canada with a concealed bomb intended to detonate \nat LAX Airport when he was arrested by alert Customs agents in 1999.\n  In 2013, with the help of our Canadian allies, the FBI and the Royal \nCanadian Mounted Police thwarted an attempt to derail and kill \npassengers on a train between New York and Toronto, which became known \nas the VIA rail plot.\n  As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee's bipartisan Foreign \nFighters Task Force, I recently examined other vulnerabilities at our \nborder associated with foreign fighter travel. Unfortunately, neither \nthe United States nor Canada is immune to the threat of foreign \nfighters who may be inspired by groups like ISIS or otherwise \nradicalized online from others abroad.\n  Among the findings of the bipartisan Task Force was the \nidentification of security weaknesses that are putting the U.S. \nhomeland in danger by making it easier for foreign fighters to migrate \nto terrorist hotspots and for jihadists to return to the West. One such \nvulnerability stems from our vast northern border that we share with \nCanada. Along this border, we face a number of unique challenges both \ngeographically and jurisdictionally.\n  Complicating the current understanding of the security needs along \nour northern border is the administration's decision to stop providing \nmetrics to Congress in 2010 that identified the number of miles under \noperational control.\n  In that year, the Government Accountability Office reported that only \n69 miles, or about 2 percent of the northern border's 4,000 miles, were \nunder operational control. Let me repeat that. Only 2 percent of our \nnorthern border is under operational control.\n  To address this lack of information with regard to the state of \nnorthern border security, this legislation requires that an assessment \nbe conducted to analyze a variety of issues facing the northern border. \nThese include potential terrorist threats, potential improvements, gaps \nin law or policy, and illegal border activity.\n  This analysis is intended to better inform any resources that are \nneeded along the border to increase operational control and legislation \nthat can result therefrom.\n  I recently had the opportunity to spend time with CBP officers and \nagents at the Port of Oswego in my district. I am continually impressed \nwith their ability to carry out their duties in incredibly difficult \nsituations.\n  This bill will help them better secure our Nation's borders, as it \nwill give our agents and officers the tools and information needed to \nbetter do their jobs.\n  Previous analyses of the northern border have largely focused on drug \ntrafficking and lack a holistic security approach to the issues that \nare unique along the northern border.\n  The analysis required in this bill will provide Customs and Border \nProtection with the foundation needed to address all threats at and \nbetween ports of entry along the northern border. It will also provide \nCongress with the information necessary to conduct proper oversight.\n  In my 10 months in office, I have worked vigorously to address known \nchallenges that the Department of Homeland Security faces. Since \nJanuary, I, along with both my Republican and Democratic colleagues, \nhave introduced seven pieces of legislation that address transportation \nand border security issues and hope that this will be the third \nbipartisan bill that we send to the President's desk.\n  This final product embodies the essence of bipartisanship, and I am \nproud to say that all Americans will benefit from the work my \ncolleagues and I have done to secure our northern border.\n  My colleagues and I understand we have a lot more work to do, and I \npromise we will continue to provide diligent oversight of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. When we see a problem at this agency, \nwe work swiftly together in a bipartisan manner with our Democratic \nbrothers and sisters to address it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n  I would like to thank Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security \nChairman Candice Miller for her support, along with my fellow northern \nborder colleagues who have joined as cosponsors.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HIGGINS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 455, the Northern \nBorder Security Review Act, introduced by my friend, the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Katko).\n  The bill before us would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nprepare a northern border threat analysis. There has long been an \nintent focus on the southern border and the many challenges faced \nthere. While this is undoubtedly justified, the northern border has \noften been neglected in this process.\n  The Northern Border Security Review Act takes steps to correct this \ndisparity by requiring an analysis of terror threats posed by \nindividuals entering through the northern border as well as \nimprovements needed at and between ports to prevent their entry.\n  I was pleased that two of my amendments were adopted in committee. \nThe first required an analysis of whether the implementation of \npreclearance and preinspection at additional ports of entry would \nenhance our security and prevent terrorists from entering the United \nStates.\n  A preinspection pilot at the Peace Bridge in Buffalo was conducted in \nearly 2014 and was deemed a success. It demonstrated the potential to \nefficiently process cargo while also enabling Customs and Border \nProtection\n\n[[Page H7318]]\n\nto conduct inspections and interdict threats before they reach the \nUnited States.\n  The historic preclearance agreement reached between the United States \nand Canada earlier this year paved the way for implementation of \npermanent preinspection and preclearance at the Peace Bridge and other \nlocations.\n  The second amendment would require an analysis of the number of \nadditional Customs and Border Protection officers and agents needed to \nproperly staff the northern border. Persistent staffing shortages have \nresulted in wait times that discourage economic activity while also \nleaving us vulnerable to a number of threats.\n  That is why I was disappointed that this language was weakened during \nnegotiations with the Senate. Having accurate information on the number \nof personnel required to detect illicit activity while facilitating \nlegitimate trade and travel is vital. It is my hope that analysis on \nstaffing requirements is included in forthcoming legislation.\n  H.R. 455 will help ensure that we better understand the threats \nfacing the northern border so we can understand how best to address \nthem. With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nbill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from New York has no further \nspeakers, I am prepared to close once the gentleman does.\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins), \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela), and the gentleman from New York \n(Mr. Katko) for their great leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, the good news is that we on the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity work together very well on many of these issues.\n  I rise to support the Northern Border Security Review Act, H.R. 455. \nMy colleague from Texas (Mr. Vela) is the ranking member. I am \ndelighted to be able to support a bill that captures all of what we \nhave been speaking of over the years.\n  As a member of Homeland Security, there are two borders. There is the \nsouthern border, for which I certainly have concern, as a \nRepresentative from Texas, but there is also the northern border. I am \nglad to say I have been to the northern border, walked along the \nnorthern border.\n  Let me say thank you for the aspects of this bill. H.R. 455 directs \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a classified northern \nborder threat analysis on terrorism threats posed by individuals \nseeking to enter the United States, improvements needed at ports of \nentry, gaps in law, policy, international agreements, illegal cross-\nborder activity, and the scope of the border security challenges.\n  This is a complete picture of the Nation's border, including whether \nadditional preclearance and preinspection by CBP at ports of entry \nalong the northern border could help prevent terrorists and their \ninstruments from entering the United States.\n  Canada has been a longstanding friend. I believe anytime that we can \nenhance both the relationship and the security of the U.S.-Canadian \nborder, the northern border, it is a very positive step forward for the \nNation's security.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 455, \nthe Northern Border Security Review Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security, a former \nranking member of its Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, and a \nco-sponsor, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 455, the ``Northern \nBorder Security Review Act.''\n  I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson of \nthe Homeland Security Committee and Chairman Miller and Ranking Member \nVela of the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee for their work on \nthis vital legislation.\n  Their leadership, coupled with input from members of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee and the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, \nhave helped make this common sense legislation a reality.\n  I very much appreciate the bipartisan spirit Chairman Miller has \ndisplayed as we worked together on many border security initiatives \nover the past several years.\n  The security of the Northern Border is an important area of concern \nin the effort to secure our homeland and keep it safe from those who \nwould do us harm.\n\n\n                             Bill Overview\n\n  H.R. 455 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a \nclassified northern border threat analysis, which shall include \nanalyses of:\n  1. terrorism threats posed by individuals seeking to enter the United \nStates through the northern border;\n  2. improvements needed at ports of entry along the northern border to \nprevent terrorists and instruments of terror from entering the United \nStates;\n  3. gaps in law, policy, international agreements, or tribal \nagreements that hinder the border security and counterterrorism efforts \nalong the northern border;\n  4. illegal cross border activity between ports of entry, including \nthe maritime borders of the Great Lakes;\n  5. the scope of border security challenges that shall include the \nterrain, population density, and climate along the northern border; and\n  6. whether additional preclearance and pre-inspection by the CBP at \nports of entry along the northern border could help prevent terrorists \nand their instruments from entering the United States.\n\n\n                           Canada-U.S. Border\n\n  Mr. Speaker, at 5,524 miles, the border separating Canada and United \nStates is the longest contiguous international border in the world.\n  In contrast, the border separating the United States and Mexico is \nonly Mexico border is only 1,951 miles long.\n  The border with Canada is significantly easier to cross, due to less \nBorder Patrol personnel.\n  The United States has approximately 1,000 Border Patrol agents \nassigned to the northern border but more than 11,000 patrolling its \nsouthern border with Mexico.\n\n\n                     Travel between Canada and U.S.\n\n  In 2009, there were 39,254,000 trips by Canadians to the United \nStates.\n  In 2010, 20,213,500 Americans traveled to Canada from the United \nStates.\n  Over 15,700,000 people flew on commercial flights between Canada and \nthe U.S. in 2010.\n\n\n                  Canadian Illegal Immigrants in U S.\n\n  Current estimates show there to be around 600,000 undocumented \nCanadian immigrants working in the United States.\n  Canadian citizens are not required to obtain visas; instead as \nCanadian citizens they are eligible for visa waivers which do not \nexpire for six months.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the security of homeland requires that we have increased \nsituational awareness and resources to respond to threats on the \nnation's northern, as well as southern border.\n  H.R. 455 makes a positive contribution in this effort and I urge all \nMembers to join me in voting for its passage.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I briefly just want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson \nLee) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins) for their comments. \nThey echo the sentiments that I believe firmly, that the Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee is probably the most bipartisan committee in \nCongress. It is an honor to be a part of it. It is an honor to serve \nwith my colleagues I just mentioned and the others.\n  Every single bill we have has bipartisan support. Every single bill \nseems to be like we are all on the same page, and that is really \nimportant when we have national security issues at hand.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, too often in Congress our debate on border security is \nlong on political rhetoric and short on substance. Development of a \nsubstantive and thorough analysis of border security threats is \nessential to decisionmaking at all levels about how best to respond. \nThis bill will help us do just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 455, the Northern Border \nSecurity Review Act, to help us understand and ultimately address any \nthreats along our border with Canada.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 455. \nThis bill is going to form the foundation for properly securing the \nnorthern border once and for all.\n  While our Canadian brothers and sisters are indeed our friends, the \nfact remains that bad people in Canada are intent on coming to the \nUnited States and vice versa and are intent on doing\n\n[[Page H7319]]\n\nharm here. We must secure our borders.\n  Having a 98 percent open border with Canada is absolutely \nunacceptable. This bill is the first step in moving towards securing \nthat border in a proper manner by making sure that we do a proper \nanalysis once and for all, which I am not sure has ever been done in \nthis manner.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 455, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7319-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BIPARTISANSHIP IN CONGRESS\n\n  (Mr. TAKAI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Speaker, this week Congress voted on the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. Moments ago we just cleared \na bipartisan budget, which now makes its way to the Senate. Through \nthis budget, we lift our debt ceiling and increase our defense and \nnondefense spending equally for 2 years and we avoid a government \nshutdown.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that we must reduce our Nation's \ngrowing debt, but we need to make sure that we do not do so at the \nexpense of our country's future and our ability to compete in a \nchanging global economy.\n  We, as Congress, need to come together to find long-term, bipartisan, \ncommonsense solutions rather than play politics with our national \nsecurity, economy, and the well-being of its people.\n  Tomorrow the House of Representatives votes for a new Speaker. I hope \nthat, under this new leadership, we see a change in how we govern. I \nhope Congress will no longer shy away from addressing the tough issues. \nI hope we can come together, both Republicans and Democrats, to get the \npeople's work done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7319-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               HEAD START\n\n  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. McNERNEY.

Head Start is a critical \ninvestment in the education of our Nation's youngest children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that, as a body, we reaffirm our investment in the \nchildren who are the future of this country.

Mr. Speaker, about 1 year ago, Speaker Boehner \nand Senate Majority Leader McConnell described a vision for the 114th \nCongress. It included ``focusing first on jobs and the economy.'' They \nlooked forward to helping middle class Americans ``frustrated by an \nincreasing lack of opportunity, the stagnation of wages, and a \ngovernment that seems incapable of performing even basic tasks.''\n  In the time since, they have done nothing but protect big businesses \nenjoy record profits, attack immigrants, and help polluters continue \nthe destruction of our environment.\n  This body has voted four times in support of the Confederate battle \nflag, but we have taken no votes on legislation that will level the \nplaying field for\n\n[[Page H7320]]\n\nworking Americans. This body has voted against a solid, long-term \ntransportation and infrastructure bill five times, and we have taken no \nvotes on legislation to boost American wages. This body has voted \ncountless times to undermine the Affordable Care Act or endanger \nwomen's access to health care, but we have taken no votes on \nlegislation to help families balance the needs of work and their \npersonal lives. That is in spite of statements from Members like the \nRepublican nominee for Speaker who just last week indicated he wouldn't \nrun for the position unless he would be allowed to set aside time to \nspend with his family.\n  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I are here on the floor tonight to \ncall for a shift in focus. We were elected to ensure everyday Americans \nhave a fighting chance and opportunities to succeed. We need to change \ngears to get to work on an agenda for working families. We need to pass \nlegislation that would give workers the ability to balance work and \nfamily needs, bills like the Healthy Families Act, the Family and \nMedical Insurance Leave Act, the Schedules That Work Act, and the \nStrong Start for America's Children Act. We need to pass legislation \nthat will give workers paychecks that actually give them a chance to \nmake ends meet, bills like the Raise the Wage Act, the WAGE Act, and \nthe Payroll Fraud Prevention Act.\n  We need to pass legislation that will give every American a chance to \nsucceed and climb into the middle class regardless of gender, sexual \norientation, or any other quality, bills like the Paycheck Fairness \nAct, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and the Equality Act.\n  Tonight, Mr. Speaker, you will hear stories from across the country \nof working families who have played by the rules and worked for long \nhours and still can't seem to make it work. These experiences are \nshared with countless others from my district in New Jersey all the way \nacross the Nation to California.\n  I hope that my colleagues are ready to listen, and, more importantly, \nI hope they are ready to act.\n  It is my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. \nEllison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. I would like to thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I \nalso would like to thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson \nColeman) for her tireless support of the progressive message and her \nlong work in New Jersey, but also here in Congress. Thank you, ma'am.\n  Mr. Speaker, Working Families Day of Action, the day when we came \ntogether to talk about the agenda for working people, is a far cry from \nwhat my Republican colleagues like to talk about on a daily basis. But \nworking people in this country need an advocate; they need somebody in \nCongress to care.\n  I want to tell a quick story about a young lady in my district. Her \nname is Randa Jama, and she is a member of SEIU Local 26, who took a \njob as a wheelchair attendant at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Airport \nlast fall with AirServ, a Delta Airlines subcontractor. It was supposed \nto be a full-time position, but her employer suddenly cut her hours to \nonly 12 hours a week. She explains to me: ``They told me that you are \nworking only Saturday and Sunday from now on.'' Her supervisors would \nstill sometimes ask her at the last minute to stay late or do an extra \nshift, but she can't work at such short notice even though she needs \nthe hours because it is hard to get access to babysitters. She is a \nyoung mom.\n  Now, on behalf of Randa Jama and many other people, I just want to \nmake a few reflections here today, and that is that things are \nabsolutely out of balance. They are out of balance, and the gap between \nrich and everybody else is wider now than it has been in decades; and \nworking people, consumers, and environmental advocates are starting to \ncome together to demand good jobs and shared prosperity.\n  The story today is not necessarily about income inequality. We all \nknow that. But what we may not know is how Americans all over this \ncountry are moving, shaking, and doing what they need to do. Whether it \nis the workers of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers or whether it is \nWorkingAmerica or whether it is the people in the labor movement, the \nFight for $15, people all over this country--Americans--are not taking \nthis situation lying down.\n  We are here today to talk about what working families need and what \nthey are doing. They face stagnating wages and struggle to balance the \ndemands at home and on the job. I am very pleased that when it was \nannounced that Paul Ryan, our colleague, was considering accepting the \nrole of Speaker of the House, he insisted that he would have proper \nwork-life balance and was not going to give up home time. I hope that \nis a signal that we can pursue a shared agenda of the work-life balance \nfor all families all across America.\n  Too many lack access to paid sick leave and affordable child care. \nFor workers who don't have a reliable work schedule, it is often \nimpossible to plan and to pay for child care, rent, transportation, and \ngroceries. People are not working enough hours in many cases, and when \nthey get those hours, they often have to choose between leaving their \nkids at home or taking the hours that they so desperately need. Workers \nare seeing their right to organize erode.\n  Here is another opportunity to tell you a good story, which is true, \nabout a friend named Kipp Hedges. Kipp Hedges worked as a baggage \nhandler for 25 years for Delta. He did an awesome job day in and day \nout and was a member of his union. The people at the Minneapolis-Saint \nPaul Airport said: Hey, we want to form a union.\n  The people who pushed the wheelchairs, the folks who drive the \ndisabled around the airport, and the folks who clean up the airport \nwanted a union. He said: Well, that is a good effort, and I want to \nsupport it.\n  He got fired. He got fired.\n  A lot of people who try to organize unions today get fired for \nengaging in union activity. That is wrong, and it is against the \nNational Labor Relations Act, but people get fired for it anyway. The \nfact is it takes them a long time to ever get any kind of satisfaction.\n  In the mid-1950s, you should note that the percentage of workers \nbelonging to unions was about 33 percent. But between 1973 and 2007, \nprivate sector union membership plummeted all the way down from about \n33, 34 percent down to about 8 percent for men and about from 16 \npercent to 6 percent for women. It is a devastating situation.\n  We all know that when people are in unions they make more. People of \ncolor in unions make more than people of color not in unions. Women in \nunions make more money than women not in unions. Even White men in \nunions, working men, make more money than White men not in unions. The \nunion factor makes a big difference.\n  The decline is estimated to explain at least one-third of the growth \nin wage inequality among men and one-fifth of the growth in wage \ninequality among women. The decline of union density has resulted \ndirectly in Americans of all backgrounds having less money in their \npaychecks.\n  Now, the American economy is growing. This is the richest country in \nthe world, and it is actually doing pretty well. But the share of that \ngrowth has only been going to the very richest few, and it has not been \ndistributed equally.\n  This is a pivotal moment in our history, and Americans are stepping \nup to do something about it. We can see clearly now that tax cuts for \nbig corporations won't help working people. We hear all the time, day \nin and day out, that if you cut taxes for the wealthy and you don't \nmake them obey any health and safety rules, then they will use all that \nextra money to start businesses, buy inventory, start plants, and buy \nequipment, and that will give the rest of us jobs. That kind of \nphilosophy has a name. It is called trickle-down economics. It doesn't \nwork now, and it didn't work then. It never works. As a matter of fact, \nAmericans all over are starting to see that a tax cut for a big \ncorporation or a wealthy individual and allowing them to abandon health \nand safety rules is not going to benefit anybody but them. In fact, it \nis going to hurt us quite a bit.\n  Mr. Speaker, we know that deregulation won't help consumers, and we \nknow that it is not going to help the environment. It will leave our \nconsumers at the tender mercies of the business community, and it will \nleave our communities at the tender mercy of polluters. We can't afford \nthat.\n  Things are radically out of balance, and working people, consumers, \nand\n\n[[Page H7321]]\n\nenvironmental advocates need to band together to push back for shared \nprosperity. We in Congress need to stand with them. One thing we can do \nis support policies and priorities outlined in the Day of Action. One \nthing we can do is stand in support of the policy priorities outlined \nin this Working Families Day of Action, #workingfamilies. We in \nCongress need to stand with them.\n  Today we are highlighting bills that would: one, raise wages; two, \nprotect the right to unionize and organize; three, increase access to \npaid sick leave, family leave, and affordable child care; and, four, \npromote fair scheduling at the workplace and fight workplace \ndiscrimination.\n  Let me just mention a few steps before I turn it over. On the issue \nof fair scheduling, this is a big deal. There are more than 23 million \nworkers in low-wage jobs, and two-thirds of these workers are women. \nWorkers in these jobs often face schedules that are rigid, \nunpredictable, and unstable, which can make it impossible to \nsuccessfully juggle responsibilities on and off the job.\n  I just want to say to any small business who worries about fair \nscheduling: We want to be in conversation with you. We want to talk it \nout and work it out. We know that sometimes things do come up in \nunexpected ways. But for sure, we can discuss, as Americans, how to \nwork out a schedule that is a family-friendly schedule and that meets \nthe needs of the business. What we have now is a completely \nunpredictable environment where people are left either choosing between \nleaving their kids at home or abandoning those hours that are \navailable.\n  I also want to mention something about unions. A typical union worker \nmakes 30 percent more than a nonunion worker. This is a fact. The \ncompanies they work for are thriving and growing. There are tons of \nunion companies all over this country that are making a lot of money. \nThe question is: How big is the CEO's bonus? If we can have some union \nrepresentation, the company can thrive, but the workers can share in \nthat thriving. Right now, workers are eking a living hand to mouth and \npaycheck to paycheck, and the CEO bonuses are out of control.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Unionized African American workers make 36 percent more than \nnonunionized African Americans. Unionized Hispanic women make 46 \npercent more than nonunionized Hispanic women.\n  Let me just wrap up with a little quick story because this really is \nabout people, Mr. Speaker. It is about people. It is not just about the \nstats. It is about people.\n  This is a worker who was required to have open availability and still \ncan't get the hours. She is required to get open availability and still \ncan't get the hours. Her name is Jill, and she works for JCPenney.\n  She writes:\n\n       My name is Jill Ernst. When I interviewed at JCPenney in \n     Minnesota, part of how I got the job was that I had to have a \n     very flexible schedule.\n       I was open all 7 days of the week, but now they only give \n     me less than 35 hours. If they give me less than 34.5 hours, \n     it's a struggle to pay rent and my bills. If they put me on \n     the schedule for 28 hours, I have to figure out how to \n     convince my manager to give me more hours or find someone who \n     is willing to give up hours.\n       My schedule is so inconsistent that, if I need to take paid \n     time off for 1 day, I know that I'll have to take the entire \n     week off or I'll be scheduled a bunch of short days and not \n     be paid for that 1 day off.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to stand up for working families, who had a day \nof action yesterday: #workingfamilies. We know there is inequality. We \nknow the wages have stagnated. We know that it is tough out there for \nworking Americans.\n  But working Americans aren't sitting around taking it on the chin. \nThey are out there demanding a fair share of this economy, and Congress \nshould stand there with them.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Ellison, \nwho has been a very strong and consistent voice on behalf of all \nworking families and, indeed, all of those that are least among us \ncouldn't have a better advocate.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking \nCongresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman for organizing this evening.\n  Many members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus I hope will be \ncoming down and joining us this evening for a tribute to this Working \nFamilies Day of Action, the Working Families Agenda. Mrs. Watson \nColeman listed some of the bills that we have on that agenda.\n  The problems that working families are facing are not intractable. We \nknow that many working women and men are struggling today, but these \nproblems are not unsurmountable. In fact, they could be solved \nrelatively easily if the Republican majority would work with us to pass \nlegislation that would bring U.S. labor policies in line with the rest \nof the industrialized world. We have the legislation. We have the \npublic support. We just need action.\n  One solution, which my colleague, Mr. Ellison, mentioned is to allow \nworkers to join unions. We know that union members earn more and have \nbetter benefits. A study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research \nfound that unionized women earn, on average, $2.50 more per hour, are \n36 percent more likely to have an employ-sponsored benefit plan and 18 \npercent more likely to have paid sick leave.\n  Last week I visited with some O'Hare airport workers who came to \nWashington, baggage handlers, passenger transporters--the people who \npush the wheelchairs--and others. They are hired by contractors like \nProspect Company.\n  Now, they are wearing uniforms, and it looks to me like they are \nhired by either the airline or the airport. But, no, they are hired by \na private contractor. They don't have paid sick leave or health \ninsurance. One woman in the group earned only $8.25 an hour after 14 \nyears on the job.\n  One of their colleagues suffered a miscarriage after her employer \nrefused to give her light duty. The next time she became pregnant, they \noffered her light duty, but only if she agreed to work only one \nafternoon a week.\n  Unionized workers have a different experience. One of the workers in \nthe group was a cabin cleaner hired by Skyline, a union company. He \nearned fair wages, a pension, and benefits.\n  We know that these problems can be solved. But I want to talk a \nlittle bit about how unstable work schedules contribute to the chaotic \nlife of many workers by telling you about Tanya in a letter I received.\n\n       My name is Tanya and I work in an assembly line in a frigid \n     36-degree warehouse chopping lettuce and other items to \n     create grab'n'go foods destined for display cases in \n     Starbucks, Costco, and Walmart.\n       I never know much in advance which days I will work, which \n     hours, or even how long my shift will last. Sometimes I may \n     be scheduled for an 8-hour shift, but get only 4 hours of \n     work because my line's order is completed early. Other times \n     I am at work and on my feet for 12 hours.\n       The unpredictability of my schedule makes it impossible for \n     me to go back to school, which I desperately want to do, \n     because I can't commit to any class schedule. I can't even \n     plan a budget for rent, food or transportation because I have \n     no idea how much money I will make in any given month.\n       It is terrible when I finish the order early and am sent \n     home without working my full shift. It is even worse when I \n     punch out and hear my supervisor say, ``We don't need you \n     tomorrow.'' My heart sinks. It is the last thing I want to \n     hear. I only make $9.25 an hour and sometimes I get only 25 \n     hours a week. That isn't even enough to pay my rent.\n\n  These are stories that all of us in this Congress need to hear, to \ndigest, to understand what the life of people in our districts is like, \nand we need to offer solutions that can improve their lives.\n  They work hard. They are not asking for much. They want good \nschedules. They want fair wages. They want some benefits. And, yes, \neven a little retirement security would be good. We could do that. We \nare the richest country in the world at the richest moment in history.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois. She is always a progressive voice and no greater \nadvocate can we have.\n  I am now delighted to yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nScott), someone who has been a friend for a very long time and whose \nwork I respect and admire tremendously.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Watson Coleman for \nall of her work, particularly the work she has done in New Jersey when \nshe was in the State legislature and now in\n\n[[Page H7322]]\n\nCongress. I want to thank the Congressional caucus for holding this \nSpecial Order on the Working Families Agenda.\n  Since the Republicans took over the House in January 2011, they have \nheld hearing after hearing to make it harder for workers to form a \nunion, they have attempted over 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct, they have been giving tax cuts to the wealthy, and all that time \nthey have been wasting millions of dollars on the Benghazi Committee.\n  Enough is enough. The American people deserve better. We know that \nfamilies across America are struggling to make ends meet. Today I am \ncalling on my colleagues across the aisle to get to work on the \nresponsible solutions that hardworking Americans want and need, \nsolutions that would boost wages, help workers achieve a better balance \nbetween work and family, and level the playing field so all workers can \nget a fair shot at success. This is the Working Families Agenda.\n  This agenda would help workers like India Ford, who is from my \ndistrict. During the Working Families Day of Action yesterday, she \nspoke to Members about how she worked nights and weekends for nearly a \ndozen years in the restaurant industry. As a single mom, this meant not \nbeing home for her child to help her with her homework, missing PTA \nmeetings, and not being able to spend time with her daughter before she \nwent to bed.\n  Finally, she got a new job at a new restaurant with a manager who \noffered to give her a schedule that worked for her family. And do you \nknow what she did? She selected the lunch shift. This simple change was \nprofound because now she is at home with her daughter at night. She is \nable to attend school events and able to help with homework.\n  But basic protections like fair schedules and paid sick leaves \nshouldn't depend on winning the boss lottery. They should be \nfundamental rights of every American.\n  Today workers are more productive than ever, but it has been a long \ntime since most people got a raise. We need to pass legislation to \nraise the minimum wage. We also need to improve the National Labor \nRelations Act because, when workers try to organize and form a union to \nnegotiate for a fair share, more than one-third of the time somebody \ngets fired during the organizational drive.\n  It is time to strengthen the National Labor Relations Act so that \nemployers might think twice before they retaliate. That is what the \nWorkplace Action for a Growing Economy, or the WAGE Act, would do.\n  We need to help workers better balance work and family. We need \nFederal paid sick days and paid family and medical leave laws, which 80 \npercent of the public supports. Workers need flexible schedules, \nschedules that work.\n  It is also past time that we level the playing field so that all \nworking families have a fair shot. It is shameful that, in 2015, \ndiscrimination still shuts many workers out of good-paying jobs.\n  No family should live in fear of a breadwinner being fired for being \ngay, but Federal law still does not provide explicit workplace \nprotections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. \nWorking people deserve more than just a paycheck. They deserve a decent \nlife. It is time to rewrite the rules to make the economy work for \neverybody.\n  Democrats stand ready to take up responsible solutions, like the \nWorking Families Agenda, to boost wages, help workers balance family \nand work, and level the playing field by eliminating discrimination so \nthat everybody has a fair shot.\n  In honor of National Work and Family Month, on Thursday, we will \nintroduce a resolution calling on Congress to hold hearings and votes \non the Working Families Agenda.\n  We already have 90 cosponsors on the resolution, and we won't stop \nthere. For as long as it takes, we will continue to call on our \ncolleagues across the aisle to take up the responsible policies that \nwill help people make a better life for themselves and their families.\n  Again, I want to thank Mrs. Watson Coleman and the Congressional \nProgressive Caucus for coordinating this Special Order hour and thank \nall of my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus who are standing up for \nworking families.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Thank you very much. As always, you have shared \ninformation with us which is illuminating and edifying and, hopefully, \nconvincing of our colleagues that they shall adhere to those things \nthat you were suggesting and recommending.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the stories tonight that I have comes from \nArmando in New Brunswick, New Jersey. For 3\\1/2\\ years, Armando worked \nat a gas station 7 days a week on the night shift. He got one day off \nevery 3 months. Despite working 46 hours each week, he didn't get \novertime pay.\n  In 2007, when his wife Silvia developed eye problems that required a \nnumber of doctors' appointments, Armando's request to leave work early \nto help with her treatment and recovery was denied.\n  In order to care for his wife, Armando would come in from work at 6 \na.m., leave at 7 a.m. to head to the hospital with Silvia, return home \nat 7 p.m., and sleep for just 2 hours before doing it all over again.\n  When he filed a complaint with the Department of Labor, Armando lost \nhis job. On his way out the door, Armando's employer told him he was a \ngood worker. He liked his work, but not the complaint.\n  Mr. Speaker, no one should have to endure this. No one should have to \nwork endlessly with just 4 days off each year just to make ends meet. \nNo one should have to choose between caring for a loved one and losing \nhis or her job.\n  I would like to take this opportunity and share another story with \nyou from New Jersey. This story comes from Josefa, also from New \nBrunswick, New Jersey. She works in a restaurant in the kitchen and \noccasionally as a cashier.\n  When Josefa became pregnant, she had to take 2 months off of work \nwithout pay. When she returned, she asked for the morning shift so that \nshe could go home to be with her newborn baby.\n  They obliged her request, but 2 weeks later they moved her to a 5 \np.m. to 9 p.m. shift. With so few hours and traveling long distances to \nget to the restaurant, Josefa was stuck. She asked her boss for more \nhours, not a raise or a handout, but the chance to work enough hours to \nmake ends meet.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Despite 5 years in her job, Josefa was told that, if she didn't like \nit, she could leave.\n  In Josefa's own words: ``I was a single mom, so it was very \ndifficult; and things like this don't just happen to me--they happen to \nmany others. We just make enough to pay the babysitter and rent, but \nthere are so many expenses.''\n  Mr. Speaker, in the greatest Nation in the world, which we are, we \ncan--and we must--do better. We must stand up for those hardworking \nAmericans who don't want a handout but who simply want a level playing \nfield. We have got to stand up for those working Americans who have to \nwork 46 hours a week, who get 3 or 4 days a year off, who are not able \nto make the decision to be able to care for a sick child, a sick \nspouse, or a sick parent.\n  We can do better than that. It doesn't take a lot for us to simply be \ndecent to those who hold up our economy, who do the jobs that we take \nfor granted every single, solitary day; but without those jobs, we \nwould see what is lacking in our lives.\n  So I ask, Mr. Speaker, that our colleagues in this House--and \nparticularly on the other side of the aisle--spend some time reflecting \non what little it is they need to do to simply give our working \nAmericans a fair shake, a fair chance, time with their families, and \ntime to be able to bring their families into the middle class.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7322-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7322-H7326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RESETTLEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY NATIONAL SECURITY ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin) is recognized for \n60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I feel compelled to speak tonight on an issue \nthat impacts the safety and the security of our country. There is a \ngrave\n\n[[Page H7323]]\n\nthreat to our national security that no one seems to want to talk about \nor to address--we talk around it; we allude to it; we look the other \nway or vainly hope that it will just go away--but sticking our heads in \nthe sand will not make it go away. Instead, the threat is growing, and \na lack of knowledge, foresight, and action on our part could jeopardize \nthe future of our children and our grandchildren. The threat that I am \nreferring to is the Refugee Resettlement Act.\n  Today, I want to share with my colleagues and the Nation some very \nimportant aspects of the Refugee Resettlement Program, which, I hope, \nwill result in serious debate and in an effective reevaluation of our \ncurrent refugee resettlement policies.\n  After events like 9/11 and the Boston Marathon bombing, you would \nthink that America would have implemented a more rigorous screening \nprocess for allowing entry into the United States. On the contrary, as \nthe world becomes increasingly more dangerous, significant security \ngaps remain.\n  President Obama has recently announced his plans to increase from \n70,000 to 85,000 the number of refugees allowed into the United States \nin 2016, next year, and, for 2017, he plans to bring in 100,000. Most \nof the increase is from Syria and western Iraq, a direct result of the \nconflict of ISIS and of Mr. Obama's own weak, disjointed foreign \npolicy.\n  In addition to the alarming national security concerns the \nresettlement program poses, there are significant costs that will be \nplaced on the U.S. taxpayer and on State and local governments. The \nnumbers that we have seen suggest a large economic burden on Americans, \nand we don't even know the full extent of all of the costs of this \nprogram.\n  This is why I have introduced H.R. 3314, the Resettlement \nAccountability National Security Act of 2015. My bill places an \nimmediate moratorium on the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program until the \nGovernment Accountability Office conducts a study to determine the \neconomic costs to the American taxpayer and until Congress analyzes the \nrisks to our national security.\n  According to the U.S. Refugee Admissions' database, nearly 500,000 \nnew refugees have come into the United States under the Refugee \nResettlement Program since President Obama first took office. As a \nfirst-term Representative from Texas, I immediately began to \ninvestigate this issue because the State of Texas and its taxpayers \nhave been asked to take in more refugees than any other State.\n  I found out that no one was asking--much less answering--the \nquestions of who, how, when, where, and how much regarding these \nrefugees. I also found out that aspects of this program are very hard \nto determine even by the government agencies supposedly overseeing it, \nmainly because these agencies contract and provide funding to \nnongovernmental organizations to administer the program and because the \nUnited Nations gets to choose the majority of the refugees who enter \nthe United States.\n  Since the Resettlement Act was signed into law by then-President \nJimmy Carter in 1980, more than 3 million refugees from Third World \ncountries have been permanently resettled in the United States; and as \nI said earlier, nearly 500,000 refugees in just the last 6\\1/2\\ years \nof the Obama administration have been resettled by private Federal \ncontractors across this country in over 190 towns and communities whose \nlocal citizens have little to no say in the matter.\n  The private government-contracted organizations that administer the \nRefugee Resettlement Program and choose the locations of resettlement \nwithin the United States are nonprofit groups. However, these \nnonprofits are paid, literally, millions of Federal dollars. I am very \ntroubled by the Refugee Resettlement Act's cost to America.\n  The stark financial problems of our nearly $19 trillion national debt \nargue against asking the American taxpayer to take on the further \nfinancial burden of tens of billions of dollars for refugee \nresettlement. According to official statistics published by the U.S. \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, more than 90 percent of recent \nrefugees from the Middle East are on welfare. This is alarming from a \nbudgetary standpoint alone.\n  The Congressional Research Service's memo that was issued to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee on the Office of Refugee Resettlement \nAdmissions from the Department of Health and Human Services revealed \nthat 74.2 percent of all refugees up until the year 2013 received food \nstamps while 56 percent received some sort of medical assistance. The \nvery next year, in 2014, the ORR reported that 92 percent of Middle \nEastern refugees were on food stamps, and over 68 percent received \ndirect cash assistance.\n  According to the ORR's annual report to Congress for fiscal year \n2013, the majority of the refugees who enter the United States are \nwithout any income or assets to support themselves and are given \nbenefits paid for by State-administered programs.\n  Families who have children under the age of 18 are eligible for the \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program. Refugees who \nare older, blind, or disabled are eligible for Medicaid benefits and \nSupplemental Security Income, or SSI, whose trust fund right now is \nnearing insolvency. The Federal Government does not reimburse States \nfor the costs or for Medicaid programs, which places a huge economic \ndrain on the State governments. As a former mayor and local school \nboard member, I know of the strain this places on local municipalities \nand school systems as well.\n  Refugees in certain States who do not meet the specifications listed \nabove, such as single adults, childless couples, and two-parent \nfamilies, are still eligible to receive benefits under the Refugee Cash \nAssistance, or RCA, and Refugee Medical Assistance, or RMA, programs \nfor up to the first 8 months that a refugee is in the United States. \nWhile the States are reimbursed for these programs, they cost U.S. \ntaxpayers about $302.4 million each year.\n  For 2013, the Office of Refugee Resettlement allocated $400 million \nfor transitional and medical services, $150 million for social \nservices, and nearly $50 million in targeted assistance. Along with \nseveral other allotments, the total refugee appropriation was over $620 \nmillion.\n  What many Americans do not realize is that refugees are eligible for \nlawful permanent residence, or LPR, status and for all Federal benefits \nafter being here 1 year in the United States. In addition, if they have \nchildren born here in the United States, they are eligible for benefits \nas well. Robert Rector of the respected Heritage Foundation puts the \ncost of accepting just 10,000 Syrian refugees at more than $6.5 billion \nfor a lifetime of costs.\n  Again, I ask: Is this wise for a country that is nearly $19 trillion \nin debt?\n  It sounds noble for the Obama administration to propose bringing in \nmore refugees next year, yet there is no full accounting or \ntransparency over what this will cost the taxpayers at the Federal, \nState, or local level. In a critical time when we must be economically \nresponsible and prioritize our finite resources accordingly, allocating \nover a half a billion dollars for a program with unknown consequences \nis not the best use of our government resources.\n  The question at the end of the day is: Can we really afford not to \ntake a further look at the resettlement program?\n  Let's also take a few minutes to examine the national security \nthreats of this.\n  Perhaps even more disconcerting than the enormous costs are the \nnumerous security risks posed by accepting refugees without properly \nscreening or vetting them. As entire regions of the Middle East \ndissolve into chaos, the ability to conduct the proper vetting of \nrefugees by verifying places of origin, political orientations, \ncriminal records, or sometimes even basic identities is, all too often, \nsimply nonexistent.\n  Already, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI \nDirector James Comey, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh \nJohnson have testified under oath that they cannot properly screen the \nrefugees who are streaming out of these war-torn areas of the Middle \nEast.\n  FBI Director James Comey said he had serious concerns about bringing \nin refugees from conflict zones. We cannot just call up the Damascus or \nLibyan police department and run background checks on these refugees \nfrom conflict zones. There is already a very\n\n[[Page H7324]]\n\ngood chance that, of the 70,000 refugees per year coming into the \nUnited States, terrorists and ISIS followers who are posing as refugees \nmay have slipped through the gaps.\n  ISIS has promised that it will exploit this refugee crisis, and it \nhas already, indeed, been caught attempting to do so. According to a \nsenior Lebanese official, at least 20,000 jihadists have already \ninfiltrated the Syrian refugee camps and are plotting to enter Western \nEurope. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, jihadist groups \ntypically target European countries that have generous and liberal \nimmigration policies and that are allies of the United States.\n  In line with this, the Hurriyet Daily News, in Turkey, stated this \npast February that the Turkish intelligence service had warned police \nthat 3,000 trained jihadists were attempting to cross into Turkey from \nSyria and Iraq and then make their way into Western Europe to target \ncountries involved in the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State coalition. What \nis even more alarming is that the news publication reports that some of \nthe members of the group, including their leaders, have already entered \nTurkey and have already established cells of terrorist operation.\n  Palestinians and citizens from Syria who are between the ages of 17 \nto 25 have entered Turkey as refugees and plan to travel to Europe \nthrough Bulgaria in order to attack anti-ISIS coalition-member \ncountries. In fact, one ISIS operative has claimed more than 4,000 \ncovert ISIS gunmen have been smuggled into Western nations and are \ncurrently hiding amongst innocent refugees. He then warned ``just \nwait,'' according to the International Business Times.\n  In May, the International Business Times also cited Libyan Government \nadviser Abdul Basit Haroun, who warned that ISIS operatives were being \nsmuggled into Europe by boat. Haroun said that ISIS militants are \ntaking advantage of the crisis by using boats for their own operatives \nwhom they want to send to Europe, and the European authorities can't \ndifferentiate between those from ISIS and the actual refugees. If this \nis not disturbing, then I don't know what is.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  There are also thousands of former refugees who have settled in \nEurope over the past several decades now going to join ISIS in the \nMiddle East. According to Gilles de Kerchove, the European Union's \ncounterterrorism chief, nearly 4,000 Europeans are estimated to have \nleft Western Europe and gone and joined ISIS.\n  We have even seen this in the United States refugee settlement \ncommunities as well. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, there have been 22 \nyoung Somali men that we know of since 2007 that left their new refugee \nhome in the United States to join the terrorist organization al \nShabaab.\n  In Somalia, they are fighting against U.S. allies and U.S.-trained \ntroops. There are 27,000 Somali refugees in the Minneapolis area, and \nPresident Obama's plans call for thousands more.\n  In Texas, 37-year-old Bilal Abood is an Iraqi American who is \nsuspected to have come to the United States as a refugee or an asylum \nseeker in the year 2009. When the FBI went to his home, they found \nevidence of ties with ISIS, including pledging an oath to its leader, \nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n  A former cab driver in Virginia, Liban Haji Mohamed, who came to the \nUnited States as a Somali refugee, is on the FBI's Most Wanted \nTerrorist list for providing material support to al Qaeda and al \nShabaab. He is considered particularly dangerous because he worked to \nrecruit other U.S. terrorists for these terrorist organizations. He \nlived in Alexandria, Virginia, just a few miles across the river from \nwhere I am standing right now.\n  According to Mike Mauro, a professor of homeland security and \nnational security analyst at the Clarion Project, a poll was conducted \nin November of 2014 of 900 Syrian refugees. In this poll of recent \nrefugees, 13 percent, or roughly one out of seven, claim to have \nsympathies toward ISIS. Alarmingly and incredibly, that amounts to a \npotential 130 ISIS sympathizers.\n  The Immigration and Nationality Act, known as the INA, specifies that \napplicants for the resettlement program be subject to various grounds \nof inadmissibility, including criminal, security, and public health \ngrounds.\n  The grounds of inadmissibility applying to refugee applicants include \nthe broad terrorism-related inadmissibility grounds, or TRIG, in \nsection 212 of the INA, the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n  Very disturbing is the fact that, beginning in 2005, the Department \nof Homeland Security, the State Department, and the Department of \nJustice began exercising their discretionary authority to waive these \ncategories of inadmissibility for refugee applicants.\n  Then, in 2015, the Department of Homeland Security began implementing \nnew additional exemptions for individuals if they only provided \ninsignificant or certain limited material support to terrorists--this \nincludes routine commercial and social transactions--or provided \nhumanitarian assistance to undesignated terrorist organizations.\n  As of this past June, the United States Government has granted more \nthan 15,560 TRIG exemptions to refugee applicants. That is right. More \nthan 15,000 times the Government of the United States has waived past \nparticipation with terrorist organizations so that refugees could come \nand enter into the United States. This must stop.\n  The warning signs are everywhere of the potential of terrorist \nsuspects posing as refugees while President Obama redoubles his efforts \nto bring these people in the United States and put at risk the lives \nand safety of the American people.\n  We have recently had two terrorist gunmen in Garland, Texas, who \nlinked themselves to ISIS; the shooter in Chattanooga, Tennessee, who \nkilled five U.S. servicemembers, recruiters; and the Tsarnaev brothers \nin the Boston Marathon bombing, who killed three spectators and injured \nan estimated 260 others. What we need to ask ourselves is: How did the \nFederal Government fail the American people with respect to vetting \nthese refugees?\n  Of course, not all refugees are Islamic jihadists. Indeed, most are \nnot. But the few that are pose a very real threat to the safety and \nsecurity of the American people. The 9/11 terrorist attackers numbered \n19, the Boston terrorists only 2.\n  As elected representatives, our responsibility to the American \ncitizens and our communities should be our number one priority.\n  The Refugee Resettlement Program has long operated under the radar of \nmost Americans. The average American has no idea that this resettlement \nprogram is a U.N. plan that chooses which refugees come to the United \nStates and that the United States taxpayer foots the bill.\n  But as it has grown over the last few years and its implementation \nhas become a threat to small communities, saddling them with the \nproblems that refugee resettlement brings without their say-so and \noften even without their knowledge, residents in several States, \nincluding Texas, are starting to ask hard questions.\n  No longer satisfied with past answers, they are showing up at \ntownhall meetings, starting blogs and email lists, digging up \ninformation and informing their friends and neighbors of what is really \ngoing on with refugee resettlement in such diverse American communities \nas Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota; Lewiston, Maine; Amarillo, Texas; \nthe State of Idaho; and many other locations, just to name a few\n  To really see what America's future will be, we have to look no \nfurther than western Europe, which has taken in over half a million \nrefugees just this year, not to mention the millions over the past \ndecades.\n  A very popular destination for refugees coming to Europe is Sweden. \nThe country is currently facing a large-scale refugee crisis, and the \ngovernment does not know where these refugees will live, how they will \nwork, and who will foot the bill for them.\n  According to Boverket, the Swedish National Board of Housing, \nBuilding and Planning, Sweden needs to build half a million homes by \nthe year 2020. This costly housing initiative will cost about $387 \nmillion a year and will only fund half of this by 2020.\n  Sweden is also known for its horrific rape numbers. Recent refugees--\nand now their Swedish-born children--are responsible for more than half \nof those convicted of rape, murder, and robbery.\n\n[[Page H7325]]\n\n  Clearly, the existing approach to addressing the plight of refugees \nis simply not working. Are these really the sort of problems that we \nwant here at home and the United States?\n  Again, I am not saying that brutal rapes, gang violence, and domestic \nterror are the norms, but, rather, they are the risks that have been \nseen in Europe that come along with accepting large numbers of refugees \nwithout proper vetting and screening.\n  While refugee crises are tragic, crimes committed by transplanted \npeople against unsuspecting, unprotected victims in their own country \nare even more tragic.\n  The five wealthiest countries on the Arabian Peninsula--Saudi Arabia, \nUnited Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain--have not taken in a \nsingle refugee that we know of.\n  Instead, they have argued that accepting large numbers of Syrians is \na threat to their safety, as terrorists could be hiding within an \ninflux of people.\n  The only help so far from Saudi Arabia is an offer to build 200 \nmosques in Germany. It is quite apparent that the fear of importing \nterrorists is real for American communities if Syria's own neighbors \nwill not admit these refugees.\n\n  My investigation of the refugee resettlement policies have also led \nto a concern for the most persecuted religious minority in the entire \nMiddle East region: Christians.\n  Of the nine nongovernmental organizations which receive Federal \ngrants and contracts to resettle refugees, six are designated religious \ncharities. However, I could find no mission statements from any of them \nabout saving Christians.\n  The U.N. connection could explain why so many non-Christian refugees \nare chosen to be brought into the United States while persecuted \nChristians in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and other nations there have a very \nhard time getting within sight of the Statue of Liberty.\n  In fact, the glaring shortcoming of the U.N. refugee program is that \nit falls short of helping one of the most persecuted groups around the \nworld, and that is Christians.\n  According to reporting by Nina Shea and Elliott Abrams, the United \nNations High Commission on Refugees refuses to classify Christians as a \npersecuted group eligible for resettlement on this basis.\n  Why? Because our Department of State chooses to adhere to a \ndefinition of refugees as people persecuted by their own government. \nThe murders of Christian men, the rapes of Christian women, and the \nbutchery of Christian children apparently do not count. These people \nare routinely beheaded, crucified, burned at the stake, sold into \nslavery, or have their property confiscated.\n  In Iraq, ISIS has blown up dozens of churches, kidnapped Christians \nand held them for ransom, even after they have already murdered them. \nLast summer they started marking Christian homes with a red letter \n``N'' for ``Nazarene'' before they took the homes and exiled the \nowners.\n  Unfortunately, for many Christians, exile is a better option than the \ninhumane atrocities that many in the region are currently facing. Many \nare sexually enslaved by ISIS, like Kayla Mueller.\n  Kayla Mueller was a Christian American human rights activist from \nPrescott, Arizona. She was taken captive in August 2013 by ISIS in \nSyria after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital. After she was \ntaken by the terrorist group, she was repeatedly raped by Abu Bakr al-\nBaghdadi, who is the leader of ISIS.\n  There are still many other Christian ISIS prisoners, including 460 \ntaken from Syria and many more who have already been killed. Many have \nbeen taken by al Shabaab in Africa. Pope Francis has even gotten \ninvolved and is calling this targeting of Christians a form of \ngenocide.\n  Many Christians who want to flee persecution face the difficult \ndecision of where to turn and where will they be safe.\n  A decision of how to flee and what mode of transportation to take can \nbe critical to Christian families. It was reported this past April that \n12 Christian migrants trying to get to Europe by boat were simply \nthrown overboard by fellow Muslim migrants and drowned.\n  Most are afraid to go to the U.N. refugee camps and fear the actions \ntaken by some of their more radicalized Muslim neighbors within the \ncamps. There are very few Christians in these camps and other non-\nMuslims because they fear for their own personal safety.\n  Unfortunately for these persecuted religious minorities, the only \npersons able to qualify easily for U.N. refugee resettlement are those \npeople who are in these U.N. refugee camps. There in the camp they can \nbe designated as priority 1 eligible by the United Nations High \nCommission on Refugees, and then they qualify for resettlement.\n  This is critical to know because the U.N. refugee camps are the only \nsource from which the U.S. will accept U.N. refugees under this \nresettlement act. Since very few Christians feel safe in these camps, \nit is apparent that this is the reason that less than 4 percent of the \nU.N. resettled refugees are Christians.\n  Former Archbishop George Carey of Canterbury said it best when he \nstated that this inadvertently discriminates against the very Christian \ncommunities most victimized by the inhuman butchers of the so-called \nIslamic State.\n  It is a sad reality for Christians in this part of the world right \nnow. They are so desperate to leave that they have said that they will \ngo almost anywhere except the U.N. camps to try to rebuild their lives.\n  There is another method, however, other than the resettlement act by \nwhich it is possible to admit Christians and other groups into the U.S. \nas refugees. The U.S. State Department has the authority to designate \ncertain groups like Christians as priority 2 refugees, which would \nenable them to enter the United States without having to be living in a \nU.N. refugee camp.\n  The U.S. State Department needs to act on this immediately. It defies \nlogic that we would want to potentially import the problems of the \nMiddle East into the very heart of America.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  The recent terrorist attacks in Garland, Texas; Chattanooga, \nTennessee; Oklahoma City, and the Boston Marathon should serve as a \ndire warning.\n  A report submitted by the Obama administration for proposed refugee \nadmissions says that in the year 2014 the median age of refugees from \nIraq and Syria was 28 and 23, respectively, and over half of these \nrefugees were of working age, between 16 years and 64 years of age. In \nfact, according to U.N. statistics, 65 percent of these Syrian refugees \nare military-age males, who should be defending their own country and \npose a risk of having ISIS infiltrators among them.\n  Again, we don't need to look any further than Europe for all the \nevidence that we need to see the dire consequences for this program to \nAmerican safety and security.\n  According to the Gatestone Institute, half a million known migrants \nand refugees came to the European Union in the first 8 months of 2015. \nThis number will most likely reach 1 million by the end of this year, \nand this does not include the number of individuals who slipped in \nundetected.\n  Of the maritime arrivals in Europe, the top countries of origin are \nSyria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Nigeria, Albania, Pakistan, Somalia, \nSudan, and Iraq. For the refugees who arrived by land, the top three \ncountries of origin are Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.\n  There has been much criminal activity, including multiple cases of \nrape, among refugee camps. On August 6 of this year, police finally \nreported that a young 13-year-old girl was raped by another asylum \nseeker at a refugee facility in Detmold, Germany. The rape actually had \ntaken place in June, but the police had kept quiet about it for several \nmonths, not wanting to alarm the German local population. It was only \nafter a local media outlet had published this story about the crime \nthat it came to light.\n  According to German social work organizations, large numbers of women \nand young girls housed in refugee shelters in Germany are being raped, \nsexually assaulted, or forced into prostitution by male asylum seekers.\n  An editorial comment in the German newspaper Westfalen-Blatt said \npolice are refusing to go public about the crimes involving refugees \nbecause they don't want to give legitimacy to criticism of the dangers \nof mass, unchecked migration from the Middle East.\n\n[[Page H7326]]\n\n  In this refugee population, there are many elements that neither \nEurope nor the United States would ever invite in, and the challenge is \nseparating them. Europe is dealing with a stark reality that it does \nnot want to face and would prefer to turn a blind eye.\n  Police in the Bavarian town of Mering have issued a warning to German \nparents not to allow their children to go outside unaccompanied. In \nanother Bavarian town of Pocking, administrators at the Wilhelm-Diess-\nGymnasium have told parents not to let their daughters wear revealing \nclothes to avoid ``misunderstandings'' by the large number of refugees \nin their town.\n  These are not the only troubling actions unfolding in Germany, a \ncountry which has pledged to take more refugees than any other country \nin the European Union. Levels of violent crime brought about by the \ngroups from the Balkans and the Middle East have turned certain cities \nsuch as Duisburg into no-go zones for police, according to a police \nreport from their headquarters in the North Rhine-Westphalia region. \nThis is the most populous state in Germany. This report states that the \nability of the police to maintain public order ``cannot be guaranteed \nover the long term,'' according to Der Spiegel, the newsmagazine which \nleaked the report.\n  There are districts where immigrant gangs are taking over entire \nmetro trains for themselves. Local residents and businesspeople are \nbeing intimidated and silenced. People taking trams during the evening \nand nighttime describe their experiences as living nightmares. \nPolicemen, and especially policewomen, are subject to high levels of \naggressiveness and disrespect.\n  Unassimilated refugees and immigrants have turned large sections of \nEurope's great cities into no-go zones where even the police will not \ngo. Jewish emigration from France is the highest since World War II.\n  In the near term, nothing will change, according to this report. The \nreasons for this: the high rate of unemployment, the lack of job \nprospects for immigrants without qualifications for the German labor \nmarket, and ethnic tensions among the migrants themselves. The Duisburg \npolice department now wants to reinforce its presence on the streets \nand track offenders much more consistently than before.\n  I am not suggesting that every refugee or even the majority of these \nrefugees are engaged in such criminal activity. It is a very small \nnumber. But what I am suggesting is that there are some among them who \nhave terrorist intentions that have infiltrated these communities, and \nit is difficult to screen them out. Even one is too many.\n  President Obama's plan is a potential national disaster waiting to \nhappen. No one is saying that we should not help those who are in \nrefugee camps. We should. America is the most generous and \ncompassionate country in the world. We already are spending $4.5 \nbillion in humanitarian aid, food, shelter, and medicine for these \ndisplaced persons in these refugee camps. What we should not do is \nendanger the American people and the safety of our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Each of us serving in this body took an oath to support and defend \nthe Constitution against enemies, both foreign and domestic, and ISIS \nhas already exploited this U.N. program to infiltrate Europe. We have a \nsworn duty to prevent foreign enemies from entering the United States \nand allowing them to become domestic enemies, particularly at taxpayer \nexpense. The President's plan and the current policy of the Refugee \nResettlement Act defies all logic.\n  I am sure that I will be criticized and attacked for making this \nspeech and sharing these very disturbing facts with you today, but I am \ncompelled by the oath of office that I took when I was sworn in as a \nMember of the United States Congress to put the safety and security of \nthe American people above political correctness.\n  I didn't come to Congress to be politically correct. I came to uphold \nthe U.S. Constitution and to protect our national security. Protecting \nour American way of life, the greatest experiment in liberty and \nfreedom in all human history, is our highest calling as elected leaders \nof this great Nation.\n  Those who criticize me for these remarks should instead turn their \ncriticism toward those who are exploiting refugees and to the \nterrorists who are infiltrating these very refugees who are entering \nEurope and the United States.\n  I encourage my colleagues to further investigate the Federal Refugee \nResettlement Program and to join me in calling for a moratorium on the \nPresident's proposal while we fully examine the costs to the American \ntaxpayer and the national security implications of his policies.\n  Let us reassert our congressional authority over the refugee program \nand put the safety and security of the American people above all else. \nIt is crucial that Congress take a look at the results of my proposed \nreassessment of the Refugee Resettlement Program, its cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer, its threat to our national security, and its impact \non our small towns and communities by passing H.R. 3314, the \nResettlement Accountability National Security Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7326-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7326-H7329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE HONORABLE FRANK M. JOHNSON, THE HIDDEN HAND OF JUSTICE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al \nGreen) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership for \nallowing us to have this time to discuss H. Con. Res. 84. This \nrecognizes the works of the Honorable Frank M. Johnson, a Federal \njudge.\n  Not only was he a Federal judge, he was one of the greatest unsung \nheroes of the civil rights movement, a lawyer par excellence, a great \nstudent of jurisprudence, and, I would daresay, he was the hidden hand \nof justice in the civil rights movement.\n  Before continuing, however, let me just thank some additional \npersons. It is appropriate that I thank the six original cosponsors of \nthis resolution. Of course, we would mention the Honorable Alcee \nHastings of Florida, and we thank him for signing on to this \nresolution. We also would like to thank the Honorable Sheila Jackson \nLee of Texas, the Honorable Gregory Meeks of New York, the Honorable \nEleanor Holmes Norton of Washington, D.C., and I especially want to \nthank the Honorable Terri Sewell of Alabama, because Judge Johnson was \nfrom Alabama. She has signed on to this resolution, meaning that she \nhas given her approval. I am grateful to her. She is a great, great \nMember of this body and has done quite well in representing the people \nof her district and, indeed, her State and her country. And, finally, \nthe Honorable Frederica Wilson of Florida. All of these Members have \nsigned on to this resolution honoring the Honorable Frank M. Johnson.\n  The Honorable Frank M. Johnson was a unique person in American \nhistory, unique in that he was one of those people that made real the \ngreat and noble American ideals: liberty and justice for all; \ngovernment of the people, by the people, for the people. He truly--he \ntruly--made justice more than a word. It meant something to him, and, \nas a result, people were able to benefit from justice. Justice was more \nthan a word for the Honorable Frank Johnson.\n  He did not have it easy, however. He was appointed to this Federal \nDistrict Court by the Honorable President Dwight Eisenhower in November \nof 1955. After being appointed, he immediately had a very difficult \ncase come before him. This is when we learned of the character of Frank \nM. Johnson. His character was such that he refused to allow himself to \nbe intimidated.\n  Over the course of his life, he had a cross burned on the lawn of his \nyard. Over the course of his life, and he lived for 80 years, his \nmother's house was bombed. It was thought that it was his home. It was \nbombed by the KKK. He was a person who had, as a classmate in law \nschool, Governor George Wallace.\n  He was a person who probably could not have been predicted to be one \nof the most significant persons in the civil rights movement at the \ntime he was appointed to the bench. There are people who, for whatever \nreasons, decide that they are going to do the just and honorable thing, \nand Frank M. Johnson was such a person.\n  While he lived, he had to have 24-hour protection--24-hour \nprotection--\n\n[[Page H7327]]\n\nfor his very life because there were those who saw him as a threat to \nthe way of life that existed at that time. They wanted to end his life \nbecause of his being perceived as a threat to their way of life.\n  What is it about him that caused people to want to burn a cross on \nhis lawn, that caused persons to bomb his mother's house thinking that \nit was his? What was it about this man that caused people to believe \nthat he was such a huge instrumentality that was moving the South in a \ndirection that they did not want to see it move into?\n  Well, he was one of those persons who actually proved, Mr. Speaker, \nthat Black lives matter. He proved that Black lives were as important \nas any other lives, that all lives matter, but he proved that Black \nlives matter by his decisions that he made.\n  I indicated earlier that one of his first decisions, Mr. Speaker, was \na difficult one. It was a case that involved the bus boycott in \nMontgomery, Alabama. It was a case wherein Rosa Parks, the Alabama \nfemale of African ancestry, took a seat on a bus; and after taking that \nseat, she was required to move because, as others came on the bus who \nwere White, she would have to move, as would any other Black person, \nand give White persons an opportunity to have seats on the bus. She \nwould either have to move back or, if all of the other seats were \nfilled, she would have to stand. She refused.\n  As a result of that refusal, Mr. Speaker, a civil rights movement was \nborn in Montgomery, Alabama, and a protest movement was led by the \nHonorable Dr. Martin Luther King. As a result of this protest movement, \nmany people galvanized. They came together, and they decided that they \nwould not ride the buses and that they would transport themselves to \nand from work.\n  Well, one might think that this boycott was the reason that the bus \nline was eventually integrated after about a year of protestations. \nBut, Mr. Speaker, the hidden hand of justice was the Honorable Frank M. \nJohnson, because he, on a three-judge panel, concluded that the Brown \ndecision, which applied to schools, should be applied to public \naccommodations, should be applied to public transportation. He \nconvinced another judge to do so, and, as a result, they issued an \norder that desegregated the buses in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  He was the hidden hand of justice. The protest movement was \nabsolutely necessary, but he showed that Black lives mattered when he \ndecided that he was going to stand for justice and that he was going to \nissue that order integrating the bus lines.\n  Later on, in the case of Gomillion v. Lightfoot, this is a case that \ninvalidated the City of Tuskegee's plan to dilute Black voting \nstrength.\n  At that time, it was not unusual for Black voting strength to be \ndiluted such that Blacks could not get representation. We were not \nrepresented in Congress to the extent that we are today.\n  At that time, gerrymandering was almost commonplace to make sure that \nBlacks did not have the opportunity to represent constituents in city \ncouncils, and not only city councils, but in county government, as \nState Representatives, as State Senators, gerrymandering.\n  Well, it was the Honorable Frank M. Johnson that invalidated that \nplan that they had and ordered the redrawing of the lines.\n  In the United States v. Alabama, in 1961, literacy tests were \nrequired for Blacks, but they weren't required for Whites. Blacks had \nto take the test, which was impossible to pass, in many cases. How many \nbubbles are there in a bar of soap, all sorts of ridiculous things, \nwere required of Blacks.\n  But this judge, the hidden hand of justice, the man who believed that \nBlack lives mattered, required Black people be registered to vote to \nthe same extent as the least qualified White person was registered to \nvote. Allowing Black people to register allowed more Black \nrepresentation to manifest itself in the years that followed.\n  In the case of Lewis v. Greyhound, 1961, this case involved the \nHonorable John Lewis, who is now a Member of Congress. It involved \nprotesting at a bus station. It involved being seated at a counter and \ninvolved desegregating the bus lines and the bus stations. John Lewis \nwas one of several persons who were arrested, and this violated his \ncivil rights.\n  It was the Honorable Frank M. Johnson that required the desegregation \nof the bus depots across the length and breadth of the country. By \ndirectly doing it in Montgomery, Alabama, it eventually became the law \nacross the land.\n  Again he demonstrated that Black lives mattered to him, and he moved \non it. He didn't just believe it. He acted on his beliefs.\n  In the case of Sims v. Frink, in 1962, this had to do with Alabama \nreapportioning. Alabama had not reapportioned since 1900. The lines had \nbeen left as they were because, by leaving them as they were, they \ncould keep certain people from having a right to vote or having their \nvote really count in the scheme of one man, one vote.\n  It was Frank M. Johnson who required that one man, one vote, \nprinciples be utilized, giving Black people a greater voice in voting.\n  In Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, in 1963, this was the \nfirst statewide desegregation of schools, and it happened in Alabama. \nIt happened because Frank M. Johnson concluded that Black lives \nmattered. He ordered the desegregation of these schools, and it was the \nbeginning of something that would spread across this country.\n  He was a part of the avant-garde of the civil rights movement, but he \ndid so with a pen from the bench. As a matter of fact, he did not wear \na robe when he was on the bench and he did not have a gavel. He \nbelieved that, if you are a just judge and you are going to follow the \nlaw, you didn't need the robe and you didn't need the gavel. You just \nneeded to follow the law. And he did so.\n  He did so in the case of Williams v. Wallace. This is a landmark case \nin that it involved the Honorable Dr. Martin Luther King.\n  As we know now, persons assembled at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. They \nassembled there for the purpose of marching from Selma to Montgomery. \nWhen they assembled at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they decided that, in \nmarching from Selma to Montgomery, they would assemble themselves at a \nchurch, and they marched from that church to the bridge.\n  If you have not been to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, you should do so \nbecause, as you do so, you will see that that bridge has an arch. As \nyou move across the bridge, you can't see from the start of your \nmovement to the bridge what lies on the other side.\n  But on the other side of the Edmund Pettus Bridge were men, members \nof the constabulary. They were on horses. They had clubs. And these men \non horses, with clubs, confronted the marchers, who were peaceful. They \nwere unarmed.\n  They were Black. They were White. They were multi-ethnic in terms of \ntheir ethnicity. They were persons of goodwill who only wanted to \nexercise their freedom of movement to demonstrate, to move from one \ncity to another, protesting the way African Americans were being \ntreated in the South in terms of their voting rights, in terms of their \ninability to receive the same treatment as others under the law.\n  Well, in doing this, in marching from Selma to Montgomery, when they \nencountered these officers with clubs, these officers beat them.\n  The Honorable John Lewis was a part of the march. He has said on many \noccasions that he thought he was going to die.\n  They beat them all the way back to the church where they started--all \nthe way back to the church--blood on their heads, on their bodies, on \nthe ground, on people, as they tried to flee and tried to fend for \nthemselves against these members of the constabulary.\n  The marchers returned later to march again, but this time they had \ngone to court and they had appeared before the Honorable Frank M. \nJohnson. He issued an order requiring the constabulary to get out of \nthe way and allow the marchers to move from Selma to Montgomery.\n  Few people are aware that Bloody Sunday was followed by an order from \nthe hidden hand of justice, the Honorable Frank M. Johnson. I would \ndaresay that that order and that movement, that march, were the basis \nfor\n\n[[Page H7328]]\n\nthe passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1965. It passed shortly \nthereafter.\n  The President signed it into law. As a result, many people who are in \nCongress today are here because that march took place and because the \nHonorable Judge, the hidden hand of justice, Frank M. Johnson, signed \nan order requiring the constabulary to get out of the way.\n  What is interesting about this order, Mr. Speaker, is that it was \nissued by his classmate, whom I mentioned earlier, Governor George \nWallace. Governor George Wallace and Frank M. Johnson were at constant \nodds with each other. They were at odds with each other not only as it \nrelated to this march, but as it related to the integration of schools.\n  As a matter of fact, there were many people in Alabama who were of \ngoodwill who started to call Frank M. Johnson the real Governor of \nAlabama because he stood toe to toe with Governor Wallace and, in so \ndoing, made real what the Governor had the opportunity to do, but \nrefused to do.\n  The Honorable Frank M. Johnson, the hidden hand of justice in Alabama \nand the United States of America.\n  In White v. Cook, 1966, he ruled that Blacks should be allowed to and \nmust serve on juries in Alabama. Black people have not always had the \nopportunity to serve, even when the law said they had the right to \nserve.\n  As a result of not having the right to serve by virtue of the way \npeople interpreted the law, they were denied service on juries. It was \nthe Honorable Frank M. Johnson that permitted this to happen by his \nruling.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left?\n  I would like to make sure that I properly cover certain materials.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 14 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Frank M. Johnson, in making this \nruling that allowed Blacks to serve on juries, was taking a giant step \nforward in that he was bringing Black people into the courthouse and \nthey were now allowed to come right in and go right in and sit up \nfront.\n  Black people haven't always been able to go into the courthouse and \nsit on the front row. They haven't always been respected when they have \nbeen in the courtroom.\n  In my lifetime, I have heard African American lawyers referred to as \n``Boy'' in the courtrooms of this country.\n  In my lifetime, I have seen African American lawyers required to wait \nwhile White lawyers were being served. In my lifetime, I have seen some \nthings that I am not proud of.\n  But, in my lifetime, I have seen great changes take place, and many \nof these changes took place because of people like Frank M. Johnson, \nunsung heroes, people who have not received the kinds of accolades, the \nkinds of kudos, that they merit for the actions that they took and the \nbravery that they exhibited.\n  But tonight I want to make sure that at least one person who was an \nunsung hero gets the notoriety that he deserves. Of course, I am \nspeaking of the Honorable Frank M. Johnson.\n  In 1966, United States v. Alabama, he ruled that the poll tax was \nunconstitutional, the poll tax. At one time, you had to pay a tax to \nvote. Unfortunately, that time has returned.\n  In my State, the State of Texas, we now have a poll tax. That time \nhas returned. Frank M. Johnson declared it unconstitutional, giving \nBlack people the right to vote without having to pay a fee.\n  Well, in my State, the State of Texas, we find now that, if you want \nto vote and you don't have a license to carry a gun and you don't have \ncertain other IDs, well, you will have to then acquire an ID to vote. \nAnd while the State of Texas will provide at no cost a certain type of \nID, these IDs are predicated upon your having proof of birth, a birth \ncertificate.\n  I took the test myself. I went to the polls to vote, and I went to \nthe polls without my voter registration intentionally, I might add, and \nI voted a provisional ballot.\n  I was given time to go out and acquire the proper identification. I \ndid it knowing that I would bring the proper identification, and I did \nso. And I voted timely. But I did this because I wanted to see what \ndoes one go through to simply get a birth certificate.\n  Well, I applied for my birth certificate. I was born in the State of \nLouisiana. I applied for it and, to this day, I have not received my \nbirth certificate. This was about a year ago that I applied for it. I \nstill have not received it from the State of Louisiana. I applied for \nit, paid the fee.\n  Now, why am I saying it is a poll tax? Because in the State of Texas, \nif you get your birth certificate from the State of Texas, then there \nis a provision for indigent persons to acquire the certificate and the \nID and you can do this without a fee.\n  But if you are from out of state, you have got to pay that fee to \nthat out-of-state agency to get your birth certificate so that you can \nget it to the State of Texas and you can get your ID.\n  The point is paying for the right to vote is a poll tax. No one \nshould have to pay to vote, no one. Frank M. Johnson outlawed the poll \ntax in the State of Alabama.\n  I pray that we have some other Frank M. Johnsons on the bench who \nwill eventually outlaw the poll tax in the State of Texas because, to \nFrank M. Johnson, Black lives mattered. They mattered.\n  They ought to matter to other people who understand that invidious \ndiscrimination still exists, that people are finding clever ways to \nkeep people from voting today, just as they did many, many years ago.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  The struggle for human rights, human dignity, civil rights is not \nover. There are still challenges before us. There are still people who \nare in high places who are making it difficult for people to vote.\n  I thank God for the Frank M. Johnsons of the world who are willing to \nstand for justice and make it possible for people to have the same \nright to vote as other people have had in this country for many years.\n  I know that there are some who would say: ``Well, you have got the \nright to vote; you ought to have an ID.'' Well, I don't have a problem \nwith people having an ID. I do have a problem when you have to pay for \nthat ID so that you can vote. Voting is separate, and it is sacred in \nthis country. We ought not require people to have to pay a fee to \nacquire an ID so that they can vote.\n  So he declared the poll tax unconstitutional in 1966.\n  In 1970, in Smith v. the YMCA of Montgomery, he ordered the \ndesegregation of the Montgomery chapter of the YMCA.\n  The YMCA has not always had its doors open to Blacks, and many of the \ninstitutions in this country who did open doors opened only the back \ndoor. I know. I have been to the back doors. I know what it is like to \ngo to a bus station and have to go to the back door. I know what it is \nlike to go to a food service establishment and have to go to the back \ndoor to get your food. I have been there. I know what it is like to \ntravel across country and to have to pick your places to stop because \nin certain places it was known that you were not permitted to stop; and \nin those places where you were permitted to stop, you would have to use \nback doors a good amount of the time.\n  So I know what discrimination looks like. I have seen the face of \ndiscrimination, and I understand how it hurts people. I understand the \npain that is inflicted upon people. I am proud that we can now go \nthrough front doors because of judges like Frank M. Johnson, who had \nthe courage to order the desegregation of public accommodation \nfacilities in this country. I am so proud that there are unsung heroes \nwho took a stand when others would simply conclude that this is not the \nright time, the country is not ready.\n  There were many other judges who could have taken the same position \nthat Frank M. Johnson took, but they didn't do so. It takes courage to \ndo the righteous thing. Frank M. Johnson was a righteous person, and he \nhad the courage to do the righteous thing.\n  In the case of the NAACP v. Dothard, which required Alabama to hire \none Black State trooper for every White State trooper, which was to be \ndone until parity was achieved, it was the Honorable Frank M. Johnson \nthat ordered this be done.\n  Frank M. Johnson understood the necessity to have the DPS in Alabama\n\n[[Page H7329]]\n\ndemonstrate diversity. He understood that if you have a diverse police \ndepartment, Department of Public Safety, that you are going to get \npeople there who can help other people be better people. It was by \ndoing this that we got more Blacks into the Department of Public Safety \nin Alabama and, as a result, across the country later on. He had the \ncourage to do this because he knew that Black lives matter.\n  Now, this is not to say that only a certain color of person is going \nto make a good peace officer, not true. People of all hues, of all \nethnicities, of all races, of all creeds can make good peace officers. \nBut there are some who are not good, and those have to be removed from \ntheir positions. You ought not have people who don't respect all \npeople, but especially at this time when we are seeing so many things \nhappen to Black people, that don't understand that Black lives matter.\n  I cannot resist the temptation to avoid speaking about what happened \nto that young girl in South Carolina. I think the sheriff did the right \nthing. He has removed that officer from his department. But there is \nsomething about that case that I think we need to talk about very \nbriefly, tersely, this: If the camera's eye had not been there, I \nconclude, I prognosticate, he would not have been fired. He would not \nhave been fired without the camera's eye.\n  The sheriff, himself, said that two adults who were there, who saw \nwhat happened--two adults, one a teacher--said they thought the \nofficer's behavior was correct. They didn't have a problem with the \nofficer's behavior. It was the eye of the camera, Mr. Speaker, that \nmade the difference. The camera brings to us what we cannot acquire \nwhen we get people with conflicting stories about what happened. We had \nan opportunity to see for ourselves what happened.\n  This is why we need body cameras. This is why Congressman Cleaver and \nI have introduced the CAM TIP Act in this Congress, so that people \nacross the length and breadth of this country can be protected who are \nofficers. If they have the body camera on, you have the evidence of \nwhat occurred. Citizens are protected. Officers can't have these \nfrivolous charges made real. They will help both officers and citizens.\n  Body cameras make a difference. They are not the panacea; they are \nnot the silver bullet; they won't be the end-all; but they will be a \nmeans by which we will have additional evidence of what actually \noccurred. And many times that evidence is going to be much more potent, \nmuch more revealing than what people will say when they have \nconflicting stories.\n  I believe we ought to do all that we can to help the municipalities, \nthe police departments across the length and breadth of this country \nacquire these body cameras, because these body cameras will make a \ndifference in the lives of people.\n  In this case in South Carolina, if not but for the eye of the camera, \nI conclude we would have different results because you had two adults \nwho proclaimed the actions of the officer to be appropriate.\n  It was Frank M. Johnson who declared that there should be parity in \nthe DPS in Alabama.\n  Finally, I want to mention this case. It is the case of a 39-year-old \nWhite female, Viola Liuzzo, who came down to Alabama to do what she \nthought was the righteous thing and help in the civil rights movement. \nShe was murdered by the KKK. And after an informant in the KKK revealed \nthe identities of the culprits, and when they were brought to trial \nwith overwhelming evidence, in the first trial, there was a hung jury. \nIn the second trial, an all-White jury acquitted the officers. In the \nthird trial, before the Honorable Frank M. Johnson, they were all found \nguilty, but they were not found guilty without the judge requiring the \njury to deliberate at length. He may have been one of the first to give \nwhat is known as an Allen charge today, requiring the jurors to \ncontinue to deliberate notwithstanding their belief that they had \nexhausted all of their options. He required them to continue to \ndeliberate; and, as a result, these three members of the KKK were found \nguilty. After having been found guilty, they were each sentenced to 10 \nyears.\n  So I am honored tonight to have brought to the attention of this \naugust body, to the attention of our State of Texas, to the attention \nof the United States of America the many, many exploits positive of \nFrank M. Johnson. I pray that this resolution will pass in the Congress \nof the United States of America for this unsung hero who understood \nthat Black lives matter.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe my time is up, and I am honored that you were \ngracious enough not to remove me from the microphone. Thank you for the \nadditional time. God bless you.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7329-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Hudson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \nattending a funeral.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/28/house-section/article/H7329-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
