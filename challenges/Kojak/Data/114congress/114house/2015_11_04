The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the House of \nRepresentatives, the Republican Conference, and my friend Paul Ryan for \nhis election to be Speaker of the House. Those on the other side of the \naisle are lucky to have him.\n  It is sad that he had to promise Members of his Conference in writing \nto not address a national issue on behalf of the American people. He \nhad to swear that he would not allow a vote on immigration reform as \nlong as President Obama, well, is President Obama. The new Speaker had \nto promise to put party unity ahead of national public policy in order \nto be elected Speaker.\n  One of my colleagues from Alabama, who was so vehement in his \nopposition to immigration, came to the floor last week to read Speaker \nRyan's pledge into the Congressional Record.\n  So the Congress that did nothing on immigration reform for the last 2 \nyears will do nothing for the remainder of the President's term. It is \nreally stunning. You must promise to do nothing in order to be Speaker \nof the House of Representatives.\n  Maybe those on the other side of the aisle will come up with a new \noath of office for leadership positions: Raise your right hand and \nrepeat after me, they will say. I swear I will not let anything happen \non my watch. I will faithfully uphold and defend the principles of the \ndo-nothing Congress and pledge allegiance to the do-nothingness for \nwhich it stands; that I will ignore all cries for help, no matter how \nloud from the American people; that I will not let public policy get in \nthe way of party politics; and that party unity is more important than \nthe United States of America, so help me Tea Party.\n  Why would one faction within the Republican Party demand a promise \nfrom the new Speaker that he not bring up any immigration legislation \nto the floor? Because the opponents of immigration and immigration \nreform would lose. They must demand from the Speaker that the majority \nnot rule in the House of Representatives because the opponents of \nimmigration know they are actually the minority.\n  This is a telling moment for the Republican Party, and it is not \nconfined to immigration. The majority of the country supports Planned \nParenthood continuing to provide basic health services and \ncontraception to women. But playing to a smaller segment of their base, \nRepublicans threaten to close down the government in order to block its \nfunding. They want the minority to rule, and they want the tail to wag \nthe dog.\n  On the environment, in the wake of decades of scientific evidence \nthat human beings have helped to cause climate change, what is the \nRepublican response? Do nothing. It is a liberal hoax, they say. We can \nbuy another beach house farther inland when the beach house is, well, \nfarther inland.\n  Members on the other side of the aisle celebrate the antics of a \ncounty clerk who refuses to follow the law and do her job, which \nincludes issuing marriage licenses to two men or two women who want to \nspend their lives together.\n  Maybe House Republicans think they are standing on principle, but the \nmajority of the country has been fighting against exclusion, second-\nclass treatment, and bigotry for decades. The rest of us have embraced \nequality. We support voting rights, the same pay for the same work, and \npolice in communities that protect and serve, not just stop and frisk.\n  Here in Congress, as we saw last week with the discharge petition to \npreserve the Export-Import Bank, sometimes the majority can break the \ngridlock of this minority and actually take action.\n  As we saw last week on the bipartisan budget and debt ceiling vote, \nsometimes Republican leaders take action for the good of the country, \ndespite the calls from the do-nothing caucus, well, to do nothing.\n  On all these matters, do nothingness comes with a cost. It is the \ncost of deported immigrants, and businesses that cannot hire people \nlegally, of women who are denied lifesaving health screenings, honoring \nfamilies as first-class citizens no matter who heads them, a cleaner \nplanet, and safer neighborhoods.\n\n[[Page H7628]]\n\n  There is a political cost as well. A colleague from South Carolina \nsummed it up in the documentary ``Immigration Battle'' on PBS \nFrontline, which I also appeared in. Addressing a group of Republican \nvoters in his district, Congressman Mick Mulvaney said, ``At some \npoint, we are going to have to figure out that if you take the entire \nAfrican American community and write them off, take the entire Hispanic \ncommunity and write them off, take the entire Libertarian community and \nwrite them off, take the entire gay community and write them off, what \nis left? About 38 percent of the country.'' The Congressman concludes \nby saying, ``You cannot win with 38 percent of the country.'' You want \nto know something? He is right.\n  We know from the environment, from the fight for marriage equality, \nthe fight for civil rights, the fight to modernize our immigration \nsystem, that taking no action is precisely the problem.\n  I think the new Speaker understands this, and someday I hope my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle agree with him and let the \nmajority rule in the people's House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7628-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE AMERICAN CHESTNUT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). The Chair \nrecognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize \nthe efforts in Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional \nDistrict to reintroduce the American chestnut tree.\n  Before the 1900s, the American chestnut was the dominant tree in the \neastern United States. In fact, in my home State of Pennsylvania, it \ncomprised roughly 25 percent of all hardwoods. Blight struck these \ntrees beginning in 1904, and by 1950, the American chestnut was nearly \nwiped out of our forests.\n  Mr. Speaker, efforts over the past several years have focused on \nreintroducing this hardwood, the American chestnut, by making it more \nresilient to blight. I am proud to say that reintroduction efforts are \ntaking place at several sites in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional \nDistrict in Centre County, Clinton County, and Elk County.\n  This past week, the Pennsylvania State University's chapter of the \nAmerican Chestnut Foundation held its annual meeting, highlighting the \nwork of researchers, along with the contributions of volunteers, to the \nreintroduction of the American chestnut.\n  As chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation and \nForestry, I commend those advocates for their dedication, their \nresearch, their efforts to the reintroduction of this species; and I \nlook forward to lending my support for bringing the American chestnut \nback.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7628-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, John Muir, a naturalist, author, and \nenvironmental philosopher, once said, ``When we try to pick out \nanything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the \nuniverse.'' This couldn't be truer when it comes to the effect climate \nchange is having on the biodiversity of our planet.\n  We can't solve the climate change crisis without realizing how \ninterconnected its impacts truly are. The Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change has predicted, assuming that current trends in burning \nfossil fuel continue, by the year 2100, the surface of the Earth will \nwarm on an average of 6 degrees Celsius. That kind of potential for \nrapid and lasting climate warming poses a significant challenge for \nbiodiversity conservation.\n  It may seem obvious, but the places that plants and animals can exist \nare limited by factors such as sunlight, precipitation, and \ntemperature. A polar bear can't exist in Brazil, just as a lion can't \nexist in Antarctica. You won't find palm trees in Greenland, just like \nyou won't find pine trees in Argentina.\n  So, as climate changes, the abundance and distribution of plants and \nanimals will also change. Climate change alone is expected to threaten \napproximately one-quarter, possibly more, of all species on land with \nextinction by the year 2050. That means climate change will surpass \nhabitat loss as the biggest threat to life on land.\n  Because of climate change, birds lay eggs earlier in the year, plants \nbloom earlier, and mammals come out of hibernation sooner. These \nchanges may sound insignificant, but they drastically impact the life \ncycle of each population and, therefore, any species that rely on it. \nWe are literally altering the timeline of nature.\n  The need to protect plant and animals species might not be a top \npriority for some of my colleagues, but I urge them to consider the \nother impacts. Twelve plant species provide approximately 75 percent of \nour total food supply. What is not generally appreciated is that these \nrelatively few species depend on hundreds and thousands of other \nspecies for their productivity.\n  Our food supply is not only based on the food we eat, but insects and \nbirds that pollinate crop flowers and feed on crop pests. For example, \nmore than 80 percent of the 264 crops grown in the European Union \ndepend on insect pollinators.\n  A lack of biodiversity can lead to a decreased ability to produce \nmedicine, as key plants are lost to extinction. And without specific \nplants, such as grasses and trees that have evolved to resist the \nspread of wildfires or mitigate the impacts of flooding, we are losing \na key shield in protecting against natural disasters. These are \nnature's defenders, and we are losing them.\n  In my own backyard, these climate changes are expected to impact \nregional biodiversity in a variety of direct and indirect ways. The \nChicago wilderness, which expands across Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, \nand Michigan, will likely experience changes in the timing of natural \nevents, such as blooming, migration, and the onset of hibernation. It \ncould also cause a loss of suitable habitat and a disruption of \necological communities due to different responses to climate change.\n  These impacts are not limited to our land, plants, and animals. \nChanges in biodiversity will have significant impacts on our waterways \nas well. In the Great Lakes, native plant and animal species will \ndiffer wildly in their responses to changing stream temperature and \nhydrology. Wetland plant communities are continually adapting to \nchanging water levels. However, the extreme changes we see as a result \nof climate changes, such as droughts and flooding, create more unstable \nenvironments for species.\n  Protecting our biodiversity does more than save plants and animals. \nIt protects agriculture, medicine, and the overall safety of our \ncommunities.\n  From the beginning of time, nature has fed us, cured us and protected \nus. Now it is our turn. If we let one piece fail, we are putting the \nentire system at risk. We need to protect plant and animal species from \nan ever-changing climate if we want to secure a healthy and prosperous \nfuture for our children.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop ignoring the science and support Federal \nlegislation that acts on climate change and addresses these grave \nbiological threats.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7628-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7628-H7629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PERSONAL FAITH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Forbes) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, today as I stand on this great floor, a \nplace that we call the people's House, I look across and there is a \nplaque of Moses, the great law-giver. While he may not be staring me in \nthe eye, he stares at every Speaker, who stands where you stand today, \ndirectly in the eye. Right above you, there is our national motto that \nis even above the flag of the United States that says, ``In God we \ntrust.''\n  I come here this morning because in the State of Washington in \nBremerton School District, they take a different interpretation of that \nmotto. You see, they believe there that you can trust in God as long as \nyou don't trust too much; that you can be grateful to that God as long \nas you are not too grateful.\n  Last week, they put on administrative leave a young football coach, \nCoach Joe Kennedy, not because he molested a child, not because he \nwasn't\n\n[[Page H7629]]\n\na winning football coach, not even because he didn't have good \nservice--because everyone agreed he had exemplary service for the last \n8 years--but the reason was simply because he dared to offer a \npersonal, private prayer at the conclusion of a football game thanking \nGod for protecting his players and the players on the other football \nteam.\n  Now, the Bremerton School District is very noble because they say \nCoach Kennedy can exercise his faith even while on duty as long as no \none else can see it.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the Bremerton School District cites cases, they do \nlike so many anti-faith groups do. They cite the cases, but it is just \nthat those cases don't apply to the facts in this particular situation \nat all.\n  This coach is not asking to pray with students at a mandatory pregame \nmeeting. He is asking for his freedom to quietly and personally offer \nprayer and thanks for his team and the safety of his players after the \ngame is over and the players are heading to greet their families and \nfriends in the stands.\n  As a Member of Congress, my faith is not some kind of coat that I \ntake off when I walk into the Capitol Building to perform my \nlegislative duties. And as a coach, Coach Kennedy's faith is not \nsomething he sheds when he walks onto the field.\n  The Constitution doesn't require you to be sequestered to a private \nroom out of sight and earshot to offer a prayer. It protects the right \nof an individual to visibly express his or her faith, just like it \nprotects the right of a Muslim teacher to wear her head scarf or a \nJewish teacher to wear his yarmulke.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why I rise today, because I hope all across this \ncountry Americans will stand with Coach Kennedy, as we do today, and, \nin so doing, send a message to the Bremerton School District in the \nState of Washington that when they trample on even one young football \ncoach's religious liberties and religious freedom, they trample on the \nreligious freedom and the religious liberty of all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7629-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING JOHN CUSHING ESTY, JR.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. Esty) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and reflect on the \nlife of a great man, John Cushing Esty, Jr., an education leader, a \nreformer, a man of intellect, wit, and joy, a devoted family man, and \nmy beloved father-in-law of 31 years.\n  John Cushing Esty was the oldest of four boys. He was a ham radio \noperator and built radios. He learned languages, was a gifted student, \na lover of education and words, and he lived a life devoted to \nexcellence in education. He was committed to educational opportunity, \nalthough he attended some of the most elite private schools in the \ncountry. But as a leader of those schools, he pushed them into the \nmodern era.\n  In the Air Force, during the Korean War era, he taught flight \nnurses--hundreds at a time--not, as he said, exactly tough duty.\n  As a young dean at Amherst College, I learned about his commitment to \nequal opportunity for all students from none other than my physician in \nthe 1990s, a man named Marshall Holley, an African American scholarship \nstudent in the 1950s, one of three students in his class at Amherst \nCollege. He got in trouble for having told off a professor, a professor \nwho he believed to be racist. He risked losing his scholarship when he \nreceived a failing grade.\n  He was sent to see my father-in-law. My father-in-law, as a young \ndean, said: You know, Marshall, you weren't wrong to tell him off. He \nwas wrong to treat you that way, but you were unwise to tell him off \nbefore you got your final grade. I will fix your grade, but you have to \nbe wiser in the future.\n  As headmaster of the Taft School in my district, Watertown, \nConnecticut, in the 1960s--a tumultuous time--John Esty led as an \neducation leader, but he also led in the cause of what at the time was \nquaintly called coeducation. Much over the objection of many alumni, \nsome of the present students and faculty, he pushed for coeducation, \nand successfully so. He did it because he knew that educational \nopportunity and excellence could only happen when opportunities were \nprovided for young women as well as young men.\n  As a trustee of Amherst College, his alma mater, he successfully \nfought for that institution to become coeducational over the objection \nof, among others, his own father.\n  As a reformer, as the head of the National Association of Independent \nSchools, he helped create a program called A Better Chance. That took \nhis commitment to equal opportunity for young men and women of \ndisadvantaged backgrounds to lead to a national effort in scholarship \nprograms around this country.\n  One of those examples of A Better Chance scholar is Governor Deval \nPatrick of Massachusetts, who credits his time as A Better Chance \nscholar at Milton Academy having transformed his life from the south \nside of Chicago to become one of this country's leaders. Similar \nscholarships also were adopted in other schools around the country, \nincluding one Punahou School in Hawaii, whose scholarship student \nBarack Obama graduated in 1979.\n  My father-in-law devoted his life to excellence in education, but he \nlived the life as well. Not only did he care about excellent education \nin private schools, but he fought for it in public schools. He served \non the elected board of education in his town of Concord, \nMassachusetts, and all four of his sons went to public schools.\n  He was a man of merriment and wit and joy. He loved learning. We \nfirst met in 1978 and bonded over an argument over the correct \npronunciation of a word. In classic John Esty style, he went to the \ndictionary that was in the dining room, and we looked up the word. I \nhappened to be right. I don't remember the word. He doesn't, either. \nBut I pronounced it correctly, and he knew that we had bonded for life.\n  He loved children, especially his grandchildren. He told them amazing \nstories often, getting them so worked up they wouldn't go to bed, but \nthey loved his story, especially Jimmy Bond, the young James Bond \nstories, which would have them in delights.\n  John, you will be loved and missed by Katherine Esty, your wife of 60 \nyears, and all four of your sons: my husband, Dan; my brother-in-law, \nPaul, and his wife, Vanda; my brother-in-law, Ben, and his wife, \nRaquel; my brother-in-law, Jed, and his wife, Andrea; the many \ngrandchildren: Sarah, Thomas, Jonathan, Marc, Julie, Victor, Jonah, \nMaya, Aliya, and Asher.\n  You shared your love of life, of music, of stories, of education, and \nof making a difference with all of us. You lived a full 87 years, a \ncommitted servant of this great country, a believer in educational \nopportunity, and a gift for joy. You will be greatly missed. Thank you, \nand Godspeed, John Esty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7629-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7629-H7630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PEACE OFFICERS ARE A CUT ABOVE THE REST\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, recently a Hollywood filmmaker joined \nprotesters and marched in an antipolice rally in New York City.\n  He referred to peace officers as murderers. His hateful rhetoric \ncalled for violence against law enforcement, saying: ``I have to call a \nmurderer a murderer, and I have to call a murder a murder,'' adding \nthat he is on the side of the ones who confront and are confronted by \npolice. His comments encourage mischief and crimes against peace \nofficers.\n  For the haters to justify lawlessness in response to perceived \nlawless acts by the police is idiotic. Bad cops, like bad citizens, \nshould face a judge in a court of law. However, communities cannot be \nburned, looted, or destroyed by cop haters because some police officer \nallegedly committed a crime. Nor can crimes against police be \nencouraged, tolerated, or justified because some other officer is \naccused of doing something improper. Otherwise, there is mob rule.\n  The filmmaker, whose occupation is dedicated to the fake, the false, \nand to fiction, made comments 1 week after New York City lost one of \nits finest. Officer Randolph Holder was gunned down--really, he was \nassassinated by a ruthless outlaw--and he was recently buried. The \nfilmmaker's self-righteous\n\n[[Page H7630]]\n\nindignation toward law enforcement only fuels the fire and the war on \npolice. It promotes anarchy, chaos, and lawlessness.\n  The war on police has resulted in the death of 31 police officers \nkilled in the line of duty this year, 31 officers who gave their life \nand their blood to protect and serve the rest of us. Cop haters ought \nto be ashamed.\n  The New York police union has called for a boycott of the Hollywood \nfilmmaker's films which, interestingly enough, are riddled with extreme \nviolence, racist remarks, and more hate toward police.\n  It is ironic, Mr. Speaker, that society expects police officers to \nprotect them, but they will be the first to criticize officers for \ndoing their job.\n  Officers defend the thin blue line between law and the lawless. Their \njob is dangerous. Every day peace officers run toward chaos that \neveryone else is running away from.\n  Mr. Speaker, in my past life I was a criminal court judge and a \nprosecutor in Houston, Texas. For 30 years I met peace officers from \nall over the country. Some of those officers I met were later killed. I \nknow peace officers from New York City, and after we get through the \ncommunication barrier--as Churchill said, we are separated by a common \nlanguage--I have found them generally to be remarkable people who do \nsociety's dirty work.\n  Those peace officers in New York are constantly on the job, rooting \nout the evil in New York City, while protecting and serving New \nYorkers. They go into the dark dens where crime dwells and arrest those \nwho would do harm to others. They have a thankless job that most people \nin America would never do.\n  Mr. Speaker, this isn't Hollywood. This is real life, where \nsituations can turn violent in an instant. There is no fake blood, \nmakeup, or actors. These lives are real.\n  Antipolice comments, like these from Hollywood, should be looked at \nfor really what they are. It is a commercial by the Hollywood film \ncrowd to make money off of films that preach hate and violence by \npandering to police haters.\n  Mr. Speaker, peace officers wear the badge or shield or star over \ntheir heart. It is symbolic by where it is placed. As a protector from \nthe evils that are committed in our society by protecting the rest of \nus, they stand between us and those who would do us harm.\n  When I was a kid back in Texas, my dad and I went to a parade in a \nsmall town called Temple. As the parade was going by, my dad noticed \nthat I was looking at a person who was standing on the corner. He \nwasn't in the parade. He was just watching what was taking place. It \nwas a local Temple police officer. Back in those days they didn't \nreally have uniforms. They wore a white shirt, a star, and a cowboy \nhat, and jeans.\n  My dad commented at that time, he said: ``If you are ever in trouble, \nif you ever need help, go to the man or woman who wears the badge \nbecause they are a cut above the rest of us.''\n  That statement was true then, and it is still true today. Mr. \nSpeaker, peace officers are a cut above the rest of us.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7630-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           WE MUST SERVE OUR VETERANS AS THEY HAVE SERVED US\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor \nall the men and women who have courageously served this country and who \ncontinue to sacrifice in order to preserve the values and the freedoms \nof our great Nation.\n  In 1919, President Wilson spoke the following words as he \ncommemorated Armistice Day, better known to us all as Veterans Day, for \nthe very first time:\n  ``To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled \nwith solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's \nservice and with gratitude for the victory.''\n  Now, of course, that was 1919, and it was a day when Americans \nreflected on the lives which were lost during World War I, ``the war to \nend all wars.'' However, then came World War II and America's \nengagement in Korea. Congress voted to redesignate November 11 as \nVeterans Day in honor of all our veterans from all our wars.\n  Today, of course, there are over 1.4 million men and women in Active \nDuty, many of whom have completed multiple deployments in areas of the \nworld where there is mass chaos, which is foreign to many of our young \nservicemembers. Unfortunately, these servicemembers bring this chaos \nhome, both physically and mentally.\n  Here are some staggering numbers from a recent report by the \nUniversity of Southern California:\n  Over two-thirds of today's veterans report difficulties adjusting to \ncivilian life.\n  Nearly 8 in 10 servicemembers leave the military without a job lined \nup.\n  In the area I represent, in Orange County, nearly a quarter of the \nveterans with jobs are earning at or below the poverty level.\n  These numbers, quite frankly, are very unacceptable.\n  In 2014, an estimate of almost 50,000 veterans were living in \nshelters, on the streets, or in other places not meant for human \npopulation. This is 11 percent of the adult homeless population. \nAccording to a number of studies, both male and female veterans are \nmore likely to be homeless than their nonveteran counterparts.\n  How does that make sense? These men and women are brave. They are \nskilled. They are critical thinkers. They are dedicated. They are \nloyal. They love their country.\n  So what has gone wrong? We must not only commit to figuring out how \nwe are failing these young men and women, but once we do, we have to be \nheld responsible for providing the necessary resources to help them \nsucceed outside of the military.\n  I understand this is a significant commitment at a time of tight \nbudgets and the changing nature of war, and that there is no one-size-\nfits-all solution. In California, for example, there are 1.8 million \nveterans. We make up 8 percent of the total U.S. veteran population.\n  According to the State of California, California anticipates \nreceiving an additional 30,000 discharged members of the armed services \neach year for the next several years. We have to be ready. We have to \nbe ready for those 30,000 veterans coming along and also with the 1.8 \nmillion who already exist in California.\n  As these members have served their country, so must we serve them. \nAccording to the Veterans Administration, there are 22 suicides a day \nof our veterans.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  We must once again look at the causes of that staggering number. We \nhave identified post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain \ninjury as main triggers for suicide, et cetera, but we have got to do \nbetter.\n  Twenty percent of new recruits will also be women. Fifteen percent of \nthe 14 million Active Duty forces are currently women. And over 280,000 \nwomen have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have to do different \nthings for women veterans because it is not the same as the needs of \nmale veterans.\n  As we all know, the VA must be looked at and we must make appropriate \nchanges to deal with the backlog, expedite disability claims, and to \nensure that all veterans receive medical assistance in a timely manner.\n  Lastly, we must protect what we fought hard to achieved for them: \neducation when they return back. We must ensure that military \neducational benefits do not go to waste.\n  Next Wednesday, once again, we celebrate Veterans Day, and I urge my \ncolleagues to work with me to ensure that we can be proud in the \nservices and the help that we give our veterans, just as they have been \nproud to serve all of us.\n  God bless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7630-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7630-H7631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IRAN SINCE THE DEAL--CONGRESS MUST STAY ENGAGED\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKansas (Mr. Pompeo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Speaker, just a little over 100 days ago, the Obama \nadministration completed an agreement with Iran on their nuclear \nprogram. I strongly opposed the joint plan of action throughout its \nconsideration in Congress. And indeed, Congress never approved the \ndeal.\n\n[[Page H7631]]\n\n  Nothing since those 100 days have now passed lead me to have any \ndifferent view of the impact of that deal on the United States of \nAmerica. And yet the President appears prepared to continue to \nimplement the deal on its terms, at least as he understands it.\n  And while media attention may have shifted away to other things, it \nis incumbent upon this body, the United States Congress, to remain \nvigilant and to ensure that America's vital national security interests \nare not damaged beyond repair in the execution of the Iran deal.\n  Indeed, in those 100 days, it has become clear that this deal is so \nbadly conceived and America's position so muddled and the text so \npoorly drafted that the parties cannot even agree what they executed \n100 days ago.\n  For example, Secretary Kerry, the principal negotiator on behalf of \nthe United States and the P5+1, said on July 23 in front of the House \nForeign Affairs Committee, ``We will not violate the JCPOA if we use \nour authorities to impose sanctions on Iran for terrorism, human \nrights, missiles, or any other nonnuclear reason.''\n  But, on October 21, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, in a \nletter to President Rouhani ostensibly approving the JCPOA, said, \n``Throughout the 8-year period, any imposition of sanctions at any \nlevel and under any pretext, including repetitive and fabricated \npretexts of terrorism and human rights, on the part of any of the \ncountries involved in the negotiation will constitute a violation of \nthe JCPOA.''\n  Members of Congress and the American people were promised repeatedly \nthat this deal was only about Iran's nuclear program, and that \nAmerica's ability to implement sanctions based on Iran's continued \nterrorist activities, ballistic missile ambitions, and other nonnuclear \nissues would not be impeded. But it now appears that the only man in \nIran whose interpretation matters--the Ayatollah Khamenei--believes 100 \npercent the reverse of that.\n  This isn't a small disagreement. This isn't about where you put a \nsemicolon or a comma. This isn't a small technical detail. This goes to \nthe very heart of the deal between the P5+1 and the Iranian Republic.\n  Iran's refusal to abide by the written terms of the agreement as it \nrelates to sanctions seems, on its face, to be an irresolvable conflict \non a key issue--and Congress must lead. Congress must stand ready, \nwilling, and unified in combating aggression by a regime who continues \nto view America as the ``Great Satan,'' and has been emboldened by this \ndeal.\n  Rather than moderate, the regime has continued to flout U.N. \nresolutions, kidnapped more Americans, and stepped up its efforts to \ndominate the region. Here are several examples.\n  On July 24, 10 days after the JCPOA was announced, Iran's chief \nexporter of terrorism, Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani, traveled \nto Moscow, in direct violation of a U.N. Security Council resolution.\n  In September, it was reported that, in anticipation of sanctions \nrelief, the Iranian regime has significantly increased funding for \nterrorist groups Lebanese Hezbollah and Hamas, two organizations that \nhave American blood on their hands. There is no doubt that these groups \nhave turned their eyes to the West and to Israel as they seek to grow \ntheir deadly and destabilizing force in the Middle East, with no \nmoderation, after they signed to this deal.\n  On October 10, Iran successfully test-fired a next-generation \nballistic missile, capable of striking Israel, in another clear \nviolation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n  And in just the last weeks, the regime kidnapped yet another American \ncitizen without justification, Siamak Namazi, who joins Pastor Saeed \nAbedini, former Marine Amir Hekmati, and Washington Post reporter Jason \nRezaian, in unjust captivity in Iran. There is every reason to believe \nthere will be more.\n  Iran has firmly set itself against American interests in Syria as \nwell. A ground force of over 2,000 Iranian forces continues to fight \nagainst American interests in Syria, supporting dictator Bashar al-\nAssad, who our President has said repeatedly must go.\n  I came to the floor today because it is the 36th anniversary of the \nIranian hostage crisis back in 1979. Anyone who had hoped that the Iran \ndeal with the United States would portend a new era of openness between \nIran and the United States has been disappointed and jolted beyond all \nimagination in the past 100 days.\n  The Iranian regime clearly intends to test our willingness in \nCongress to defend America's interest by pushing the limits of the \nJCPOA, and beyond. Iran also intends to intensify their conflict with \nthe West, imbued with a new legitimacy. It now has $150 billion.\n  We, the Congress, have a duty to not let the passage of time, the \nloss of media interest, and the difficulty of the task to prevent us \nfrom protecting America's interest Iran's aggression--even if we must \nbattle our own President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7631-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7631-H7632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CARE FOR ALL VETERANS ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, as we look forward to \ncelebrating Veterans Day on November 11, let me just thank every man \nand woman serving in our military and every veteran for your service to \nour country. You represent and reflect the very best in our country's \nvalues and ideals.\n  This month, we also celebrate National Family Caregiver Month. \nCaregivers play a vital role, providing care and a sense of comfort and \npeace at trying times for Americans all over our country.\n  While we recognize all caregivers, I rise today to specifically speak \nabout individuals who dedicate their livelihood, love, and support to \nimproving our veterans' quality of life.\n  Caregivers of veterans assist with personal care needs and support \ntheir daily activities, including mental and physical therapies, \nmanaging of finances, transportation, and other essential duties.\n  In 2010, Congress passed the Caregivers and Veterans Health Services \nAct, marking the needed investment in supporting the family caregivers \nof our veterans by creating the VA Caregiver Support program. This law, \nwhile beneficial, limits eligibility of the program to post-9/11 \nveterans only.\n  I believe we should not limit the care of a veteran based on their \nperiod of service, but instead make the program accessible to veterans \nof all service areas, particularly our elderly veterans and their \ncaregivers who presently do not have the benefit. In an effort to open \nthe program to all veterans, I joined Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty to \nintroduce the CARE for All Veterans Act, H.R. 2894.\n  Earlier this year, I attended a town hall at the Southeastern \nVeterans' Center in Spring City, Chester County, where a Vietnam war \nveteran asked me why his caregiver could not have access to the support \nprovided by the VA Caregiver Support program.\n  I want to thank that veteran for raising this issue. On behalf of the \nestimated 214,000 pre-9/11 veterans in Pennsylvania, including 11,000 \nin my district alone, and veterans all across this country, I \nintroduced the CARE for All Veterans Act with Congresswoman Esty. This \nlegislation is a meaningful step to ensure our veterans receive the \nquality of care they need in the comfort of their own home from their \nloved one.\n  H.R. 2894 responsibly grows the program to create an equitable system \nfor our Nation's veterans and provide additional assistance to primary \nfamily caregivers of eligible pre-9/11 veterans.\n  A coalition of veterans groups support the CARE for All Veterans Act, \nincluding the American Legion, Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, Disabled American Veterans, AMVETS, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and VetsFirst.\n  I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and, when the \ntime comes, support this legislation on the House floor. Our focus must \nobviously be on making sure our veterans receive the care and services \nneed. That means ensuring their loved ones and caregivers have the \nproper training, support services, travel expenses, health care, and \nrespite care to provide the best in-home care for veterans. All \ncaregivers, no matter the age of the veteran they serve, should have \naccess to the VA Caregiver Support program.\n\n[[Page H7632]]\n\n  During a month when we recognize Veterans Day, we must also take a \nmoment to recognize those who play an instrumental role in the life of \na veteran: their caregivers. By passing this bill, we could make a big \ndifference for the veteran and their caregiver.\n  I am grateful to my constituents for bringing this need to my \nattention, and I call upon my colleagues to join me in this effort in \nsupporting H.R. 2894.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7632-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEFEATING ISIS AND PRESIDENT'S SYRIA STRATEGY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Young) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of \ncountless Hoosiers who are concerned for our troops. Like many \nAmericans, we are increasingly dismayed by the Obama administration's \nincoherent strategy to defeat ISIS and protect American interests \naround the world.\n  As someone who served this country in the United States Marine Corps, \nand now as an elected Representative, I take seriously our \nresponsibility here in Congress to demand war strategies that put \nAmerican military personnel in a position to successfully complete \ntheir missions. This responsibility to our troops--to set them up for \nvictory--has contributed to a new level of frustration felt by many of \nus over President Obama's disjointed foreign policy decisions in the \nMiddle East.\n  Just last Friday, without any input from Congress, and absent any \nform of public debate, a White House spokesperson announced to the \nworld that President Obama was authorizing the deployment of U.S. \nspecial operators directly into the fray in Syria.\n  Rather than hear it straight from our Commander in Chief, it took \nPresident Obama 3 full days to appear publicly and discuss his decision \nto escalate U.S. involvement and put more American boots on the ground.\n  On the one hand, I applaud the administration for any attempts to \ndegrade the capabilities of ISIS and stabilize a war-torn Syria. \nHowever, it remains unclear what these brave special operators have \nbeen asked to accomplish. And, what strategy will enable a few dozen \nU.S. special operators to decisively drive ISIS from their stronghold \nin Raqqa?\n  To be clear, I know many of these valorous special operators \npersonally. I am familiar with their remarkable ability to accomplish \nseemingly impossible missions, even with the odds stacked against them. \nBut these warriors are not magicians. They are not a magic elixir \ncapable of turning the tide of a 4-year, multifaceted civil war. They \nmust be empowered to win.\n  President Obama tells us the U.S. mission is to degrade and defeat \nISIS. But for that to succeed, he must articulate a broader strategy \nfor the remaining 15 months of his tenure as Commander in Chief.\n  As it currently stands, limited airstrikes and a handful of special \nforces operators will not sufficiently empower the United States and \nour partners to initiate change in the region.\n  Unfortunately, I fear that this marks yet another instance of the \nPresident dictating U.S. defense policy by popular opinion. This is \nunfair to our men and women in uniform, their families, and it is \nunfair to all Americans.\n  My fervent hope is that during the close of this administration, a \ncoherent, longer-term strategy is developed that empowers the greatest \nmilitary in the world to protect American interests and to bring \nstability to a region desperately in need of peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7632-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1045\n                         HONORING OUR VETERANS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa \n(Mr. Young) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as we approach Veterans \nDay, to honor the brave men and women who have served our country in \nuniform.\n  Now, earlier this year, I met with a group of young Iowans in \nGreenfield, Iowa, belonging to the Junior Optimists Club. They found a \ntruly unique way to pay tribute to our Iowa veterans.\n  The Sidey family owned and published the Free Press in Greenfield, \nIowa, for over 125 years. The Free Press would publish in their \nnewspaper letters Iowa servicemembers sent home to their families over \nthe years.\n  The Junior Optimists I met with went through the Sideys' collection \nof letters from World War II from soldiers. They picked out the ones \nthey found most interesting or compelling and read them aloud at a Flag \nDay celebration that I was fortunate to attend.\n  I want to share one here, and I will put some others in the Record \nhere with my colleagues in the House of Representatives, and enshrine \nthem in the Congressional Record so that we, and future generations, \nmay always remember the very real and human struggles our men and women \nface as they leave their loved ones and family behind to bravely secure \nand serve our country with dignity, honor and distinction.\n  I would like to read one of these letters, written by Lieutenant \nKenneth Eatinger of Adair County, Iowa.\n\n       July 23, 1943.\n       Dear Little Brother:\n       I hope and trust you will be able to read this all by \n     yourself, but if you can't, mother will read it to you and \n     you will be able to save it and read it yourself at a later \n     date after you have learned to read better.\n       Sonny, I know you miss me. I miss you too. It is too bad \n     this war could not have been delayed a few more years so that \n     I could have been with you a while longer and do all the \n     things I had planned to do with you. But I suppose we must be \n     brave and put those things off for now.\n       If I could just get home once more to see you and all the \n     folks again and have them meet my little wife and baby, I \n     wouldn't ask for anything more.\n       When you are a little older, you will know why your brother \n     had to leave home for so long. You know we have a big country \n     and we have big ideals as to how people should live and enjoy \n     the riches of it and how each is born with equal rights to \n     life, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness.\n       Unfortunately, there are some countries in the world where \n     they do not have these ideals, where a boy cannot grow up to \n     be what he wants to be, with no limits on his opportunity to \n     be a great man such as a great statesman or a businessman, a \n     farmer, a soldier.\n       Because there are many people in other countries who want \n     to change our Nation, its ideals, its form of government and \n     way of life, we must leave our homes and families to fight.\n       When it is all over, your brother is going to bring his \n     little family home to see you and Mom and Dad and Inez and \n     all the rest. In the meantime, take good care of Mom and Dad \n     and grow up to be a good boy and a good young man.\n       Study hard when you are in school. Be a good leader in \n     everything good in life. Be a good American, strive to win, \n     but if you must lose, lose like a gentleman, and be a good \n     sport. Don't be a quitter, either in sports or in your \n     business or profession when you grow up.\n       Get all the education you can. Stay close to Mom and follow \n     her advice. Obey her in everything, no matter how you may at \n     times disagree. She knows what is best and will never let you \n     down or lead you away from the right and honorable things of \n     life.\n       Little Brother, if I don't come back, you will have to be \n     Mom and Dad's protectors when they get older because you will \n     be the only one they have. You must grow up to take my place \n     as well as your own in their life and heart.\n       Last of all, don't forget your brother. Pray for him to \n     come back from this war, and if it is God's will that he does \n     not, be the kind of boy and man your brother wants you to be.\n       Kiss Mother, Dad, and Inez for me every night. Goodbye for \n     now, Little Brother. With love to you and all the family, \n     Your Brother.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, these are the words of a brave man, and they ring as \ntrue today as they did over 70 years ago when they were written. They \nembody the ideals of this great Nation and the ethos of our Armed \nForces that have fought, sacrificed, and died for our country so that \nwe can remain free.\n  My friends and colleagues, next week, when we recognize these men and \nwomen on Veterans Day, look them in the eye and say, ``Thank you.'' For \ntheir bravery and sacrifices, they deserve our unwavering gratitude and \nrespect.\n  May God bless them, and may God bless these United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7632-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7632-H7633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE SERVICE OF WILLIAM ``BRIT'' KIRWAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). The Chair \nrecognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, first, I would say I was moved by the remarks \nof the gentleman who just spoke, and I know we all join him in his \nsentiments.\n\n[[Page H7633]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an individual who has \nmade a remarkable impact on higher education in this country and in my \nState. He has done that for more than a half a century.\n  William English ``Brit'' Kirwan retired at the end of the June as \nchancellor of the University System of Maryland. He served as \nchancellor for the past 12 years, and, during that time, he oversaw the \nperiod of growth, transformation, and achievement, which included the \nintegration of on-line technology with course instruction and a 24 \npercent increase in enrollment.\n  Dr. Kirwan's lifetime of service to higher education, Mr. Speaker, \nbegan in his youth, which was spent on or around college campuses in \nLouisville and Lexington, Kentucky, and Durham, North Carolina.\n  His father, Dr. A.D. Kirwan, was an accomplished educator and college \nadministrator as well, having written and lectured in history at the \nUniversity of Kentucky and later served as dean and its president.\n  Brit Kirwan followed in his father's footsteps, luckily for all of \nus, attending the University of Kentucky, and later pursuing his \nmaster's and doctorate in mathematics from Rutgers University in New \nJersey.\n  Dr. Kirwan came to the University of Maryland College Park in 1964, a \nyear after I graduated. He came as an assistant professor of math. \nAfter 24 years teaching in the department, and having been elevated to \nthe department chair, and then provost, Dr. Kirwan was selected as the \npresident of the university in 1988.\n  He led the university system of Maryland's flagship campus for a \ndecade, before leaving to become president of The Ohio State \nUniversity.\n  I think I speak for all Marylanders when I say we were very happy \nwhen he came back to Maryland. I was a member of the Board of Regents \nat the time, and I remember participating in a meeting when we were \nsearching for a new chancellor.\n  I asked my colleagues, ``If we could get Brit to come back, what \nwould you think?'' All of them were extraordinarily enthusiastic.\n  So I called his house in Ohio, and his wife, Patty, answered, and I \nasked her if she and Brit would be interested in returning. Patty \nimmediately replied they would both like to be closer to their \ngrandchildren. Luckily, they were living in Maryland.\n  I took that as a good sign and, a short time later, Brit was back as \nchancellor of the university system. He managed a network that serves \nover 165,000 undergraduate and graduate students at 12 universities, \ntwo regional higher education centers, and one research center. It is \nthe 12th largest university system in America. Under Dr. Kirwan's \nleadership, it has become a national model for excellence in higher \neducation, research, and applied innovation.\n  Dr. Kirwan has been called upon by both Democratic and Republican \nPresidents over the years to advise on issues relating to higher \neducation access and performance. And certainly, he has been asked by \nUnited States Senators and Members of this House for his advice and \ncounsel as well.\n  He has been committed, throughout his years as an administrator, Mr. \nSpeaker, to the principle that education ought to be accessible to all, \nand it ought to be seen as a tool to help people enrich their lives for \nlearning, while advancing their careers. Among his major priorities \nhave been making the university campuses more diverse and making \nattending college more affordable.\n  Under his leadership, the university system built partnerships with \nthe private sector and the State and Federal Government in order to \nfurther the cause of advanced research and innovation that has \npractical application for economic growth and national defense.\n  Last year, Mr. Speaker, I was proud to be on hand to inaugurate a new \ntest site in southern Maryland for unmanned aircraft systems, which \nwill help in the development of new aerospace technologies and bring \nbusiness development and skilled jobs to that region.\n  Dr. Kirwan has always understood that we need to do more to ensure \nthat everyone who wants to pursue higher education can do so and that \nour colleges and universities are helping to produce skilled innovators \nand workers. He knew that the university system was a partner in \neconomic growth in our State and that university and academic \ninstitutions were partners in growing the U.S. economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have had the pleasure of working closely with Dr. \nKirwan for many years, and I have seen, firsthand, his passion for \nhigher education, his respect for faculty and staff, and his love of \nstudents.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to participate in a ceremony to \nrededicate the University of Maryland mathematics building in honor of \nDr. Brit Kirwan. That building, in which he taught mathematics, is now \nnamed in his honor for him.\n  All of us, Mr. Speaker, have witnessed his determination to make the \nuniversity system of Maryland a source of pride for our State and for \nour country, and he has done so.\n  He has been a man who is deeply devoted to his wife, Patty, a \nwonderful woman, and their wonderful family and their community. Patty \nKirwan is, herself, an extraordinary partner in the success that she \nand Brit have both achieved.\n  Mr. Speaker, Chancellor Brit Kirwan is a man of extraordinary \nintellect, vision, understanding, compassion, character, and principle. \nHe has brought all of these traits to bear in all of the important \nroles he performed throughout every endeavor in his life.\n  On behalf of all of us who live in our State but, indeed, on behalf \nof all the citizens of the United States whom he has advantaged in one \nway or another, I thank Dr. Kirwan for his leadership on behalf of the \nhigher education for our State and for our country.\n  Dr. Kirwan has stepped down as chancellor, but, Mr. Speaker, I know \nhe will continue to lend all of his great talents to making higher \neducation ever more effective and his country ever more successful.\n  Well done, Doctor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7633-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS COMPLEX\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, tuberous sclerosis complex, or TSC, is \na genetic disease which causes tumors to form in organs throughout the \nbody, impacting the health and abilities of those born with it.\n  Nearly 50,000 Americans are affected by this condition, and many more \ncases remain undiagnosed because of lack of awareness or observable \nsymptoms. For these individuals and their families, the fight against \nTSC is constant.\n  But in the face of this adversity, those with TSC show us strength \nand determination, not only to survive, but to thrive; individuals like \nEvan Moss from Virginia.\n  Evan was just 2 years old when he was diagnosed with TSC and, by age \n4, was suffering up to 400 seizures a month because of his condition. \nBut like so many with TSC, Evan's story is not defined by this impact. \nNow 11 years old, Evan is an accomplished author and a passionate \nadvocate for those living with TSC.\n  As a member of the Congressional Rare Disease Caucus and honorary \nchair of the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance, I am focused on shedding \nlight on conditions like TSC and highlighting exceptional individuals \nlike Evan.\n  The fight against TSC extends far beyond this Chamber, but each of us \ncan play an important role in understanding and, ultimately, defeating \ntuberous sclerosis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7633-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7633-H7634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PASSAGE OF THE TRANSPORTATION BILL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, I would like to begin \nby thanking Chairman Shuster, chairman of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee, and Ranking Member DeFazio, for bringing \nforth here to floor of the House a long-term transportation bill.\n  It is the product of numerous hearings that have been held over the \nlast couple of years, and those hearings were interesting in that, \nuniversally, whether we were hearing from the head of the national \nChamber of Commerce, or hearing from the head of the AFL-\n\n[[Page H7634]]\n\nCIO and/or the trade unions that build our infrastructure, the message \nwas always the same.\n  First of all, it was a recognition of the obvious: bridges are \nfalling down, trains are coming off the track. It is tragic and costly \nin terms of dollars and loss of life.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Secondly, it was pointed out by everybody that this failure is \nhandicapping our economy--our ability to expand business, to create \njobs, and to grow our economy.\n  Thirdly, everyone testified that we need a long-term surface \ntransportation legislation so that States, communities, and our Federal \ntransportation officials can do the kind of planning that is necessary \nto build the kind of transportation system that is needed for a strong \neconomy.\n  Lastly, I want to point out that this legislation before us here \ntoday is the product of what has come to be known as regular order; \nnamely, the process where important legislation for the country is \nbrought before the appropriate committees and the committees and all \nthe members of that committee have an opportunity to offer any ideas, \nany amendments that they want that they think will improve, in this \ncase, our surface transportation system.\n  The fact of the matter is we have hundreds of amendments, and that \ncommittee, on which I am proud to serve, examined and considered every \nsingle one of those amendments.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is important to remind ourselves here that democracy \nis a long, arduous, and difficult process, but when you allow the \nmembers of a committee who have spent enormous amounts of time getting \nsmart and knowledgeable about the responsibilities of that committee to \ncome together, to offer their ideas, to have them thoroughly examined, \nand to have them thoroughly debated is how you find common ground. That \nis how you come together. That is how you build and develop respect for \none another, and that is what has happened in the development of this \nsurface transportation bill that we have before us here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the committee, and I congratulate the \nCongress for recognizing how important and how valuable regular order \ncan be to the process of restoring people's confidence in the ability \nof the Congress of the United States to fix things, get things done, \nand end the gridlock. Thank you, my fellow colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7634-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REFORMING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about an issue that we \ndon't talk about nearly enough. Our country's imperfect criminal \njustice system is affecting not only the people in my district but also \ncommunities all across our Nation.\n  Every year the Federal Government spends more than a half trillion \ndollars on anti-poverty programs. The numbers show that these \ninitiatives have not solved the problem. Today there are nearly 50 \nmillion Americans living in poverty. Over the last decade, the number \nof Americans living in our Nation's most impoverished communities--\nwhere at least 40 percent of the families live below the poverty line--\nhas nearly doubled to a historic high of 14 million.\n  Meanwhile, the United States prison and jail population has reached \nan all-time high, and the number of people on probation and parole has \nliterally doubled. This is not a coincidence, but the numbers don't \neven begin to tell the real story.\n  Solving this problem requires meaningful action and change--two \nthings I would argue that Washington does not do so well. But rather \nthan sitting idly by and waiting for Washington to get its act \ntogether, I have already begun taking action back home in Illinois' \n10th Congressional District.\n  I have worked with community-level programs that have helped give \npeople the tools that they need to be able to lift themselves out of \npoverty, brought in national leaders to tour our social service \norganizations across our district, and learned about the unique ways \nthat these organizations are fighting poverty and working for criminal \njustice reform on the local level.\n  Recently I had the privilege to introduce Bob Woodson to a few of the \ninspiring local leaders who are working on these issues. The more time \nthat I spend talking with various community leaders, the more painfully \nobviously the need to implement reforms to this system becomes.\n  One of the inspiring local groups working to fix some of the problems \nin our district is FIST. It stands for Former Inmates Striving Together \nin Waukegan. FIST works with the community to help individuals that are \nreentering society get what they need to reenter the workforce. It is \nno secret, Mr. Speaker, that most ex-convicts, sadly, end up back in \nprison after serving jail time. This organization, as well as others, \nis trying to change that trend by sharing positive stories and offering \na judgment-free zone for individuals to get back up on their feet.\n  Far too often, Mr. Speaker, the success stories that these \norganizations have do not get told, and, in fact, are kept a secret. \nBob Woodson said, ``People are motivated to change and improve when \nthey are shown victories that are possible, not injuries to be \navoided.''\n  One inspiring young man we had the privilege to meet was Darrell \nMcBride from Waukegan. He took the time to tell us about the journey \nthat he took to get to where he is today, and that story bears \nrepeating. Darrell spent 8 years in prison, which left him with limited \nresources and educational opportunities. He knew that he needed a job \nand direction after he was released, or the statistics would suggest \nthat he would find himself back in prison. He turned to YouthBuild Lake \nCounty, and since graduating from the program, he has earned a \nconstruction certificate and, most importantly, has landed a job.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is this kind of help that we should be encouraging \nall to begin to promote within our communities. Thousands like Darrell \nwould benefit greatly from criminal justice reform. While I know that \nthis situation cannot simply be fixed in Washington, I certainly hope \nthat we can help. One way in which I am trying to help is by \ncosponsoring and working for the passage of the Fair Chance Act \nintroduced by my friend from Maryland, Representative Elijah Cummings. \nThis legislation would ``ban the box'' for Federal agencies, \nprohibiting them from asking prospective government employees about \ntheir criminal justice histories on job applications.\n  Potential employees should not use criminal history to screen out \napplicants before they have a chance to look at their qualifications. \nThis policy would enable almost 20 million people to have a second \nchance and the opportunity to sell themselves to potential employers \nand make a positive contribution to our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to deal with what leads people to end up in \nprison to begin with. We can do this by implementing positive \nstrategies and innovations such as the use of body cameras for police \nofficers to fight crime and to improve transparency and accountability.\n  Put simply, we need to end the era of mass incarceration, and this \nmeans reforming the mandatory minimum sentencing, among other policies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope that going forward we can work with groups to \npromote the success stories to help to empower individuals trying to \nturn their lives around and to work with local communities to reduce \nthe rate of incarceration. Unfortunately, there is still a long way to \ngo until this problem is solved, but I would like to thank \norganizations like FIST and YouthBuild for the great work that they are \ndoing in Illinois' 10th Congressional District.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7634-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7634-H7635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Palazzo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my concern over recent \nevents taking place in my home State and around our Nation that tear at \nthe fabric of our country's First Amendment right to freedom of \nreligion.\n  Time and again we have seen instances in which an individual's right\n\n[[Page H7635]]\n\nto practice his or her faith has been subordinated to the sensibilities \nof individuals who do not share their faith in God.\n  In Mississippi, we saw it in August when a high school band from \nBrandon, Mississippi, was forbidden from playing the hymn ``How Great \nThou Art'' at a football game. We saw it in September in Lamar County \nas a teacher was ridiculed and disciplined for posting a voluntary \nprayer list in her classroom.\n  Just last week, I, along with 45 other Members, joined Congressman \nForbes and Senator Lankford in support of Coach Kennedy of Bremerton \nHigh School in Washington State. Coach Kennedy's 8-year tradition of \nwalking to the 50 yard line after the conclusion of football games to \nsay a quiet prayer was banned last month due to the school district's \nconcern that his actions could be construed as an endorsement of \nreligion.\n  Recently we have even seen a Marine Corps base in Hawaii come under \nfire for having a road sign read, ``God bless the military, their \nfamilies, and the citizens who work with them.'' Wow, even our United \nStates Marines are attacked for exercising their faith.\n  Mr. Speaker, opponents of religious freedom have been energized by \nrecent decisions made by the United States Supreme Court as well as \nlower courts, both of which have placed the cultural views of a small \ngroup ahead of the thoughts, feelings, and rights of the vast majority \nof Americans.\n  Judicial activism at all levels of the Federal judiciary has resulted \nin the systematic rewriting of centuries-old societal norms, and this \nmust end. Time and again our courts have waded into waters which the \nConstitution specifically vests in the legislative branch. What is at \nstake here is nothing less than the future of our country's religious \nliberties, the religious liberties upon which our very Nation was \nfounded.\n  Those who have would have God completely removed from public \ndiscourse--be it marriage, health care, or the right of schoolchildren \nto pray or play religious music during football game halftimes are \npleased with the first part of the amendment: ``Congress shall make no \nlaw respecting the establishment of religion.'' However, they \nconveniently ignore the second part: ``or prohibiting the free exercise \nthereof.'' This amendment was enacted by our framers to protect \nreligion from government, not the reverse.\n  Mr. Speaker, families are struggling to keep it together. Single-\nparent households are at an all-time high. Poverty, incarceration, \nteenage pregnancy, and drug usage are all around us. When and where \nprayer is needed the most, it is no longer allowed or is forbidden. How \ncan we try to remove from the public sphere the one thing that holds us \ntogether, and that is our religion?\n  We can no longer simply leave our religion at the church doors. It is \nour responsibility to live out our values and beliefs in our everyday \nlives. Edmund Burke said it best: ``The only thing necessary for the \ntriumph of evil is that good men do nothing.''\n  I support the free expression of religion in all quarters of our \nsociety, and I stand with Coach Kennedy, the band from Brandon, the \nteacher in Lamar County, and every other American who has been stripped \nof their religious freedoms. I am committed to protecting our right to \nexpress our faith without fear of governmental intrusion or \nretaliation, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7635-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     KRISTALLNACHT 77TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, Monday, November 9, marks the 77th \nanniversary of Kristallnacht, the event that would foreshadow the \ncrimes against humanity that the Nazis would commit against 6 million \nJews and other religious and ethnic minorities.\n  Inspired by incitement from the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, Joseph \nGoebbels, regime members, and party loyalists issued orders to local \nofficials to target and attack the Jewish community. Often disguised in \nplain clothes to perpetuate the false narrative that these were \nspontaneous attacks and the expression of the public sentiment toward \nthe Jews, the pogroms of Kristallnacht had an immediate and chilling \nimpact.\n  Mr. Speaker, mobs roamed the streets freely attacking Jews in their \nhouses, destroying their businesses, and forcing them to perform public \nacts of humiliation. Nearly 300 synagogues were destroyed while Jewish \nartifacts and archives were confiscated.\n  Approximately 7,500 Jewish-owned businesses and shops were vandalized \nand looted; and to add to the disgrace and punishment of having their \nlivelihoods taken from them and destroyed, the Jews were blamed for the \nevents of Kristallnacht, and they were fined for damages--the then \nequivalent of $400 million. Over 30,000 Jews were arrested and then \ntransferred to some of the Nazi's most gruesome and notorious \nconcentration camp sites during the events of Kristallnacht.\n  Nearly 100 Jews were killed on the night of November 9, 1938, and \ninto the morning the next day.\n  Yet, Mr. Speaker, this was only the beginning. Facing little public \nbacklash, the Nazi regime took the events of Kristallnacht as a signal \nof support for their cruel treatment of the Jewish community and \nquickly imposed restrictions against the Jews that would lead up to the \nHolocaust.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Mr. Speaker, Kristallnacht is a solemn reminder of what can happen \nwhen people allow anti-Semitism, incitement, and hatred to carry on \nunabated. Kristallnacht was the manifestation of fear and scapegoating \nand was not only allowed to take place, but was the direct result of a \npeople's indifference to the hatred of a religious minority. And \nindifference is, indeed, all that is needed for evil to take root, for \nevil to expand.\n  That is precisely why we must commemorate these tragic events that \nmar our collective past and that mark one of humanity's darkest \nperiods, and why we must rededicate ourselves to the vow of: ``Never \nagain.''\n  This is particularly important in today's environment, as Israel \nfinds itself plagued by a new round of terror and violence that has \nbeen spurred upon by incitement and anti-Israel indoctrination from the \nPalestinian authority and its so-called leaders.\n  In the past month and a half, there have been nearly 60 random knife \nattacks against Israeli citizens, five shootings, and six car rammings. \nYet, where is the condemnation from the international community? \nInstead of speaking out against these attacks, the United Nations Human \nRights Council invited Abu Mazen, and he used his platforms to spew out \nhis harmful and inciting rhetoric. Responsible nations must condemn, \nnot ignore, Abu Mazen's words and his actions.\n  Last month, Secretary Kerry said that leaders need to lead; and, this \nweek, this body stood up and said enough is enough.\n  The House passed a resolution I offered, alongside my south Florida \ncolleague, Congressman Ted Deutch, that condemned the anti-Israel and \nanti-Semitic attacks from within the Palestinian authority.\n  The House also passed a resolution that encouraged our government to \ndo more in the fight against anti-Semitism and to work more closely \nwith the governments of Europe to step up their efforts to battle the \nalarming rise of anti-Semitism across the continent.\n  And we need to do more at home, especially on our college campuses. \nToo often, Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism is being disguised as an anti-\nIsrael political attack, manifested primarily through the Boycott, \nDivestment and Sanctions movement, the BDS movement.\n  We have a moral obligation to stand up against these acts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7635-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7635-H7636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

He was a man \nof integrity and principle, a Representative who stood for what is \nright and who fought on behalf of what makes America great.\n  He will be missed, but his legacy of service and devotion to North \nCarolina will continue to be the standard that current and future \nleaders follow.\n  Howard, we miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7636-7", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTRODUCTION OF THE POWER ACT\n\n  (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, we depend on immigrant \nworkers to take some of the toughest jobs. They pick our food, clean \nour houses, and wash our cars. As U.S. workers, they deserve to freely \nexercise their labor rights; yet when immigrants want to organize for \nfair pay or decent working conditions, they are often silenced by \nunscrupulous employers who retaliate through harassment, abuse, and \nthreats of immigration enforcement.\n  This is unacceptable. When I hear about it, I think of Asuncion \nValdivia, who died after 10 hours of grape picking in 105 degree heat. \nAsuncion did not have the opportunity to report a violation. We cannot \nallow any voice to be stifled, especially when that voice is speaking \nout against dangerous or unfair practices.\n  That is why I am introducing the POWER Act this week. This bill \nexpands U visa eligibility for victims of retaliation, strengthens \nlabor agencies' investigative powers, and allows a stay of removal for \nworkers who filed a workplace claim.\n  We must protect our workers, no matter who they are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7636-8", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATIONS TO MARIAN HIGH SCHOOL'S BOYS' SOCCER TEAM\n\n  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. WALORSKI.

Last weekend, the Knights \nclaimed the Class 1A State boys' soccer championship with a 3-0 \nvictory.\n  The win also earned Head Coach Ben Householter his first State \nchampionship in 18 years as head coach. He was also named the Northern \nIndiana Conference Coach of the Year. All season long, Marian competed \nagainst the best of the best, finishing with 20 wins and only 2 losses.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today a very proud Hoosier. Marian \nHigh School is a great school, and the team, the coach, the teachers, \nand the entire student body should be proud today. I want to recognize \nthe parents, who sacrifice so much for their kids to play in sports \nprograms.\n  The achievement that this is today is something these students will \nhave for a lifetime.

Mr. Speaker, during his first speech, our new Speaker \nmade a commitment to return the U.S. House of Representatives to \nregular order. What does that mean? Think ``Schoolhouse Rock,'' an \norderly process where bills are introduced, debated in a bipartisan \ncommittee process, amendments are allowed, and legislation is actually \nbrought up for a vote.\n  I could not agree with the Speaker more. This Congress, this country \nwould benefit from a more open debate, where voices from both parties \nare heard, where every Member is empowered to fully be a part of the \nlegislative process, to do the work that they were sent here to do on \nbehalf of the people they work for.\n  I know I have introduced many bills that have not been brought up in \ncommittee, have never seen the light of day on the floor, and I know \nother Members share that frustration. That needs to end. We need to \nhave a more open process.\n  Just last week, 313 Members of this body voted to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank. Almost every Democrat and a majority of Republicans \ncame together, and the legislative process worked.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do call on you to continue to keep that promise.

Mr. Speaker, last week I had the honor of meeting with \nGarett Long and Jessica Chiartas, two very bright graduate students \nfrom UC Davis in northern California who were invited to D.C. to \npresent their work on soil science.\n  Their research in the area of soils and biogeochemistry focuses on \nunderstanding the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of our \nsoils, as well as the processes of mass and energy flows that control \nour agricultural and natural ecosystem functions.\n  Now, the average layman might not find that too exciting, but it is \nexciting for agriculture to advance these technologies and get more and \nbetter production and quality of crops out of our lands.\n  In particular, one area of research highlighted was their work in the \nwine growing region and the data and research collected on how soil \nimpacts our vineyards and the wine that is enjoyed by people all across \nthe world.

Mr. Speaker, as we prepare to \nhonor the service of our men and women in uniform this Veterans Day, we \nmust come together to stop one of the most egregious practices that is \npreying upon them: predator payday loan companies are targeting our \nveterans at an alarming rate.\n  In North Texas alone, a fast cash payday advance of $500 that is \nrolled over five or more times could wind up costing $1,200 or more. As \na result, many borrowers are trapped in a cycle of debt when these \nshort-term loans are not repaid on time, usually within a required 2 to \n4 weeks.\n  Mr. Speaker, these companies have targeted our vulnerable veterans \nwith limited financial options, digging them deeper and deeper into \ndebt. We in Congress must work to cap these interest rates and require \nall lenders to follow the same standards as our local banks, mortgage \ncompanies, and other for-profit lenders.\n  As a Nation, we have a long way to go to make sure that those who \nhave protected and defended our homeland are, themselves, protected and \ndefended when they return home to rebuild their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7637-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7637-H7638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING MRS.

As a result, veterans \noften fall victim to payday lenders who offer unaffordable loans, \nforcing them even deeper into debt.\n  In 2013, California payday lenders generated three-quarters of their \nrevenue from borrowers who took out seven or more loans. The Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau should use its authority to crack down on \nthe worst abuses in the payday loan market.\n  Veterans and their families have made tremendous sacrifices to keep \nus safe.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a \nTennessee giant: Senator Fred Thompson.\n  Whether Fred Thompson was speaking on the Senate floor, canvassing \nthe State in his red pickup truck, or entertaining us on the big \nscreen, he always did the Volunteer State proud.\n  In his lifetime, Fred saw many accomplishments, but he remained the \nsame: a proud product of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, the son of a car \nsalesman, and the first person in his family to earn a college degree.\n  Fred was a statesman who led with conviction. He was a visionary who \nhelped bring Tennessee from a Democratic stronghold to the conservative \nsuccess story that it is today. He was a loving husband and father. He \nwas a man of faith, who I know has found ultimate healing today from \nthe cancer that gripped his earthly body.\n  Tennessee shines brighter because of Fred Thompson's service.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday, President Obama issued an \nexecutive memorandum that could turn into one of the most far-reaching \nand devastating environmental regulations in history. This document, \nwhich holds the same weight as an executive order, aims to expand a 26-\nyear-old policy that requires agencies to set a no net loss of wetlands \nto all natural resources. The economic impact of this regulation would \nbe devastating to the West.\n  Why do I live in Utah? I live there because I love it. I love to rock \nclimb. I love to ski. I love the beauty of the place I live.\n  All of us want to protect our natural resources, but we can't put \nhuman interests at the bottom of the priority pile. This is more than a \nhuge power grab. It is going to devastate the trust that is essential \nbetween the President and the American people.\n  If the President wants more regulations and further protections on \nnatural resources, such a thing must be done in the people's Congress \nby those who are closest to the people. For that reason, I will use \nevery tool at my disposal in order to ensure that this outrageous \nPresidential decree is not implemented.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7639-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1230\n    HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF FORMER CONGRESSMAN HOWARD COBLE\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS.

He served in the \nU.S. Coast Guard, the North Carolina State House, and as the \nCongressman for North Carolina's Sixth Congressional District for more \nthan 30 years.\n  Howard Coble dedicated his life to serving, and it was exemplified in \nthe way he ran his office. As a freshman Member of Congress, I looked \nto him in serving my constituents. He was steadfast, attentive, and \nalways put his constituents first. Some say he offered the best \nconstituent services of any Member.\n  I will never forget the night Howard Coble welcomed me to Congress \nthe day I was sworn in. He later wished me well on my new journey as a \nMember.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his family, his friends, and his \nformer colleagues during this difficult time.\n  He will be missed but never forgotten.

Mr. Speaker, it was a little less than a \nyear ago that a number of us gathered on the House floor to bid \nfarewell to our colleague, Howard Coble, as he retired from 3 decades \nof service to the people of North Carolina.\n  The series of heartfelt tributes that day, from Members on both sides \nof the aisle, were a striking reflection of the respect and admiration \nthat so many of us felt for Howard. And he returned that affection. He \nalways made the extra effort to get to know those with whom he worked, \nregardless of their stature or their party affiliation.\n  Howard was also an effective legislator, a tireless advocate for the \nSixth District. He took on complicated and difficult issues in his \nleadership roles on the Judiciary and Transportation Committees.\n  I was fortunate to partner with him on a number of bipartisan \ninitiatives, from textile research, to disaster relief, to funding for \nhis beloved Coast Guard.\n  In an era where our politics are too often fractious and divisive, \nHoward's camaraderie, good humor, and generosity of spirit reflected \nthe best of what this institution can be.\n  Lisa and I are saddened by his passing. We join his many friends and \nformer colleagues in extending condolences to his family and expressing \ngratitude for his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7640-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VETERANS HEALTH AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce the introduction of \nthe Veterans Health and Accountability Act. Yesterday's Veterans \nAffairs Committee hearing showed why this bill is so critical.\n  An investigation revealed that Veterans Affairs administrators likely \ngamed the system to enrich themselves at taxpayer expense, creating \nhigh-paying vacancies at desirable locations, where they would have \nless responsibility.\n  At the hearing, they pled the Fifth to avoid the truth, and they \nremain on the job. Meanwhile, Granite State vets are waiting for care.\n  My Veterans Health and Accountability Act strengthens the Veterans \nChoice program, allowing veterans to seek private care due to \ninadequate VA facilities. My home State of New Hampshire does not even \nhave a full-service VA.\n  The act also protects whistleblowers who expose negligence and \nmismanagement. If it were not because of these individuals, we may \nnever have discovered secret waiting lists where thousands of vets \nprobably died waiting for care.\n  The bill I introduced clarifies hiring and firing rules, so bad \nactors who abuse their positions can be exited promptly.\n  We must enforce and expand VA reforms to ensure our military vets \nreceive the care we promised them. We must restore Americans' trust in \ngovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7640-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DISAPPROVAL OF THE RADEWAGEN AMENDMENT TO THE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION \n                                  BILL\n\n  (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my disapproval to the \nRadewagen amendment to the surface transportation bill, which was \nultimately defeated last night, 113-310.\n  This amendment would have required the Secretary to change the \nallocation program funds made available to the territories. This \namendment would have potentially harmed my district, the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, and Guam, by possibly taking already minimal funds away from \nthese two territories.\n  The funding provided in the transportation bill is yet another \nexample of this Congress' inability to address the real needs of the \nU.S. territories, whose economies have not recovered and require \nadditional support.\n  And, while I certainly recognize and empathize with the frustrations \nof some of my colleagues from the territories, it is the limited \nfunding within this bill which has created an environment where we are \nliterally fighting over scraps.\n  The proposed funding in the bill barely provides any increase of the \nhistorically low allocation for the territorial highway program.\n  I would like to thank both the chair and ranking member of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Shuster and Mr. \nDeFazio, for not supporting the amendment and for recognizing that this \nis not an amendment that enjoyed the full support of all the four \nsmaller territories.\n  I would also like to thank the dean, Congresswoman Bordallo, of the \nterritory of Guam, for her efforts and engagement on this very \nimportant issue.\n  I look forward to working with Transportation and Infrastructure \nleadership and staff and my fellow Delegates from the insular areas and \nworking together on resolving our problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7640-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE SERVICE OF DANIEL STANDAGE\n\n  (Ms. McSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. McSALLY.

He \nreceived a 100 percent service-connected disability, but that hasn't \nheld him back.\n  Daniel completed a blind rehabilitation program at the Southern \nArizona VA. He enrolled at the University of Arizona and was \ninstrumental in establishing its student veterans center, a place that \noffers assistance to transitioning student veterans.

The Chair may postpone further consideration of \n     the Senate amendments in the House to such time as may be \n     designated by the Speaker.\n       Sec. 6.  Upon adoption of the further amendment or \n     amendments in the House pursuant to section 4(b) of this \n     resolution --\n        (a) a motion that the House concur in the Senate amendment \n     to the text, as amended, with such further amendment or \n     amendments shall be considered as adopted;\n       (b) the Clerk shall engross the action of the House under \n     subsection (a) as a single amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute;\n       (c) a motion that the House concur in the Senate amendment \n     to the title shall be considered as adopted; and\n       (d) it shall be in order for the chair of the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure or his designee to move \n     that the House insist on its amendment to the Senate \n     amendment to H.R. 22 and request a conference with the Senate \n     thereon.\n       Sec. 7.  The chair of the Committee on Armed Services may \n     insert in the Congressional Record not later than November \n     16, 2015, such material as he may deem explanatory of defense \n     authorization measures for the fiscal year 2016.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The gentleman from \nGeorgia is recognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to my friend from Colorado (Mr. Polis), pending \nwhich I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration \nof this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I find myself with a big smile on my face. \nI usually do when the Reading Clerk sits down. Even if I could dispense \nwith the reading of the rule, I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. Even \nif there were some days where I would be tempted to do it, Mr. Speaker, \nthis wouldn't be that day because we are down here with rule number two \non the transportation bill.\n  You will remember we came down here yesterday--it was my friend from \nMassachusetts and I at that time--to bring a rule to consider the first \n6-year transportation bill this country has had in over a decade. It is \na bill that the Transportation and Infrastructure\n\n[[Page H7642]]\n\nCommittee has worked on for not days, not weeks, not months, but years \nto get it ready. It is a bill that was not pushed by Republicans or \npushed by Democrats. It is a bill that was pushed by all of us together \nto do those kinds of important things that are necessary for \ninfrastructure planning for each and every one of our constituents back \nhome.\n  It is a bill that has been moving in the Senate, which is a rarity in \nand of itself. It is a bill that we are moving here in the House. It is \na bill that can go to the President's desk for his signature and make a \ndifference for Americans, make a difference in our economy, and make a \ndifference for our families.\n  Now, I sit on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. \nSpeaker, and you would think that my pride of authorship and all the \ngood work we did on that committee would have said: Do you know what? \nWe got it right the first time. Let's just bring that bill to the \nfloor, and let's get it done because it is important to America. Let's \nfinish it today.\n  I see some of my colleagues from the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee sitting down here. There might be a little \ntemptation to take our work product and rush it straight to the desk \nbecause we did do a pretty good job together. But in their wisdom, Mr. \nSpeaker, the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee, the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee, the chairman of the Rules Committee, the ranking member of \nthe Rules Committee, and our leadership team here in the House said: Do \nyou know what? There are a lot of Members who don't sit on the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee. There are a lot of Members \nwho represent some really smart and really talented folks back home in \nAmerica, but their Representative doesn't sit on the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee. We need their ideas in this debate, too.\n  So we came to the floor yesterday, Mr. Speaker, and we brought a rule \nthat made more than 20 amendments in order. We were debating that rule \nfor an hour. We hadn't even finished debating the rule when we brought \nback more amendments and made another 16 in order, Mr. Speaker. We are \nback here today because that more than 40 was not enough. We want to \nmake another 81 amendments in order. Mr. Speaker, this is a festival of \ndemocracy that is happening in this House today. Everyone's voice is \nincluded.\n  Now, I want to be clear. We had over 300 amendments submitted to the \nRules Committee. Here on this floor, sometimes we have a very open \nprocess with appropriations bills, Mr. Speaker, where absolutely \neveryone can offer absolutely any idea at absolutely any time they want \nto. This process is a little more structured, and I want to stipulate \nthat that is true. We had a lot of duplicative amendments offered, Mr. \nSpeaker. This is important work. We didn't want to waste the body's \ntime. We culled those duplicative amendments.\n  We had a couple amendments offered, Mr. Speaker, that were not minor \nchanges to the underlying legislation. They were major revisions to \npublic policy that had not had committee hearings and that had not had \nany public discussions. We culled those as well.\n  But over 120 amendments, Mr. Speaker, will now be made in order on a \nbill, again, that was not the product of days of effort, not a product \nof weeks of effort, not months, but years of effort of our House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee to bring together a product \nthat this body can be proud of--a product, I might add, that \nRepublicans in the past and Democrats in the past have failed to come \ntogether and succeed on.\n  This is a day of celebration, Mr. Speaker, as we offer this rule to \nconsider even more of our colleagues' ideas. I hope that we will get \nunanimous support for this rule, Mr. Speaker. With the passage of this \nrule, we can get into debate, and we can move this bill one step closer \nto the President's desk, and we can move one step closer to making a \ndifference for those families back home.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, we will get to what is in the bill in a minute. With \nregards to process, as an example of a Member of this body, I had a \nnumber of issues in the transportation area I wanted to address in my \ndistrict. Most notably, I wanted to address the sound levels of train \nhorns in our busy downtown areas, like Fort Collins and Longmont. It is \none of the biggest issues I hear about from our local downtown \nbusinesses; and, of course, to anybody who, including myself, has been \ndowntown with the train blaring by in close proximity, it really is a \nmajor detriment to the quality of life, and there is no significant \nevidence that I have seen or that has been presented to me that this in \nany way improves safety. So I did offer an amendment that would have \nchanged that. Unfortunately, it was blocked in Rules Committee.\n  Now, on that particular issue, we had a discussion with the chair and \nthe ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. \nI hope to work with him in other ways. But to say that somehow this is \nan open process, that I can bring forth and other Members can bring \nforth amendments to improve the bill--of course, there were a few \nallowed. Out of 302, there were 126 allowed. That means there are more \ndisappointed Members that had ideas than there are satisfied Members \nthat are at least going to have the opportunity to bring their idea \nforward.\n  Again, it is 126. It is better than 50, and it is better than 30, \nthere is no question. But it also means there are an awful lot of \nRepublicans and Democrats, including my colleague from Wisconsin (Mr. \nDuffy) with whom I sponsored--he as the Republican; I as the lead \nDemocrat--a bipartisan amendment that would have dealt with train \nstoppages. We are dealing with this also in Fort Collins, where we have \ntrains that do switching and delay traffic sometimes for 15, 30, and 45 \nminutes. We are simply saying that you can't do that in an urban zone; \nthat delays traffic. It can impede ambulances and fire engines from \nreaching their destinations. It is dangerous. We simply proposed an \namendment to impose a civil penalty of $10,000 around that to deter \nthat kind of action. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, that amendment was \nblocked under this very rule that we are talking about here.\n\n  I have, for instance, an amendment that is very important in my \ndistrict for highway 70 designation that is allowed under this rule, \nand I am happy that it is. Keep in mind, in perspective, there are many \nmore ideas--good, bad, and other--that Republicans and Democrats had on \nboth sides of the aisle that they weren't even allowed to talk about \nand aren't even allowed to talk about under this rule, this restrictive \nrule, that we have before us today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wish that I could do something and that the Rules \nCommittee allowed me to do something about excess train noise in our \ndowntown areas. I wish that the Rules Committee had allowed Mr. Duffy, \nme, and the many others that this affects to do something about train \nstoppages closing traffic and endangering the public in our downtown \nareas. But it was not allowed under this rule, not allowed at all.\n  Mr. Speaker, calling this bill a 6-year reauthorization is also a bit \nof a misnomer. The bill only makes funding available for 2 to 3 years. \nSo this is not, in fact, a 6-year bill. It is a 2- to 3-year bill. It \nis being touted for something that it doesn't have the power to do. \nSimply calling it a 6-year bill when you are only funding it for 2 to 3 \nyears doesn't make it so.\n  Mr. Speaker, our economy is still fragile. Americans are concerned \nabout maintaining and growing their quality of life. Affordable \nhousing, quality education, and retirement are sometimes out of the \ngrasp of too many Americans. Critical infrastructure on public roads \nand bridges is absolutely important for driving our economy forward.\n  My colleagues and I are charged with recognizing and offering \ninnovative solutions to these problems. We are each selected by \nconstituencies that have particular items that impact them. I was sent \nhere to work on train noise, as an example, and train stoppages that \ndelay traffic, the designation of highway 70, which we hope to be able \nto include in the final bill, and many other transportation issues, \nsome of which are reflected in the bill.\n\n[[Page H7643]]\n\n  I certainly commend my colleagues on the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee for working diligently in trying to bring up a \nlong-term, robustly funded, and thoughtful bill.\n  This bill, unfortunately, is another exclusionary bill. Again, you \ncan certainly say there could be improvement to have more amendments \nthan prior bills have allowed, but there are many more good ideas that \nRepublicans and Democrats have offered that are not allowed to be \ndebated under this rule.\n  I commend the process and its inclusion of critical provisions \nregarding the Export-Import Bank. This is important to many companies \nin my district to ensure that U.S. businesses are competing on a level \nplaying field. As an example, Fiberlok, located in my district in Fort \nCollins, is a specialty printing company. It provides heat transfer \ngraphics. It is family owned, and about 40 percent of its business is \nexport business.\n  I also visited Boulder-based Droplet Measurement Technologies, which \nwas named Export-Import Bank's Small Business Exporter of the Year for \nits work in cloud and aerosol measurements.\n  We simply want a level playing field for American businesses.\n  Of course, this package has some commendable transportation-related \nprovisions. For instance, it provides $325 billion in Federal contract \nauthority and allows for the direct deposit of any additional revenues \nCongress is able to come up with. It invests in all modes of surface \ntransportation, highway, transit, and maintaining funding for \nalternatives like biking and walking that should be commended. It \ncreates a $4.5-billion competitive grant program allowing States to \ncompete for geographically expansive projects that impact and can now \nbe financed by multiple States and regions.\n  Unfortunately, however, this is not a 6-year authorization. From the \nInfrastructure 2.0 Act I recently introduced, along with my colleague \nMr. Delaney, to the President's GROW AMERICA Act, to Mr. DeFazio's and \nRepresentative Blumenauer's initiatives to re-index the gas tax, many \nof us have been in the forefront of offering avenues for full funding \nof this bill. Yet, unfortunately, time and time again, whether it is \nthe repatriation concept or whether it is a re-indexation of the gas \ntax concept, all of the very reasonable offers and ideas that we have \nput forward have been repeatedly and inexplicably rejected, and we have \nseen a failure from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nbring forward ways to actually pay for what they claim is a 6-year \nbill.\n  Look, a long-term, sustainable, funded bill is what we want. If that \nis the bill we get, Mr. Speaker, I will personally whip that bill. But \nthis is not that bill. This bill fails to make the commitment needed to \nour Nation's crumbling transportation and infrastructure, and it sets \nthe precedent of authorizing investments without paying for them, which \nhas been the whole difficult part of putting a bill together, which \nthis bill just kicks the can down the road on.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  I oppose this overly restrictive rule and the path that we are taking \nto pretend that a bill is 6 years when we only pay for it for 2 to 3 \nyears.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I remember when I ran for Congress 4\\1/2\\ years ago, I had this idea \nthat because I had really good ideas and had the backing of 700,000 \nfolks back home in the district who also had really good ideas that we \nwere going to be able to come up here and share our good ideas; 435 of \nmy colleagues were going to recognize the wisdom that I brought from \nthe great State of Georgia, and we were just going to be able to make \nthose things happen.\n  It has been harder than I had anticipated, Mr. Speaker; I will \nconfess that to you. It has been harder than I had anticipated. It \nturns out there are some folks in other parts of the country who have \nsome different ideas.\n  My friend from Colorado is absolutely right. He offered two \namendments yesterday, and he only got one of them made in order. That \nhas happened to me, too. That has happened to me, too.\n  We have got to talk about what we are going to define as success in \nthis place. Are we going to define getting half of everything you want \nas failure, or are we going to define getting half of everything you \nwant as a huge step in the right direction that we can celebrate \ntogether?\n  There are not that many bills in this institution, Mr. Speaker, that \nare worked through in the bipartisan, collaborative way that this one \nhas happened. It is not easy. It is tremendously difficult--\ntremendously difficult. Why? Because we have legitimate disagreements \nabout public policy--legitimate disagreements about public policy.\n  Now, I don't want to tamp down my friend's pessimism about 3-year \nfunding instead of 6-year funding. I want 6-year funding, too. I have \nwanted it from day one, and I am prepared to vote for it today. I \nhaven't found quite as much enthusiasm for that around not just this \nfloor, but the floor right down the hall in the United States Senate. \nWe are going to have to sort that out.\n  I tell you, with no small bit of optimism, that I think we are going \nto find that 6-year funding before we see a conference report back on \nthis floor. I believe it. We need it. We have serious people working at \nit, and we have the ability to make it so.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, by any measure--by any measure--certainty of \nfunding, certainty of authorization, bipartisanship, nonpartisanship, \namendments made in order, length of time of the authorization, length \nof time of the funding, by any measure--this is the best transportation \nbill and the best transportation rule that have come to this floor in \nmore than a decade--more than a decade.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't want us to take our toys and go home claiming \nvictory over all that ails America. That is not where we are today. I \nwant us to take credit for making a small step in the right direction \ntogether, a step that so many of our colleagues before us have failed \nto succeed at together, and engage in what is sure to be not another \nhour or 2 or 3 or 4, but dozens of hours to continue to improve this \nwork product of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n  This is a moment of opportunity for us, Mr. Speaker. We can spend our \ntime grousing about what we didn't get, or we can spend our time \ncelebrating what we did get, put this bill on the President's desk, \ncreate certainty for America, and then come right back together the day \nafter and begin to make improvements once again. That is the way this \ninstitution has always worked when it has worked at its finest, Mr. \nSpeaker, and that is the way I expect this institution to work today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee \non Transportation and Infrastructure.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, in terms of what the gentleman from Georgia \njust said, I do appreciate the fact that we are debating many policy \namendments. That is the way the process should work, both sides of the \naisle contribute. That is great. Some were excluded that I think should \nhave been included. I don't know why they weren't allowed. I was \nwilling to stay here later last night and stay later tonight so \neverybody who wanted an amendment could have a chance.\n  But the biggest and most glaring omission by the Rules Committee is \nof not allowing any attempt by this House to fund the bill. That is \npretty extraordinary. Actually, we probably don't even have 3 years of \npretend funding in the bill because some of those offsets were spent \nlast week in the big budget deal, so I don't know what we have left. \nBut it sure as heck isn't anywhere near 6 years of funding; and it is \nnot 6 years of funding at a more robust level, which is necessary.\n  Even if we funded this bill for 6 years, at the end of 6 years, our \ninfrastructure will be more deteriorated than it is today. It is \ndeteriorating more quickly than we are investing. That is a problem.\n  We need to increase the investment. We haven't raised the Federal gas \ntax since 1993. That is a user fee, a user fee created by President \nDwight David Eisenhower, raised again by Ronald Reagan, and then \nfinally by Bill Clinton the last time it was increased. A bipartisan \nidea: user fee. Fund infrastructure for transportation with a user fee.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports an increase in the user fee. \nThe American Trucking Association supports an increase in the user fee. \nWe\n\n[[Page H7644]]\n\nare virtually being begged by interest groups out there representing \nconsumers and commercial users of the system to do something, vote on \nsomething.\n  I offered a really simple little amendment. Let's just index the \nexisting gas tax so we don't lose more ground. If we did that, gas \nwould go up 1.7 cents a gallon next year. I think consumers would be \noutraged. No, they wouldn't be outraged. They would be pleased we \nstarted filling in the potholes and doing away with the detours around \nthe bridges that are closed.\n\n  If you indexed and you project that, you could borrow money against \nthe future income following the budget rules of PAYGO. We could borrow \n$100 billion and fill in the huge hole in this bill and then use some \nof those so-called pay-fors to increase spending under this bill.\n  Why can't we have a simple vote on revenues, a vote by the House of \nRepresentatives?\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto say that I can identify with the gentleman from Oregon's \nfrustration.\n  The frustration you see is not from a gentleman who does not have any \npower over the process. He is the ranking member of the Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee. But the rules of the House prevent the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee from funding \ntransportation. It is an incredibly powerless space to be in.\n  Your job on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is to \ncome up with good transportation policy. You just can't pull any of the \nlevers that fund it. That is the frustration you hear from my friend \nfrom Oregon, and I don't discount that in the least.\n  What I do discount, however, is any suggestion that what is happening \ntoday is in any way unprecedented. My friend from Oregon first began \nserving in this House when Ronald Reagan was President of the United \nStates, and not one Ways and Means major funding bill has come to this \nHouse floor under an open rule in any day of the gentleman's service--\nnot one. Not one Ways and Means bill funding this government has come \nto the House floor under an open rule. Not under Republicans, not under \nDemocrats, not ever--not ever.\n  There are lots of reasons for that. I don't need to get into arcane \nbudget policy. But what I do need to say is we have an opportunity in \nconference to solve this problem. We are grappling with openness in \nthis institution. I am excited about it, Mr. Speaker. A lot of folks \nsay, oh, we can't have openness on the floor because we will have to \ntake tough votes. I say, if you don't want to take tough votes, don't \nrun for Congress.\n  We have a serious challenge, however, in whether or not we allow a \ncommittee, like the Ways and Means Committee, whose sole purpose, whose \nsole jurisdiction, covers tax matters--no one else covers tax matters \nother than the Ways and Means Committee. Do we allow them to grapple \nwith funding issues, or do we bring an amendment to the floor, debate \nit for 9\\1/2\\ minutes, and change Federal tax policy together? We can \ndo that.\n  I am glad we are not doing Federal transportation policy in a 9-\nminute stint. I am glad we worked on it, again, not for days, not for \nweeks, not for months, but for years, together, to get policy that \nworked.\n  It is very puzzling to me, again, by any measure--by any measure. \nThis is the best transportation process and the best transportation \nrule that this body has seen in a decade. We can choose to recognize \nthat and improve upon it, or we can choose to continue the self-\nflagellation that seems to constitute government today. I don't \nunderstand it. I am very proud to be in this body. I am very proud to \nwork with each one of you, and I am very proud of the work that we have \ndone together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  I need 10 minutes at least to respond to that assertion. There is no \nparty with whom I have served over the last 35 years that has been any \nmore into self-flagellation of the United States Government, the \nAmerican Government, than his party. I will say with all due respect.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HOYER. No.\n  Mr. WOODALL. The gentleman is not talking about me. The gentleman is \ntalking about my party.\n  Mr. HOYER. I talked about your party.\n  Mr. WOODALL. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. But I will tell you that I disagree with the gentleman's \nbasic premise. He talks about the rule. The rule is not the issue. I am \nagainst this rule. Its substance, that is what the gentleman from \nOregon was talking about. He was talking about investing and making \nAmerica grow, creating jobs. That is what we ought to be debating, not \nsome rule for you to have a lot of amendments. You can have a zillion \namendments. If they are all awful, it won't be a good rule.\n  I rise in opposition to this rule. I rise in opposition because it \nwould make in order several amendments that undermine the will of a \nmajority of both parties in this House, that the Export-Import Bank \nshould be reopened immediately.\n  I said for a year and a half the majority of this House was for it; \nand for a year and a half, it was bottled up by a committee chairman in \na closed process.\n  Since some Republicans blocked an extension of the Export-Import \nBank's charter authority and let it shut down in July, hundreds of \nAmerican jobs have been shipped overseas, and exporters and their \nworkers have been unable to compete on a level playing field in foreign \nmarkets.\n  Last month, in a historic effort, virtually all Democrats and a \nmajority of Republicans came together to end the gridlock and take \nsteps to allow the House to work its will and hold a vote on reopening \nthe Export-Import Bank. This rule seeks to reverse that process.\n  When that vote was finally held, Mr. Speaker, 127 Republicans finally \ngot the opportunity to work their will--a majority of their \nConference--and joined with every Democrat, save one, to reopen the \nBank and create jobs in our country.\n  The will of this House is clear, unequivocal. The best way to reopen \nthe Bank is by keeping, unchanged, in this highway bill the Heitkamp-\nKirk language, a bipartisan amendment from the Senate that 313 Members, \notherwise known as 75 percent of this body, voted for last week on this \nfloor. The amendments that this rule would make in order are, in \neffect, a last-ditch attempt by the Bank's opponents to undo the will \nof the majority of this House.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule; and should it be adopted, \nas is likely the case, I urge every one of my colleagues who voted to \nreopen the Export-Import Bank last week to stand together in defeating \nevery single amendment offered on the Export-Import Bank so we can \nstand together to defeat all of the amendments that are offered on the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 25 seconds.\n  Mr. HOYER. It is a Senate bill and a House bill that are exactly the \nsame. If they had been passed alone, they would be on the President's \ndesk right now.\n  Once again, we need to help American exporters; but more importantly \nthan that, we need to help American workers get and keep jobs. We talk \na lot about it. This is an opportunity to do it. Defeat any and every \namendment, no matter how sugary it may sound, to defeat the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I don't fault my friend from Maryland for not yielding. He had very \nlimited time. I remember the days of the magic minute. Those were \nbetter yielding days.\n  Mr. HOYER. But I will yield to him on his time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. I appreciate that. The gentleman is always generous.\n  Mr. Speaker, while the minority whip was the majority leader of this \ninstitution, this House did a lot of big things--a lot of big things. \nBut what they couldn't do--what they couldn't do--was a bill like the \none that Ranking Member DeFazio and Chairman Bill Shuster have brought \nto the floor today.\n\n[[Page H7645]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  We can cast this dye and call it anything we want to; but the fact of \nthe matter is it is a success, and it is one that we have done \ntogether. I don't know where partisanship comes into this process, and \nit will be a shame if it comes in today because it sure hasn't been in \nin the previous days, weeks, months, and years that we have been \nworking on this process.\n  I had some great ideas for this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I serve on the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee. Where better for a fellow \nwith great ideas on transportation to work than on the Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee.\n  So I knocked on my chairman's door. I said, Mr. Chairman, I bring the \nwisdom of the Seventh District of Georgia. I have crafted it all here \nin legislative language for you. Let me just go ahead and give it to \nyou so you can include it in the base text.\n  Do you know what the chairman said to me?\n  He said, Rob, we are doing this in a collaborative manner. If your \nideas are that good, you are going to find some folks on the other side \nof the aisle who believe in your ideas, too. You bring me back those \nideas. Together, we will get it done.\n  He was right. That is exactly what I did. My ideas were that good. \nThank you very much. I did go out and find some collegiality on the \nother side of the aisle, and we did include those ideas in the base \ntext. That is what this product is.\n  You can't do that on every piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker, as the \ndivisions are too great; but the minority whip was right--this is about \njobs. There is not a local mayor in the country who doesn't know that, \nas one's transportation infrastructure and education infrastructure \ngoes, so goes one's community.\n  We need to solve that education piece. Today, we are going to solve \nthe transportation piece. Not once in more than a decade has a bill \ncome to the floor of this House with the kind of commitment to \ntransportation and infrastructure that this bill has today. My hope is, \nsomewhere in these 81 amendments this rule makes in order, we will be \nable to improve upon that bill. If nothing else, if we can't improve \nupon it, at least we can find out where the will of the House is by \ndefeating those amendments.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the process I ran to be a part of. This is the \nway I imagined the House to work. I am very proud to be here today, and \nI hope my colleagues will take some of that pride as well.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I was proud to join my Ways and Means \nCommittee colleague, my counterpart--Mr. Renacci of Ohio--along with \nseveral other Members, in submitting to the Rules Committee a modified \nversion of our bipartisan bill to provide long-term, sustainable \nfunding for our highways and bridges, which this bill does not do.\n  Our proposal would have used the next 3 paid-for years to set up a \ntask force to devise a plan to fund the remaining years of the bill. \nContinuity can ensure that construction projects and the jobs they \nprovide don't come to a grinding halt when Congress fails to act.\n  The fact that our bipartisan amendment to save the highway trust fund \nwas shut out from floor consideration but that the devolution crowd \ngets a vote on their plan to dismantle the fund speaks volumes about \nhow this leadership views the concept of an open process and regular \norder, to say nothing of the place for compromise and bipartisan \nsolutions.\n  Look, we have a diverse coalition of colleagues who is cosponsoring \nour plan. We have support from a broad coalition of business, labor, \nconstruction, engineering, and transit advocates.\n  Let's be frank. Be it under Democratic or Republican control, this \nbody has been loath to make the tough decisions needed on the issue of \ntransportation funding. It is a disgrace that our bipartisan team was \nnot given the chance to put the trust back into the trust fund.\n  I urge my colleagues to send a message by opposing this bill.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  ``Disgrace'' is a strong word from my friend; but I would say that, \nif there is disappointment in this institution, it is that the Ways and \nMeans Committee, with the sole jurisdiction over funding \ntransportation, has failed under both Republican and Democratic \nleadership to provide long-term transportation funding. The gentleman \nserves on that committee. I don't. I welcome his support on the \nsteering committee if I try to make that move.\n  It is not easy, Mr. Speaker, to find that transportation funding, and \nthe gentleman made a passionate pitch in the Rules Committee last night \nabout the importance of keeping the user fee dynamic at play here.\n  Mr. Speaker, there was a time when the transportation bill was pushed \nby folks back home, not because they needed transportation certainty, \nas they so desperately need today, but because the local jurisdiction \nwas only getting back about 80 cents out of every gas tax dollar they \nwere sending in. They wanted to push that number up to 81 or to 82. It \nbrought us all together around pushing a bill.\n  When we decided we didn't have the courage in the United States \nCongress--I was not in this institution at that time--to actually fund \nwhat it was that we had paid for, we began taking money out of general \nrevenues and just stuffing it in the transportation trust fund. Now, if \nyou are a road builder, if you are in the business of getting people to \nwork, if you are in the business of getting families out of traffic, if \nyou are in the business of making America's economy grow, you thought \nthat was a trade worth making. You had no idea that, now that every \nState is getting back more than a dollar for every dollar of taxes they \nsend in, it is really hard to get people back to the table to fix the \nproblem that the gentleman is speaking of.\n  We are at a nexus here, Mr. Speaker, between trying to solve a \nproblem and trying to preserve our user fee system. I don't know where \nthe division in the road is going to go. If we fail to maintain the \nuser fee system when we find the additional year 4, year 5, and year 6 \nof transportation funding, we may never get it back.\n  Mr. Speaker, I represent a very conservative area in the great State \nof Georgia. We don't much care for taxes of any kind. We don't mind \ntaking care of one another, but we feel like we do it better ourselves \nthan do folks from far, far away. My local jurisdiction rejected \nFederal gas taxes. It rejected State gas taxes. It passed for \nthemselves a $200 million bonding initiative to build roads locally \nbecause they believed they would get it done. Users are paying for \nthose roads.\n  There is not a conservative in this country, I would posit, who is \nunwilling to pay for what it is that he uses. It is our job to go sell \nthat to folks--that, if you use it, you need to pay for it--and there \nis no shame in that. It is a constitutional responsibility that we have \nin this body, and it is one we ought to be proud to stand up and \nsupport.\n  Though, I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that \nwe are going to have some EPA discussions in this legislation. My folks \nback home don't believe that, if they send a dollar to Washington, they \nare going to get a dollar's worth of roads back in return. They don't. \nThey believe 10 percent is going to come off here and 10 percent is \ngoing to come off there. It is going to be wasted on regulatory \ncompliance here, and it is going to be wasted on silly Federal mandates \nthere; and they are going to get 50 cents of road for a dollar's worth \nof taxes. I don't think they are all wrong about that, Mr. Speaker. I \nthink there is a lot of wisdom in that suspicion.\n  Now, this bill does a lot to correct that.\n  Two days ago, we had the ranking member of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee in the Rules Committee, who was making that \nvery point, which is that this bill is working to restore that trust.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, who worry about \nfunding as I worry about funding, if we restore that trust, we will \nhave access to the funding.\n  It is a very challenging issue, Mr. Speaker. It is our \nresponsibility, in\n\n[[Page H7646]]\n\nhaving lost that trust, to restore it. This bill takes a major step in \nthat direction.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, my friend from Georgia suggests that this is very \ncomplex and difficult and that we have wrapped ourselves around the \naxle, and we can't do this in the Rules Committee or in the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n  That is hogwash.\n  I wish that the Ways and Means Committee would have accepted the \nlegislation that I have had for the last 5 years that is supported by \nthe Chamber and the truckers and AAA and bicyclists and engineers--but, \nno, they have not done it. We could have an opportunity with this bill. \nThere are a number of my colleagues who have proposals for finance, but \nthey wouldn't even make in order a study, for heaven's sakes.\n  This year, seven Republican States, including Georgia, have raised \nthe gas tax. They have followed the admonition of President Ronald \nReagan in 1982, who called on Congress to come back after Thanksgiving \nrecess and raise the gas tax.\n  The gentleman was not there when I testified, but I submitted a list \nof 18 organizations that support raising the gas tax, and we are not \neven allowed an opportunity to debate it on the floor. That is why we \ncan't do as good a job as we want with this transportation bill.\n  And what are we given?--a 6-year shell with 3 years of, sort of, pay-\nfors--I like this--requiring the Federal Reserve dividend, which is \nopposed by most of my Republican friends. There are 150 people who \nsigned a letter, saying that it is really stupid to sell the strategic \noil reserve at twice what the current price is and--one of my \nfavorites--having bill collectors hound poor people for their taxes. \nThe last two times we tried it, it lost money.\n  This is a fraud. I urge rejection.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As a Rules Committee member--and it is called the powerful House \nRules Committee for a reason--I am thrilled to see the parade of my \nWays and Means colleagues on the House floor, who are saying that what \nWays and Means doesn't get done we should be doing in the Rules \nCommittee instead. I am excited about that as, I am sure, my friend \nfrom Colorado is as well. Together, we can do a lot of good tax policy.\n  I have a bill called the ``FairTax.'' I haven't been able to bring it \nto the floor yet. With the endorsement now of two of my Ways and Means' \nfriends that we ought to be able to make these amendments in order on \nmajor funding legislation and bring them to the floor, I am looking \nforward to trying to get that delegation letter going. I don't have any \nDemocrats on the bill right now, but I would welcome anybody. It is \nH.R. 25, the fundamental tax reform bill. I would love to bring that to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are talking as if it is over right now, as if there \nis no more debate left to have. That is what is nonsense. We are going \nto continue improving this bill throughout the afternoon and into the \nnight and into tomorrow. We are going to take this bill to conference \nand improve it still.\n  I have said it once, but I will say it again: the opportunity for 6 \nyears of funding is still there.\n  This isn't the time to turn the firing squad inward. This is the time \nto stand shoulder to shoulder and get out there and do this together. \nWe believe in that, Mr. Speaker. We couldn't reach agreement with the \nSenate last year because they wanted 3 years of funding, and we wanted \n6. We were dreaming the big dreams, not as Republicans and Democrats, \nbut as the U.S. House of Representatives--as the people's House. Those \ndays are still upon us. We have an environment in which to win. I hope \nwe will seize it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nNevada (Ms. Titus), a member of the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure.\n  Ms. TITUS. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, when the new Speaker took the gavel last week, he \npromised us that the House would run differently in that Members on \nboth sides of the aisle would get a chance to bring forth amendments \nand that the House would debate the merits of those.\n  Today, I am reminded of the saying, ``Plus ca change, plus c'est la \nmeme chose.''\n  Like the gentleman admonished and as the chairman said, I worked \nacross the aisle and brought a bipartisan amendment with my friend, Mr. \nDavis from Illinois. It made a small change about the local use of \ntransportation dollars. Despite overwhelming support, we were denied \nthe opportunity to bring that amendment to the floor.\n  In the middle of the night, in the backroom here in the Capitol, the \nmajority decided that the will of the people simply didn't have to be \nheard on this important transportation issue; yet they have allowed 10 \namendments to be heard on the Export-Import Bank, which have nothing to \ndo with transportation, and the issue of which was resolved a week ago.\n  Indeed, I say, the more things change, the more they stay the same. \nSo, despite all the fancy rhetoric you are hearing, I would urge you to \nremember that and to vote ``no'' on this rule.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  With this new order that we have here, we are going to have to work \nthrough it together, and it is not going to be easy. For the folks who \nthink it is going to be easy, I would go ahead and turn your voting \ncard in now and let somebody else come up here and do the work. It is \nnot going to be easy. It is going to be hard.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Because what constitutes regular order for us? How do we work \ntogether?\n  My friend from Nevada just talked about her amendment that the Rules \nCommittee didn't consider. She is absolutely right. That said, she \noffered the amendment in committee and withdrew it before we had a \nchance to vote on it.\n  We had this topic before us in the Transportation Committee and \ndidn't do it there. Folks chose to do it on the House floor and in the \nRules Committee instead. Is that the way we want this institution to \nwork? Do we want to ignore the issues at the committees of jurisdiction \nand bring them to the House floor straightaway, or do we want to work \nthrough the committee process?\n  I don't have all the answers, Mr. Speaker. I have one vote in a body \nof 435. I generally side on the side of openness as opposed to being \nclosed. I generally side on the side of voting instead of not voting.\n  Of all the rules I have had a chance to handle, Mr. Speaker, in the \n4\\1/2\\ years the good people of the Seventh District have entrusted me \nwith their voting card, this bill that we have before us, this rule \nthat we have before us makes in order more voices than any other rule I \nhave ever handled.\n  If folks don't think we have gone far enough today, fair enough. \nLet's talk about it again tomorrow. But I challenge you to tell me that \nwe did it better yesterday, not ``we'' the Republicans yesterday, not \n``we'' the Democrats yesterday, but ``we'' this House yesterday.\n  I have been watching this institution a long time. Not in more than \n10 years have we even considered a bill of this magnitude on the floor \nof the House, and I am pleased that we finally came together to do it \ntoday.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Delaney).\n  Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Speaker, my good friend from Georgia talks about the \ncertainty that will be obtained by this bill. There will be certainty. \nThere will be an absolute certainty that we will continue to \nunderinvest in our infrastructure in the United States of America for \nthe next 6 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, because of recent funding levels, we have caused the \ninfrastructure in this country to be underinvested by a huge number. \nPeople estimate we have a $6 trillion shortfall in our infrastructure. \nWell, that is a huge challenge. It is also a huge opportunity. If we \ncould actually increase our investment in infrastructure, we\n\n[[Page H7647]]\n\nwould create jobs, we would improve the lives of our constituents, and \nwe would make our country more competitive.\n  Instead, we are looking at a bill that locks in infrastructure \nspending at current levels for another 6 years. How anyone could \npossibly look at the facts, look at the data, and look at the situation \nof the infrastructure in this country and conclude that that is the \nright answer is beyond my comprehension.\n  The only way to stop this chronic underinvestment in our \ninfrastructure that will cause the infrastructure crisis in this \ncountry to continue to build is to reject this rule and reject the \nunderlying bill so that this Congress can go back to the drawing board \nand figure out smart ways to increase our funding in infrastructure.\n  There are bipartisan solutions. We have heard about some of them \ntoday. One of the ones that I have worked on for years is to tie \nincreasing our investment in infrastructure to international tax \nreform, where we have trillions of dollars sitting overseas trapped. If \nwe can create pathways for that money to come back, we can allocate \nadditional revenue towards infrastructure and increase our investment \nin infrastructure so we will not continue to have the problem of \nchronic underinvestment in our infrastructure and we can rebuild \nAmerica.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my friend from Maryland he is \nabsolutely right. We could do better in terms of certainty.\n  I would remind the gentleman that when Democrats ran this institution \nthe cycle before I got here, they passed six different transportation \nextension bills in 2 years. That means we are averaging 4 months of \ncertainty.\n  This bill, even under the most pessimistic assertions, gives us 3 \nyears of certainty, which is more certainty than America has seen in a \ndecade. I am not trying to stop trying, Mr. Speaker. I want us to keep \nfighting forward together. I just want us to recognize that this is the \nbest we have done in a long, long time. Let's take advantage of having \ndone the best we have done in a long, long time, and let's keep trying \nto do better.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. \nDuncan), a senior member of the Transportation Committee.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank the gentleman \nfrom Georgia for yielding me this time. In my 27 years in this \nCongress, I can think of very few Members who are better orators, \ngreater speakers than the gentleman from Georgia; and I appreciate his \ngiving me this time.\n  I rise in support of this rule.\n  Later today, Congressman Paulsen of Minnesota and I will be offering \nan amendment that, I think, is very technical in nature; but it is \ndesigned to help the smallest businesses in the trucking industry.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for \nincluding some provisions from a bill that I introduced in the base \ntext that establishes hiring practices that a freight broker must \nfollow.\n  My and Mr. Paulsen's amendment clarifies the requirements that a \nfreight broker must meet before hiring a motor carrier for the delivery \nof goods. This bill will require a broker to check to ensure that a \nmotor carrier is first registered with, and authorized by, the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration to operate as a licensed motor \ncarrier; and, secondly, that it has the minimum insurance required by \nFederal law; and, third, it has the satisfactory safety fitness \ndetermination by the FMCSA. My amendment inserts ``or be unrated'' in \nthe third requirement.\n  Currently, there are thousands of small trucking companies which have \nyet to be audited by the FMCSA. By adding the words ``or be unrated,'' \nwe ensure that these very small companies will not be precluded from \nbeing in the pool of eligible motor carriers that can be used for \nshipping goods.\n  Without this modest change, thousands of very small, very safe \ntrucking companies will be eliminated from the pool of eligible motor \ncarriers just because the FMCSA has not had time or staff levels enough \nto rate them. Without this amendment, thousands of small companies that \nhave never had a wreck or a violation will be hurt.\n  So, without this change, we will hurt small businesses and drive up \nthe cost of shipping goods for everyone. This is an amendment for the \nlittle guy, the mom-and-pop operators.\n  There is a second part to this amendment that address a fourth \nrequirement that must be checked by the brokers. This fourth condition \nrequires a broker to check to make sure that a motor carrier has not \nbeen issued an out-of-service order to prohibit a carrier from \nconducting operations.\n  To conclude, I will just say my and Mr. Paulsen's amendment ensures \nthat we have only safe trucks on the road and that thousands of small \nbusinesses are not hurt in the process. This amendment is supported by \nthe Owner Operators Independent Drivers Association, the Transportation \nIntermediaries Association, various other associations, the \nInternational Warehouse Logistics Association, and on and on.\n\n  I would urge my colleagues to look into this amendment and hopefully \nsupport it later today when we bring it to the floor.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, many American workers don't have access to \npaid sick days, which means they can't miss work without losing a day's \npay or risking their job security, sometimes even endangering the \npublic health by spreading their flu or cold to others.\n  Mr. Speaker, everyone should be able to take care of themselves or \ntheir loved ones when they are sick and not have to worry about losing \ntheir job or falling behind on their bills.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. \nDeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous \nquestion. Defeating the previous question will allow us to amend the \nrule to provide for consideration of the Healthy Families Act. It is an \nact that would allow workers to earn up to 7 days of job-protected sick \nleave every year.\n  Being a working parent should not mean choosing between your job and \ntaking care of yourself and your family. But at least 43 million \nprivate sector workers, 39 percent of the workforce, must make this \ndecision every time illness strikes. Millions more cannot earn paid \nsick time to care for a sick child or for a family member.\n  Employers ultimately suffer when workers have to make this choice. \nIncreased turnover rates amount to greater costs. And employers can \njeopardize the health of other employees when their policies force \nemployees to come to work sick.\n  Paid sick days policies have been enacted successfully at the State \nand local levels. Nearly 20 jurisdictions across the country have \nadopted paid sick day laws, and there is strong public support for \nuniversal access to paid sick days. Eighty-eight percent of Americans \nsupport paid sick days legislation.\n  The Healthy Families Act allows working families to meet their health \nand financial needs while boosting businesses' productivity and \nretention rates.\n  It ultimately strengthens this Nation's economy. It is common sense, \nbusiness savvy, and it is the right thing to do. Let's protect the \npublic health, boost the economy, help hardworking families have access \nto paid sick days. Let's pass the Healthy Families Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Neal), the ranking member on the Ways and Means \nSubcommittee on Select Revenue Measures.\n  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, we shouldn't be bragging about this \nlegislation today, boasting about this legislation. Let me give you the \nperspective of 27 years here.\n  This used to be the easiest legislation to pass in this institution. \nIt created\n\n[[Page H7648]]\n\ngreater cost efficiencies. It created greater investment and, just as \nimportantly, it put people to work immediately.\n  There was no hearing held on the tax title portion of this bill. \nThere was no operation or opportunity for Members to offer amendments \nin the Ways and Means Committee. Now, let me point out, for that 4-year \nperiod when we were in the majority, I held those hearings; and then \nafter the loss of elections, during those 4 years, nothing ever came of \nit again.\n  We have repeatedly urged the opportunity to talk about a genuine \nmechanism for financing the Federal highway system, our airports, our \nrailroads; and the opportunity has not availed itself.\n  To point something out here that I think is noteworthy as well, this \nfinancing is held together by bubble gum. How many times are we going \nto sell the oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? Every time I turn \naround, it becomes the pay-for these days. Is there any oil left in \nthere? That is how we are going to finance the Federal highway system?\n  A reminder, what I heard earlier that in some States people only want \nto pay for services that they use, that was the revenue mechanism, the \nuser fee, the gas tax that allowed people to pay for the services that \nthey used; namely, driving along on the Federal highway system. Now, \nhow is that for a complication?\n  We are here today because we have not adequately addressed the \nFederal highway system's responsibility and that begins in this House \nof the Congress where all financing, according to our Constitution, is \nsupposed to originate. If the Ways and Means Committee isn't taking it \nup, there is no opportunity for the House to take it up.\n  Don't brag about this rule today. It is a bad rule, and we should \nvote it down and get on with financing the Federal highway system the \nway it is supposed to be financed.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  I just remind my friend, during the Congress before I arrived when he \nwas chairman, four different extensions of the highway trust fund, not \none of them was funded with a change in the gas tax.\n  Mr. NEAL. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, we held the hearings. We went through it. We \nhad the Chamber of Commerce in, the American Trucking Association, and \nwe had organized labor in. We were set to go, and then we lost the \ninstitution and that was the end of the discussion about the Federal \nhighway system.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nVermont (Mr. Welch), a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Neal said, this transportation highway \nbill used to be a solid, bipartisan bill that invested in the future of \nthis country. This Congress has set different expectations. I think if \nwe are candid with ourselves and with the American people, we have \nbecome a low-expectations Congress. I guess it could be said that this \nbill meets, but certainly doesn't exceed, the low expectations that \nprevail in this body.\n  It is true that it will have a 6-year bill authorization with 3 years \nof bubble-gum-styled funding. That is going to give some certainty to \nthe agency of transportation in Vermont, so it is true that this is \nbetter than when we were doing 3-month extensions and 5-month \nextensions on ``pension smoothing.''\n  You know what? America deserves better. America needs more, and we \ncan provide it. We have jobs to create, work to be done, workers ready \nto put shovels in the ground and to get America moving again. It is \nwithin our power, both sides, to make that happen. But it can't happen \nif we are so fearful to even discuss revenue measures that we don't \nhave hearings on them.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  We have had good proposals from Mr. Blumenauer, a bipartisan proposal \nwith Mr. Renacci and Mr. Pascrell, the Delaney proposal. There are \nsolutions out there that are going to invest in this country, generate \njobs for this economy, increase the gross domestic product, and make \nour economy more competitive and our highway system safer.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMaryland (Ms. Edwards), a member of the Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule \nprecisely because it makes in order various Export-Import Bank \namendments that are actually designed to kill what we just did to make \nsure that we could reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Nonetheless, I am grateful to Chairmen Shuster and Graves and Ranking \nMembers DeFazio and Norton and their committees and their personal \nstaffs for their leadership in trying to move forward a 6-year \nreauthorization.\n  All of us have acknowledged that this is far from perfect, but the \nfact is, America is literally falling apart: by asphalt, by rebar, by \ncement, by steel, by rail, pothole by pothole, just falling apart. The \nUnited States now ranks 16th in infrastructure according to the World \nEconomic Forum. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, \nthe overall assessment of our infrastructure ranks is, I am sad to say, \na whopping D plus.\n  As some of you remember from The Washington Post back in February, a \nconstituent of mine was driving on the Suitland Parkway, just outside \nof D.C. She was minding her own business, running her errands. What \nhappens? A chunk of cement falls down and hits her car. That is right, \na chunk of cement falling from the beltway to hit her car on the \nSuitland Parkway. Fortunately, no one was injured, but this is just one \nexample of a project that was on the Federal list and simply wasn't \nworked on because there was no money to do it.\n  I support what we are doing today in terms of a bipartisan \nauthorization for a long-term authorization, but this is nowhere near \nwhat we need to do to repair the couple of trillion dollars in \ninfrastructure deficit that we face in this country that is causing us \nnot to be as competitive as we need to be and really is taking up a \nbunch of time for people who are stuck on roads that are going nowhere.\n  Let me be clear, this is not the bill that I would have written. It \nis not perfect, but maybe it is the best that we can do under the \ncircumstances. Clearly, though, we shouldn't have a 6-year \nauthorization with only a couple years of funding. There have been \nnumerous proposals to fund our long-term infrastructure.\n  I am grateful that I was able to at least work on a couple of \namendments regarding oversight of the Washington Metropolitan Area \nTransit Authority, WMATA, and I look forward to continuing to work on \nthese efforts.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, a few of my colleagues have talked about selling down \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I think that is a great bipartisan \nidea to pay for something. We actually no longer need to have crude oil \nin the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Our Nation is a net producer of crude oil, so they are actually \nstockpiling the same stuff that we are talking about exporting; namely, \nunprocessed crude oil. There is a component of the crude oil reserve \nthat is heating oil that is processed. That is still necessary. That is \nnot being sold down. Nobody has talked about selling that down. I think \nwe can use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as an additional pay-for for \nother items until it is successfully phased out over the next few \nyears. I think this bill is the first step. I applaud my colleagues for \nincluding it.\n  Keep in mind, though, it is an accounting trick in terms of the \ndollar value of that. They are assuming that it will be sold at roughly \ntwice the current price of oil. That may happen; it may not. We don't \nknow. But at least it is being sold, and that is a good thing.\n  A third of our Nation's roads are rated poor or mediocre. We need to \ndo better. We have a responsibility to address the transportation and \ninfrastructure crisis.\n\n[[Page H7649]]\n\n  If you have ever been to Fort Collins, the biggest city in my \ncongressional district, home to Colorado State University, you have \nfound a lot of traffic along Interstate 25.\n  If you have ever traveled Interstate 70 to our world-class ski \nresorts, like Vail or Breckenridge, you might very well have been \nlocked in traffic as you went out there to enjoy the ski season or the \nsummer high season.\n  Fort Collins, Loveland, Boulder, Vail, Frisco, Breckenridge, these \nare our communities that are tourism-and recreation-driven, and we need \na 21st century transportation solution that provides consistency in \nfunding levels, not a shell game to fund 2 years of a 6-year bill.\n  We need to open up a future for major highway improvements, like we \nneed on Interstates 25 and 70. We need to put politics aside and not \nshroud a 2-year bill behind a facade of a 6-year bill. Our parents and \ngrandparents sacrificed to build a world-class national infrastructure \nsystem, but we need the courage to maintain it and improve it for the \n21st century.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the responsibility of this maneuver. \nI urge defeat of the previous question, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on my \nside?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 5\\3/4\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate my friend from Colorado working with me on this rule \ntoday. I appreciate all the folks on the Committee on Transportation \nand Infrastructure who made this possible, and the whole body that came \nin front of the Committee on Rules, bringing amendments to try to make \nthe bill better.\n  I don't want to suggest that the differences that we have between one \nanother here are in any way going away because of this bill. They are \nnot. I have heard passionate speech after passionate speech about \nfunding of this bill.\n  I share some of those concerns, but I represent a county of 200,000 \npeople who just raised $200 million in a bonding initiative to build \ntheir roads. Until my colleagues have raised the taxes on their \nconstituents by $1,000 on every man, woman, and child--$4,000 on a \nfamily of four--to build roads back home in your district, please don't \ncome and ask my constituents to pay even more.\n  Georgia is one of the States that has raised its gas tax, from a 7 \ncent sales tax to a 26 cent excise tax. When your State has taken on \nthat same burden of responsibility, come back to me and tell me how \nmuch more Georgia needs to put in to help you.\n  The devolution of the transportation trust fund has long been a \nconversation in this body, but by holding the Federal gas tax constant \nover these years, that devolution has been happening naturally with the \neffect of inflation, and localities are picking up the tab.\n  You know what we are celebrating this week back home, Mr. Speaker? \nThis is election week, of course. A year ago this week is when Forsyth \nCounty passed its $200 million bonding initiative. You know when they \nbroke ground on the project, Mr. Speaker? This week. This week. You \ntell me that time is money. It is true in transportation.\n  I challenge you to find that Federal project that you are working on \nback home in your district that you are going from conception to \ngroundbreaking in 12 months. I want to help you find the funding to \nmake it happen, I do, because, clearly, you are running at a heightened \nlevel of efficiency, and it deserves our support.\n  Mr. Speaker, the reason we need this bill is because we are not \ngetting a dollar's worth of value out of a dollar's worth of Federal \ntaxes. The reason we need this bill is to help make some of those \nbipartisan reforms to the infrastructure program that just don't make \nsense. They just don't make sense in the 21st century, and it is no \nwonder. Democratic Congresses failed to succeed in this effort. \nRepublican Congresses failed to succeed in this effort. This Congress \nis succeeding in this effort.\n  There are 81 new amendments with this rule today, 81 new ideas with \nthis amendment today. Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill has more \ncertainty and more funding than any other proposal this body has \nconsidered in more than a decade. This rule has more openness, more \nvoices, and more amendments than any other rule of this nature that I \nhave been able to handle in 4\\1/2\\ years here.\n  We don't get it right every day. We don't get it right every day. \nVotes don't go the way I want them to go every day, but we have got a \nchance, Mr. Speaker. We have got a chance with this bill, with this \nprocess, with this new House leadership team to restore the trust that \nhas been lost for far too long.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying \nresolution.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 512 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     932) to allow Americans to earn paid sick time so that they \n     can address their own health needs and the health needs of \n     their families. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and \n     controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority \n     members of the Committees on Education and the Workforce, \n     House Administration, and Oversight and Government Reform. \n     After general debate the bill shall be considered for \n     amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order \n     against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion \n     of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee \n     shall rise and report the bill to the House with such \n     amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments \n     thereto to final passage without intervening motion except \n     one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the \n     Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to \n     no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day \n     the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of \n     business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the \n     Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 932.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution .  .  . [and] has \n     no substantive legislative or policy implications \n     whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said. \n     Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative \n     Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th \n     edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the \n     previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is \n     generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority \n     Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. .  .  . When \n     the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of \n     the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to \n     ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then \n     controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or \n     yield for the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled\n\n[[Page H7650]]\n\n     ``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the \n     previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported \n     from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to \n     amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) \n     Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of the motion for \n     the previous question on a resolution reported from the \n     Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the \n     opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper \n     amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate \n     thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7650-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 1019\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON.

Pursuant to House Resolution 512 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the further consideration of the Senate \namendments to the bill, H.R. 22.\n  Will the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo) kindly take the \nchair.\n\n                              {time}  1504\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of \nthe Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 22) to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to exempt employees with health coverage under \nTRICARE or the Veterans Administration from being taken into account \nfor purposes of determining the employers to which the employer mandate \napplies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, with Mr. \nPalazzo (Acting Chair) in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, \nan amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-32 was \npending.\n  Pursuant to the order of the House of today, amendment No. 1, printed \nin part A of House Report 114-326, may be considered out of sequence.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Ryan of Ohio\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 56, line 8, after ``diesel retrofits'' insert ``or \n     alternative fuel vehicles''.\n       Page 56, line 9, insert ``or indirect'' after ``direct''.\n       Page 56, line 14, insert ``or indirectly'' after \n     ``directly''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Ryan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is cosponsored by \nCongresswoman Napolitano and is endorsed by the Natural Gas Vehicles \nfor America, the Electric Drive Transportation Association, and the \nNational Propane Gas Association.\n  The amendment addresses one specific provision in the bill, section \n1109, which modifies how Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality, CMAQ, \nfunds can be used in PM2.5 nonattainment and maintenance areas. ``PM'' \nstands for ``particulate matter.''\n  The purpose of the CMAQ Program is to fund transportation projects or \nprograms that will contribute to the attainment or maintenance of the \nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards. All projects and programs that \nare eligible for CMAQ funds must come from a conforming Federal or \nState transportation plan. The program is designed to allow States to \nidentify the right solution for their air quality challenges and \nutilize CMAQ funds to implement them.\n  Without the Ryan-Napolitano amendment, the language in section 1109 \nmay restrict States' discretion in identifying the most cost-effective \nemissions reduction technologies and effectively limit their options to \nonly diesel retrofits. Specifically, the priority consideration and use \nof funding provisions for the section seemingly restrict local \nauthorities' ability to consider other alternative vehicle technologies \nthat can be adopted to meet the goals of this section.\n  Other technologies, such as natural gas, propane, or electric \nvehicles, also reduce PM2.5 and provide other air quality benefits. In \nmy State of Ohio and the chairman's State of Pennsylvania, being two of \nthose States, they\n\n[[Page H7655]]\n\nallow for the use of CMAQ funds for a variety of alternative fuel \nvehicles. However, section 1109, as written, may limit their and other \nStates' solutions in using CMAQ funds to address the nonattainment \nissue.\n  We should not be directing States on how to use these funds, and it \nis important that we keep the utilization of CMAQ funding technology \nneutral. Giving States the flexibility in utilizing these funds allows \nthem to select the best vehicle technology to address PM2.5 concerns. \nModifying the priority consideration and the use of funding language in \nthis section allows us to meet the environmental goals while avoiding \npicking winners and losers.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Shuster for his help and Ranking \nMember DeFazio and their staffs for working with us on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Mrs. Napolitano), the amendment's cosponsor.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support as a \ncosponsor of this amendment. I thank my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Ryan) \nfor offering it. I thank the gentleman for allowing me to cosponsor it \nbecause this is an important issue for my area.\n  In section 1109(c), this amendment would clarify language in the bill \nin order for local transportation agencies to continue to fund not only \nhighway, but transit, bicycle, and pedestrian, projects with Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality Program funds, called CMAQ. This amendment \nwould also allow for alternative fuel vehicles to be eligible for \nrecipient funds along with diesel retrofit projects.\n  A concern was brought to my attention by the metropolitan planning \norganizations in California, including the Los Angeles County \nMetropolitan Transportation Authority and the cities they represent, \nwhich includes my district in the San Gabriel Valley, that important \ntransportation projects would no longer be prioritized for CMAQ \nfunding.\n  In 2014, southern California transportation agencies--mind you, they \nrepresent over 20 million people--used CMAQ funding to provide $51 \nmillion in traffic flow improvements, $50 million in transit, and $22 \nmillion in bicycle and pedestrian projects. This amendment would \nclarify that these projects are still prioritized for CMAQ funding.\n  I thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for working with \nus on this amendment. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nconference to further clarify that traffic flow, transit, and bicycle \nand pedestrian projects continue to be eligible for CMAQ set-aside \nprograms as they are now.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \ndon't oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, currently under the CMAQ Program, funds \nmay be used to purchase publicly owned alternative fuel vehicles, \nincluding passenger vehicles, service trucks, street cleaners, and \nothers.\n  This is a good amendment that ensures alternative fuel vehicles are \nstill eligible under this bill. I support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Hunter\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 73, line 24, strike the closed quotation mark and the \n     final period.\n       Page 73, after line 24, insert the following:\n       ``(n) Facilitating Commercial Waterborne Transportation.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, or rights granted \n     thereunder, and provided that the requirements of the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et \n     seq.) are met, a property owner may develop, construct, \n     operate, and maintain pier, wharf, or other such load-out \n     structures on that property and on or above adjacent beds of \n     the navigable waters of the United States to facilitate the \n     commercial waterborne transportation of domestic aggregate \n     that may supply an eligible project under this section, \n     including salt, sand, and gravel, from reserves located \n     within ten miles of the property.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Hunter) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, the roads, bridges, and other \ninfrastructure projects we seek to advance in the legislation before us \ntoday require a steady supply of aggregate and gravel. Without it, we \nmight as well not even be here debating this legislation.\n  In fact, a report from the U.S. Geological Survey--2011 USGS Report: \nAggregate Resource Availability in the United States--found ``a 70 \npercent increase in annual aggregate production may be required to \nupgrade our transportation infrastructure.''\n  The report went on to say, ``There is an indisputable need for an \nuninterrupted, large supply of aggregate for the restoration and \nrehabilitation of the infrastructure.''\n  It is also important to note that a substantial portion of the cost \nof aggregate is its transportation costs, and lowering those costs will \nreduce the cost of construction projects.\n  My State of California is just one example of where the need is \ngreat. According to a recent report, California goes through 200 \nmillion tons of high-grade aggregate every year, which is the \nequivalent of more than 7 million trips by large diesel trucks.\n  So here is what my amendment does:\n  It streamlines access to marine-accessible sand and gravel aggregate \nsupply points throughout the United States, allowing our country to \nmeet the future needs of the national infrastructure projects which are \ncovered in this legislation.\n  With this amendment, we have the opportunity to strengthen our supply \nof raw building materials for infrastructure projects, to reduce road \ncongestion and transportation costs, and to strengthen our maritime \ncommunity.\n  I urge all Members to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Generally, the gentleman from California and I have worked together \non a number of things, and this is one time when I reluctantly rise in \nopposition to his proposal.\n  I have spent a good deal of time on aggregate issues in my own \ndistrict that relate to those which are located in the marine \nenvironment, and I understand some of the frustrations and concerns \nthat go on there. The language in this, though, is so broad that we are \npreempting both the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and the Truman-Hobbs \nAct, which relate to impediments to navigation.\n  At this point, that sort of amendment would, for instance, overturn \nan easement that has been entered into between the joint Naval Base \nKitsap and the owners of this aggregate. There is a concern that, if a \ndock were built in that area, it would interfere with the navigation \nthat is a prime route for our strategic submarine forces in the Pacific \nNorthwest and the Pacific region.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  So we think it has unintended consequences that go far beyond any \nidea of streamlining access to maritime aggregate resources.\n  So I would have to recommend Members oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Harris).\n  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentleman from \nCalifornia's amendments.\n  With this amendment, we need to start the rebirth of our Nation's \nshipping capabilities and begin to build\n\n[[Page H7656]]\n\nU.S.-flagged seagoing vessels to move a domestic supply of sand and \ngravel across our Nation.\n  This amendment allows access to aggregate that will be available to \nrestore damaged beaches, enhance fisheries habitats in the estuaries \nand littoral regions of the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the \nPacific Ocean by providing clean sand and gravel for broad-scale beach \nreplenishment projects that are so vital across the Nation.\n  This amendment will also lead to establishment of a reliable U.S. \nsource to meet domestic demand for major construction and public \nprojects. Half of all uses for sand and gravel are used for public \nprojects, building and replacing vital U.S. highways, bridges, and \nseawall infrastructures.\n  Utilizing our marine transportation will save taxpayer dollars by \nreducing costs on public works projects because, simply put, moving \ncontainerized cargo on the water is cost-competitive, economical, and \nefficient.\n  Passage of this amendment puts our country on the path to having the \npotential to create at least 20,000 more shipbuilding manufacturing \njobs just by building at least 30 to 40 new seagoing bulk freighters \nand container carrier ships worth at least $3 billion that will result \nif we pass this amendment.\n  This amendment is good for the country. It is good for our \ninfrastructure, and it is good for creating American jobs across this \ncountry.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Here is what this amendment does. If you have a quarry that does \ngravel or aggregate by any waterway, whether it is an inland waterway, \nan inlet, a sound, or the ocean, you can then develop your gravel pits \nand put that aggregate on ships--not on trucks, not on rail, but on \nships--that have a much lower emission cost than anything else does. \nYou can put them on ships, which means it is going to help the maritime \ncommunity.\n  We import sand and gravel right now from China. We get our aggregate \nright now from Communist China. Instead of doing that, let's strengthen \nour domestic supply and allow the aggregate producers around the \ncountry the ability to export their aggregate to domestic suppliers, to \nthe national defense community, to our road makers, and to our building \nmakers.\n  This strengthens America. It strengthens our national security. I \nurge all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, this amendment waives all laws for construction of these \ntransportation-related facilities, i.e., piers, wharfs, and load-out \nstructures.\n  Now, the problem is that, if you waive all the laws, someone may want \nto build a pier that interferes with everybody else who navigates that \nnarrow channel, including the United States Navy with their boomer \nsubs. That is not really, I think, a very good way to go forward; and \nthat was recognized by Congress as a problem in 1899, impediments to \ncommercial navigation, in this case, strategic national defense \nnavigation.\n  So I think there may be another way to get at more easily utilizing \nthese resources. But preempting the Rivers and Harbors Act and the \nTruman-Hobbs Act, which means structures could be built which would \nimpede others' navigation, is really incredibly problematic. I really \nthink that this should be considered in a more deliberate way as part \nof future legislation, perhaps the Water Resources Development Act or \nsomething along those lines.\n  Again, I would strongly oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 4 will not \nbe offered.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. DeSaulnier) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n[[Page H7657]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is based on the \nbipartisan Metropolitan Planning Enhancement Act that rebuilds public \ntrust by promoting evidence-based decisionmaking in the transportation \ninvestment process. This commonsense amendment helps States and \nmetropolitan planning organizations offer the highest return for \ntaxpayers and commuters through increased transparency and improved \naccountability.\n  Americans of all types are suspicious of government right now. In the \ncontext of transportation funding, many Americans believe that highway \nand bridge project decisions are based on politics and insider \nconnections rather than statewide and regional transportation goals.\n  In many areas of the country, local commuters have little idea how \nState Departments of Transportation and MPOs make their project \ndecisions or why they choose one project over another; yet, every year, \nlawmakers ask taxpayers to spend more and more of their hard-earned \ndollars on infrastructure projects with minimal transparency and \naccountability.\n  This amendment requires State and regional transportation plans to \ninclude project descriptions and to score projects based on criteria \ndeveloped by the State or the region, not the Federal Government.\n  Requiring that projects be assessed with objective criteria ensures \nthat limited transportation resources are invested in projects that \nprovide the highest return on investment to commuters. Furthermore, \nrequiring transportation decisionmakers to communicate how projects are \nchosen enhances the public's understanding of and confidence in the \nproject selection process.\n  Many States and MPOs are incorporating project priority criteria \ntoday: Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, \nWashington State, Minnesota, Massachusetts, amongst others. There is \nplenty of early evidence that this has increased confidence within the \ncommuting public.\n  Effective and efficient transportation systems are critical to our \ngrowing and prosperous U.S. economy. We cannot allow diminishing \nresources to be directed toward bad investments. This amendment ensures \nthat the public has more complete information to judge the merits of \nprojects for themselves.\n  Mr. Chairman, much of the debate about America's crumbling \ninfrastructure is about how we are going to find the necessary money to \nmatch the need. As responsible legislators, we should ask ourselves how \nwe can most efficiently invest the resources we already have.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, good governance \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, the proposed amendment would impose \nburdensome new requirements on States and metropolitan planning \norganizations, significantly delaying project selection and \nconstruction.\n  States and MPOs already, under current law, are subject to extensive \nplanning requirements and take multiple factors into accountant in \ndeveloping their short- and long-range plans. It is critical that they \nhave the flexibility to weigh tradeoffs in different priorities without \nbeing hamstrung by a strict ranking process.\n  Transparency and the opportunity for participation by stakeholders \nand the public is a hallmark of the planning process. States and MPOs \nare required to have a participation plan to ensure that any interested \nparty can be heard.\n  The National Governors Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, \nand the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials all oppose this amendment, and they are the very people that \ndeal with this.\n  I oppose the amendment, and I would urge all my colleagues to oppose \nit, also.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chair, with all due respect to the chairman, I \nwant to thank him for his consideration.\n  I do believe, having seen this in the San Francisco Bay Area, that \nthe incentive and the requirement to do more will actually help with \nthe transparency, as I have stated earlier.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Cartwright\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I rise as designee of Representative \nGrijalva, and I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike sections 1301 through 1313.\n       Page 168, line 12, strike ``this Act,''.\n       Strike sections 1315 through 1317.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, this bill uses ``streamlining'' the \nregulatory process, which is a euphemism for ``steamrolling'' over \nbedrock environmental laws. In fact, it dedicates 50 pages of this bill \nto paving over the National Environmental Policy Act, also known as \nNEPA, as well as the National Historic Preservation Act, NHPA.\n  I know it is popular in Republican circles to blame environmental \nregulations for all of our Nation's ills, but that doesn't make it \ntrue. In fact, the evidence tells us an entirely different story.\n  The Federal Highway Administration reported several years ago, before \nall of this steamrolling started, that more than 90 percent of NEPA \nreviews for highway projects were accomplished through a categorical \nexclusion process that takes only a few days. For the few--and we are \ntalking about only 4 percent--highway projects which do require an \nenvironmental impact statement, the end result is often savings for the \ntaxpayers and better projects that cause less harm to the environment \nand to our communities.\n  Earlier this year, a plan to improve U.S. Route 23 in Michigan was \nmodified to avoid the largest loss of wetlands in the State's history \nand to preserve that habitat for migratory waterfowl prized by hunters.\n  In New Jersey, in 2012, construction on the Route 53 causeway to \nOcean City was completed after NEPA review helped them minimize private \nproperty takings as well as damage to tidal marshes.\n  In my own home State of Pennsylvania, construction of the \nPennsylvania Turnpike/I-95 Interchange Project is underway after a \nthorough and public NEPA review, which was conducted with the input and \nsupport of local residents and local government officials. This process \nled to the selection of a design with the fewest impacts to homes, \nbusinesses, and the local environment.\n  NEPA does not lead to unnecessary delays; it leads to better \noutcomes. The real culprit in delaying highway projects is a lack of \nfunding. To address that problem, the House majority will need to first \nlook in the mirror. It is their draconian budget slashing that has left \nour transportation infrastructure in the disrepair that is in existence \ntoday.\n  My amendment is simple, Mr. Chair. It would require us to evaluate \nthe impacts of the last two rounds of regulatory steamrolling passed in \nthe\n\n[[Page H7658]]\n\nSAFETEA-LU bill and the MAP-21 bill before we take any further steps to \ngut environmental protection and historic preservation.\n  This approach is perfectly reasonable because, while there is ample \nevidence that regulatory reform was not needed in the first place, \nthere is exactly zero evidence that it has had any positive impact at \nall because no information has been collected on the matter.\n  So the very least we can do, in the interest of responsible \ngovernment, is evaluate the effects of the laws we pass before we \ndeclare the need for more of the same. Shirking our responsibility to \nappropriate highway dollars and instead just scapegoating laws that \nprotect the American people from harm is simply dishonest.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  I do believe the sections of this bill that this amendment strikes \nare seriously flawed, and I do look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the \nadministration, and our friends in the Senate on achieving a more \nreasonable outcome.\n  Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nGrijalva), I withdraw this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Hunter\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 225, strike lines 4 through 20 and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a program to \n     permit the acknowledgment of roadside maintenance with the \n     use of live plant materials.\n       (b) Term.--The Secretary shall carry out the program for a \n     10-year period. Upon the request of a State, the Secretary \n     may continue to carry out the program for that State for an \n     additional 10-year period.\n       (c) Participating States.--The Secretary shall select 10 \n     States to participate in the program.\n       (d) Guidelines for Selection of States.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish guidelines \n     for selecting States to participate in the program.\n       (2) Discretion of states.--The guidelines shall not limit \n     the discretion under subsection (e) of any State \n     participating in the program. Any other guidelines relating \n     to the participation of a State in the program shall be \n     established by that State, subject to subsection (e).\n       (3) Priority.--In selecting States to participate in the \n     program, the Secretary shall give priority to any State that \n     can provide documentation demonstrating that the State, or \n     its agents, prior to November 2015, actively reviewed, or \n     stated an interest in, innovative approaches using live plant \n     materials for acknowledging a substantial contribution to \n     roadside maintenance.\n       (e) Inconsistent Laws, Regulations, or Manuals.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, States \n     participating in the program may permit acknowledgment of \n     roadside maintenance through the use of live plant materials \n     without being limited by any Federal, State, or other law, \n     regulation, or manual that limits or regulates procurement \n     actions, acknowledgment signs, advertising, landscaping, or \n     other uses of, or actions relating to, highway rights-of-way \n     or areas adjacent to highway rights-of-way.\n       (f) Funds Exclusively for Roadside Maintenance.--Any funds \n     paid to a State under the program shall be considered to be \n     State funds (as defined in section 101(a) of title 23, United \n     States Code), and shall be made available for expenditure \n     under the direct control of the State transportation \n     department (as defined in that section) exclusively for \n     roadside maintenance.\n       (g) Report.--Before the expiration of the first 10-year \n     period referred to in subsection (b), the Secretary shall \n     submit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works of the Senate a report on the \n     results of the program.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Hunter) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan amendment is only a \ntechnical change to a pilot program that is already included in the \nunderlying bill. I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for including the base language in the bill.\n  This legislative language in our proposed amendment is a means for \nState Departments of Transportation to increase their revenues without \nadditional burden on the taxpayer. Everybody knows that every State is \nhurting for transportation dollars. This helps them.\n  By acknowledging contributions of third parties to a State DOT's \nroadside maintenance through a corporate logo made of live plant \nmaterials rather than conventional metallic material, State Departments \nof Transportation will have innovative new means for funding highway \nmaintenance needs. This will free up funds for other highway projects.\n  I support this program because Caltrans, my State DOT, and six other \nState DOTs asked for the authority to operate this kind of innovative \nprogram. The pilot program does not cost the State or Federal \nGovernment a penny to operate. Estimates are that my State of \nCalifornia could conservatively save millions of dollars annually in \nroadside maintenance costs from this program. Other States would enjoy \nother similar tangible benefits.\n  The legislative language for the pilot program, as it appears in the \nunderlying bill, does not specifically permit acknowledgment through \nlive plant materials and places no limitations on what guidelines the \nU.S. Department of Transportation would develop for innovative \napproaches under the pilot program.\n  The legislative language in our proposed amendment paves the way for \nState DOTs to implement an acknowledgement program with live plant \nmaterials by specifying this particular approach in the legislative \nlanguage and by providing some specificity on the guidelines that the \nU.S. Department of Transportation should develop and what matters are \nbest left to the States to assure the success of this innovative new \napproach.\n  I urge all Members to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow commercialization within the \nFederal right-of-way, and that causes concern as to the potential for \nproliferation.\n  We have had many debates over the years that I have been on the \ncommittee over advertising proximate to interstates. We have come to a \npretty good stasis on that issue. This amendment is not new. It is not \nwidely supported.\n  We did not hear from California that they were in support. We were in \ntouch with them numerous times. Perhaps they are, but we didn't hear \nthat. The Outdoor Advertising Association of America does not support \nthe amendment.\n  I would urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 3\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo).\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from \nCalifornia for taking the initiative on offering this amendment, which \nsimply modifies the pilot program already created in the manager's \namendment.\n  My endorsement of this amendment stems from the fact that Florida's \nDOT currently has a cosponsorship program, and a multitude of other \nState DOTs have also offered their support. This program permits States \nto partner with private sector organizations, which will fund further \nroadside maintenance. The private sector, not the government, will be \nresponsible for the fabrication, installation, and maintenance of the \nsigns, resulting in zero expense to taxpayers.\n  This amendment enables State DOTs to implement an acknowledgment \nprogram with live plant materials. Furthermore, it provides specifics \non the guidelines USDOT should develop and lets States decide which \nmatters are of significance to them.\n\n[[Page H7659]]\n\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, this is one of those things that I kind of \nthought everybody would enjoy. It is environmentally friendly, it uses \nplants and flowers, and it doesn't cost anybody anything. I mean, this \nis one of those deals that I am surprised is opposed by any Member.\n  At this time, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. \nBrown).\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, my State of Florida could receive \n$35 million in revenue and $8.7 million in maintenance savings annually \nfor the program.\n  At this time, revenue is flat-funded. This is a ``may.'' The States \ndon't have to participate in it. It is a pilot program. It is flowers, \nand it is friendly. I support it, and I would urge my colleagues to \nvote for it.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the bill itself establishes this. The gentleman has \nproposed an up-to-20-year pilot program. That seems pretty permanent in \nterms of most people's life spans.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUNTER. It takes a long time for these flowers to grow.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Reclaiming my time, I guess we are putting in \nperennials, not annuals. Okay.\n  In any case, the bill itself does establish a pilot program that \nwould establish that five States would be allowed not just to do logo \nflowers, but to do other innovative projects that could generate \nrevenues for use in the maintenance of the rights-of-way, and this \nwould be five States. There would be guidelines published by the \nSecretary. They would terminate after 6 years, and then we would see if \nthere was wisdom in expanding it.\n  One problem that is raised is we have gone through, as I said, many \ncontroversies over billboards, particularly when they went to \nbillboards that would change as you were driving.\n  There was heavy regulation of that because of the period of the \nchange so as not to distract drivers and cause potential traffic \naccidents. I can imagine you are driving along and you are really \nwanting to read that logo as you are going by, and this could \ncontribute to distracted driving. So we must oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I am looking at some of the designs that \nhave been already done. One is a Nike swoosh. You don't have to read a \nswoosh. You just know it is a swoosh because we all know what Nike \nswooshes look like.\n  You have the Pepsi logo. You don't have to read that. By going with \nthe gentleman's argument, you couldn't have any billboards up anywhere. \nThere are tons of billboards that you have to read.\n  These are just logos, and the corporations want to pay the State DOT \nto put these logos on the side of the road. This is free money for the \nStates, free money for States' transportation.\n  I would urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Denham\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of Division A, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FEDERAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 14501(c) of title 49, United \n     States Code, is amended ---\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``paragraphs (2) and \n     (3)'' and inserting ``paragraphs (3) and (4)'';\n       (2) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through (5) as \n     paragraphs (3) through (6) respectively;\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:\n       ``(2) Additional limitations.--\n       ``(A) A State, political subdivision of a State, or \n     political authority of 2 or more States may not enact or \n     enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the \n     force and effect of law prohibiting employees whose hours of \n     service are subject to regulation by the Secretary under \n     section 31502 from working to the full extent permitted or at \n     such times as permitted under such section, or imposing any \n     additional obligations on motor carriers if such employees \n     work to the full extent or at such times as permitted under \n     such section, including any related activities regulated \n     under part 395 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       ``(B) A State, political subdivision of a State, or \n     political authority of 2 or more States may not enact or \n     enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the \n     force and effect of law that requires a motor carrier that \n     compensates employees on a piece-rate basis to pay those \n     employees separate or additional compensation, provided that \n     the motor carrier pays the employee a total sum that when \n     divided by the total number of hours worked during the \n     corresponding work period is equal to or greater than the \n     applicable hourly minimum wage of the State, political \n     subdivision of the State, or political authority of 2 or more \n     States.\n       ``(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit \n     the provisions of paragraph (1).''.\n       (4) in paragraph (3) (as redesignated) by striking \n     ``Paragraph (1)--'' and inserting ``Paragraphs (1) and (2)--\n     ''; and\n       (5) in paragraph (4)(A) (as redesignated) by striking \n     ``Paragraph (1)'' and inserting ``Paragraphs (1) and (2)''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall have the force and effect as if enacted on the date of \n     enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration \n     Authorization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-305).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Denham) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, in 1994, Congress enacted the Federal \nAviation Administration Authorization Act, or F4A, to prevent States \nfrom undermining Federal deregulation of interstate commerce through a \npatchwork of State regulations. Since 1994, motor carriers have been \noperating under the Federal meal and rest break standards until a \nruling by the California Ninth Circuit Court. This amendment would \nremedy that issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Unfortunately, the language of this amendment is so broad that it \nwould basically preempt meal, rest break, and other laws that relate to \ntruck drivers in 21 States. So I think this is an issue of states' \nrights.\n  It is an issue of an overly broad attempt to address what is a real \ncontradiction that was created by the ninth circuit, that if you have a \ntruck driver who is operating long haul through a number of States \nhaving to comply with new rest or meal break requirements on the \nFederal clock, which I can barely understand with the new requirements \non rest, every time the driver crosses a State line, it is confusing \nand I think is a potential impediment to interstate commerce.\n  We offered an amendment that would have specifically addressed that \nconcern. Unfortunately, we weren't able to reach agreement on that. Mr. \nLarsen of Washington State submitted that amendment to the Committee on \nRules. It was not allowed. Unfortunately, we only have this overly \nbroad amendment.\n  This would not just affect interstate trucking; it would preempt \nCalifornia's wage, hour, and rest break rules for intrastate trucking \nin the State of\n\n[[Page H7660]]\n\nCalifornia and 20 other States. In fact, the case that was before the \nninth circuit was intrastate truck drivers who were delivering \nappliances.\n  It also would go further. We spent a lot of time when I chaired the \nsubcommittee on the issue of these, basically, pressed labor, who were \ntheoretically purchasing their drayage trucks to haul cargo out of Long \nBeach and out of Los Angeles, who were really basically being enslaved. \nThey were never going to pay them off. They were never going to own \nthem. In fact, they were hot-seated. Other people were also buying the \nsame truck at different hours of the day. Nobody ever got the trucks.\n  This would basically preempt any laws in California so that drivers \ncould be paid on a piece rate no matter what the congestion conditions: \nSorry. Gee, we paid you for that load. So it took you 8 hours. That is \nthe way it is. So you only earned 49 cents an hour. Sorry. Because wage \nand hour laws don't apply to you.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  It is just an overly broad attempt to address what has, at its core, \na contradiction under the FAAA Act, the ruling about interstate \ncommerce. So I would have to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Oregon. He was here \nin 1994 when Speaker Foley pushed this issue through. He understands \nthe issue. While his language did not fully address the issue, we are \ngoing to continue to work together to resolve this as this amendment \nmoves forward.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown).\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chair, let me just say first to Mr. Shuster \nand Mr. DeFazio that I want to thank them for their leadership in \ngetting this bill to the floor. I am just going with the new Speaker, \nwho said, ``the will of the House.'' And I am sure the will of the \nHouse will pass this amendment. Why? Because one thing is that \ntransportation is intermodal.\n  I was here in 1994, when we said we were not going to have a \npatchwork and we were not going to have each State with their own rules \nand regulations. I say let's move forward. In my opinion, we need to \nreinstate the intentions of the Congress in 1994.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would note that 90 percent of the trucking industry is \nrepresented--not necessarily in terms of volume, but in terms of \nvalue--by OOIDA, and they are opposed to this.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. \nNapolitano).\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I thank Mr. DeFazio for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which would \noverturn a Federal court decision that determined California meal and \nrest break laws apply to truckers.\n  On July 9, 2014, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, as was \nmentioned before, ruled that trucking operators in California must \nallow for 30-minute breaks after 5 hours of work and a 10-minute rest \nbreak after each 4 hours. This meal and rest break standard is very \nreasonable when you consider the truck drivers can be subject to 14 \nhours of on-duty time.\n  The amendment would not only preempt California's law with regard to \ntrucking operations, but would preempt laws in 21 other States and \nterritories that guarantee a meal break. I won't go into the States' \nnames. The States must be allowed to set meal and rest break standards \nas they see fit for the health and safety of their workers. One size \ndoes not fit all.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is needed \nto keep interstate commerce moving and to correct a misguided rule \nissued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Here, we are faced with \nan overactive judiciary legislating from the bench with very real and \nvery adverse economic consequences as a result of this misinformed \ndecision.\n  Mr. Chairman, Congress has taken deliberate action in the past to \npreempt States from getting in the way of a nationally uniform set of \nrules for motor carriers. This amendment makes clear the intent of \nCongress that States can't impose their own requirements on drivers \nwhose working hours and breaks are governed under nationally uniform \nFederal regulations.\n  Mr. Chairman, under current Federal safety regulations, drivers who \nneed a break are always entitled to take one. This amendment does not \nchange that. Likewise, current Federal whistleblower laws protect \ndrivers from carriers who stand in the way of that, and this amendment \ndoes not change that.\n  But as a result of the Ninth Circuit Court decision, motor carriers \nwill now be forced to plan their routes and services around the \nobligations of individual State break requirements. This will deprive \nbusinesses and drivers of the flexibility currently afforded under \nFederal law for interstate commerce. It will reduce shipping capacity. \nIt will increase shipping costs, and it causes confusion and cost.\n  If not corrected, who will pay the price for the decision of the \nunelected judges of the ninth circuit? In my district, it will be the \nsmall businesses and consumers who face higher prices, and it will \nprove more costly to transportation professionals whose livelihoods are \ndirectly dependent on an efficient and streamlined shipping and \ntrucking industry.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. May I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon has 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Takano).\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I stand in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  My friends across the aisle regularly reject legislation because it \nencroaches on states' rights, yet their commitment to State sovereignty \ndisappears when it comes to protecting workers.\n  This amendment does more than just clarify the Federal Aviation \nAdministration Authorization Act of 1994. It changes and expands its \napplication to preempt the will of States such as mine.\n  California's meal and rest break laws ensure a safe working \nenvironment for truck drivers traveling within the State, and the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals specifically ruled these laws are not preempted by the \nFederal Aviation Administration Authorization Act.\n  This amendment overrules the court and State legislatures to weaken \nlabor protections at the industry's request.\n  As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and as a \nCalifornian, I stand in strong opposition to this amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Ashford).\n  Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Chairman, I am proud today to stand with \nRepresentative Denham as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  This amendment reinforces--make no mistake--a current law that has \nbeen on the books for over two decades. It promotes interstate \ncommerce, ensures economic growth, and fortifies safety requirements.\n  This amendment will allow a vital industry in my district and a vital \nindustry to our Nation, the trucking industry, to operate without a \npatchwork of State regulations.\n  In my home State of Nebraska, we have several of the Nation's largest \nmotor carriers. These employers haul freight throughout the country and \nprovide good-paying jobs. Unfortunately, these employers may now face \nlitigation that could cost tens of millions of dollars and create \nregulatory uncertainty across this country.\n\n  Far-flung litigation shouldn't threaten the livelihood of hardworking \nNebraskans. It is likely that companies like those in my district will \nsimply refuse to do business in certain States. This result will \ndestroy jobs, hinder competition, and hurt taxpayers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Walker).\n\n[[Page H7661]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, Congress has been clear that the patchwork \nof laws and rules dictating when drivers eat, sleep, and pull over is \nimpractical. Fifty standards create an unreasonable burden on truck \ndrivers and companies.\n  Furthermore, dismantling the Federal standards jeopardizes safety, \nincreases costs, causes significant inefficiencies, reduces \ncompetition, inhibits innovation and technology, and curtails the \nexpansion of markets.\n  I support the Denham amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart).\n  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment.\n  In my district, I have some of the largest trucking companies in the \ncountry. I recognize these are hardworking, dedicated people who play a \nvital role in the success of our economy. The growth of regulations \nunder this administration has made their jobs much, much more \ndifficult.\n  This amendment seeks to relieve truck drivers of a patchwork of \nregulations that make their jobs very difficult, with little positive \neffect.\n  Let me correct a common misunderstanding. This amendment does not \nprevent drivers from taking breaks when they think it is appropriate. \nIn fact, it does the exact opposite. It allows the drivers to be \nflexible to take breaks when they think it is most appropriate and most \nsafe and not to worry if they are violating the law.\n  Arbitrarily predetermined break times set by 50 different States \nsimply will not work, and that is why I am such a strong supporter of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Denham).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Aguilar\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROGRAM TO ASSIST VETERANS TO ACQUIRE COMMERCIAL \n                   DRIVER'S LICENSES.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of \n     Defense, shall fully implement the recommendations contained \n     in the report submitted under section 32308 of MAP-21 (49 \n     U.S.C. 31301 note).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Aguilar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chairman, I think we can all agree that our veterans \ndeserve the very best we can offer when they return home. While we can \nnever repay them for their heroism and bravery, we can reaffirm our \nappreciation by doing everything in our power to help them transition \nback to civilian life. My amendment would help us do just that.\n  This amendment requires the Department of Transportation and the \nDepartment of Defense to work together to help veterans transition into \ncivilian jobs driving commercial trucks. It would help them obtain \ncommercial driver's licenses, as outlined in a report commissioned by \nthe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration 2 years ago. This \nreport was done at the direction of the last surface transportation \nbill, MAP-21, and my amendment requires DOT and DOD to work together to \nimplement the report's recommendations.\n  Along with improving access to quality health care, one of the most \nimportant ways we need to help veterans is connecting them with job \nopportunities. Encouraging local businesses to hire more veterans is \none step, but helping our veterans translate those skills they used in \nthe military is a crucial part of putting our veterans back to work.\n  Many veterans who drove specialized vehicles in the military struggle \nto put these skills to work when they return home because of \nunnecessary and burdensome regulations. My amendment makes it easier \nfor veterans to put their skills to work by requiring the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration's report recommendations be put into \neffect.\n  Please allow me to explain.\n  My amendment writes into law the recommendations that States can \nwaive driving skills tests if a veteran certifies that he or she was \nemployed in the military in a position operating a commercial motor \nvehicle, or CMV, during the last year. This was included in the \nunderlying bill, for which I applaud the majority and minority for \ntheir efforts; however, my amendment goes a bit further.\n  Among other things, my amendment helps create an abbreviated \ncommercial driver's license skills test for States to give military \ndrivers who do not have the experience operating vehicles with air \nbrakes or manual transmissions.\n  This amendment also, based on the recommendations of the report, \ndirects the military services to work with the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration and the American Association of Motor Vehicle \nAdministrators to clarify options available to servicemembers and \nveterans to obtain existing information on military licenses, military \nCMV driver history, and military CMV experience.\n  Mr. Chairman, we need to do better by our men and women in uniform \nwho have risked and sacrificed so much to keep us safe and free. As we \nfocus on growing our economy, we need to keep our veterans in mind as \nwe seek to expand job opportunities. This amendment will help us do \njust that.\n  The study commissioned by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration was 2 years ago. It is time to put that into action and \nto get our veterans back to work. This is about getting our veterans \nwhat they have earned and deserve, and I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see this through.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \ndo not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I appreciate the gentleman from California bringing this \namendment forward.\n  The STRR Act requires the Secretary to issue regulations by the end \nof this year to implement recommendations of a report to Congress on \nassisting veterans in acquiring a commercial driver's license. However, \nthe bill does not address the nonregulatory recommendations. This \namendment does that. It requires the Secretary to implement those \nrecommendations within a year.\n  This is a good amendment that will assist our veterans in making the \ntransition to civilian life. I urge all Members to support the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. AGUILAR. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 10 Offered by Ms. Hahn\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. STUDY ON BURYING POWER LINES.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary shall conduct a study and report the \n     findings of such study to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress regarding the feasibility, costs, and\n\n[[Page H7662]]\n\n     economic impact of burying power lines underground. Such \n     study shall include the potential costs and benefits of \n     burying power lines underground when building new roads.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Hahn) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer the Hahn-Cicilline amendment \nto the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2015. \nOur committee has been putting in many months, some would say even \nyears, in writing this bill. So it is actually a great day to see this \nbill finally come on the floor.\n  In addition, I would like to thank Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member \nDeFazio, and the entire Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for \nour hard work in crafting this legislation.\n  If I might just take a moment at this point to give a farewell and a \nrest in peace to Howard Coble, who was a good member of our \nTransportation Committee, who served in the Coast Guard. In fact, we \nnamed our Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act the Howard Coble \nCoast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014. We will miss him. \nHe was a good member of our committee.\n  Our amendment today looks to make our Nation's roadways safer and, \nalso, more scenic by directing the Secretary of Transportation to study \nthe benefits and costs of undergrounding power lines.\n  Forty percent of all power outages are due to fallen trees or weather \nevents, and an additional 8 percent are caused by traffic accidents.\n  By placing power lines underground, roadways are safer from downed \nlines during storms, service to customers is more reliable, and our \nroadways will simply be more beautiful to drive on.\n  Every year over 1,000 fatalities occur as a result of collisions with \nutility poles. In fact, according to the Insurance Institute for \nHighway Safety, about 20 percent of all highway deaths are due to power \nline poles and traffic barriers.\n  This is a preventable tragedy, and this amendment asks the Secretary \nto evaluate if this is feasible and to share with Congress its \nfindings.\n  We should take this highway authorization as an opportunity to make \nour highways safer and more scenic.\n  My home State of California has been a leader in undergrounding power \nlines. In 1967, California began encouraging and directing utility \nproviders to allocate a portion of their budgets to replace overhead \ncables with underground cables. This has been a good start, but I think \nwe could do more in this country.\n  It was President Johnson, urged on by Lady Bird, who signed the \nHighway Beautification Act in 1965 to limit unsightly roadside mess.\n  Upon the bill's passage, President Johnson said, ``Beauty belongs to \nall the people. And so long as I am President, what has been divinely \ngiven to nature will not be taken recklessly away by man.''\n  By conducting a nationwide study through the DOT, we can begin to see \nwhere these conversions make sense across this country.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I, as always, appreciate the gentlewoman from California \nand her hard work. She is a valued member of the committee.\n  I don't believe this amendment has to do with transportation policy. \nI think it is a good thing when you bury power lines for a lot of \nreasons--appearance, weather, all those things--but I really don't \nbelieve this is a Federal issue, nor do I believe the U.S. Department \nof Transportation is the appropriate agency to determine the costs and \nbenefits of burying power lines.\n  I really believe that should be up to the companies and their cost-\nbenefit analysis to determine that and not to underwrite or subsidize \ntheir operation by doing this.\n  So, again, with great respect to the gentlewoman from California, I \noppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) to speak in support of this \nimportant amendment.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and \nfor her extraordinary leadership on this effort.\n  I rise in strong support of this amendment. This amendment would \nrequire the Secretary to conduct a study of the feasibility, costs, and \neconomic impact of burying power lines underground.\n  According to Federal data, the U.S. electric grid loses power 285 \npercent more often than it did in 1984, when data collection efforts on \nblackouts began.\n  According to the Department of Energy, that costs American businesses \nas much as $150 billion per year, with weather-related disruptions \ncosting the most per event.\n  Underground power lines make up just 18 percent of U.S. transmission \nlines, yet nearly all new residential and commercial developments opt \nfor underground electric service.\n  During Hurricane Irene in 2011, more than 6.5 million people in the \nUnited States lost power, including more than 30 percent of the \nresidents living in my home State of Rhode Island, as well as \nConnecticut and Maryland.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this simple, straightforward \namendment so that we can begin to create a more reliable and resilient \nelectric grid.\n  I want to acknowledge the work being advanced by Scenic America to \nhelp restore and modernize the Highway Beautification Act that \nCongresswoman Hahn just made reference to.\n  A group of us, including this extraordinary gentlewoman from \nCalifornia, have been in a working group trying to work on legislation \nto really restore and modernize the Highway Beautification Act, and \nScenic America has really taken the lead in this work.\n  I think the words of Lady Bird Johnson that the gentlewoman just \nrecited are incredibly important. This is an important first step to \njust get information to understand the economic impact of burying power \nlines, what a difference it will make not only in terms of the scenic \nbeauty of our highways, but also to businesses, and to prevent the \neconomic loss that happens both to individuals and businesses.\n  It is an excellent amendment. I thank the gentlewoman for her great \nleadership. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. HAHN. I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline). \nThis was our joint amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, as you said, Scenic America is working on different ways \nin this country to beautify our landscape. I believe that this \ntransportation bill was the appropriate place to do this, as this is \nabout highways and our roads in this country.\n  But, having the disapproval and opposition of my chairman--it wasn't \nthat strong, but it was a disapproval--I will agree to withdraw this \namendment, and we will work with Scenic America to find another way to \nbring the undergrounding of our utilities forward.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island, although I \noppose his amendment.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I would just ask the gentleman if he would commit to \nworking with Congresswoman Hahn and I and a group of others that are \nreally interested in restoring and modernizing the Highway \nBeautification Act so that we might work collaboratively on restoring \nsome of those important provisions.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I appreciate the gentleman pushing this issue. Again, as \nI said, burying power lines I think is a positive thing. It does add to \nthe beauty of the landscape. But I just don't believe that it is the \nFederal Government's role to underwrite, the taxpayers to underwrite, \nthese utility companies.\n  So, again, I appreciate the withdrawal. I appreciate your pushing \nthis issue. I continue to oppose the amendment.\n\n[[Page H7663]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Chair, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Heck of Washington\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of division A, add the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC. 1431. STORMWATER REDUCTION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       Chapter 3 of title 23, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 330. Stormwater reduction assistance program\n\n       ``(a) Definitions.--In this section, the term `green \n     stormwater infrastructure' refers to stormwater management \n     techniques that address the quality or quantity of stormwater \n     related to highway construction or due to highway runoff.\n       ``(b) Federal Highway Runoff Management Program.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this section, the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the heads of other relevant Federal \n     agencies, shall develop and publish best practices and \n     guidance for the installation, use and maintenance of green \n     stormwater infrastructure, including the adoption of \n     permeable, pervious, or porous paving materials or other \n     practices and systems that are designed to minimize \n     environmental impacts of stormwater runoff and flooding.\n       ``(2) Contents.--The guidance shall include best practices, \n     guidelines, and technical assistance for the installation and \n     use of green stormwater technologies, including--\n       ``(A) identification of existing and emerging green \n     stormwater infrastructure technologies;\n       ``(B) cost-benefit information relating to green stormwater \n     infrastructure approaches;\n       ``(C) performance analyses of green stormwater \n     infrastructure technologies in typical use scenarios; and\n       ``(D) guidance and best practices on the design, \n     implementation, use, and maintenance of green stormwater \n     infrastructure features.\n       ``(3) Updates.--Not later than 5 years after the date of \n     publication of the guidance under this paragraph, and not \n     less frequently than once every 5 years thereafter, the \n     Secretary, in consultation with the heads of other relevant \n     Federal agencies, shall update the guidance, as \n     applicable.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Heck) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, small towns and cities alike \nhave reasons to manage their storm water runoff. Our streams, rivers, \nlakes, and estuaries are all at risk of dangerous pollution following a \ndownpour.\n  Trust me, those of us from western Washington know this full well, \nand places like Puyallup, Washington, are actually finding ways to \nadjust their neighborhoods to protect surrounding waterways from \npollution.\n  Since 2009, Puyallup has helped residents install rain gardens to \nabsorb the rainfall. These rain gardens are linked by pipes that \ncollect the excess water from the roofs and direct it to the gardens \nrather than to the streets and then into the sewer.\n  This is just one innovation of several great ideas that are innovated \nthroughout this country in places like Puyallup.\n  My amendment today builds on the success on the ground by simply \nasking the Department of Transportation to develop best practices for \nstorm water management, to collect the information, and a guide on how \nto implement, install, and maintain green storm water infrastructure, \nand help any State that requests help with the development of such a \nplan--a voluntary program, not a requirement, no new money.\n  Many of these innovative infrastructure practices--permeable \npavement, natural drainage swales, green roofs--are economical and \nincrease property values and invest in the people that make their \ncareers designing and building these inventions.\n  These new tools are both flexible and yield a strong return on \ninvestment. The people of Puyallup, Washington, get that.\n  They know and I know and you know that we can't let water carry oil \nfrom our cars, pesticide from our lawns, and other pollutants into \nClarks Creek or the Puyallup River or the Puget Sound.\n  We can't do that and keep a strong economy or a desirable location \nfor business and living. We can't let runoff kill, as an example, our \ncherished Coho salmon.\n  So I ask you to support the promise of these innovative economical \nideas to manage our storm water and to get DOT involved.\n  This is the best of federalism. No new money, no mandatory program, \njust a way to get the information out, which the Federal U.S. DOT is in \nthe perfect position to collect and make available.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from the Sixth Congressional \nDistrict of Washington (Mr. Kilmer).\n  Mr. KILMER. I thank the gentleman from Washington's Tenth District.\n  In my neck of the woods, we take pride in the Puget Sound and we \nunderstand that it is in danger. That is why I join my colleague today \nto talk about the treasures the Sound holds: the water, the salmon, the \noysters, the orcas, an entire ecosystem that is currently under attack. \nThis is a threat that happens every time a thunderstorm or a rain \nstrikes cities like Tacoma.\n  When heavy rains hit, that water will wash toxic mixtures of oil and \nheavy metals off of our city streets and highways and into waterways \nlike Puget Sound.\n  The Seattle Times recently wrote about a new study that found some \nrunoff was so toxic that it killed Coho salmon in 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  It is something we don't often think about, but this storm water mix \ncreates a pollution that lingers. Folks in the region I represent are \ndoing groundbreaking work putting in green storm water infrastructure \nto capture this runoff before it hits our waters.\n  These are projects like rain gardens, green roofs, and natural \ndrainage swales. Instead of letting storm water slide along and collect \nmore dirt and grime and end up in our bodies of water, it captures it.\n  Our amendment would encourage the growth of these projects. It would \ngive our local governments and places like Tacoma and Puyallup and \nelsewhere a clear playbook on the most effective ways to implement \ngreen storm water infrastructure.\n  It demonstrates that the Federal Government and local stakeholders \ncan be partners in cleaning up our waters. This matters. It matters to \nTacoma and other cities. It matters to bodies of water like the Puget \nSound.\n  Storm water runoff may be hard to spot, but it is taking a toll on \nPuget Sound and other bodies of water. That is why this amendment is \nimportant. That is why I encourage my colleagues to vote for this \namendment.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Fortenberry). The gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I certainly understand what the gentleman \nfrom Washington is trying to accomplish here.\n  The reason I oppose it is not because of what he is attempting to do, \nbut the Federal Highway Administration currently has strongly supported \nand encouraged the use and implementation of green infrastructure in \nthe Federal aid transportation projects to mitigate highway runoff \nimpacts.\n  FHWA recently published a new storm water runoff model, and it is \nengaged in various storm water research, including storm water \nperformance measures.\n  The Department of Transportation also is part of a Federal agency \ngreen infrastructure collaborative. This initiative includes working \nwith States to implement integrated ecosystems, including landscape-\nscale mitigation. So I don't believe we need to legislate further on \nthis.\n  I also would make note that just last night, we agreed to the \namendment of Ms. Edwards of Maryland on storm water mitigation to put \nthe States in the metropolitan planning process.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Again, I understand what the gentleman is trying to accomplish. I \nthink it is already in the legislation. I think it is already in \ncurrent law, so I would oppose the amendment\n\n[[Page H7664]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much \ntime I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. With all due respect to the chair of the \ncommittee, that isn't included in the current legislation and is \nclearly not the intent of the amendment. The intent of the amendment is \nto ask them to accumulate best practices. Yes, they have programs where \nthey promote and they advocate. This is to ask them to go out and find \nthese programs like we talked about in Puyallup which are unusual and \ninnovative and which aren't yet in the manual so that they can share. \nThis is information sharing on a scale that they don't currently do.\n  In fact, Mr. Chairman, it would help with a serious problem; but \ngiven the Chair's opposition to this, I will only ask that he consider \ntaking a deeper dive into what we are trying to accomplish here because \nit solves a problem.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I will continue to work with the \ngentleman. The gentleman is correct. It is not in current law, but the \nFederal Highway Administration is working on these things \ncollaboratively with the States, and I think that we ought to let them \ncontinue at that pace.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chair, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. King of Iowa\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. PREVAILING RATE OF WAGE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act, including the \n     amendments made by this Act, may be used to implement, \n     administer, or enforce the prevailing rate of wage \n     requirements in subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, \n     United States Code (commonly referred to as the Davis-Bacon \n     Act).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Iowa (Mr. King) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that I have \noffered in the past, and it will be known as the amendment that \neliminates the effect of the Davis-Bacon Act. The substance of it is \nthis:\n  None of the funds made available by this act may be used to \nimplement, administer, or enforce the prevailing rate of wage, which is \nthe effect of this amendment, and it is effectively the Davis-Bacon \nAct. It seems to get the attention of some of my colleagues.\n  I would say, Mr. Chairman, that I have worked with this issue as long \nas anyone in the United States Congress. I have worked back for years, \nas I began about 5 years in the construction site as an employee. \nMultiple times I received Davis-Bacon wage scales; sometimes I did not.\n  As I became a contractor in 1975, we began hiring employees. \nSometimes we paid Davis-Bacon wage scales, and sometimes we did not; \nbut I was always aggravated by the Federal Government's deciding that \nthey knew what we had to pay our help and what they were worth.\n  I recall many debates on the floor of the House of Representatives \nwhen people from the other side of the aisle would say that anytime \nthere is a relationship between two or more people that are consenting \nadults, the Federal Government has no business sticking themselves in \nthe middle of that relationship. Yet the Davis-Bacon Act tells me what \nmy son, who is now sitting in the gallery, has to pay me if I am going \nto climb in the seat of one of his machines, say an excavator, a \nscraper, a bulldozer, or a motor grader.\n  So we are 40 years in the construction business. I have watched the \ninefficiencies that are created by the Davis-Bacon Act. You might need \nsomebody on a shovel, and he decides it pays more to get on a motor \ngrade; or you might need somebody on a scraper, and he decides it pays \nmore to get on a bulldozer. This wrecks the efficiency as well as puts \nan extra high price on the cost of the products that are being produced \nunder the contracting business in the United States.\n  So I would say this, Mr. Chairman, that over our years in the \nconstruction business, the extra costs for Davis-Bacon ranges somewhere \nbetween 8 and 38 percent additional, depending on the type of project \nand the location where you are. The average is someplace between 20 and \n22 percent.\n  So to boil this all down, if we want to be responsible to the \ntaxpayer, then we want to get the best dollar out of that.\n  Somebody is going to say that it is second-rate work. That would be a \ndirect insult to me. It would be a direct insult to my son, who owns \nKing Construction today and who is listening to this debate. Our \nquality work stands with anyone's, and it is superior to many; and \nsometimes it is Davis-Bacon wage scale, and sometimes it is not. But we \nknow what they are worth. The government doesn't know what they are \nworth. We want to hire the best help, keep the best help, and keep the \nbest help on. That is just here in this microcosm of King Construction, \nbut it is extrapolated across the Nation.\n  So do we want to build 4 miles of road under government-mandated \nwages or do we want to build 5? I want to build the 5 miles. I want to \nbuild five bridges, not four. I want the best dollar for the taxpayers, \nand I want the highest efficiency that we can get. That is the \nsubstance of this amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, there was a time in America in 1931 when people were \ndesperate, and unscrupulous contractors would move people from place to \nplace, put them in work camps, and undercut the wages in communities. \nThe wisdom of the Congress back then was this is not proper. \nCommunities have different wage rates.\n  This is not a diktat from Washington, D.C., about the wages. It says \nyou will pay the wages that prevail in your community. For instance, in \nthe gentleman's community, the median wage is $49,427. But under Davis-\nBacon, an electrician--a pretty darned skilled person in my opinion--\nwould only get $36,500 if they get the minimum Davis-Bacon wage. So I \ndon't see that that is outrageous.\n  What we are trying to prevent here is the abuse of construction \nworkers and people, moving them from place to place, bringing them from \na very low-cost State and saying: Hey, when you go home, you are going \nto be doing good. We will put you in a little work camp and a tent. You \ncome here to this State; you undercut all the local workers; you do the \njob; and you go home. We don't want to go back to those days. Those \nwere not halcyon days in America.\n  So this is really a way to provide people with a living wage, \ncertainly not an extravagant wage. I don't think $36,500 for an \nelectrician in Iowa is an extravagant wage, and I don't see why we \nshould pull that floor out from underneath them and say: Oh, hey, well, \nthat is a little too high. We want to be able to pay our electricians \nless than that.\n  This is about trying to create a race to the bottom like we have in \ntoo many other things in this country, our trade agreements and a whole \nhost of other things that are going on that are creating income \ninequality. This will exacerbate income inequality. This amendment \nshould be defeated.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nScott), the ranking member of the Education and Workforce Committee.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the King amendment.\n  This amendment would prohibit the application and payment of \nprevailing wages provided under the Davis-Bacon Act for funds expended \non construction projects in this bill.\n\n[[Page H7665]]\n\n  Davis-Bacon sets wage and benefit standards for federally assisted \nconstruction projects to ensure that contractors compete on the quality \nof their work, not by undercutting wage levels in local communities. \nNegating the application of wage laws, as the King amendment proposes \nto do, often leads to shoddy construction and substantial cost \noverruns.\n  This is not said to insult the sponsor of the amendment. The fact is \nthat the census construction data shows that the value added per worker \nin States with prevailing wage laws is 13 to 15 percent higher than in \nStates without prevailing wage laws.\n  Additionally, studies conducted by the University of Utah have found \nthat repealing the prevailing wage has led to the reduction or \nelimination of apprenticeship programs. Mr. Chairman, this is National \nApprenticeship Week. We should be promoting the participation in \napprenticeship programs, not taking up measures that would negatively \nimpact this critical job training tool.\n  Under prevailing wage laws, contractors are forced to compete on the \nbasis of who can best train, equip, and manage construction crews, not \non the basis of who can assemble the cheapest, most exploitable \nworkforce either locally or by importing labor from somewhere else.\n\n  Historically, Mr. Chairman, there has been bipartisan opposition to \nrepealing or suspending the Davis-Bacon Act in infrastructure programs. \nLet's continue that bipartisan tradition on prevailing wages by voting \n``no'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Iowa has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thought I had actually made the statement, I thought \nmy good friend from Virginia would pick this up, that it isn't about \nshoddy construction work that can be laid at the feet of merit shop \noperations. I am standing here on my feet in my boots having done all \nkinds of work for lots of years, and so has my family, going back about \nfive generations. Our work has been competing with and superior to that \nof many, and there is nothing in the record of our company that anyone \ncould point to other than quality and efficiency.\n  In fact, the reason that he needs an apprentice program is because \nyou can't afford to hire somebody and train them unless the government \nis willing to let you pay them less than the prevailing wage. That is \nwhat the apprentice program is. I have been one, and I have been \nbounced out of there because of the Davis-Bacon Act.\n  Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, when I listen to the gentleman about how \nwe are going to prevent people from moving people in from a low-wage \narea to a high-wage area to take a higher wage or perhaps undercut the \nexisting wage that is there, that is what started the Davis-Bacon Act. \nIt wasn't to keep the low wages out. It was to keep African Americans \nout of New York City during the Depression when there was a large \nFederal building contract, and a contractor successfully bid that job. \nHe was from out of town and he brought his crews in from Alabama, \nAfrican Americans from Alabama, to do the work cheaper than the union \nscale would do in New York. That is what brought about this Davis-Bacon \nAct.\n  When the Federal Government decides they are going to tell people \nwhat they have to pay their employees, they are the last people that \nactually know what that is worth. When you have to compete in this real \nworld where equipment is expensive and time is priceless and we have \nstrict specifications, strong engineers, bonds--bid bonds and \nperformance bonds--and insurance contracts, we have to be efficient, \nand we have to be professional. We have to be able to not only do this \nas well as anyone, but more efficiently than anyone. That is what the \nmerit shop does.\n  Mr. Chairman, nobody is dragging their feet in our operation. They \nwant the company to be successful. When I send people out on a Davis-\nBacon job, they are out there sometimes rolling clods because they know \nthat it pays them to roll clods rather than get the job done. That is \nour expression, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire if I have 1 minute \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is actually a pretty simple question, and I know \nmy friend from Iowa tends to see this question through the lens of his \nown personal experience and his own company, but, frankly, this is a \nbigger question than that.\n  I think it is right that the Federal Government has a stake in how it \nspends its money and that the Federal Government ought to be able to \nsay that when we fund construction projects, we don't want contractors \nto simply pick the cheapest labor they can. Sure, we may want to build \nmore roads, but we want to make sure those roads last. It is not just a \nmatter of how many miles you build, but whether or not they are going \nto be done in a way that makes sure that the quality of the work \nmatches the investment that this country is making.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentleman's point. I can just tell \nyou about my own experience having done development and construction in \none of the toughest markets in America, big construction and small \njobs. I always knew when we paid a prevailing wage that the work was \ngoing to be done on time and it was going to be done with quality.\n  When it comes to the Federal dollar, doesn't it seem to me and all of \nus here that cheap is not always better, and that we owe it to the \nAmerican people to deliver to them a product that is consistent with \nthe quality that they would like to see in their own home? When you go \nto buy material or when you go to hire a contractor yourself for your \nown home, you don't say to yourself, ``Who is the lowest cost provider \nI can get?'' You want to make sure the job is done right.\n  Secondly, the American people need a raise. We don't need the Federal \nGovernment to participate in this race to the bottom in undercutting \nlocal economies by paying people less than they are worth. We have lost \nenough in this country. It is time to end this.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  For over 75 years, the Davis-Bacon Act has been protecting middle \nclass families and taxpayers.\n  As a son of a union worker in Snohomish County, Washington, I know \nhow important prevailing wages can be for middle class families.\n  A prevailing wage is not necessarily a union wage--it's set by the \nDepartment of Labor after surveying local labor.\n  But it's a living wage, one that has helped build middle class \neconomies in my district in places like Everett and Lynnwood.\n  Davis-Bacon standards also ensure that taxpayers are getting their \nmoney's worth when it comes to construction projects.\n  By paying a decent wage, Davis-Bacon projects are built by more \nexperienced and more productive construction workers.\n  The result is better built, longer lasting projects that save money \nover their lifetime which is especially important because poor and \ncrumbling infrastructure hurts everyone.\n  We shouldn't cut corners when it comes to our transportation \ninfrastructure, and we shouldn't cut corners when it comes to hiring \nconstruction workers.\n  The amendment before us would do just that.\n  Workers deserve to be paid fair wages.\n  I ask my colleagues to support middle class families by voting \nagainst this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be \npostponed.\n\n[[Page H7666]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n\n          Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Larsen of Washington\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I ask \nunanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the modification.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I have heard from many \nmidsize cities in my district that they often struggle to compete with \nlarger cities for Federal transportation funding.\n  While the needs of midsize cities are just as significant as those of \nlarger cities, the administrative burden of accessing TIGER grants or \nTIFIA loans is often too great. My amendment addresses that difficulty \nby improving access to TIFIA loans.\n  While TIFIA is a great funding source for bigger projects, sponsors \nof smaller projects can be discouraged from using it because the \napplication process is complicated and requires more resources than \nthese cities can muster.\n  My amendment would require the Secretary to provide an expedited \nprocess for TIFIA applications that are less than $100 million and \nbacked by real revenue. These are smaller, lower risk projects that \naren't happening because States and localities might be scared off by \nthe long and involved TIFIA loan application process.\n  By creating an expedited process for these smaller, lower risk \nprojects, we can open access to Federal resources for smaller cities \nand counties that we represent.\n  This is a streamlined amendment that puts more power in the hands of \nState and local governments, something I know that my colleagues can \nsupport.\n  I appreciate that Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio have \nmade other improvements to the TIFIA process in the underlying bill, \nand my amendment complements these improvements in a straightforward \nway. I would appreciate the support of the leadership on the committee \nfor this amendment.\n  I ask support of my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, even \nthough I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's commonsense \namendment. As usual, he brings common sense to the table.\n  This amendment does and will accelerate the approval of TIFIA credit \nassistance for certain projects.\n  I encourage all Members to support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I ask support for this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen), as modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mr. Culberson\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 249, after line 14, insert the following:\n       (2) in subsection (c)(1)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (B)(ii) by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in subparagraph (B)(iii) by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; and'' ; and\n       (D) by adding at the end of subparagraph (B) the following:\n       ``(iv) the applicant shall have a current operating ratio, \n     as such ratio is set forth by the Federal Transit \n     Administration using the ratio of current assets to current \n     liabilities, of 1:1.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Culberson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, one of our principal responsibilities \nhere is to be good stewards of our constituents' hard-earned tax \ndollars. It is a responsibility that I know each one of us takes very \nseriously.\n  My amendment today will ensure that we apply the same commonsense \nstandards to the investment of our constituents' hard-earned tax \ndollars that we do in the investment of our own dollars.\n  You in your own life would not loan money or invest money in a \nbusiness that was so poorly managed that it took on more debt than they \ncould manage. You wouldn't put your money in a company that had taken \non so much debt that their debt exceeded their liabilities. And, \ncertainly, if you were applying for a bank loan, a bank would not loan \nyour business money if your business had more debt than it had assets.\n  That is all this amendment says is that the Federal Government will \nnot\n\n[[Page H7667]]\n\ninvest our constituents' hard-earned tax dollars in a transit agency \nthat has more debt than they do liabilities.\n  My amendment ensures that the minimum asset-to-debt ratio that a \ntransit entity can have is 1:1. It is common sense. This is sort of a \nworking guideline that I know the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee, on which I work, and the Federal Transit Administration \nhas for years wanted to be sure that the agencies out there--transit \nentities across America--have no more debt than they do assets.\n  So the amendment says the Federal Government will not issue a Federal \ntransit grant to an agency that has a ratio of current assets to debt \nthat exceeds 1:1, very straightforward, very simple.\n  Let's protect our constituents' hard-earned tax dollars in the same \nway we would protect our own. In fact, it is actually a much higher \nobligation that we have to be good stewards of the Treasury, as \nresponsible representatives.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This is an unusual amendment, to say the least. There is no measure \nof assets done regularly for our transit systems in America. In fact, \nthe only measurement that is done is that we have an $84 billion--B, \nbillion--backlog to bring our existing transit systems up to a state of \ngood repair. That means, basically, I am sure everybody would fail this \ntest.\n  So if you want to do away with transit in America and get them out of \nthe trust fund--something that Ronald Reagan made a high priority, and \nhe put transit into the trust fund. He was the first Republican to \nsupport that, and they have been in ever since.\n  He said: We cannot ignore our urban centers. They are the engines of \neconomic growth in this country, and we can't ignore them. We need to \nbe able to move people efficiently in those urban areas.\n  So, since then, we have had a modest proportion of the trust fund--\nabout 20 percent, generally--going into transit.\n  That is not adequate, as it is not adequate for bridges; 140,000 need \nreplacement or repair. It is not adequate for highways; 40 percent of \nthe system is failing and it needs total rebuilding.\n  But an $84 billion backlog in transit--they are killing people right \nhere in the Nation's Capital because of the state of disrepair. It is \nan embarrassment.\n  There is no transit district in the United States of America who \nmakes money. So what is this about? I don't get it. We are not lending \nmoney for them to make a profit and pay off loans. They all receive \nFederal support, and they need more Federal support.\n  In fact, in my travels, I have only been one place where they claim \nthe transit district made money, which is Hong Kong. I urge you to go \nride there at rush hour and see if you enjoy that experience. It is not \nvery good here either.\n  But, in any case, no one else claims to make money. And I don't know \nif they really do. That is a Communist-dominated state. So it is \nprobably not true.\n  I don't understand the amendment, to tell the truth. I would urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, my colleague from Oregon is confusing \nthe issue here. The amendment is very straightforward.\n  Let me read from the amendment itself. The applicant transit agency \nhas to have a current operating ratio of current assets to current \nliabilities of 1:1. They have to have the same current level of debt as \nthey do assets in order to be eligible to apply for a Federal transit \ngrant.\n  This isn't about making money. This is about making sure the \ntaxpayers are not going to give another brick to a transit agency that \nhas already got too much debt and is overloaded and is in a position \nwhere they may not be able to take full advantage of the grant. \nTaxpayers, our constituents, should not have to put their hard-earned \ntax dollars into a transit agency that is carrying more debt than they \nhave assets. This is very straightforward.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Texas for \nhim to name a transit agency that has gone bankrupt recently.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. In fact, I just spoke to the chairman of the Houston \nMetropolitan Transit Authority yesterday, and he tells me that their \nasset-to-debt ratio--they have got assets.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Reclaiming my time, I don't know what and who is running \nthat thing.\n  Mr. CULBERSON: They are going to go bankrupt.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Sir, it is my time. They have not gone bankrupt. They \nare still operating.\n  The Federal Government has not had, that I am aware of, any major \nTIFIA loans or anything go into default.\n  This is a bizarre amendment in search of a problem that doesn't \nexist. We have no transit agencies that are making money. I don't \nanticipate we ever will have a transit agency that makes money. No one \nin the world operates transit agencies that make money.\n  It is a public service to mitigate congestion and provide for our \nmajor urban areas to move people more efficiently with a partnership \nbetween the Federal Government and local authorities.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, this is not about making money. The \nHouston Metropolitan Transit Authority chairman yesterday told me that \ntheir asset-to-debt ratio is about 2:3:1. So they have got 2 to 3 times \nmore assets than they do debt.\n  That is what this amendment says, that we will, as good stewards of \nour taxpayers' hard-earned dollars, only send Federal transportation \ngrants to transit agencies like Houston Metro that have done a good job \nmanaging their responsibilities and their assets are at least on par \nwith their debt. That is all it says.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, my colleague from Oregon is confusing \nthe issue. This isn't about making money. This isn't about repaying the \nmoney.\n  This is about making sure that our constituents' hard-earned tax \ndollars are going to be wisely and carefully and prudently sent only to \nthose transit agencies that have proven they can do a good job, that \nthey don't have more debt currently than they have current assets.\n  My amendment, quoting from the amendment, is very simple:\n\n       Applicant shall have a current operating ratio of current \n     assets to current liabilities of 1:1.\n\n  That is at a minimum. Houston Metro would qualify for this. There are \ntransit agencies all over America that would qualify for this.\n  Let's make sure that the transit entity, before they ask for our \nconstituents' hard-earned tax dollars, have demonstrated that they are \ncompetent and capable of managing the money that they already have on \nhand and they don't have more debt than they can carry.\n  I urge passage of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Actually, the amendment is to take money from New York City, \nWashington, D.C., probably Baltimore, Boston--I don't know--anyone who \nhas a legacy transportation system that actually, until Ronald Reagan \nwas President, pretty much was built without Federal dollars and run \nwithout Federal support and they have huge backlogs in terms of \nbringing them up to a state of good repair, 120-, 130-year-old tunnels.\n  This would just basically say: Let's put the money in the places \nwhich have the most modern transportation systems, built most recently, \nand probably built since Federal support was put in place by Ronald \nReagan and stick it to the ones who did it on their own 130, 140 years \nago and have been struggling to keep up and only had a partnership with \nthe Federal Government since Ronald Reagan was President of the United \nStates.\n  This does not go to the efficiency of an operation anytime anybody \napplies for a TIFIA loan or anything else. They\n\n[[Page H7668]]\n\nare evaluated in terms of how they are going to be able to repay those \nloans at the fare box, out of the fare box, out of operating costs, not \nwhat their assets to liabilities are.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 15 will \nnot be offered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 16 Offered by Ms. Meng\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title I (page 233, after line 8), insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1431. IMPROVEMENT OF DATA COLLECTION ON CHILD OCCUPANTS \n                   IN VEHICLE CRASHES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall revise the crash \n     investigation data collection system of the National Highway \n     Traffic Safety Administration to include the collection of \n     the following data in connection with vehicle crashes \n     whenever a child restraint system was in use in a vehicle \n     involved in a crash:\n       (1) The type or types of child restraint systems in use \n     during the crash in any vehicle involved in the crash, \n     including whether a five-point harness or belt-positioning \n     booster.\n       (2) If a five-point harness child restraint system was in \n     use during the crash, whether the child restraint system was \n     forward-facing or rear-facing in the vehicle concerned.\n       (b) Consultation.--In implementing subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall work with law enforcement officials, safety \n     advocates, the medical community, and research organizations \n     to improve the recordation of data described in subsection \n     (a) in police and other applicable incident reports.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House \n     of Representatives a report on child occupant crash data \n     collection in the crash investigation data collection system \n     of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n     pursuant to the revision required by subsection (a).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Ms. Meng) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, this bipartisan amendment is simple. It is \nidentical to language that appeared in the Senate version of the \ntransportation bill that required improved data collection on the types \nof child restraint systems in use whenever a child is present during a \ncar crash.\n  I am honored to have Representative Love as a cosponsor of this \namendment, and I thank her for her support.\n  Mr. Chair, I know that we have 81 amendments to work through today \nand a long evening ahead of us; so, in the interest of time, I will \nkeep my remarks brief.\n  The amendment I am offering merely requires revisions to the crash \ninvestigation data collection system of the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration in an effort to save children's lives. The more \nwe know about the type of child restraint system used, how it was used, \nand the outcome of that use, the more we will be able to avert future \ntragedies.\n  After 3 years of collection of the data required by this amendment, \nthe Secretary will be required to submit a report to Congress on the \nperformance of various child restraint systems. It is my hope that we \nwill join together at that time to craft new legislation that addresses \nwhat we learn.\n  Again, this is a bipartisan amendment, Mr. Chair. I believe it is a \ngood amendment, and I think we have an opportunity to save children's \nlives.\n  I urge support for this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \ndo not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not in our jurisdiction. \nIt is in the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction. I understand \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee supports the amendment, so we support \nthe amendment also.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon \n(Mr. DeFazio).\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact that the chairman does not oppose \nand that the committee of jurisdiction does not oppose.\n  It is very timely. We just had a study about child safety seats which \nraises questions about rear-facing seats, and I think this \ncomprehensive data would be very, very important as we move forward, \npotentially changing the guidelines on how we restrain children in \nvehicles to better protect them.\n  I congratulate the gentlewoman on bringing this amendment forward, \nand I hope that it is accepted.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 17 Offered by Mr. Russell\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 17 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III of division A, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. STREETCAR FUNDING PROHIBITION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Federal \n     financial assistance may not be provided for any project or \n     activity to establish, maintain, operate, or otherwise \n     support a streetcar service. This section does not apply to a \n     contract entered into before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, streetcars, also known as trollies, are \nmass transit vehicles that operate on rail lines embedded in normal \nroadways, often drawing electrical power from overhead structures.\n  From 2009 to 2014, the Department of Transportation awarded $432 \nmillion for streetcar projects in 14 cities throughout the country.\n  Streetcars are highly impractical from a public transit standpoint. \nLike a bus, but unlike a train, a streetcar's speed is constrained by \nthe speed of traffic around them. Unlike a bus, however, they are bound \nby their tracks. If anything blocks the tracks, such as an accident or \na construction project, the entire line shuts down, making it an \ninefficient form of transportation.\n  Streetcars are costly to build and operate. They require extensive \ninfrastructure, including tracks and overhead power, that is not \nrequired for buses. Per passenger, per mile, they are also \nsignificantly and consistently more costly to operate than buses. \nAccording to a 2013 Journal of Public Transportation study, they fail \nor are at the bottom of all efficient forms of transportation.\n  The Congressional Research Service can find no clear evidence that \nstreetcars increase transit ridership. Streetcar corridors that saw \neconomic growth often benefited from other substantial subsidies. It is \nunclear if streetcars contributed to this growth.\n  The main argument for this amendment, which would prohibit future \nfunding, is that it would establish Federal prohibitions on any \nfinancial assistance to establish, maintain, operate, or otherwise \nsupport a streetcar service unless there is a current contract in place \nthat would be entered\n\n[[Page H7669]]\n\ninto before the date of the enactment of the act.\n  The main argument for streetcars is often their psychological appeal. \nWhile this is appreciated, it is also very subjective, and it depends \non the sentiments of tourists or local communities. They are more \ncomparable to water taxis or Ferris wheels than to buses and light \nrail. The Department of Transportation is not in a good position to \njudge how tourists and locals will feel about a streetcar project. The \nagency, therefore, lacks the insight to predict the success of a \nproject.\n  Most streetcar funding has come from the Transportation Investment \nGenerating Economic Recovery grant program, or TIGER program. TIGER is \nan extremely competitive program with 20 times more applicants than \nthere is money available. Recent rule changes are expected to make it \neasier for streetcars to receive funding from the Capital Investment \nGrant Program, also known as the New Starts and Small Starts program.\n  The President's administration has requested $3.2 billion for this \nprogram for FY 2016, including $75 million for streetcar projects, and \nat least six more are under development.\n  Any further grant awards for streetcar projects will divert scarce \nFederal funding from other high-priority transportation projects. While \nwe appreciate all forms of transportation, our infrastructure, our \nnational defense, and the vitality of our commerce on our roads beg for \nmore efficient means of transportation for our dollars, which are \nlimited.\n  Bus Rapid Transit projects, or BRT projects, for example, attract \nriders with higher quality stations and buses, traffic lanes that are \nfully or partially dedicated to buses, and more reliable, frequent \nservice. Unlike for streetcars, there is objective evidence that the \nBRT tends to increase transit ridership and decrease trip time, \naccording to the Government Accountability Office.\n  Streetcar projects are expensive, uncertain gambles that depend on \nsubjective local and tourist sentiments more than on objective facts. \nIt is for that reason--as we face a $19 trillion deficit and as we face \nforeign policy challenges abroad that require contingency dollars and \nas we look at husbanding the strength for our transportation--that my \namendment would make sure that these resources are used in their proper \nplace.\n  Local communities should, therefore, risk their own funds, like in my \nhome State of Oklahoma. Oklahoma City recently passed a $129 million \ndowntown streetcar project, which its own citizens approved, without \nusing Federal funds. While municipalities may desire streetcars, they \nshould not do it with other Americans' money.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This amendment would dictate to communities across America what form \nof transit they could put into their urban areas to solve problems of \ncongestion and the efficient movement of people from place to place.\n  The gentleman mentioned tourist destinations. Yes, some may relate to \ntourist destinations; others may relate to medical facilities, as in \nPortland, Oregon, where the streetcar terminates at the Oregon Health & \nScience University. It also then utilizes a tram, which is at both the \nbottom and the top of the hill. It is used by many patients and others \nwho have to get there. So these are not just toy things or things that \nare used for tourists. They are used to solve congestion problems in \nmajor urban areas. They are also incredible tools for economic \ndevelopment.\n  As for the fixed streetcar line in Portland, they revitalized a whole \nsection of the city, which generated $3.5 billion in private economic \ndevelopment because the line was there. They didn't get any Federal \nmoney, but they built their projects adjacent to that line, which also \nprovided a built-in ridership. Many people who reside in those pretty \nhigh-end apartments actually don't own cars, and they utilize the \nstreetcar.\n  Salt Lake has already attracted $400 million in investment. Atlanta, \nGeorgia, has a very successful program. Tucson, Arizona, has seen an \nincredible initial ridership, far exceeding projections. Cities across \nAmerica are finding great success with streetcars; so to deny them this \ntool on some sort of arbitrary basis, I think, is unwarranted.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oklahoma has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, no research supports clear economic \ngrowth, according to the Congressional Research Service. While there \nmay be other factors--usually with heavy government subsidies--that \nalso contribute to this growth, it does not have any delineation toward \nstreetcars.\n  This amendment does not dictate but protects scarce resources. In a \nnation that has an incredible deficit problem, we have to get to the \npoint at which we can have priorities. This focuses on priorities.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I could not disagree more with my \nfriend from Oklahoma City.\n  First of all, the streetcar is a highly developed mechanism that 30 \ncommunities across the country are involved with right now, and they \nall invest their own money, including Oklahoma City. I find it ironic \nthat somehow there is this notion that people are picking this out of \nthe air as a toy or arts and crafts. That is not the case.\n  Look, I have been working on this for over 30 years, since I \ninitiated a project for Portland's streetcar. I would be happy to \nintroduce the gentleman to businesspeople, to local government. \nActually, my friend from Oregon understated it. It is $4.5 billion. It \nis happening in Seattle, in Tacoma. I was in New York--in Brooklyn--\nthis Friday, where they are looking at a streetcar. It is an \nextraordinarily efficient way to concentrate development. It encourages \nprivate investment. It extends the pedestrian experience. It is part of \nthe toolkit.\n  I notice the gentleman has left the Chamber. I was going to ask him \nif he knew that, in his Oklahoma City, there is a TIGER grant that is \ngoing to build three blocks of rail line starting in 2016. It was a \nchoice of Oklahoma City. They thought the TIGER grant was so important \nthat they are using Federal money in a project that is supplementing \nlocal money.\n  My friend from Oregon is correct, the ranking member, in that we \nshouldn't take this tool away from communities, large and small, across \nthe country. From Kenosha, Wisconsin, to Los Angeles, people are \nunderstanding that the streetcar has a vital role in revitalizing \ncommunities, in giving people more choices, in focusing economic \ndevelopment; and it is why the tram--the streetcar--is ubiquitous \nacross the world. It is why we now have 30 cities that are doing it.\n  I would argue, if you look at the billions of dollars we have \ninvested in transportation projects, less than a half a billion dollars \nthat people competed for very aggressively, for these TIGER grants, is \nmoney well spent. It is well spent in my community. Some people might \nwarrant Bus Rapid Transit, like my colleague from Oregon has in Eugene.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  This is a tool that has proven its worth. Communities around the \ncountry, from Cincinnati to Dallas, Texas, are doing it because it \nworks. It would be a tragic mistake to approve an amendment that would \ntake this tool away from communities that decide to do it and would \nlike to supplement their local resources with Federal money, like is \nhappening in Oklahoma City next year.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 18 Offered by Ms. Edwards\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n\n[[Page H7670]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III of division A, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS OF THE WASHINGTON \n                   METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``Compact'' means the Washington Metropolitan \n     Area Transit Authority Compact (Public Law 89-774; 80 Stat. \n     1324);\n       (2) the term ``Federal Director'' means--\n       (A) a voting member of the Board of Directors of the \n     Transit Authority who represents the Federal Government; and\n       (B) a nonvoting member of the Board of Directors of the \n     Transit Authority who serves as an alternate for a member \n     described in subparagraph (A); and\n       (3) the term ``Transit Authority'' means the Washington \n     Metropolitan Area Transit Authority established under Article \n     III of the Compact.\n       (b) Appointment by Secretary of Transportation.--\n       (1) In general.--For any appointment made on or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall have sole authority to appoint Federal \n     Directors to the Board of Directors of the Transit Authority.\n       (2) Amendment to compact.--The signatory parties to the \n     Compact shall amend the Compact as necessary in accordance \n     with paragraph (1).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentlewoman \nfrom Maryland (Ms. Edwards) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Maryland.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember.\n  Representative Comstock of Virginia and I have an amendment that is \nat the desk, and I don't have to tell my colleagues who ride Metro \nevery day to and from work of the issues that WMATA Metro has had with \nsafety, performance, and management.\n  Our bipartisan amendment gives the Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Transportation the authority to appoint the four Federal \nmembers to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Board. \nCurrently, the General Services Administration has this sole authority \nand shares oversight responsibilities of the Federal board members with \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation. The WMATA board determines the \nagency's policy and provides oversight for the funding, operation, and \nexpansion of transit facilities.\n  We have worked closely with Senator Mikulski of Maryland on this \nissue, and she has introduced a bill in the Senate that is cosponsored \nby all three other local Senators: Senators Cardin, Warner, and Kaine \nof Virginia.\n  From various conversations we have had, the Secretary of \nTransportation is also aware of this issue and is supportive of the \nDepartment of Transportation taking over. The General Services \nAdministration has stated that ``this was never in our wheelhouse.'' \nAnd WMATA does not oppose this change.\n  I want to thank Chairs Chaffetz and Meadows and Ranking Members \nCummings and Connolly for working with us since the amendment also \nfalls under the jurisdiction of the House Oversight and Government \nReform Committee. They have cleared this amendment.\n  Before I close, I want to remember our late colleague--and former \ncolleague on the Transportation Committee--Howard Coble, who died last \nnight. He represented the Sixth Congressional District of North \nCarolina, including the town I was born in, Yanceyville, North \nCarolina. He will be sorely missed by all of us and his long-time \nconstituents and his service with us. May he rest in peace.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  I don't have to tell my colleagues, some of who ride Metro each day \nto and from work, of the issues the Washington Metropolitan Area \nTransit Authority (WMATA) has had with safety, performance, and \nmanagement.\n  The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA, \nPublic Law 110-432), included the National Capital Transportation \nAmendments Act, a bill authorizing $1.5 billion in federal funding for \nWMATA capital improvements. It was because of this federal investment \nand WMATA's large federal employee ridership that the National Capital \nRegion Congressional Delegation created the federal board members.\n  The Delegation expanded the WMATA Board from twelve members from \nMaryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia to include sixteen \nmembers, establishing the four new federal member positions. The \nDelegation also believed that these federal board members would not be \nwrapped up in jurisdictional politics. Often board members from the \njurisdictions do not recommend what is needed because their \njurisdiction does not have the money.\n  The National Capital Region Congressional Delegation gave the \nappointment authority to the General Services Administration (GSA) \nbecause at the time, it seemed the best federal agency to represent the \noverall federal workforce. Approximately forty percent of WMATA's \nridership is federal employees.\n  Our amendment gives the Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nTransportation (USDOT) the authority to appoint the four federal \nmembers to the WMATA Board. Currently, the GSA has this sole authority \nand shares oversight responsibilities of the federal board members with \nUSDOT. The WMATA Board determines the agency's policy and provides \noversight for the funding, operation, and expansion of transit \nfacilities.\n  I have worked with Senator Mikulski on this issue and she has \nintroduced a bill in the Senate that this amendment is based on. S. \n2093 is cosponsored by all 3 other local Senators, Senators Cardin, \nWarner, and Kaine.\n  From various conversations we have had, Secretary Foxx is aware of \nthis issue and is supportive of USDOT taking over. GSA has stated that \n``this never was in our wheelhouse.'' And WMATA does not oppose.\n  I want to thank Chairs Chaffetz & Meadows and Ranking Members \nCummings & Connolly for working with us since the amendment falls under \nthe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's jurisdiction. It \nis my understanding they have cleared this amendment.\n  Since the creation of the federal board positions in 2008, GSA has \nnot played an active role in oversight of the federal board members. \nGSA does not have any expertise about what it takes to operate a \ntransit system, nor does it have any experience.\n  Only USDOT has been committed to the oversight of the federal board \nmembers and trying to correct WMATA's myriad problems. WMATA's serious \nsafety, operational, and financial issues have all been documented by \nUSDOT. The Secretary of USDOT and the Federal Transit Administration \nhave been working directly with the federal board members and the \ntransit agency to get things fixed. The federal board members and USDOT \nare in regular communication.\n  In addition, the local delegation led by Senator Mikulski has been \nproviding the federal finding authorized in PRIIA in the annual \nTransportation & HUD (THUD) Appropriations Bill. For the last seven \nyears, bill and report language has been included requiring strict \noversight by the USDOT Secretary on how these taxpayer dollars are \nspent.\n  Before I close, I would like to remember our late colleague, Howard \nCoble, who died last night. He represented the 6th Congressional \nDistrict of North Carolina, including the town that I was born in, \nYanceyville. Howard will be sorely missed by all of us and his long-\ntime constituents. May he rest in peace.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, although I don't oppose the \namendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, this particular amendment \nreally is in the jurisdiction of the Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee. They are in favor of the amendment, so we are going to urge \nour colleagues to support it. We are not going to oppose it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say it has been a real \npleasure to be able to work with Mrs. Comstock on this amendment. It is \nvery rare that we have opportunities to work across the aisle and also \nacross the Capitol to make sure that we are doing the right thing for \nour transit system here in the metropolitan Washington area that serves \nso many millions of both Federal workers and tourists from all of our \ndifferent States and jurisdictions.\n  It is really clear that the General Services Administration in this \nday and age is probably not the most appropriate place for the \nappointment of these members of the board. It is dutifully to be placed \nwith the Department of Transportation to which they have\n\n[[Page H7671]]\n\nagreed. I thank our colleagues for all agreeing to this as well.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 19 Offered by Ms. Frankel of Florida\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 19 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 424, strike line 17 and all that follows \n     through page 426, line 24.\n       Page 428, line 20, strike ``and'' at the end.\n       Page 428, line 23, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 428, after line 23, insert the following:\n       (4) is not a high-risk carrier, as identified by the \n     Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\n       Beginning on page 449, strike line 5 and all that follows \n     through page 451, line 22.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentlewoman \nfrom Florida (Ms. Frankel) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair, ranking \nmember, and all the colleagues who worked so hard on bringing this \nlegislation to the floor.\n  My amendment is really about improving this bill. It is going to make \nit a better bill, and it is about making our Nation's roads safer and \nthe delivery of goods more efficient.\n  There are 15.5 million trucks on the road each year driving more than \n93 billion miles annually, carrying over a billion dollars' worth of \ngoods. There is no question that our Nation's trucking industry is a \nhuge economic driver, earning $650 billion annually, 5 percent of the \nUnited States GDP.\n  With all that sunshine comes a little bit of rain. The National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration said that in 2013 almost 4,000 \npeople were killed and 95,000 people were injured by large trucks, \ncosting the public a whopping $100 billion annually. So my amendment \ndoes three things to increase safety and to reduce those costs.\n  First, the amendment brings the requirement for commercial truck \ninsurance into the 21st century. It is shocking, Mr. Chair, that the \nminimum insurance required for commercial trucks has remained the same \nsince the 1980s at $750,000 per incident regardless of the number of \nvictims or their injuries. The FMCSA, which is the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration, is currently engaged in rulemaking to \nexamine the appropriateness of this standard. The base bill requires \nstudies that I respectfully submit will slow down this process.\n  Imagine a large truck hitting a bus full of schoolchildren and the \ninsurance only being $750,000 to cover all the losses. Do you want to \nbe the person that tells the parents that Congress needs to do more \nstudies before their medical bills can be paid? My amendment strikes \nthese unnecessary studies so that the FMCSA can finish their important \nwork without delay.\n  Second, the base bill creates a national hiring standard that brokers \nand shippers must use to hire carriers. One of these standards is based \non outdated information. It is not updated annually. So my amendment at \nthe desk would strengthen the hiring standard by prohibiting the hiring \nof motor carriers defined as ``high-risk carriers'' by the FMCSA.\n  Finally, just this year, the FMCSA did a study that found that \ncompliance, safety, and accountability scores accurately predict safety \nperformance by drivers. These scores are currently used by brokers and \nshippers to identify unsafe carriers. Studies show that, since this \nsystem has been used, there has been a 14 percent reduction in serious \nviolations of the law. I want to repeat that. There has been a 14 \npercent reduction in serious violations of the law.\n  This base bill requires another study that is going to take 18 \nmonths. Not only that, the base bill now hides important safety \nstatistics during this time. What my amendment does is very simple. The \nprovision makes these safety scores transparent for the public to see.\n  Together, these measures are going to improve the movement of goods \nacross the country by increasing safety and efficiency. It is a real \ngood amendment. I think it is going to make this bill much better, and \nI urge its adoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, this amendment literally just \nguts some very crucial reforms to this bill. What this amendment does \nis strikes a section in the bill that requires the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration to remove from its Web site those \ncompliance and safety accountability program scores.\n  What we found is that the CSA is a flawed system. It treats safe \ncarriers unfairly, and it has done very little to improve motor carrier \nsafety records.\n  The Government Accountability Office and the motor carrier \nstakeholders, they have been very critical of the CSA program. They \nhave called for the reform. So what this does is make sure that those \nreforms are going to happen quickly. It doesn't hide anything. Once the \nreforms are in place, the scores are going to go back up on the Web \nsite.\n  In the meantime, that raw data concerning accidents, violations, out-\nof-service rates, it will remain publicly available; and it is also \ngoing to be available to law enforcement if they need to investigate or \nprosecute an unsafe carrier. So nothing is being hidden, but what this \ndoes is require that these reforms are going to take place and they are \ngoing to take place very, very quickly.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I would just be repeating \nmyself.\n  I do want to repeat one thing which I think is important. Since the \nsystem has been used by FMCSA, there has been a 14 percent reduction in \nserious violations of the law, and I think that speaks for itself.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chair, again, this guts some very \nimportant parts of this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 20 Offered by Mr. Duncan of Tennessee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 20 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 428, line 23, before the period, insert ``or be \n     unrated''.\n       Page 428, after line 23, insert the following:\n       (4) has not been issued an out-of-service order to prohibit \n     a motor carrier from conducting operations at the motor \n     carrier level--\n       (A) for failing to pay fines under part 385.14 of title 49, \n     Code of Federal Regulations;\n       (B) for a proposed ``unsatisfactory'' safety rating under \n     part 385.13(d) of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations;\n       (C) for failing to respond to a new entrant audit under \n     part 385.325 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations; and\n       (D) and currently is being considered as an imminent hazard \n     at the carrier level (not the individual driver or equipment \n     level).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n\n\n  Modification to Amendment No. 20 Offered by Mr. Duncan of Tennessee\n\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that \namendment No. 20, printed in part A of House Report 114-326, be \nmodified by the form I have placed at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n  Modification to amendment No. 20 offered by Mr. Duncan of Tennessee:\n\n\n[[Page H7672]]\n\n\n  \n\n     on line 12 of amendment No. 20, add the word ``not'' after \n     is.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, first I want to commend \nChairman Graves. Nobody could have done a better job on this bill than \nhe has done. I also want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member \nDeFazio because they have placed just about everything that I have \nrequested into this bill, including accepting an amendment yesterday.\n  I will repeat something that I said during general debate yesterday: \nI am so pleased that after we have spent hundreds of billions of \ndollars over the last 15 years in a vain attempt to rebuild the Middle \nEast, now we are finally going to pass a major bill to rebuild this \ncountry and provide hundreds of thousands of jobs all across this \nNation.\n  I rise today, Mr. Chairman, with Mr. Paulsen of Minnesota to offer an \namendment that is basically very technical in nature, but it is one \nthat is very, very important to many thousands of the smallest \ncompanies in the trucking industry.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for \nincluding in the base bill some of the language from a bill that I \nintroduced that deals with this situation. This amendment expands that \nby clarifying the requirements that a freight broker must meet before \nhiring a motor carrier for the delivery of goods.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Currently, the bill requires a broker to check to ensure that the \nmotor carrier is first registered with and authorized by the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration to operate as a licensed motor \ncarrier; secondly, has the minimum insurance required by Federal law; \nand, third, has the satisfactory safety fitness determination by the \nFMCSA. All of these things make for a safer trucking industry in this \ncountry.\n  Our amendment inserts ``or be unrated'' in the third requirement. \nCurrently, there are thousands of small trucking operations which have \nyet to be audited or rated by the FMCSA. By adding the words ``or be \nunrated,'' we ensure that these small companies are not precluded from \nbeing in the pool of eligible motor carriers that can be used for \nshipping goods.\n  According to the Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Association, \nOOIDA, without this amendment, we will be creating an incentive not to \nuse small carriers, putting hundreds of thousands of truck drivers out \nof business due to no fault of their own.\n  Without this change, we will hurt small mom-and-pop trucking \nbusinesses and drive up the cost of shipping goods for everyone.\n  The second part of our amendment adds a fourth requirement that must \nbe checked by the brokers. This fourth condition requires a broker to \ncheck to make sure that a motor carrier has not been issued an out-of-\nservice order to prohibit a carrier from conducting operations. Once \nagain, this makes for a safer trucking industry in this country.\n  If we do not make this amendment part of the bill, thousands of small \ncompanies and mom-and-pop operators who have never had a wreck or had a \nviolation would lose business just because FMCSA does not have the \nsufficient time or staff to officially rate them.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I will just say this amendment ensures \nthat we have only safe trucks on the road and that thousands of small \nbusinesses are not hurt in the process. However, I have received \nassurances from both Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio that \nthey want to do something about this.\n  I think everybody on both sides of the aisle in this Congress really \nwants to try to help the smallest businesses in almost any industry, \nand they have told me that they will really try to do something about \nthis in conference.\n  With that assurance and at their request, I am withdrawing this \namendment and hope that we can improve the bill as it goes on through \nconference.\n  Mr. Chairman, I withdraw the amendment at this point.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 21 Offered by Mr. Lewis\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 441, beginning line 3, strike section 5404 and insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 5404. STUDY ON COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a study to evaluate \n     the safety effects of the laws and regulations of States that \n     allow licensed drivers between the ages of 18 years and 21 \n     years to obtain a commercial driver's license to operate a \n     commercial motor vehicle within the State.\n       (b) Matters Included.--The study under subsection (a) shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) A review of the requirements for licensed drivers \n     between the ages of 18 years and 21 years to obtain \n     commercial driver's licenses described in such subsection.\n       (2) A review of collision rates and fatal collision rates \n     for such drivers while operating a commercial motor vehicle.\n       (3) A review of any other safety factors and metrics \n     determined appropriate by the Secretary in accordance with \n     subsection (c).\n       (c) Input.--In conducting the study under subsection (a), \n     including with respect to the safety factors and metrics \n     reviewed under subsection (b)(3), the Secretary shall solicit \n     input from representatives of State motor vehicle \n     administrators, motor carriers, labor organizations, \n     independent truck drivers, safety advocates, medical \n     associations and medical professionals, and other persons \n     determined appropriate by the Secretary.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish a report \n     containing the results of the study under subsection (a), \n     including any recommendations for statutory changes.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Lewis) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It would strike a \npilot program that allows teenagers to drive trucks across State lines. \nRight now this bill mandates that we allow teenagers to become truck \ndrivers. But, Mr. Chairman, it does not ask whether we should give them \nthe keys.\n  The American public has a strong opinion on this issue. After 92 \npercent of the comments strongly opposed to this idea, the Federal \nMotor Carrier Safety Administration denied a request for a similar \nprogram in 2003. The vast majority thought it was a bad and dangerous \nproposal.\n  My amendment simply asks the Department of Transportation to take \nanother look, a second look, before starting a national program. We \nneed to examine the safety of places where young drivers are already \nallowed to drive trucks within their own States.\n  Interstate highways are already dangerous enough. Given the higher \nand higher accident and fatality rates of younger drivers, it makes no \nsense to make this change without looking at all of the data.\n  Mr. Chairman, young drivers may not have the experience needed to \nhandle heavy, dangerous vehicles. Some follow too closely. Others go \ntoo fast and don't check their mirrors. Young drivers can use their \nbrakes too much, and that is a real danger when handling an 80,000-\npound truck.\n  Ask any parent. They know. Young drivers do not always listen, even \nwhen an experienced driver is in the front seat. My amendment does not \nsay no. It says just let us do the research first. We should study the \nsafety of teen truck drivers before any experiment that might have \ndangerous results.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Missouri is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike a \nlimited pilot program that is authorizing drivers over the age of 19\\1/\n2\\ to enter into a graduated program to obtain a commercial driver's \nlicense. The program is very limited to a number of States and a number \nof carriers that\n\n[[Page H7673]]\n\ncan participate. It also includes a number of safety requirements and a \nGAO report to Congress examining its safety impacts.\n  Mr. Chairman, what is interesting about the way present law is is \nthat a driver of the age that is being addressed here could drive all \nthe way across the State of Missouri, for instance, but they can't \ndrive 10 miles in the city of Kansas City, across town, because it is \nover a State line.\n  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and it actually hampers a whole \nlot of businesses out there that operate in communities like Kansas \nCity, St. Louis, and St. Joseph that are actually split by a State \nline.\n  The trucking industry is facing a severe shortage in the number of \ndrivers. With freight expected to increase 30 percent over the next 10 \nyears, the driver shortage is only going to worsen. We need to get more \nyoung people interested in careers in the transportation industry. It \nis as simple as that.\n  This is a limited pilot program. It represents a delicate compromise \nthat would accomplish a very important goal.\n  I urge Members to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that there is a driver \nshortage, but it is important, very important, to follow the data. We \nshould not put inexperienced drivers on the road before we have all of \nthe facts.\n  In my congressional district, in Metro Atlanta, we have three major \ninterstate highways running through our city: I-75, I-85, and I-20. \nEven with experienced drivers, there is always some major accident. We \nneed to follow the data. I urge all of my colleagues to support my \ncommonsense amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, again, what we are trying to do \nwith this program is just allow those drivers to be able to cross the \nState line. Again, they are already allowed to go an entire State's \nlength within the State.\n  I would ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 22 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 22 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 449, beginning line 5, strike section 5501 relating \n     minimum financial responsibility rulemaking.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in \nsupport of my amendment to H.R. 22.\n  Minimum insurance requirements for trucks have remained the same \nsince the 1980s. Currently, it is $750,000. Healthcare costs have \nskyrocketed. For example, hospital care for traumatically brain-injured \npeople can average $8,000 per day. Minimum insurance does not \nrealistically account for multivehicle accidents where $750,000 must be \ndivided among all of the injured parties.\n  FMCSA is currently undergoing rulemaking to evaluate current \ninsurance requirements. Congress should not delay or derail this \neffort. Section 5501 conditions the agency's rulemaking upon its \ncompletion of detailed studies that must be completed in consultation \nwith industry stakeholders.\n  This amendment strikes language that is designed to delay and \nultimately derail this long-overdue rulemaking. When a person suffers \nlife-threatening injuries due to the negligence of a motor carrier, the \ncost of long-term care and the loss of his or her livelihood often is \npushed to the background. For families that undergo this ordeal, it \noften comes as a surprise that, despite a congressional mandate in the \n1980s, minimum insurance requirements for interstate truckers and bus \ncarriers have remained unchanged.\n  The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 specifically set out to ensure public \nsafety by requiring insurance premiums to be updated regularly. A \nsimilar bill, the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, was passed for the \nsegment of the industry transporting passengers interstate.\n  While the minimum insurance levels in 1985 for general freight \ncarriers and small-bus operators was $750,000 and $1.5 million \nrespectively, with higher liability limits for carriers of hazardous \nmaterials and large bus carriers, the intent of Congress was to \nincrease the minimums regularly to keep pace with inflation.\n  In April of this year, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration released a report to Congress that examined the adequacy \nof the current financial responsibility requirements for motor \ncarriers. The conclusion was clear: Today the cost of injuries and \nfatalities arising from crashes far exceed the minimum insurance levels \ninterstate operators are required to carry. As a result, victims are \noften not appropriately compensated for their injuries.\n  Language in section 5501 is an attempt to stop or at the very least \ndelay this long-overdue FMCSA rulemaking in its tracks by taking away \nthe resources necessary for the agency to evaluate appropriate levels \nof financial responsibility for the motor carrier industry. FMCSA \nrulemaking is necessary because current insurance limits do not \nadequately cover crashes primarily because of increased medical costs.\n  To be on par with medical consumer price index inflation, the \nliability limit for general freight carriers today would be $4.4 \nmillion, calculated from the 1980 passage date of the Motor Carrier \nAct, and around $6.5 million for small-bus operators.\n  Moreover, the April FMCSA report found that, in real terms, insurance \npremiums have actually decreased for the same level of coverage since \nthe 1980s. The result is that thousands of crash victims are left \nwithout the financial resources to pay medical bills or restore the \nquality of life that he or she enjoyed before the trucking or bus \naccident, that despite the fact that insurance premiums have gone down.\n  In many cases, the burden of healthcare costs are passed on to \ntaxpayers, as Medicare and Medicaid shoulder millions of dollars of \nmedical care each year due to inadequately insured carriers. We must \nkeep the trucking industry accountable for safety by supporting this \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is it \nstrikes some very commonsense regulatory reforms in the bill.\n  The underlying bill requires the Department of Transportation to \nstudy whether an increase in minimum insurance levels for intercity \nbuses is needed before pursuing a rulemaking to change the levels. I \ndon't understand why we would strike language that simply tells the \nDepartment to determine whether a problem exists before it regulates.\n  The amendment also strikes language in the bill that requires the \nSecretary to consider the impact of an ongoing rulemaking on small \ntrucking companies and safety.\n  These considerations, Mr. Chairman, are not going to delay the \nrulemaking, but it is going to add transparency and accountability to \nthe process.\n  I would urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H7674]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 23 Offered by Mr. Ribble\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 23 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V of division A, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TRANSPORTATION OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND \n                   EQUIPMENT.\n\n       Section 229(e)(4) of the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement \n     Act of 1999 (49 U.S.C. 31136 note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``50 air mile radius'' and inserting ``75 \n     air mile radius''; and\n       (2) by striking ``the driver.'' and inserting ``the driver, \n     except that a State, upon notice to the Secretary, may \n     establish a different air mile radius limitation for purposes \n     of this paragraph if such limitation is between 50 and 75 air \n     miles and applies only to movements that take place entirely \n     within the State.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Ribble) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase the air-mile \nradius from 50 air-miles to 75 air-miles for the transportation of \nconstruction materials and equipment to satisfy the 24-hour reset \nperiod under the hours of service rule. It would also give States the \nability to opt out of this increase if the movement would take place \nentirely within one State's borders.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment cosponsored by Mr. Lipinski, Mr. \nHanna, and Mr. Cramer.\n  Commercial motor vehicle drivers in the construction industry face \nsome unique circumstances. They often haul perishable materials like \nasphalt and concrete from a construction company's central shop or \ndispatch center to a specific project site within that company's area \nof operation.\n  These drivers spend long periods of time waiting to pick up materials \nand loading or unloading equipment, instead of driving, but they are \nconsidered on duty for the entire duration of the trip. Current law \nallows construction industry drivers to reset their weekly on-duty time \nafter a 24-hour consecutive off-duty period; however, this exemption is \nonly allowed if those drivers work within a 50 air-mile radius.\n  Because construction companies operate today in larger areas than \nthey did when the exemption was first put in place two decades ago, I \nam offering this amendment to increase this air-mile radius to 75 air-\nmiles. I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition, \nthough I am not in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment extends an existing \nexemption established in 1995 by Congress, and I think it is a \nreasonable and very small adjustment to that. I think it will improve \nefficiency and lower costs. I have no objection.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Lipinski), a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank the ranking member for yielding.\n  I want to thank Mr. Ribble for his work on this amendment and other \nimportant transportation issues. I think Mr. Ribble and Ranking Member \nDeFazio have explained this very well.\n  In recognition of the unique nature of the construction industry, \nCongress did provide this exemption to certain hours of service rules \nfor commercial motor vehicle drivers in the industry.\n  Increasing this from 50 to 75 miles is a small change, but I think it \nwill be very helpful because the current exemption we have seen has \ncome up short. It needs to be modernized for most efficient goods \nmovement and keep perishable materials from spoiling, as well as \naccount for the fact that many materials suppliers operate in areas \noutside of the current air-mile radius. This amendment helps improve \nthe exemption by increasing it by 25 miles.\n  It is also important to note that this amendment provides an opt-out \nprovision for those States that do not wish to participate in this \nincrease.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

PILOT PROGRAM FOR REDUCTION OF DEPARTMENT-OWNED \n                   VEHICLES AND INCREASE IN USE OF RIDE-SHARING \n                   SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Pilot Program Requirement.--The Secretary of each \n     covered department shall establish a pilot program within the \n     department for the following purposes:\n       (1) To reduce the inventory of light vehicles owned by the \n     department by 10 percent for each of the fiscal years \n     described in subsection (b), through the sale or other \n     appropriate disposal of such vehicles.\n       (2) At the discretion of the Secretary of the department, \n     to increase the use by the department of commercial ride-\n     sharing companies.\n       (b) Fiscal Years Described.--The fiscal years described in \n     this subsection are the following:\n       (1) The first fiscal year beginning after the expiration of \n     the 1-year period starting on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (2) Each of the four fiscal years following the fiscal year \n     described in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     end of the fiscal year described in subsection (b)(1), and \n     annually thereafter for the duration of the pilot program, \n     the Secretary of each covered department shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the results of the pilot program in the \n     department. The report shall include information about the \n     transportation budget of the department and such findings and \n     recommendations as the Secretary of the department considers \n     appropriate.\n       (d) Covered Department.--In this Act, the term ``covered \n     department'' means each of the following:\n       (1) The Department of Agriculture.\n       (2) The Department of the Interior.\n       (3) The Department of Energy.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, these amendment marathons can often be \na bit exhausting around here with all sorts of ideas coming from \ndifferent directions, but now for something completely different.\n  Our government is heading to having about a half a million light-duty \nvehicles, so think of this: As of today, I think we have about 460,000 \nlight-duty vehicles in the fleet of government.\n  Our amendment is something very, very simple. We all walk around with \nthese supercomputers in our pocket--our smartphones--and we see the \ntechnology revolution, the information revolution, that is happening \naround us, whether it be ride sharing, on-call services, or just the \nmanagement of data. We have people living next to each other going to \nthe same workplace.\n  Let's use this information in this new world around us and ask three \nagencies to reduce their vehicle fleets by engaging in the new world of \ninformation, whether it be ride sharing, an Uber model, a Zipcar model, \nor taxicab model. Maybe it is a hybrid that we have never thought of \nthat gets brought forward.\n  So the amendment is very, very simple. All we are asking is that \nthree agencies reduce their vehicle fleets by using modern technology, \nmodern means of transportation, modern social transportation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n\n[[Page H7675]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chair, first, I would ask the gentleman very quickly the \nquestion: Why these particular agencies?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert).\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, to my friend on the other side, there \nwas a GAO report--I think it might now have been a couple of years \nago--and these three agencies actually were tagged as having the \nhighest number of vehicles as a percentage of, I believe, employment \npopulation that sat idle. Agriculture was close to 30,000 vehicles; \nInterior, 18,000. There was an actual reason.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman.\n  Although the gentleman does reside in Arizona, I know he certainly is \naware that both the BLM and the Forest Service must cover huge amounts \nof territory with their employees, including many forested and remote \nareas.\n  In my district, just doing my rounds on paved roads, I can be out of \ncell service 20 to 25 percent of the time. There is no Uber, Lyft, or \nany alternative available to me, let alone my Forest Service and BLM \nemployees who are up in the forest. I don't think Uber is lurking \naround the forest waiting to pick them up. Plus, they don't have cell \nservice. I guess they could use a sat phone, but I don't think they \nwill come.\n  The agency choices are peculiar. They may have a large fleet, and \nthey have a large fleet for a particular reason. Obviously, you can \nhave one Forest Service employee and one vehicle going to a very remote \nwork location for one work duty. They don't have an opportunity to ride \nshare or do anything else. I find that to be particularly problematic.\n  I think the intent of having the government reduce the number of \nlight vehicles, particularly for agencies that are based in urban areas \nor more urban environments, is very intriguing and interesting. I would \nbe happy to support his next amendment, which would have us study this \nissue. The GAO, working with GSA, I think could point to appropriate \nways to reduce the fleet and to more efficiently reduce costs and yet \nstill have employees be able to use their time very efficiently.\n  I would oppose this amendment, but in order to save time, I will say \nnow that I will support the next amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, to my colleague from Oregon, one more \ntime, the reference points in the GAO study actually said vehicles that \nlay idle, and that is why we chose these. There was actually a reason \nfor choosing these three agencies.\n  Mr. Chairman, a couple of data points: Agriculture, 29,818 light-duty \nvehicles; Interior, 18,752 light-duty vehicles; the Department of \nEnergy, 7,315 light-duty vehicles.\n  We are asking them to do the 10 percent reduction of those vehicle \nfleets over the 4 years. If technology efficiencies, the new gig \neconomy, however you see it, can't accomplish that through the simplest \nreforms brought to us by the modern era, we are in trouble.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I think the gentleman misstated. It is 10 percent per year for 5 \nyears. It is a 50 percent reduction in fleet. So that seems, without \nmuch more granular data, pretty radical. And I wouldn't want to see \nthat the next time I have got a major fire, the Forest Service doesn't \nhave adequate vehicles in the Willamette Forest or in any other forest \nin my State to dispatch all the people they need to command and control \nand to deal with that fire.\n  So I think the idea of the study has merit. I think it is an \narbitrary cut of 50 percent, particularly with two land management \nagencies that manage millions of acres of land. I know of Forest \nService and BLM employees that, on a given day, their duty may require \nthem to drive 4 hours to a remote spot to do a particular function, \nspend an hour there, and drive back; and there is no way around it \nbecause they had to do something at that particular point. So saying, \n``Gee, you are going to have to ride share or thumb or call Uber and \nsee if they will take you out there for a couple hundred miles in the \nmountains,'' it just doesn't work for me.\n  I think a study is a good idea, and we may find, indeed, there are \nefficiencies. But to arbitrarily reduce the fleets of the two largest \nland management agencies in the Federal Government, the Forest Service \nand the BLM, by 50 percent, I think could cause very unanticipated and \npotentially disastrous problems.\n  I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 25 Offered by Mr. Schweikert\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Reichert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, today I rise to offer an amendment that \nwill allow us to collect the facts and evaluate the impact of the 2014-\n2015 West Coast ports slowdown and dispute.\n  The efficient movement of goods is critical to the economic success \nof this country. Our farmers and manufacturers must be able to export \ntheir high-quality products to the customers around the world that they \nrely upon.\n  Beginning in the summer of 2014, these customer relationships and our \neconomy were threatened. This was the result of a prolonged contract \nnegotiation between the Pacific Maritime Association and the \nInternational Longshore and Warehouse Union that ended February 2015.\n  Just how serious was the impact of these prolonged negotiations? One \nexample from my home State provides a clear illustration.\n  Our apple growers in Washington State were faced with an estimated \n$100 million worth of apples that they could not sell. Other stories \ncan be told about multiple types of produce and products, including the \nhay and the potato industry, in Washington State.\n  In fact, Mr. Chairman, I was in Malaysia and Singapore during part of \nthe slowdown, and the complaint in those two countries was they \ncouldn't get their potatoes. And especially they were upset they \nweren't getting their Washington State french fries.\n  So this did have an impact across the globe. This wasn't just a \nUnited States economy impact. This was a global impact.\n  In fact, the ships coming from those countries to the West Coast were \nslowed down to 8 knots, hoping that this would be resolved by the time \nthe ships reached the West Coast.\n  This amendment simply requires the Government Accountability Office \nto study the economic impact of this dispute, review the steps taken to \nreach an agreement, and suggest what other tools might be used to \nprevent future slowdowns.\n  Like many of you, I have committed to my constituents that I will \nwork to ensure that this is not repeated for the sake of our workers, \nfarmers, and manufacturers. This amendment moves us in that direction.\n  I thank my colleagues, Representatives Schrader, Newhouse, Radewagen, \nand Coffman for working with me on this important issue. I urge support \nof this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, we would all like to prevent future disruptive \nshutdowns like this. I think a full survey of all the causes would be \ninteresting. It would be an interesting thing to have the GAO conduct.\n  Unfortunately, this is directed only at one factor, which is the \nunion itself. In fact, in here, finding 7 says: Suggest any legislation \nthat might ensure better regulation of the operations of the ports in \nthe United States with respect to such labor negotiations.\n  I think that that is very focused just on the labor side and not a \nbalanced look at what might have gone on on the management side of this \nissue.\n  Secondly, there are many other ongoing, enduring, and very costly \nport congestion factors out there that should be comprehensively looked \nat in order to more efficiently move freight in and out of our ports, \nabsent any sort of labor dispute or shutdown or lockout or any of those \ncertain things that relate to labor that also merit a comprehensive \nlook and, I think, merit a potential action by Congress. But this \nreport would not enlighten us in those areas either.\n  I would like to see the GAO conduct an analysis of the myriad of \nfactors that point to port congestion, provide Congress with a wide \nrange of policy recommendations, including options for financing \nintermodal efficiency to enhance the trade of goods in and out of the \nUnited States. So I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, just as a matter of clarification, this \nlegislation addresses both the Pacific Maritime Association and union \nissues.\n  How can you be against something that would be an investigation that \nwould clearly reveal what the problems are on both sides?\n  So this legislation is not designed to point the finger at any one \nentity. Two entities are involved in this issue. We need to find out \nwhat we can do to prevent this from happening in the future because it \ncosts the United States economy money, it costs jobs, and it affects \nthe entire global economy.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from American Samoa \n(Mrs. Radewagen).\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, first, I would like to thank Representatives Reichert, \nSchrader, Newhouse, and Coffman for their work in offering the \namendment that will simply direct GAO to conduct a study on the impact \nof the recent West Coast ports slowdown so that we can avoid these \ncostly slowdowns in the future.\n  As we all know, the Nation's economic stability and prosperity are \ndirectly linked to our ability to import and export goods. In fact, 30 \npercent of the Nation's GDP stems from imports and exports, 30 percent. \nThat is a large portion of the country's production.\n  During the slowdown, many of our businesses struggled to maintain the \nflow of capital due to their inability to ship goods. Additionally, \nmany of our retailers found it difficult to keep their shelves stocked \ndue to the lack of incoming goods, causing revenue loss and even the \nshutting of some businesses.\n  Now, just imagine if, instead of 30 percent, that number was 90 \npercent. Could you possibly imagine the devastation to the economy of \neven a brief slowdown?\n  It would have been the biggest story of the year. Our constituents \nwould have been camped out on our front steps demanding action from \nCongress.\n  Well, let me tell you that, in American Samoa, that number is 90 \npercent. We rely almost solely on imported goods for our food and \nenergy needs.\n  The main revenue generator on our beautiful islands is the tuna \ncanning industry, which comprises more than 85 percent of the island's \nGDP. This industry relies heavily upon their ability to ship their \nproducts quickly to the mainland and other nations.\n  We must ensure that this does not happen again. This amendment being \noffered by my colleagues and me will take the first step in finding \nsolutions to future slowdowns in the operations at our Nation's ports.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the House support this bipartisan measure \nto ensure the continued flow of goods to and from our ports and the \ngrowth of our economy.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon \n(Mr. Schrader).\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I am actually pleased here to join my \ncolleague, Representative Reichert from\n\n[[Page H7677]]\n\nWashington, in offering this important amendment today.\n  I want to assure Members here on the floor that this in no way is \npicking sides. You want to talk about labor disputes? These are labor \nmanagement disputes.\n  The problem we have on the West Coast is that this particular dispute \nlast year actually crippled severely the United States economy not just \non the West Coast, but into the Midwest and beyond.\n  We can't have this happen again. We cannot have this happen again. We \nhave to remain competitive in this global economy. We have to figure \nout a different way to resolve these disputes so that what is a \nlegitimate labor management negotiation does not affect businesses, \nfarmers, workers, and thousands of jobs across this country.\n  In my State, Terminal 6, the port of Portland's container terminal, \nis no longer operational. Why? Because the carriers don't want to call \non this port because it is too unreliable. They don't know if they are \ngoing to have ships to anchor up for weeks on end waiting to upload.\n  Instead, they will just call on other ports north or south of us. \nThis is directly an impact for the businesses and farmers.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHRADER. The Reichert amendment simply allows us to have a GAO \nstudy to talk about what possible outcomes could be different than what \nwe endured last year. The goal here is just simply to get some facts, \nget some information, protect American jobs, protect American workers.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Washington has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would suggest that, in reading the language, I think it could be \nmore balanced and I think it also should include those other factors \nwhich are day-to-day congestion, which do cost our economy hundreds of \nmillions or billions of dollars a year.\n  So I am opposed to this, as worded. I urge people to oppose it, and I \nwould hope that we can work through the conference committee on \nsomething that will give us a more comprehensive analysis of what we \nneed to do to increase the viability of all American ports.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 27 Offered by Mr. Newhouse\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 27 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VIII of Division A of the bill, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ___. FINDINGS ON PORT PERFORMANCE.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) America's ports play a critical role in the Nation's \n     transportation supply chain network.\n       (2) Reliable and efficient movement of goods through the \n     Nation's ports ensures that American goods are available to \n     customers throughout the world.\n       (3) Breakdowns in the transportation supply chain network, \n     particularly at the Nation's ports, can result in tremendous \n     economic losses for agriculture, businesses, and retailers \n     that rely on timely shipments.\n       (4) A clear understanding of terminal and port productivity \n     and throughput should help--\n       (A) to identify freight bottlenecks;\n       (B) to indicate performance and trends over time; and\n       (C) to inform investment decisions.\n\n     SEC. ___.

Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Newhouse) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Mr. Shuster, as well as Ranking Member DeFazio and all the\n\n[[Page H7678]]\n\nmembers of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their \nhard work on this large bill, this legislation.\n  The amendment I offer today for myself and Mr. Schrader of Oregon is \nvitally important to the American economy. Nearly a year ago, a dispute \nbegan at 29 of our Nation's West Coast ports that drastically slowed \nimports and exports to a near standstill.\n  Agricultural products rotted on the docks. Retailers couldn't get \nproducts to stores. American manufacturers could not get their products \nto foreign customers. By one estimate, there was nearly $7 billion in \ndamages to our economy.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have no interest in pointing fingers over who is \nresponsible for the dispute. However, I do believe that Congress has a \ngreat interest in preventing future disruptions from harming our \nbusinesses and consumers as well as our economy.\n  One thing that became abundantly clear during the disruption was that \nthere was very little data available to gauge how our ports are \nfunctioning on a day-to-day basis. If something is impeding port \nperformance, be it a dispute, major congestion, or even a natural \ndisaster, we need to know if and how our ports are suffering before it \nharms our economy and standing with foreign trading partners.\n  This amendment is simple. It requires the Bureau of Transportation \nStatistics to collect and make available data on how our Nation's ports \nare operating. Currently, the Bureau collects this information for our \nrailroads, for our highways, and our airports. We also need this \ninformation for our ports as well.\n  The amendment that we are introducing is already in the Senate \nhighway bill. It has been approved by the Senate Commerce Committee by \nvoice vote. This is not and should not be controversial.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  I also want to note that there are over 150 organizations supporting \nthis measure, organizations like the National Retail Federation, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, the Association of American Railroads, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, and the American Trucking \nAssociation. The list goes on and on. It has very broad multi-industry \nand bipartisan support.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is about transparency and certainty for \nour Nation's economy. If something is harming our ports, our \ndecisionmakers need information to address and mitigate that harm.\n  Now, I would have urged my colleagues to adopt this amendment, just \nas a broad, bipartisan group did so in the Senate, but I have been in \nclose conversation with staff of the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee, as well as the chairman and the ranking member. I would ask \nfor continued commitment on the part of the chairman to keep working on \nthis issue. It is very important and vital to the economy of the United \nStates.\n  With that commitment, Mr. Chairman, I withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Chair understands that amendment No. 28 will not be offered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 29 Offered by Mr. DeSantis\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 29 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of division A, add the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC. 1431. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INSOLVENCY OF THE HIGHWAY \n                   TRUST FUND AND RETURNING POWER TO STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Highway Trust Fund is nearing insolvency.\n       (2) It is critical for Congress to phase down the Federal \n     gas and diesel taxes and empower the States to tax and \n     regulate their highway and infrastructure projects.\n       (3) The Federal role and funding of surface transportation \n     should be refocused solely on Federal activities and empower \n     States with control and responsibility over their \n     transportation funding and spending decisions.\n       (4) The objective of the Federal highway program has been \n     to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system \n     that promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all \n     States.\n       (5) The Interstate System connecting all States is near \n     completion.\n       (6) Each State has the responsibility of providing an \n     efficient transportation network for the residents of the \n     State.\n       (7) Each State has means to build and operate a network of \n     transportation systems, including highways, that best serves \n     the needs of the State.\n       (8) Each State is best capable of determining the needs of \n     the State and acting on those needs.\n       (9) The Federal role in highway transportation has, over \n     time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels \n     used in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the \n     States based on the perceptions of the Federal Government on \n     what is best for the States.\n       (10) The Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuel \n     tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not \n     necessarily appropriate for individual States.\n       (11) The Federal distribution, review, and enforcement \n     process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive \n     activities.\n       (12) The Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 \n     States, regardless of the different circumstances of the \n     States, cause the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax \n     dollars of projects, programs, and activities that the States \n     would not otherwise undertake.\n       (13) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing \n     the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to \n     manage its own affairs.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary should provide a new policy blueprint to \n     govern the Federal role in transportation once existing and \n     prior financial obligations are met;\n       (2) this policy should return to the individual States \n     maximum discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for \n     all elements of the national surface transportation systems \n     that are not within the direct purview of the Federal \n     Government;\n       (3) this policy will preserve the Federal responsibility \n     for the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate \n     and Defense Highways and will preserve responsibility of the \n     Department of Transportation for design construction and \n     preservation of transportation facilities on Federal public \n     land, preserving responsibility of the Department of \n     Transportation for national programs of transportation \n     research and development and transportation safety; and\n       (4) this policy will preserve responsibility of the \n     Department of Transportation to eliminate, to the maximum \n     extent practicable, Federal obstacles to the ability of each \n     State to apply innovative solutions to the financing, design, \n     construction, operation, and preservation of Federal and \n     State transportation facilities with respect to \n     transportation activities carried out by States, local \n     governments, and the private sector.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. DeSantis) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, we are here today discussing how to meet \nthe country's important infrastructure needs, and I think what my \namendment does is offer a vision for a different approach in the \nfuture. I think it is an approach that is more accountable to \ntaxpayers, and I think it rests on governments closer to the people \nmaking more of our transportation decisions.\n  I don't think anyone is going to sit here and claim that the transit \nand highway system as it is done up here in Washington is being done \nwell. It is chronically underfunded. We are using all kinds of budget \ngimmicks in this bill. We are doing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nagain to, quote, unquote, pay for this. Somehow you are taking oil at \n$50 a barrel and you are projecting it to be sold for $85 a barrel. So \nwe know we have been through this a lot here.\n  I think part of the problem is, if you look at our infrastructure \nneeds, most of them are intrastate, not necessarily interstate. And \nwhile the interstate system is very important and it needs to be \nmaintained, expanded where appropriate, most of the needs that we have \nin a State like Florida can be done at the county level or at the State \nlevel.\n  I would note, Mr. Chairman, that since we have had the highway trust \nfund since 1956, Florida has paid a lot in taxes, and we received about \n88 cents on the dollar back. So I am trying to figure out why we would \nwant to perpetuate a system that is not fiscally sustainable and that \nputs more power in Washington.\n  Think about it. Most of your needs are done countywide, citywide, and \nstatewide, and yet people in a State like Florida will pay their gas \ntaxes. That will be shipped up to Washington;\n\n[[Page H7679]]\n\npeople will fight over it, politicians, lobbyists, and interest groups; \nand then the money that comes back is 88 cents on the dollar.\n  I would like to send the gas tax to Washington that is going to fund \nthe actual interstate system, but then leave a portion of the gas tax \nfor State legislatures to spend or for people in local governments to \nspend. I think you would be able to do it cheaper. I think it would be \nmore accountable to the taxpayers, and I think it would be better for \nmotorists and people who are using our transportation system.\n  So all this does, Mr. Chairman, it is not binding. I wish we could \nhave done something binding, but there are different budget rules. What \nit does is lay out a vision that we can do this in a way that rests on \ndecisions being made closer to the American people rather than putting \neverything in Washington, D.C.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, we want to go back to the good old days; that is, \nbefore Dwight David Eisenhower was President. Here we have what we had \nbefore when we didn't have a national highway program. This is the \nbrand-new Kansas turnpike. Oklahoma said: We will build ours. Uh-oh. We \nhave got financial problems.\n  They didn't.\n  So for a few years, this brand-new ribbon of concrete ended right \nhere. Kind of odd. This is Amos Schweitzer's farm field. They put up a \nbig wooden barrier. People crashed through it, and Amos towed them out \nof the field. He was a nice guy.\n  Until we had a national program where the Federal Government would \npartner with the States for something that was of national import, it \ndidn't happen. Let's go back to those good old days.\n  This is a new idea, came from Grover Norquist: We are going to \ndevolve the duty to the 50 States assembled and the territories, and \nsomehow they will magically coordinate this. Oh, by the way, if you \nhappen to be a coastal State with major ports--I think Florida has a \nfew of those--gee, you are going to have to pay for all of the costs of \ntransshipping the goods that flow into your State out to the other \nStates. That is your responsibility. You are Florida, raise the money \nto do it.\n  Oh, how are you going to do that?\n  I don't know. You can't raise taxes on the imports because that would \nbe a Federal responsibility, a different category.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is an idea whose time has not yet come, an idea \nwhose time passed a very long time ago. We need more investment in the \nnational system. Mr. Chairman, 140,000 bridges need repair or \nreplacement; 40 percent of the highway surface, the roadbeds need \nreplacement; $84 billion backlog in bringing our transit systems up to \na state of good repair, and that is not even dealing with a growing \npopulation, growing mobility, and the need for a national freight \nprogram. And we are just going to send it back to the States, and they \nwill magically somehow take care of it--poppycock.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, we would love for these interstate issues \nto be done at the Federal level. That is what the Federal Government is \nhere for, and that is the way it should be. But when you are talking \nabout purely local issues, there is not a reason to send the money up \nto Washington and then beg back for pennies on the dollar. That is not \nan efficient way to do it.\n  Yes, I think that we do have a responsibility to have an efficient \ninterstate system, but we also need to understand that Washington \nshouldn't be dictating what local communities do.\n  And, yes, in a State like Florida where we have a lot of this is \nintrastate, let's empower the States and let's empower the local \ncommunities. Just imagine if they were able to have a portion of that \ngas tax go directly to them. I think you would see great decisions \nmade.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I share many of the same conservative beliefs that my \ncolleague from Florida has. This town is littered with agencies that \ndon't belong here according to the Founding Fathers. Over time they \nhave grown up, and the Federal Government has taken that power.\n  But I do disagree with the gentleman from Florida on this issue. When \nit comes to transportation, the Constitution we have today, the \nbreaking point of the Articles of Confederation, one of the breaking \npoints, the biggest breaking point, was the transportation system. \nMaryland and Virginia couldn't come together on a treaty to navigate \nthe Potomac River, so they realized that if they couldn't connect this \nNation, then we would never be a nation. We would be 13 separate \nentities, 50 entities today. But the Founding Fathers came and wrote \nthe Constitution we know today.\n  Article I, section 8 talks about the role of the Federal Government, \nproviding for the common defense, regulating interstate commerce, and \nestablishing post roads. Those post roads today are the highways and \nthe byways of this Nation.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman. Washington shouldn't be \ndictating. This bill does more to send back power to the States, to let \nthe States drive the issues. But there is a Federal role, not to do it \nall, but to partner--to partner--with the States in building the \ninfrastructure system that we have today. What physically connects us \nis our highway system; it is our transportation system.\n  I would argue also, Mr. Chairman, the gentleman pointed out that \nFlorida--I agree, I know what the return on Florida is, but Florida has \nbenefited tremendously by two roads in particular: I-95 and I-75. If \nyou go to the east coast or the west coast of Florida, millions of \npeople are traveling from the Northeast and the Midwest down to Florida \nto spend their dollars, and many are relocating. If you go to the east \ncoast, there are many Pennsylvanians. So Florida has benefited \ntremendously by this system that we have today.\n  Again, I believe with this bill we are turning back to the States a \nlot of responsibility. I think this is a conservative bill based on \nthat, to let States--and also, to remind the gentleman and my \ncolleagues, I like to turn back things to the States that they actually \nask for. My phone is not ringing off the hook having Governors say, \n``Give us this back.''\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Finally, Mr. Chairman, Adam Smith said in ``The Wealth \nof Nations'' that government should do three things for their people: \nprovide them with security, preserve justice, and erect and maintain \ninfrastructure to promote commerce.\n  If you don't believe Bill Shuster, get out a copy of ``The Wealth of \nNations'' and read what Adam Smith said, the father of our economic \nsystem.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I urge everyone to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I would point out that under the current \nformulas, actually, and current spending levels, Florida is getting \nback $1.15 on the dollar. So, actually, under the gentleman's proposal, \ndevolving back to the States, doing away with the Federal revenues, \nboth gas tax and general fund revenues, would actually be a net loss to \nFlorida; but then I guess they would just have to raise their gas taxes \nby the 18.3 cents that is going to the Federal Government and a bit \nmore in order to make that up.\n  Again, we would lose the coordination among the States. The \npriorities of States bordering Florida may not match the priorities of \nFlorida in terms of access and egress to the State of Florida. So I \nthink we are well-served as a nation by having a coordinated Federal \nprogram and streamlined and efficient reforms.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to oppose this amendment.\n\n[[Page H7680]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n    Amendments En Bloc No. 1 Offered by Mr. Shuster of Pennsylvania\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER.

Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. \nDeFazio) each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, let me start off by first saying we lost a \nvaluable former member of this committee just recently. Howard Coble \npassed away. I just want to say that Howard was on this committee his \nentire time in Congress.\n  He was a very valued member of the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee. He was a champion of the Coast Guard, which he served, his \nbeloved Coast Guard, and he was always there fighting for them. He was \nan excellent Representative of the people of his district in North \nCarolina, and he was a great friend of mine and, I know, many, many \nMembers of this Congress.\n  Howard Coble will be missed greatly. I am just proud to say that on \nthe last Coast Guard reauthorization bill we were able to name it after \nHoward Coble, someone who deserved that honor.\n  So, again, it is with a heavy heart I say that I salute Howard Coble \nand say farewell, as I said, to a great friend and great Member of this \ninstitution.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise now to offer these amendments en bloc. They \nreflect priorities from both sides of the aisle. I thank all Members \nfor their cooperation in putting together this en bloc, and I urge all \nMembers to support it.\n  I would like, also, to take a moment at this time to thank all the \nMembers on both sides of the aisle that participated in this debate. I \nwant to thank the Speaker for putting us first on the floor for this \nnew open and transparent--I know some of my colleagues on the other \nside don't think it was open enough, but I think many of us on the \ncommittee, I don't want to speak for Mr. DeFazio, but it was an open \nprocess to me, and I think that is important.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  As Mr. Polis talked about earlier today, he had ideas. We were able \nto incorporate some of those, some of the Members on the other side, \nand some we certainly opposed. But it was the hard work and willingness \nto come together on this important piece of legislation. I think this \nmakes it stronger when we go to the Senate.\n  The STRR Act continues the Federal role in providing a strong \nnational transportation system, enables our country to remain \neconomically competitive, and helps ensure our quality of life. As we \njust talked about in the last amendment, this is a Federal \nresponsibility. The Founders would have wanted it this way. They \ncertainly probably had differences of opinion. But this role is \nsomething the Federal Government needs to be part of.\n  The STRR Act is a multiyear bill that provides that certainty for \nStates and local governments. This bill helps to improve our Nation's \ninfrastructure and maintains a strong commitment to safety, but it also \nprovides important reforms that will help us to continue to do the job \nmore effectively. Some of those reforms I mentioned earlier were \npushing back to the States, giving them the ability to have the \nflexibility, to make sure that they can drive this in their States to \nget these projects done more effectively and more efficiently, which \nwill save us all money.\n  I urge all Members to support this bill and the amendments en bloc.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Lipinski).\n\n[[Page H7683]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank both the ranking \nmember for yielding and for his support, and the chairman for his \nsupport, for two amendments that I have in this bloc.\n  One is a commonsense amendment exempting a narrow class of welders \nfrom the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations that I offered with \nMr. Davis of Illinois and a number of other Members. The other \namendment is a bipartisan compromise that I offered with Mr. Dold and \nMr. Nadler. It is an effort to clarify that transit agencies can \nutilize CMAQ and TIFIA funds to match the 50 percent funding in a New \nStart grant.\n  I appreciate the chairman's willingness to work with me on this issue \nand restore the Core Capacity and Small Starts projects Federal match \nlimit back to 80 percent and allow local agencies to flex other Federal \nfunds to these projects.\n  Without these funds, without these changes, local flexibility would \nbe greatly diminished and many projects would be delayed or canceled, \nincluding Chicago's red and purple line modernization.\n  This bill still restricts the use of the STP funds for the remainder \nof the match and codifies the New Starts grant amount at 50 percent. I \nstrongly disagree with these new restrictions and hope we can also work \non this in conference.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Nolan), a member of the committee.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, my amendment and the body of the amendments \nin this bloc are really all about public safety. Mine, in particular, \nis a bipartisan, commonsense solution to a very limited but seriously \ndangerous problem. In short, it will help make winter travel safer for \ntruckers, travelers, and pedestrians who live, work, and do business in \nand around the great seaport of Duluth, Minnesota.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Bill Shuster and Ranking Member Peter \nDeFazio for working with me on this, and the endless hours that you \nhave put forth in committee and here on the floor yesterday, today, \nlate into the night, and tomorrow for opening up and democratizing this \nprocess, making amendments like mine and others possible.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin (Ms. Moore) to describe her amendments which are included.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member.\n  I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for accepting my \namendments on the DBE prompt payment issue, and to allow teen driving \nsafety grants to be used to help fund school-based driver's education \nto help our young people meet the Graduated Driver Licensing \nrequirements.\n  I want to talk about the last of my amendments, requiring a GAO \nreport on the impact of MAP-21 changes on the ability of those who \npreviously benefited from transportation services under the Job Access \nand Reverse Commute program to get to work.\n  The report would examine whether services to low-income riders \ndeclined after MAP-21 was implemented, as well as efforts by the FTA, \nafter passage of MAP-21, to encourage public transportation agencies to \nmaintain and support these services so that low-income riders would \nallow them access to jobs, medical services, and other life \nnecessities.\n  MAP-21 ended the stand-alone JARC grant program. Instead, those \nactivities were added as eligible uses of funds under larger formula \ngrant programs. There was no requirement that transit agencies use any \nof their annual transit funding to provide services to meet the needs \nof low-income individuals trying to get to work--none.\n  My amendment would allow us to know what the real-world impact of \nthese changes are. Congress did not intend these changes to make it \nharder for low-income and TANF populations to use transportation to get \nto work. That just doesn't make sense. These hardships should not \noccur.\n  I hope that adoption of this amendment sends a message to transit \nagencies that they must continue to provide innovative services to \nensure that low-income people and the marginally employed are able to \nreach places of employment, educational opportunities, job training, \nchild care, medical appointments, and other life necessities.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Adams) to discuss her amendment.\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I rise today in support of this package of amendments that includes \nmy amendment, which clarifies minority groups to be targeted in human \nresources outreach efforts by the Department of Transportation. My \namendment would expand the bill's use of the term ``minority'' and \nspecify the inclusion of underrepresented minority groups.\n  Oftentimes, when policies are put in place to create diversity, they \nare not implemented with special attention to communities that are \nhistorically underrepresented. This is a special burden for \nunderrepresented minorities who have higher than average unemployment \nrates.\n  Furthermore, we all know investments in infrastructure means jobs for \nour constituents and opportunities for our businesses back home. As we \nwork to pass this legislation, I believe we must make a concerted \neffort to diversify the people who are able to take advantage of these \nopportunities.\n\n  I should note that particular areas of the transportation industry, \nsuch as public transportation service providers see better levels of \ndiversity, but it is time to expand these opportunities to include \nengineering, contracting, project development, and other components of \nthe process. Our transportation industry should reflect the diversity \nof our country at every level.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Graves).\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I just want to make note of an \nimportant provision that is included in the en bloc amendment package.\n  As you know, the transportation bill includes a new program that \naddresses significant roadways. It addresses some of the more expensive \nprojects, and it establishes a competitive grant program in excess of \nabout $740 million a year.\n  One of the important things we have to do is we have to provide \nguidance to the Department of the Transportation in regard to the \ncriteria they use, the metrics they use, in this competitive process.\n  An amendment in this bill includes the importance of strategic energy \nassets to ensure that roadways like LA 1 in south Louisiana are \nincluded.\n  After Hurricane Katrina, gasoline prices nationwide spiked about 75 \ncents a gallon. Following Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, gasoline \nprices spiked about $1.40 a gallon, which was the largest price spike \nsince the Arab oil embargo. So it is important that, as they go through \nand allocate these grants, that they are looking at factors that are \nvery important and have national consequences.\n  I want to thank the ranking member and the chairman and all the big \nfour for helping us on this.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, we are not quite at the end of this epic, \nbut I would like to take a moment.\n  First, I want to reflect on the chairman's brief eulogy for Howard \nCoble, who was a wonderful member of the committee; and Howard's \nembarked on his last great voyage. We all remember him warmly.\n  I would like to thank the chairman and the chair of the subcommittee \nfor the way in which we moved forward. This bill was a product of many, \nmany months of negotiation between Members and staff. I think we have a \ngood policy-based product here, so I want to thank the chairman and the \nchairman of the subcommittee. I want to thank my ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n  I want to thank my committee staff on my side: Helena Zyblikewycz, \nAuke Mahar-Piersma--we are blessed with interesting names on our side--\nAndrew\n\n[[Page H7684]]\n\nOkuyiga, Ben Lockshin, Jennifer Homendy, Ryan Seiger, Alexa Old Crow. \nOf course, my chief of staff Kathy Dedrick. We have had much mention of \nthe last time we did one of these bills. Kathy staffed me when we did \nthe last time long-term bill, which was quite a few years ago. Jen \nGilbreath, Jaime Harrell, and Luke Strimer.\n  On the Republican side, I particularly want to thank Chris Bertram \nand Murphie Barrett and all the other Republican staff for their \nfabulous work.\n  I won't say all the meetings were warm and fuzzy, but we worked stuff \nout in the end. I think we got a good product. I think going through \nthis legislative process was a demonstration that House Members can \nindividually be relevant, offer their ideas. They might be rejected, \nthey might be accepted, but I think this was a very good process.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Yoder). The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 6 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, this has been 3 years in the making. When \nI first became chairman just about 3 years ago to almost the date \ntoday, one of my top priorities was to pass a multiyear surface \ntransportation bill. I have had some people who lament and say: Oh, you \nhave been on the floor long; oh, you have had to go through these \ndifferent fights. But I can tell you, it has all been pleasurable. It \nis exciting that we finally are getting this thing to send here on the \nfloor and get it into conference.\n  I couldn't do it without the help and advice of a great staff on the \nRepublican side. I also want to thank the Democratic staff. I know both \nstaffs have spent some long nights and some long weekends trying to get \nthis thing all worked out, and they have done a great job of it. I \nthank each and every one of them on both sides of the aisle for their \nhard work.\n  I want to thank all the members on the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee on both sides for their valuable input and, \nagain, their hard work in putting this thing together to bring it to \nthe floor. I want to thank Ranking Member DeFazio, Ranking Member \nNorton, and the chair of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, Mr. \nGraves, for their work.\n  Peter DeFazio has been a good friend and able opponent at times. He \nhas been here a long time. He is bright; he is tough; he is passionate; \nbut at the end of the day, we are able to come together on a lot of \nthese issues and work it out, so I appreciate Mr. DeFazio's efforts.\n  And finally, let me say, for the first time in my 15 years of \nCongress that I have participated in a Transportation and \nInfrastructure debate on the floor, that my father's name has not been \nmentioned one time. So let me be the first to mention my father, Bud \nShuster. I am not sure if he is watching at home. If he is, he is \ntaking notes and will tell me things I said right and things I could \nhave probably said better. But I just want to thank him for the \nguidance he has given me throughout my life, for the valuable advice he \nhas offered to me at times when I have asked and many times when I have \nnot asked. And, again, if he is watching tonight, I am sure he is \nwriting down some things that he is going to give me some pointers on. \nBut I want to thank my father, Bud Shuster, again, for his great \nsupport over the years.\n  I am looking forward to getting to conference and getting this thing \ndone because I think it is important to the American people that we \nhave a long-term highway bill. This has been an issue that people say \nit is great, there is a lot of bipartisan support--and there is--but \nthese are issues that Republicans, Democrats, and Americans care about, \nour infrastructure, and want to get to work without delays and want to \nget products to market and want to get the raw materials to the \nfactories that keep us competitive in the world. We are in a world \nmarket that we have to remain competitive, and transportation is one of \nthose vital links that will keep us there.\n  With that, again, I thank everybody for their hard work. Staff, \nagain, thank you.\n  With that, I urge all Members to support the final bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to \nadd the Newberg Dundee Bypass Route as a High Priority Corridor and I \nwould like to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for working with me \nto bring it forward. Let me be clear--there is no cost to this \namendment--it merely raises the prominence and importance of the \nbypass. The construction of the bypass is underway and has great \npotential to ease congestion, promote freight mobility, and provide \nimportant multi-modal connections for residents and visitors in the \nbroader Yamhill County region. The success of Oregon's wine and \nagricultural industries has increased freight traffic in the region. \nThe bypass seeks to address the difficulties associated with \ntransportation of goods and services and enhance the recovery of \nYamhill County's economically distressed communities. The development \nof this corridor has wide support in the region, including from the \nstate, local and tribal governments, and surrounding communities. I \ninclude a letter from Oregon's Department of Transportation in support \nof this amendment for the Record.\n  Further, this project is of significant importance because of its \nlocation in the Cascadia Subduction Zone. We know that the question is \nnot if, but when, an earthquake and tsunami will hit. Preparing our \nregion is a priority for Oregonians and will save countless lives and \nfederal funds. This road serves as an evacuation route for the central \ncoast and is being built to withstand a 9.0 earthquake. I thank \nChairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for their support of my \namendment.\n\n                                     Department of Transportation,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Director,\n\n                                      Salem, OR, October 30, 2015.\n     Re: Support for amendment to designate the OR 99W Newberg-\n         Dundee bypass route between Newberg, OR, and Dayton, OR \n         as a new High Priority Corridor on the National Highway \n         System.\n\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Peter DeFazio,\n     Ranking Member, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio: I write \n     today in support of an amendment to H.R. 22 offered by \n     Representative Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon.\n       Representative Bonamici has filed an amendment with the \n     Rules Committee seeking to amend Section 1405 of the bill by \n     adding the OR 99W Newberg-Dundee Bypass route between \n     Newberg, OR, and Dayton, OR as a new High Priority Corridor \n     on the National Highway System.\n       The Newberg-Dundee Bypass project is one of many key \n     regional transportation corridors in Oregon. The Bypass \n     project is important to both regional freight movement and \n     congestion relief. In addition, the Oregon Department of \n     Transportation's (ODOT) Safety Priority Index System for 2014 \n     identified six sites on OR 99W that are in the top 10 percent \n     of crash sites statewide based on frequency and severity of \n     incidents. In the event of a major natural disaster such as a \n     Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake and tsunami, this \n     corridor would serve as an emergency evacuation and relief \n     route for the central Oregon Coast. The first phase of the \n     project, which is currently under construction, is being \n     built to withstand a 9.0 Cascadia subduction zone earthquake \n     to ensure this critical lifeline will remain operational in \n     such an event. For these reasons, ODOT supports the inclusion \n     of the Newberg-Dundee Bypass on the list of High Priority \n     Corridors on the National Highway System.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Matthew L. Garrett,\n                                                         Director.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Young of Iowa). The question is on the \namendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nShuster).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 57 Offered by Ms. Herrera Beutler\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 57 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 289, strike lines 11 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(i) $352,950,000 for fiscal year 2016;\n       ``(ii) $462,950,000 for fiscal year 2017;\n       ``(iii) $468,288,000 for fiscal year 2018;\n       ``(iv) $473,653,500 for fiscal year 2019;\n       ``(v) $479,231,500 for fiscal year 2020; and\n       ``(vi) $484,816,000 for fiscal year 2021;''.\n       Beginning on page 289, strike line 21 and all that follows \n     through page 290, line 8, and insert the following:\n       ``(i) $262,950,000 for fiscal year 2016;\n       ``(ii) $262,950,000 for fiscal year 2017;\n       ``(iii) $268,288,000 for fiscal year 2018;\n\n[[Page H7685]]\n\n       ``(iv) $273,653,500 for fiscal year 2019;\n       ``(v) $279,231,500 for fiscal year 2020; and\n       ``(vi) $284,816,000 for fiscal year 2021.''.\n       At the end of title III of division A, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INCREASE SUPPORT FOR GROWING STATES.\n\n       Section 5340 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) Apportionment.--Of the amounts made available for \n     each fiscal year under section 5338(b)(2)(M), the Secretary \n     shall apportion 100 percent to States and urbanized areas in \n     accordance with subsection (c).''; and\n       (2) by striking subsection (d).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentlewoman \nfrom Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.\n  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chairman, over 50 percent of all transit \nriders in the U.S. travel on buses, but only 10 percent of our transit \nfunding actually goes to buses. I will say that again. Over half of the \npeople in this country who use public transportation take buses to get \nto work, to the grocery store, to visit family; yet the Federal \nGovernment dedicates less than 10 percent of its transit funds \nspecifically to buses and to bus facilities.\n  We are selling communities short, communities like my home in \nsouthwest Washington, but we have an opportunity to rectify the \nsituation, Mr. Chairman.\n  While overall transit funding has been steadily increasing, this bill \nfunds buses in 2016 at, roughly, half of the 2012 levels--that is, Mr. \nChairman, unless you happen to represent one of seven States for which \nthis bill sets aside, roughly, an additional $272 million a year.\n  While all 50 States can compete for funds through the nationwide \nCompetitive Bus Grant program, which is funded at $90 million in 2016 \nand $200 million each year after, a select few of the northeastern \nStates get an additional $272 million pot to draw from. That is right, \nMr. Chairman.\n  These high-density States--Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New \nJersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware--have a special pot of \nmoney set aside for them that averages $90 million more a year than the \nnationwide pot that all 50 States compete for. Oh, and those seven \nStates still get to compete for the nationwide pot.\n  It is an issue of fairness, Mr. Chairman. The idea that seven States \nhave available to them more money than all 50 States combined isn't \nfair to the communities in my State or in yours or in the other 43 \nStates.\n  My amendment would simply move the funding from the seven-State set-\naside program into the Competitive Bus Grant program and allow all \nStates to compete for these much-needed resources.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the \namendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington, a former member \nof the committee.\n  Let me be clear. I agree we should be further increasing the funds \navailable for bus procurement. MAP-21 cut bus funding in half--a \ndevastating cut to many smaller and mid-sized transit agencies, \nincluding in my district.\n  We tried to reverse these cuts as much as we could in this bill, but \nwith the severely limited funding that was mentioned earlier today, \nthere was only so much we could do. In total, we increased the bus \nformula and competitive grant program by 40 percent.\n  I would also like to mention the bus procurement reforms in the bill \nthat are designed to lower the cost of bus purchases. We provided \nseveral different mechanisms that provide bulk buying power for transit \nagencies. Buses are expensive, and larger purchases will help them to \nget lower costs.\n  This amendment will further increase the bus procurement programs and \nshift money from the high-density-States formula that benefits seven \nnortheastern States. The high-density-States formula is actually an old \nSenate provision, carefully drafted by the esteemed members of the \nSenate's Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee sometime ago and \nis of great benefit to those seven States.\n  I am very sympathetic to the amendment, but I am obligated, \nreluctantly and tepidly, to oppose it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Turner).\n  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this earmark, as I \nam a cosponsor and am in support of this amendment, No. 57, offered by \nMs. Herrera Beutler.\n  This has been interesting in the debate because it has been \nabsolutely clarified on both sides that we see this as an earmark. \nBasically, seven States take from this bill a disproportionate amount \nbased on a formula that declares them high-density States: New York, \nNew Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island, and \nDelaware.\n  If you do not live in one of these States and if you are a Member of \nCongress, you should vote for this amendment because declaring them \nhigh-density States is a meaningless designation. For example, Chicago, \nLos Angeles, and many, many urban areas throughout our country are high \ndensity and deserve to be able to participate in this fund, but they \ncannot because they are not located in one of these States that has \nlargely been, as the ranking member has indicated, a Senate formula \nset-aside.\n  Our Founding Fathers, when they came together to create the system of \nthe House and the Senate, did so so that we would have equality, a \nbalance between each of the States and their populations. This is not a \nbalance when you have a set-aside for seven States.\n  Once again, I would call on all of my fellow colleagues who do not \nlive in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, \nRhode Island, and Delaware to vote for this amendment by Ms. Herrera \nBeutler. She has identified that this is an earmark for these States \nand that it robs money from other States that need assistance with \npublic transportation.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mr. TURNER. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment because \nit does correct an injustice.\n  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chairman, as was well said, 371 Members of \nthe House represent people in States that will benefit from this \namendment. By voting ``yes'' for this amendment, 371 Members will have \nan opportunity to increase access to important transit funds in their \ndistricts without raising spending levels in the bill.\n  Even those Members in these high-density States are not losing access \nto the funds. The amendment allows all 50 States to compete fairly for \ngrant funding based on the needs of the area and the merits of the \nproject.\n  How can anybody be against this? What is wrong with this?\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would say that a great \nformer Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, said that ``all politics is \nlocal.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 58 Offered by Mr. Chabot\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 58 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title I of division A, add the \n     following new section:\n\n     SECTION 1431. INCREASING CERTAIN PENALTIES RELATING TO \n                   COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY.\n\n       (a) Civil Penalty.--Section 521(b)(2)(A) of title 49, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking ``$2,500'' and \n     inserting ``$5,000''.\n       (b) Criminal Penalty.--Section 521(b)(6)(A) of title 49, \n     United States Code, is\n\n[[Page H7686]]\n\n     amended by striking ``$2,500'' and inserting ``$5,000''.\n       (c) Disqualifications.--\n       (1) First violation or committing felony.--Section \n     31310(b)(1) of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (A) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``; or'' and inserting \n     a semicolon;\n       (B) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; or''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(F) determined by the Secretary to have operated a \n     commercial motor vehicle that the individual knew or \n     reasonably should have known had a defect that resulted in a \n     fatality.''.\n       (2) Second and multiple violations.--Section 31310(c)(1) of \n     title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (A) in subparagraph (E), by striking ``; or'' and inserting \n     a semicolon;\n       (B) by redesignating subparagraph (F) as subparagraph (G);\n       (C) in subparagraph (G) (as so redesignated)--\n       (i) by striking ``(E)'' and inserting ``(F)''; and\n       (ii) by inserting ``, operations,'' after ``violations''; \n     and\n       (D) by inserting after subparagraph (E) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(F) determined by the Secretary to have more than once \n     operated a commercial motor vehicle that the individual knew \n     or reasonably should have known had a defect that resulted in \n     a fatality; or''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Chabot) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I will be brief.\n  All of us here have the honor to serve in the people's House, and we \nare here to serve our constituents--the people who send us here from \nall over the country--and also to serve in the best interests of our \ngreat Nation.\n  I had a constituent who approached me. I happened to be touring the \nbusiness at which he works, and he told me something that affected me \ngreatly.\n  His son was just days before his 23rd birthday. He was a student at \nthe University of Cincinnati. He was coming down Interstate 75 in a \nminivan and was minding his own business. I don't know what he was \nthinking about, but he had his whole future ahead of him.\n  But a completely avoidable accident occurred. A wheel that was so \nrusted broke free from a big rig, and it crossed the median. It struck \nthe vehicle he was in, and it killed him immediately, a couple of days \nbefore his 23rd birthday.\n  It had been a couple of years, but his father was still very \nemotional about this, understandably so.\n  We looked into this situation. We talked with a number of our \ncolleagues and did a lot of research on it and worked with the American \nTrucking Association and with America's Independent Truckers' \nAssociation as well. We came up with an amendment to this particular \nbill that we are discussing here this evening, the transportation bill.\n  What the amendment would do, essentially, is stiffen the penalties \nfor a driver who knowingly operates a commercial vehicle that has a \nserious defect that results in a fatal crash.\n  Clearly, what we are trying to do is to make the public more safe and \nto deal with a family that has been tragically changed forever. They \nlost one of the most important members of that particular family. We \nare trying to do this in a responsible way.\n  The trucking industry in this country, for the most part, is very \nsafety conscious, and their rate of fatalities has come down. I commend \nthem greatly for what they are trying to do, but there is a hole in the \nsystem right now.\n  In this particular situation, there was a rusted thing that shouldn't \nhave been on the road. This type of thing doesn't happen all that \noften, but it happened this time, and it killed my constituent's son.\n  We have discussed this with the chairman and with staff. It is my \nunderstanding that the chairman is willing to work with us on \naddressing this issue of trying to make the American public safer and \nis willing to work with our distinguished folks on the minority side as \nwell.\n  With that understanding, I am willing to withdraw my amendment here \nthis evening and continue to work with them through the process to \nhopefully address this issue in a way that will receive support on both \nsides of the aisle so that we can pass this into law and make the \npublic safer. It will allow this particular family, who was affected so \ntragically in this instance, to know that they have done something to \nhonor their son.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster).\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to work with the gentleman on \nthe issue. I oppose the amendment, but I want to continue talking with \nthe gentleman and working with him.\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nam not in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I certainly want to work with the \ngentleman. I mean, this is a story that tugs at you. The gentleman \nbrings before us an important issue. I think there is a way to get at \nthis; so, I would love to work with the gentleman as we go to \nconference and see what we can do.\n  With the indulgence of the House, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Shuster and Mr. DeFazio as well for working \nwith me and for working with the entire committee. The Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee does work together in a bipartisan \nfashion, and the House does work.\n  On the other hand and in the same vein, I had the pleasure of knowing \nHoward Coble for my entire time I have been in Congress. I was his \nranking member on Judiciary, and he was my ranking member on Judiciary.\n  We had a great relationship. He was one of the finest gentlemen I \nhave ever known. He was a scholar. He was a gentleman. He loved North \nCarolina. He loved this House. He will be missed. He was an example of \nthe way people can work together to make progress in the United States \nCongress. I was honored to know him.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I would also like to share in the \ngentleman's comments about our colleague, Howard Coble of North \nCarolina.\n  He was truly a wonderful part of this distinguished institution. I \nserved on the Judiciary Committee for the better part of 20 years with \nHoward Coble, and we all looked up to him. He was kind of one of a \nkind, and I say that in the most honorable way.\n  He was one we looked to. He had a sense of humor that went to your \nheart. He was just a great guy. He will be truly missed not only by his \nconstituents, but by this House that he loved for so many years.\n  On my amendment, I have heard both the chairman and our friends on \nthe minority side indicate they are willing to work with us on this \namendment.\n  Mr. CHABOT.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. Perry. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1022, strike lines 5 through 7 and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) In General.--Section 2(b)(1)(E)(v) of the Export-Import \n     Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635(b)(1)(E)(v)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``20 percent of such authority for each \n     fiscal year'' and inserting ``25 percent of such authority \n     for fiscal year 2016, 30 percent of such authority for fiscal \n     year 2017, 35 percent of such authority for fiscal year 2018, \n     and 40 percent of such authority for each fiscal year \n     thereafter''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following: ``If the Bank fails \n     to comply with the 2nd preceding sentence with respect to a \n     fiscal year, the Bank may not approve the provision of a \n     guarantee, insurance, or credit, or any combination thereof \n     benefitting a single person, in an amount exceeding \n     $100,000,000 until the beginning of the 2nd succeeding fiscal \n     year.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Chair, the Export-Import Bank has a portfolio annually \nsomewhere to the tune of $120 billion, I think under the new proposal; \n$130 billion. Fifty-one percent, Madam Chairman--fully 51 percent--goes \nto 10 companies in our country--$120 billion. Isn't that fantastic?\n  Whether you support or oppose the Ex-Im, everyone can welcome the \nfact that the reauthorization we are considering today raises the \nBank's small-business target 25 percent. Republicans and Democrats in \nboth the House and the Senate have called on the Bank to focus on \nsmall-business needs more effectively.\n  This amendment keeps that 25 percent small-business target in the \nunderlying bill. It doesn't change that, but it would then raise the \ntarget by 5 percent per year through the reauthorization period.\n  Madam Chair, $120 billion a year, $130 billion a year, 51 percent \ngoes to 10 companies in the United States. You think: Wouldn't it be \ngreat if the town that I represent, the towns that Members in this \nHouse represent, could be one of those 10 companies? It is not to \ndisparage any of those 10 companies. We are happy that they are in the \nUnited States, and we are happy that they are profitable.\n  But these small businesses that are trying to get a leg up, that want \nto employ their neighbors and that want to enrich their communities \nwould like a shot as well. But they don't have legions of lobbyists, \nand they don't have big staffs to go to the Ex-Im Bank and plead their \ncase.\n  What that results in is 98 percent of small businesses, 98 percent of \ntrade across our country, is conducted without any help at all of the \nExport-Import Bank. Wouldn't it be great if we could remedy that? And \nwouldn't it be easy if we could remedy that?\n  Madam Chairman, that is what the amendment that I propose does. With \nthis amendment, Ex-Im still has the flexibility to devote most of its \nassistance--now 51 percent to 10 companies in the country--to large \nbusinesses. The big ones will still have the same access to Ex-Im. All \nthis does is requires the Ex-Im to take small businesses more \nseriously.\n  Yes, it is a little more work. They don't have the lobbyists and the \nstaff that all these big, multinational companies do. But isn't it \nworth it in our small towns to help them and to assist them?\n  We know the Bank is more than capable of doing this. In fiscal year \n2014, 25 percent of its authorization went to small businesses. So the \nBank easily met its target. But in the 3 years prior to that, Ex-Im \nignored--literally ignored--the small-business target that Congress \nenacted and required of them.\n  Under this amendment, Ex-Im has to ensure that it meets its small-\nbusiness target. It has to. If we want to help small businesses like \nthe one in your town, the one in the towns that you represent, we have \nto make sure that it does that. We need to keep an ambitious target \nthat Ex-Im can meet and encourage the Bank to reach it.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition \nto this amendment, and I will be opposing all amendments to this \nportion of the highway bill.\n  Without a doubt, these amendments reflect the latest in a string of \ntactics by opponents of the Export-Import\n\n[[Page H7693]]\n\nBank to delay and block any reauthorization of the Bank from moving \nforward. This amendment and other anti-Ex-Im amendments we will soon \nconsider cannot reasonably be viewed as a constructive effort.\n  As we know well, small businesses unquestionably are central to the \nhealth of our economy. Fortunately, before extremists, ones on the \nopposite side of the aisle, shut down the Ex-Im Bank. Many small \nbusinesses were already directly supported by the programs offered by \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  In fact, in fiscal year 2014, out of over 3,700 authorizations, more \nthan 3,300, or nearly 90 percent, directly served U.S. small \nbusinesses. Of the remaining 10 percent, many of these authorizations \nserved companies that support vast U.S. supply chains, including in my \ndistrict.\n  The effort to use small businesses as a pawn in the fight to kill the \nEx-Im Bank should be rejected. This amendment must be rejected.\n  Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Madam Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney), my good friend.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. I thank the gentleman. I agree with most of what the \nranking member on Financial Services just said with the exception of \nthe conclusion. Everything that the Export-Import Bank does for small \nbusinesses actually is very productive.\n  So here is the question: Why isn't the Export-Import Bank meeting its \nsmall-business requirement? Why hasn't it met it? For the last 3 years, \nit has not met its statutory requirement.\n  One of the things we have not talked about yet, Madam Chairman, is \nthat the amendment also puts a penalty on the Bank for not meeting that \ntarget. Right now it is the law that the Bank has to provide a certain \nlevel of services to the small-business community. It has failed to do \nthat. As is so often the case, there is no penalty. This amendment \nwould add the penalty.\n  It helps small business, it expands the Export-Import Bank's small-\nbusiness presence, and it actually puts some teeth in the law for a \nchange. For that reason, I hope that we can support this amendment.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman. I am sorry I \ndon't have more time.\n  Madam Chairman, this is a bill about jobs. The amendment is about \nkilling jobs, as he wants to kill the Bank, the gentleman who sponsored \nthis amendment. That is all it is. Every one of these amendments will \nundermine the Export-Import Bank that got 313 votes on this floor.\n  The gentleman mentions five businesses. What he didn't mention is the \nthousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs that they \ncreate and maintain. That is what we are talking about: jobs for \naverage Americans. Whether they work for large, medium, or small \nbusinesses, we are talking about jobs for Americans.\n  Here you are at the last minute trying to kill it. You had 2\\1/2\\ \nyears to offer your amendments. You had 2\\1/2\\ years to bring this bill \nto the floor. You chose not to because the minority was going to kill \nthis bill. I told your majority leader over and over and over again it \nhad the majority of your party, and you refused to bring it to this \nfloor.\n  Tonight is the time to say the majority rules, the 313 will rule. \nReject every one of these amendments. Let's create jobs with the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would remind Members that their remarks \nare to be directed to the Chair and not to other Members.\n  Mr. PERRY. Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck) who serves on the Financial \nServices Committee and who has worked tirelessly for this \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Madam Chair, let's begin with the facts. The \nfacts are this: every single killing amendment being offered tonight \nis, in fact, being sponsored by somebody who voted against passage of \nthe Ex-Im. They don't want to improve the Ex-Im. They want to kill the \nEx-Im.\n  The fact is the 20 percent target in current law, with all due \nrespect to one of the previous speakers, is not a requirement. It is a \ntarget. Stop saying requirement. Words matter. That is misleading, and \nit is wrong. The fact is nearly 90 percent--90 percent--of all \ntransactions of the Ex-Im go to small businesses.\n  I can't help it that Jenny's Pickles, a jar thereof, sells for \ninfinitely less than a Boeing airplane or that Manhasset music stands \nsell for infinitely less. The fact of the matter is 90 percent of their \ntransactions go to small businesses.\n  The fact of the matter is Economics 101. Please hear me sometime: the \nBoeing Airplane Company has 14,800 businesses in its supply chain and \n6- to 8,000 are small. Reject the amendment.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher), who has been an absolute \nleader on this issue.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Madam Chair, one more time let me talk about the facts. The facts \nare, as the gentleman from Washington just stated, 90 percent of the \nBank's transactions go to small businesses, 3,340 transactions.\n  The facts are that section 201 in our reform bill that is actually \nreforming the Export-Import Bank takes the target--not the requirement, \nbut the target--from 20 percent to 25 percent.\n  What we need to make sure that we are focused on here tonight is not \npunishing people that want to grow their businesses or not trying to \nput a cap on people that want to create jobs.\n  Again, I am from a little place called Frog Jump. This is not about \nBoeing, and this is not about GE. This is about jobs all over this \ncountry that don't cost the taxpayer one penny--not one penny--Madam \nChairman.\n  This is just about killing the Export-Import Bank and killing jobs. \nIt breaks my heart, but we must defeat these amendments. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. PERRY. Madam Chair, the fact is that all the reforms that the \nkind gentleman just spoke of are not going to happen. None of that is \nhappening. The Senate threw that in the trash.\n  So what we have is an Export-Import Bank that has refused to comply \nwith the law over and over again. The fact also remains that nobody \nhere is trying to kill the Export-Import Bank. We aren't. This is the \nprocess by which we make it better.\n  Whether or not you sell a jar of pickles or whether you sell an \nairplane, $120 billion, 51 percent of it goes to 10 companies. You \nfigure it out. You figure out what that looks like to you. To me, it \nlooks like cronyism. That is what it looks like to me.\n  I come from York, Pennsylvania, and instead of creating thousands and \nthousands and thousands of jobs, we would like to create tens and \nhundreds of thousands of jobs by requiring the Bank that is encumbering \nthe United States taxpayer to work with small businesses, the \nbusinesses in our town, instead of just going to the big businesses in \nthis country.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chairman, I would simply say \nto the gentleman from Pennsylvania you figure it out. Evidently, you \ndon't know anything about what Ex-Im does and the jobs that it \nprovides.\n  Madam Chairman, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from Oklahoma \n(Mr. Lucas), a leader with courage.\n  Mr. LUCAS. Madam Chair, my colleagues, I would urge you to reject \nthis amendment and all the amendments.\n  This process should have happened 6 months ago. It should have \nhappened in committee. It should have happened in regular order. But we \nweren't allowed to do that. We have been forced into this position.\n  Reject this amendment, reject these amendments, and then let's begin \nthe process of real reform.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n\n[[Page H7694]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Mulvaney\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1032, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. RESTRICT BANK LENDING TO SERVING AS COUNTERVAILING \n                   LENDER.\n\n       (a) Ban on Providing Credit Assistance for Transaction That \n     Does Not Meet Foreign Competition.--Section 2(b) of the \n     Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635(b)) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(14) Prohibition on Assistance for Transaction That Does \n     Not Meet Foreign Competition.--The Bank shall not guarantee, \n     insure, or extend (or participate in the extension of) credit \n     involving any transaction, with respect to which credit \n     assistance from the Bank is first sought after the effective \n     date of this paragraph, that does not meet competition from a \n     foreign, officially sponsored, export credit agency.''.\n       (b) Annual Certification That Each Provision by the Bank of \n     Credit Assistance Is Made to Meet Foreign Competition.--\n     Section 8(h) of such Act (12 U.S.C. 535g(h)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(h) Certification That Each Provision of Credit \n     Assistance Is Made to Meet Foreign Competition.--The Bank \n     shall include in its annual report to the Congress under \n     subsection (a) a certification that--\n       ``(1) each provision by the Bank of a loan, guarantee, or \n     insurance, with respect to which credit assistance from the \n     Bank was first sought after the effective date of this \n     subsection, in the period covered by the report was made to \n     meet competition from a foreign, officially sponsored, export \n     credit agency; and\n       ``(2) no such provision was made to fill market gaps that \n     the private sector is not willing or able to meet.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Madam Chair, a parliamentary inquiry before you start \nmy time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina will state his \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Madam Chair, you state No. 2. Is that Mulvaney No. 2 or \nMulvaney No. 1?\n  The Acting CHAIR. Amendment No. 2 printed in part B of House Report \n114-326.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I have heard a couple arguments already--I guess we heard them \nbefore, Madam Chair--about how the place to do this was in committee. \nFine. That could be. It doesn't make the amendments bad. It doesn't \nmean the principles contained in here are wrong. We didn't get a chance \nto do that in committee. You can blame whoever you want to for that. \nBut the point of the matter is, this is where we are going to take up \nthe amendments, and the fact we didn't do it 6 months ago does not make \na good amendment a bad amendment. The amendments will stand on their \nown merit, as this one will, Madam Chair.\n  What this one does is fairly simple. One of the things we have heard \nfor the last several years about the Bank is that we need the Bank in \norder to meet foreign competition, that 1,700 other countries have \nexport credit facilities, and if we don't have one of our own, we will \nunilaterally disarm and not be able to compete in the global \nmarketplace.\n  I happen to disagree with that. I happen to have some faith that \nAmerican goods are good enough to compete overseas without the \ngovernment subsidy. But that is fine. Let's take that for sake of \ndiscussion and say, all right, we don't want to unilaterally disarm. \nWhat this amendment does is makes sure that we don't.\n  What this amendment does is simply says, look, if you want to use the \nExport-Import Bank, you have to be able to establish that you are \nactually competing with a foreign export credit facility. Fairly \nsimple. It goes to the heart of what so many people say is why we have \nthe Bank. So why not simply say, all right, look, we will have this \nthing until we can convince other countries to get out of this \nbusiness, which we should be doing and, by the way, are obligated by \nlaw to be doing--not by target, but by law.\n  We have had the responsibility to do that, Mr. Chairman, since 2012, \nyet this administration has refused to do that. But until we get a \nchance to enforce the law and actually get other countries to disarm, \nlet's go ahead and not unilaterally disarm, and let's make sure, in \norder to use the Export-Import Bank, you have to be meeting specific \nand identifiable competition from other export credit facilities.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  This amendment, offered by one of the leading opponents of the Ex-Im \nBank, would effectively chop the Ex-Im Bank's mission in half by \neliminating the Bank's role in providing finance to fill market gaps \nthat the private sector is unable to meet. This would overwhelmingly \nharm the small businesses that use the Bank and that often have the \nhardest time securing the financing they need through the private \nsector alone.\n  For example, when U.S. small businesses are seeking to export, \ncommercial banks often refuse to accept foreign receivables as \ncollateral for a loan without an Ex-Im guarantee. Without Ex-Im, these \nsmall businesses would be unable to extend terms to foreign buyers and \nwould have to ask for cash in advance. In these cases, sales would \nalmost always go to a firm from another country that can count on the \nbacking of its own official export credit agency.\n  I urge all Members to oppose this amendment, which would undermine \nthe Bank's important role.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, how much time did each of us consume in our \nopening statements?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina consumed 2 \nminutes. The gentlewoman from California consumed 1 minute.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nto the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, two quick points.\n  First, let's not quite leave this issue of the irregular order and \nnature of what we are doing. Let's all remember one thing. Not only are \nall the people who are advancing amendments here today opponents of the \nEx-Im and want to kill it, but they also, many of them, sat in the \ncommittee and voted against an amendment to the budget views and \nestimates that suggested that reauthorization of the Ex-Im ought to be \nsubjected to regular order. They have already made their position \nclear: no regular order. They not only don't want regular order, they \ndon't want the Ex-Im.\n  No, it is not 700 and however many countries that have export credit \nauthority; it is only 59. It is every other developed nation on the \nface of the Earth. The Chinese have not one, but four, export credit \nauthorities. In the last 2 years, they financed as much as our Export-\nImport Bank has in its 81-year history.\n  Let me leave you with this one thought: I know a lot of you on that \nside of the aisle read The Wall Street Journal. I hope you saw the \nBusiness section 2 days ago. The headline is, ``China Rolls Out First \nLarge Passenger Jet''--The Wall Street Journal.\n  I warned here about a year ago they were developing the C919. There \nit is. There is the picture. They also indicate in here that they have \nthe C929, which is a double aisle, wide-body jet airplane under \ndevelopment.\n  Do you really want to strike this death blow to the heart of \nAmerica's manufacturing business? Please vote ``no'' on this and all \namendments.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n\n[[Page H7695]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nto the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas).\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, I think it is worth once again considering \nhow we got to this point. Considering that under regular committee \norder, we should have taken this bill up 6 months ago. Three months \nago, many of us went from the point of pleading to demanding, pressing \nharder and harder to try to bring this to the focus. Ultimately, that \nwas not the option, and we were obligated to use a rather old but \nimportant rule in order to bring this legislation to the floor.\n\n  As some of my colleagues have noted, a supermajority of the House \nvoted for it--313 Members. A majority of the Republican Conference, a \nmajority of the majority voted for it. Yet now we are at a point where \nwe are rebattling all of these amendments.\n  If you can't win by playing by the rules, then how do you win in this \nplace? If we defeat all of these amendments, will things mysteriously \nhappen in the next process and we will have to fight that off? That is \nwhy I tell my colleagues: Play by the rules. Remember what we \naccomplished last week? Understand the real purpose of these \namendments. If it was to perfect a bill, then the authors would have \nbeen working with us 6 months ago or 3 months ago or a few weeks ago, \nbut that wasn't the option provided. So now, a second time, we have to \nfight our way all the way through these issues.\n  Please demonstrate that you care about economic competitiveness in \nthis country. Please demonstrate that you care about workers in this \ncountry. Reject all of these amendments. Let's move the process over. \nLet's finish this for real.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Schweikert).\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, look, I stand behind the microphone \nright now, hopefully helping many of you who support the Ex-Im Bank, to \nhelp you stand behind your previous rhetoric.\n  If I remember, as you said, the older--was it archaic?--process that \nwas brought last week, I noticed the rule you brought allowed me to \nbring my reform amendment because you were reforming the--oh, that is \nright. You didn't. You did not allow us to have that voice on those \nreforms. It was not a process. So now guess what is going on? We happen \nto have regular order, an opportunity to walk up and say we have some \nlittle ideas that we believe make the institution better.\n  To my friend over on the left, okay, 59 credit enhancement, surety \nenhancement organizations. All this amendment does is it says, if you \nare competing against someone who is using another country's credit \nenhancement, you get to use ours. Isn't that what you are asking for \nreformwise?\n  If you want to level the playing field, what a great idea. If they \nare using it, we get to use it. If they are not using it, we don't have \nto. That is reform, and that matches up with the rhetoric I was hearing \naround here last week of how you were reforming the institution.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher).\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member.\n  Again, we continue to make these great speeches and get all wound up, \nbut we don't talk about the facts. The facts are that Bank customers \nalready have to certify. The facts are that all of the people offering \nthe amendments want to kill the Export-Import Bank, which creates \nthousands of jobs. The facts are that we could have done this in \ncommittee a year ago. The facts are none of us wanted to be here \ntonight having this debate because we wanted to do this in regular \norder.\n  But, Mr. Chairman, the facts are that, if we allow these amendments \nthat are just aimed at killing the Export-Import Bank to pass and \nthousands of people are going to lose their jobs and our competitors \nall around the world are going to benefit, we must vote ``no.'' We need \nto defeat this amendment. I appreciate my buddy from South Carolina \noffering it, but I just think it is in the wrong order, and we need to \ndefeat it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The gentleman from \nSouth Carolina has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, let's look at the facts. Yes, the Bank is \nrequired right now to look at this. They are not required to actually \nconsider it. In fact, there are examples, factual examples, of the Bank \nlooking into whether or not there were any countervailing efforts done \nby foreign credit facilities and just ignoring that. Yes, the law does \nrequire them to, but there are no teeth in the law. This amendment \nwould allow us to do that.\n  Another fact: in 2012, this body required the Export-Import Bank to \nstart getting out of the business of competing with Export-Import Banks \noverseas in the airline industry. The law signed here, signed by the \nSenate, signed by the President was completely ignored by this \nadministration. This amendment would fix that.\n  Those are the facts, Mr. Chairman, from my friend from Tennessee. The \nfacts are the administration is not following the law.\n  We have seen that from time to time, haven't we?\n  We have a chance to rectify that here this afternoon, Mr. Chairman, \nby passing this amendment and focusing the Bank on what everybody seems \nto agree is a very important core duty of competing with export credit \nfacilities overseas, and I would recommend an approval of the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Mulvaney\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1032, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 95004. CERTIFICATION THAT BANK ASSISTANCE DOES NOT \n                   COMPETE WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR.\n\n       Section 2 of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. \n     635), as amended by section 95001 of this Act, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l) Recipients of Bank Assistance for a Transaction of \n     More Than $10,000,000 Required to Certify Inability to Obtain \n     Credit Elsewhere.--The Bank shall not guarantee, insure, or \n     extend credit, or participate in an extension of credit, in \n     connection with a transaction, with respect to which credit \n     assistance from the Bank is first sought after the effective \n     date of this paragraph, of more than $10,000,000, to a \n     person, unless the person has--\n       ``(1) certified to the Bank that the person has sought, and \n     has been unable to obtain, private sector financing for the \n     transaction without any Federal Government support; and\n       ``(2) provided the Bank with documentation that at least 2 \n     private financial institutions have declined to provide \n     financing for the transaction.''.\n\n     SEC. 95005. FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) Applicability of False Claims Provisions to Export-\n     Import Bank Transactions.--Section 3729(a) of title 31, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4);\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:\n       ``(3) Additional violations.--Any person who--\n       ``(A) receives a loan or guarantee from the Export Import \n     Bank of the United States for the purposes of supporting a \n     project or venture, without conducting reasonable diligence \n     to determine whether private sector financing would have been \n     available to support the project or venture, whether or not \n     the terms of the private sector financing would have been \n     substantially different from the terms of the financing \n     provided by the Export Import Bank of the United States; or\n       ``(B) receives a loan or guarantee from the Export Import \n     Bank of the United States for the purposes of supporting a \n     project or venture, knowing that private sector financing\n\n[[Page H7696]]\n\n     would have been available to support the project or venture, \n     whether or not the terms of the private sector financing \n     would have been substantially different from financing \n     provided by the Export Import Bank of the United States,\n      is liable to the United States Government for the face value \n     or the appraised value of the loan or guarantee, whichever \n     amount is greater.''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (2)(A), by striking ``the violation of \n     this subsection'' and inserting ``a violation under paragraph \n     (1)''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to acts described in paragraph (3) of section \n     3729(a) of title 31, United States Code, as added by \n     subsection (a)(2) of this section, that are committed on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 95006. STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR EXPORT-IMPORT BANK \n                   CONTRACTS.\n\n       Section 2 of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. \n     635), as amended by sections 95001 and 95004 of this Act, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(m) Effects of Finding by Inspector General That Contract \n     Recipient Made Inaccurate Representation About Availability \n     of Competing Foreign Financing or Private Sector Financing.--\n       ``(1) Rescission of contract.--The Bank may not enter into \n     a contract under which the Bank provides a loan or guarantee, \n     unless the contract provides that, if the Inspector General \n     of the Bank determines that a representation made by the \n     recipient of the loan or guarantee about the availability of \n     competing foreign export financing or private sector \n     financing was inaccurate at the time the representation was \n     made--\n       ``(A) the contract shall be considered rescinded; and\n       ``(B) the recipient shall immediately repay to the Bank an \n     amount equal to--\n       ``(i) in the case of a loan, the amount of the loan; or\n       ``(ii) in the case of a guarantee, an amount equal to the \n     appraised value of the guarantee.\n       ``(2) Ineligibility for future financial support.--A person \n     whose contract is rescinded under paragraph (1) shall not be \n     eligible for any financial support from the Bank.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Stutzman).\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of private \nlenders crowded out by the Export-Import Bank.\n  I thank my friend from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) for his work \nreforming the Export-Import Bank and for introducing this particularly \nimportant reform.\n  This amendment is pro-American, pro-jobs, and is entirely consistent \nwith the policy of Ex-Im's lapsed authorization.\n  Last year, Mr. Chairman, and earlier this year, I worked in good \nfaith to reform the Export-Import Bank. The Bank's authorization lapsed \nin large part because the White House and the Bank's proponents would \nnot take yes for an answer. They refused to work with us on changes, \njust like they are again tonight, that would prevent any single \nbusiness from dominating the Bank's activity or to prevent the Bank \nfrom crowding out private lenders. That latter point is the one that \nthis amendment will address.\n  This amendment requires loan applicants receiving more than $10 \nmillion to certify that they had originally sought out and been denied \nby two private lenders. This requirement doesn't block anyone from \ngetting a loan. It only requires that they go to traditional banks \nfirst.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  This provision is similar to one required for some Small Business \nAdministration financing as well.\n  Mr. Chairman, one of my central objections to government lending \nprograms is their capacity to destroy and replace private markets. The \ngovernment inevitably misallocates resources and jobs, ultimately \nmaking our industries less competitive and reducing jobs in the long \nterm.\n  Apparently, the authors of the Bank's prior reauthorization also \nagree to that point because, according to the Ex-Im's charter, it is \n``the policy of the United States that the Bank in the exercise of its \nfunctions should supplement and encourage and not compete with private \ncapital.'' Let me emphasize that last part, that the Bank should not \ncompete with private capital. Unfortunately, I have heard from lenders \nin Indiana who say that, absent Ex-Im, they would be financing more \nexports.\n  If the Bank is going to exist at all, the role of the Bank should \nonly be as a lender of last resort. The Bank is only intended to fill \ngaps in the private lending market. Any larger role the Bank plays is a \nviolation of its own charter. Worse, granting the Bank a larger role \nwould exacerbate market distortions that will, ultimately, fail \ncountries and the businesses that rely on them.\n  This amendment simply ensures that the Export-Import Bank stays \nwithin its bounds. If the Bank is truly a lender of last resort, this \namendment will not affect its lending. If it is, in fact, competing \nwith private lenders despite clear congressional intent, then this \namendment will start to correct the problem.\n  Mr. Chairman, the world is watching. Developing countries are \ndeciding whether to pursue American-style capitalism or Chinese-style \ncentral planning. As Speaker Ryan put it last week on this House floor, \nwe should be exporting democratic capitalism, not crony capitalism. If \nthis Bank is going to be reauthorized, we should at least make a real \neffort to let private lenders have the first opportunity to finance \nexports.\n  I know that many of Ex-Im's proponents agree that the Bank is not a \nlong-term solution to foreign competition. Even Ex-Im Chair Fred \nHochberg agrees, telling us earlier this year in committee that, in a \nperfect world, there would be no export credit agency of the United \nStates. If our priority is long-term economic growth and employment, \nthen we must not be tempted to rely on central planned exports the way \nthat China and Europe do.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment, and I ask my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 \nminute.\n  This amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina is yet \nanother attempt to undermine the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank by \nrequiring multiple denials of assistance from the private sector be \nprovided as a precondition of obtaining financing. The Ex-Im Bank would \nnot exist if they had to go before someone and require that they look \nat their application 10 times, 15 times.\n  This would be burdensome. It would be time consuming and, more \nlikely, unworkable for the potential uses of the Ex-Im Bank. The fact \nis that private sector banks don't generally issue letters of \nrejection, likely making compliance with the amendment impossible.\n  I also take issue with the provisions included in the amendment that \nare designed to intimidate potential users of the Bank who would be \nliable if they were found to have not adequately determined whether \nprivate sector financing may have been available to them.\n  I urge Members to oppose this amendment, which would impose new \nrestrictions on U.S. businesses alone, putting them at a unique \ndisadvantage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, of all of the arguments against \nthe Export-Import Bank, this is my favorite. Ayn Rand would be \nthrilled. I am appalled. Of all of the arguments, private lenders will \nbe crowded out. Private lenders will be displaced. Private lenders: \n``Woe is me. You are taking away our business.''\n  Yet no one ever--not once--has answered the question: Why is it then \nthat the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community \nBankers Association are among the strongest supporters of this? It is \nbecause--and the truth of the matter is--markets aren't perfect, and \nthey don't work in certain circumstances.\n  Where don't they work? They don't work with low-cost items: Miss \nJenny's\n\n[[Page H7697]]\n\nPickles, Manhasset Music Stands, PEXCO's Traffic Cones.\n  Why? It is because a small bank doesn't have the wherewithal to \ncollect across an international border, and a big bank isn't going to \nbother with that low volume of a transaction. A big bank isn't going to \nbother with Miss Jenny's Pickles or with Manhasset Music Stands. It is \nnot worth it to them.\n  That is why they see that markets aren't perfect. There are certain \ninstances in which they fail, and that is why they support the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n  We, actually, ought to be very proud of them. Sometimes it is used as \na point of criticism. ``You know they only finance 1 or 2 percent. Who \nneeds them? It is such a small amount.'' You ought to take that as a \npoint of pride. We are laser-focused on exactly where the need is--\nwhere the market isn't perfect. We are not subsidizing. We are, in \nfact, compensating for an imperfect market.\n  Perhaps it is China that is subsidizing with their four export credit \nauthorities, which, again, in the aggregate, have loaned more in the \nlast 2 years or have financed more than we have in our 81-year history.\n  We are laser-focused where the market doesn't exactly work--small \ncost items. Large-lived capital items, that is the other issue. Who is \ngoing to collect across an international border?\n  I urge you to vote ``no'' because the private sector wants you to \nvote ``no.''\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I inquire as to the time remaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Rokita).\n  Mr. ROKITA. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, as a rank-and-file Member--that is, a Member who is not \non the Financial Services Committee--I want to stand in strong support \nof this amendment. There are a lot of us who are looking for a way \nforward in this, and this reform would allow that to happen.\n  We don't know whether the private sector would work or not, because \nthose who are seeking lending aren't forced to ask. I find it laughable \nthat some say this would be too onerous on a bank or on someone who is \nseeking lending. These are the same people who think that Dodd-Frank \nregulations are okay, that they aren't too onerous. I think that is \nridiculous.\n  Last week, we were afforded the choice of an unreformed Ex-Im Bank or \nno Ex-Im Bank. This amendment and the ones being brought up tonight \nthat are like it offer us a third way: commonsense reforms that would \nallow the private sector to work and then would allow the Ex-Im Bank to \nbe a function of last resort, preserving the jobs that we all care \nabout. No one on this floor, Republican or Democrat, wants to kill a \njob. That is ridiculous.\n  So, as a rank-and-file Member who is off committee, I stand in \nsupport of the Mulvaney amendment, and I ask for its support.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger).\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. I thank the ranking member for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I just want to address a statement that was made a \nlittle earlier from my friend from Indiana.\n  He quoted the chairman and said that, in a perfect world, we would \nnot need Ex-Im. I agree. In a perfect world, we wouldn't need nuclear \nweapons. In a perfect world, nobody would have nuclear weapons, but \nnobody in this Chamber is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm our \nnuclear weapons in order to live by the politics of purity.\n  I had dinner the other day with a friend of mine who has a \nmanufacturing company. It is a small manufacturing company. They export \ndrilling components to Third World countries to help them drill for \ntheir own energy resources. He informed me that he has actually lost 15 \npercent of his business since this charter has expired. That is real \nmoney. That is real exporting. That is a real situation that affects \nreal people's lives.\n  Look, I understand that people want to amend this, and I think they \nhave a right to desire to amend this. The place to amend this would \nhave been in the committee, which I am not on by the way. It would have \nbeen an opportunity to have amended it and to have had a full debate \nand to have brought the amended bill to the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives to debate. That didn't happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas).\n  Mr. LUCAS. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, I will just simply ask my colleagues: Why did we get to \nthis point? Why should we vote against this amendment? Why should we \nvote against all 10 amendments?\n  It is because, 100 years ago, our friends--our predecessors--set up a \nsystem so that, if a Speaker or a chairman thwarted the will of the \nbody, there would be a way for the membership to bring it forward and \npass it; but the system had to be created so streamlined that that same \nforce or forces working to prevent the body from working its will could \nnot overcome it.\n  Last week, we demonstrated that rule worked. Unfortunately, today, we \nare demonstrating they didn't quite think everything through, because \nwe are revoting or we are voting on 10 issues on a subject matter that \nwas solved last week.\n  My colleagues, if you enjoy being here this evening, if you enjoy \nlistening to this debate all over again, I am sorry. The proponents \ndidn't do this. We thought we had won by playing fair and square last \nweek. Furthermore, we would have loved this debate 6 months ago.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded \nvote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Mulvaney\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1032, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PROHIBITION ON SUPPORT TO CERTAIN ENTERPRISES IN \n                   COUNTRIES WITH SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS OVER \n                   $100,000,000,000.\n\n       Section 2(b) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 \n     U.S.C. 635) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(14) Prohibition on Support to Certain Enterprises in \n     Countries With Sovereign Wealth Funds Over \n     $100,000,000,000.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Bank shall not guarantee or extend \n     (or participate in an extension of) credit in connection with \n     a transaction, with respect to which credit assistance from \n     the Bank is first sought after the effective date of this \n     paragraph, with a foreign company (or joint venture including \n     a foreign company) that benefits from support from a foreign \n     government if the foreign government has 1 or more sovereign \n     wealth funds with an aggregate value of at least \n     $100,000,000,000.\n       ``(B) Sovereign wealth fund defined.--In clause (i), the \n     term `sovereign wealth fund' means, with respect to a \n     government, an investment fund owned by the government, \n     excluding foreign currency reserve assets, any asset held by \n     a central bank for the execution of monetary policy, and any \n     government-managed pension fund.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Before I go on to the next amendment, I want to very briefly put a \nclosing point on the last discussion in responding to the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  Of course, the bankers love this. What does a banker love any less \nthan a guaranteed loan?\n\n[[Page H7698]]\n\n  As for Miss Jenny's Pickles that we have heard about many, many \ntimes, I will point out to everybody that the last amendment was \nlimited to loans that were greater than $10 million, not really, really \nsmall businesses. Those are exactly the type of private sector market \nloans we are looking for.\n  In fact, if I wanted to sum up in one sentence as to why you should \nsupport the last amendment, it would be: Can't we at least, maybe, give \nthe private sector a chance first on loans of this size?\n  There is another opportunity to do that now, Mr. Chairman, on this \nnext amendment, which would prohibit the Export-Import Bank from doing \nany business with companies that are owned or have other ties to \nsovereign wealth funds in excess of $100 billion.\n  I will give you a classic example of how the Export-Import Bank is \nbeing used right now.\n  The Government of Indonesia was seeking bids for a power plant. One \nof the American manufacturers was in the bidding, and the bid request \ncame in as follows and said that the buyer shall finance the project by \nusing 30 percent equity and 70 percent debt. An export credit agency \nshall cover at least 50 percent of the debt financing. Bidders shall \npropose a prospective lender who will cover the loan without guarantee \nfrom the Government of Indonesia and without collateral.\n  What was this, Mr. Chairman?\n  This was a foreign government saying: We would like to buy your \nstuff, and if we don't pay you, we would like your taxpayers to be on \nthe hook.\n  That is exactly what this is, and that is why so many of these \ninternational requests for proposals have exactly that requirement in \nit. These foreign governments don't want to be responsible if they \ncan't pay. They want this government to be responsible if they can't \npay, and that means they want our taxpayers to be responsible if they \ncan't pay.\n  We figured let's go ahead and let that be, Mr. Chairman, for a little \nbit; but if you have a sovereign wealth fund in excess of $100 billion, \nthen maybe you should be on the hook. Maybe our taxpayers should not \nbe. Maybe you are big enough to actually guarantee your own debts. It \nseems like a fairly reasonable thing that we should be sitting here, \ntrying to figure out ways to protect the taxpayer. So I encourage folks \nto support this particular amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I claim time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to yet another poison pill amendment \noffered by the gentleman from South Carolina. The amendment seeks to \ncreate an odd linkage between the world's sovereign wealth funds and \nthe provision of export credit financing.\n  Given the fact that, even if these funds involve themselves a great \ndeal in the provision of export financing, which I understand they do \nnot, I would assume they would be more interested in financing their \nown country's exports and not the exports of American goods and \nservices.\n  In any event, I want to be very clear about one thing. The purpose of \nthe U.S. Export-Import Bank is to support American jobs by boosting \nU.S. exports. The Bank exists to serve American interests. So when we \nwithhold financing from the potential foreign purchaser of a U.S. \nproduct or service, we are only hurting ourselves.\n  This is not a serious amendment. I urge Members to oppose it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), who serves on the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, I, too, oppose this amendment. This amendment \nincorrectly presumes that sovereign wealth funds have some special \nlinkage to export financing. Sovereign wealth funds do not have a \ndirect link to export credit financing.\n  The gentleman is certainly thinking about one of his favorite \ncompanies, Delta, who complains about the Export-Import Bank while \nignoring the OECD and existing mechanisms established to address this, \nfor example, the Open Skies laws. I repeat. Sovereign wealth funds do \nnot have a direct link to export credit financing.\n  I agree with the gentlewoman from California that this cannot be \ntaken seriously. I urge Members to oppose it.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chair, let's remind everybody that it has \nbeen asserted here that you would pass this amendment to protect \ntaxpayers, and the exact opposite is the truth.\n  The truth is, for a generation, the Export-Import Bank has \ntransferred money into the U.S. Treasury to reduce the deficit. If you \nwant to reduce the deficit, vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  It has also been suggested that these amendments somehow constitute \nreform as opposed to the underlying bill. It is not true. This is the \nbiggest package of reforms ever enacted for Ex-Im.\n  It does the following: increases small-business target from 20 to 25 \npercent, codifies the chief risk officer and the risk management \ncommittee, provides and requires external audits of fraud controls, \nprovides for upgrades and modernization of IT long overdue, expands \nloss reserves to 5 percent, reduces exposure of the portfolio from $140 \nbillion to $135. Lastly, it has a pilot program for a reinsurance \nprogram shifted to the private sector.\n  This is a reform bill without these amendments. These amendments are \ndesigned to kill the bill. Vote ``no'' on the bill. Vote for reform. \nVote ``no'' on the amendments.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I inquire as to the amount of time \nremaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina has 3 minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from California has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Rokita).\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chair, regarding reforms, looking at the underlying \nlegislation that we dealt with last week, those reforms either already \nexisted, have been in place and been ignored by the Ex-Im Bank--we have \nbeen waiting several years since the last time I voted against the Ex-\nIm Bank for these reforms, and they don't do it; they have been \nignored--or it is ignorance or malfeasance regarding traditional or \nstandard business or Bank practices.\n  I stand in favor of this amendment because this proposal would \nprevent the Ex-Im Bank from providing financing to any foreign company \nor joint venture that benefits from government support when that joint \nventure's country also has a sovereign wealth fund over $100 billion. \nWhy in the world would we want to subsidize a joint venture that has or \ncould have state backing from its own country?\n  Now, if we enacted this reform for fiscal year 2014, applying this \nprovision would have resulted in an estimated reduction of \napproximately $3.1 billion or only 15 percent of the Bank's total \nauthorizations, far from killing it, but, again, allowing a needed \nreform that isn't in the underlying legislation we dealt with this \nweek.\n  I urge support for this amendment.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher).\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Chair, again, I know great public speeches, but this \nis the biggest package of reforms since President Reagan.\n  The Bank actually returns on an average of $500 million to $1 billion \nto the Treasury every year. It is not costing the taxpayer a dime.\n  These are a few companies: Abro Industries, South Bend, Indiana; \nAuburn Leather Company, Auburn, Kentucky; Metropolitan Air Technology, \nChicago, Illinois; Advanced Protection Technologies, Clearwater, \nFlorida. Several companies, Mr. Chair, that will not be in business if \nwe kill the Export-Import Bank. All you hear from the opposition are \nexcuses, trying to kill the Export-Import Bank.\n  It is a shame when the facts don't matter, Mr. Chairman, but the \nfacts are this doesn't cost the taxpayers. The facts are we are doing \nmore to reform\n\n[[Page H7699]]\n\nthe Bank than has been done in 40 years. This is a Republican reform \npackage. Let's put the politics aside here and do what is best for our \nconstituents, the folks back home.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas).\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chair, once again, let's turn this amendment down. \nLet's turn back all of these amendments.\n  If anything, this amendment appears to try to fix the problem that \none company has in one sector in one region of the world. Some people \nmight define that as crony capitalism. Others might even call it an \nearmark.\n  Let's turn it back. Let's turn all these back. Let's get on with our \nbusiness. I'm sorry we have to go through this this evening.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nSchweikert).\n\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chair, to my friend from Tennessee, let's do the \nfacts. Simple amendment because, without it, you have all decided to \nsubsidize the uber-wealthy in the world.\n  Think about it. You have made a decision to use our import credit \nfacility, our constituents' credit, to subsidize great wealth around \nthe world. That is what you have decided to do here.\n  I thought there was a battle here between the right and the left and \nthe left always said, ``We are for the little guy.'' Here is your \nchance.\n  If you want just some basic reforms that--are you thrilled with the \nconcept of a sovereign wealth fund coming out of Indonesia? Malaysia? \nOthers? We are going to guarantee the loan instruments on the back of \nour taxpayers.\n  Come on. At some point, the argument is absurd saying: Well, you had \na chance to do this last week. No, we didn't. You chose to do a closed \nrule. You did. You had every opportunity to do an open rule and give us \nthe chance to put these actual reforms in.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to address their remarks to \nthe Chair.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, obviously, they don't get what a sovereign \nwealth fund is. It just is a balance of payments between countries, and \nI think that it is a dilatory argument.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I have heard three arguments, Mr. Chairman, that somehow this is a \nconvoluted linkage. No, it is not. It is pretty straightforward. The \nBank shall not guarantee or extend credit in connection with a \ntransaction with a foreign company or joint venture, including a \nforeign company, that benefits from support from a foreign government \nif the foreign government has a sovereign wealth fund with an aggregate \nvalue of at least $100 billion.\n  I have no idea how that is convoluted, Mr. Chairman. That is about as \nstraightforward as you get. If you are involved in a sovereign wealth \nfund, you don't get taxpayer money.\n  The other thing I heard is that this is to protect one customer, one \nclient. That is absurd. This is designed to protect 150 million \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  The last thing I heard was this is not serious. Yes, it is. Anytime \nwe have the opportunity to put American taxpayers in front of foreign \ntaxpayers, I think that would be very serious.\n  I would encourage the support of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman and Members, this \ndesperate attempt by my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, this \nlast-minute attempt to try and kill Ex-Im, is laughable.\n  I am asking all of the Members of this House to simply see it for \nwhat it is and vote against it. Vote ``no'' on these amendments and \nthis amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Mulvaney\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1032, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SATISFACTION OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE EXPORT-IMPORT \n                   BANK OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Elimination of Authority to Issue Obligations to the \n     Secretary of the Treasury.--Section 5 of the Export-Import \n     Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635d) is repealed.\n       (b) Requirement That the Export-Import Bank of the United \n     States Cover All Its Losses.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 2 of Public Law 90-390 (12 U.S.C. \n     635k) is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``the first $100,000,000 of such losses \n     shall be borne by the Bank; the second $100,000,000 of such \n     losses shall be borne by the Secretary of the Treasury; and \n     any losses in excess thereof'' and inserting ``all losses''; \n     and\n       (B) by striking the 2nd and 3rd sentences.\n       (2) Conforming repeal.--Section 3 of Public Law 90-390 (12 \n     U.S.C. 635l) is repealed.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Chairman, this one is fairly simple. We have heard now for the \nlast half-hour or so how much money the Treasury gets from the Export-\nImport Bank, how profitable the Export-Import Bank is for the American \ntaxpayer. Okay. That is great.\n  Then, let's get rid of the connection between the Export-Import Bank \nand the guarantee that the Treasury gives to it. Let's let the Export-\nImport Bank rise and fall on its own economics and its own balance \nsheet and not put the taxpayer on the hook.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strident opposition to this \namendment. I think that this amendment really tells the story that they \nreally are trying to destroy the Export-Import Bank as opposed to \nreform it. How can you deny borrowing authority to a lending \ninstitution and say you are serious about having it stay alive?\n  The Bank has done a fantastic job of managing risk by keeping its \noverall debt rate below one quarter of 1 percent, far better than most \nprivate banks, in fact.\n  The Export-Import Bank reauthorization already includes the creation \nof a permanent chief risk officer role, establishing a risk management \ncommittee, enhancing the Bank's loan loss reserves, among other \nreforms.\n  The underlying bill makes the Bank safer and better run than before, \nmaking this amendment transparently unnecessary.\n  Members should oppose this anti-Ex-Im amendment.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher).\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Chair, to the gentlewoman's comments, this does show \nan attempt to kill the Bank.\n  When we go back home to our districts, a lot of times we are on the \ntail end of jokes, being Congressmen and Congresswomen, and sometimes \nthey talk about us being a little slow.\n  So let me go over the facts one more time for the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina. The Bank doesn't cost the taxpayer a penny. We are \ndoing more in the way of reforms than since President Reagan. It \nreturns $500 million to $1 billion a year back to the Treasury.\n  Now, I know that they have taken the position to kill the Bank, but \nthis kills jobs. This is about jobs in Tennessee, jobs in California, \njobs in Oklahoma, jobs in Illinois.\n\n[[Page H7700]]\n\n  This is not a level playing field. China, Russia, and all of these \nother countries are just hoping that we make the mistake and we don't \nreauthorize the charter of the Export-Import Bank.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Let's be responsible adults. Let's not play politics as usual and \nworry about these outside groups and our political scores, Mr. \nChairman. Isn't it sad that we would worry about some score with an \noutside group more than our districts and more than our constituents \nthat have jobs because of the Export-Import Bank? We should be ashamed \nof ourselves.\n  I again urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on all these amendments, \nand let's get to the serious business of the people's House.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Duffy).\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of Mr. Mulvaney's \namendment to shield taxpayers from bailing out the Export-Import Bank.\n  I have been here for this debate over the last 45 minutes, and I have \nheard my good friend from Frog Jump, Tennessee, comment, and I think he \nsaid the Export-Import Bank doesn't cost taxpayers one penny, okay? \nThat was the quote, doesn't cost one penny. But what this amendment \ndoes is guarantee that the Export-Import Bank won't cost the taxpayer \none penny because the taxpayer is not going to be on the hook. But then \nI just heard my good friend from Tennessee say, if we pass this \namendment, it is going to kill the Bank.\n  You can't have it both ways. Either it kills the Bank if you don't \nhave a backstop because it costs the taxpayers money, or it doesn't \ncost the taxpayers any money and this amendment won't kill the Bank. \nBut you can't have it both ways. It does not work that way.\n  Listen, this makes sense. The Export-Import Bank helps the 10 largest \nbusinesses in America. Why are moms and dads and families in Wausau, \nWisconsin, or Hayward, Wisconsin, Frog Jump, Tennessee, the suburbs of \nChicago, or rural Oklahoma, who make $50,000, $60,000--maybe a little \nmore in the Chicago suburbs--why are they the backstop for these \nbiggest corporations?\n  That shouldn't be the way it is. So let's take the backstop of that \ntaxpayer, those American families, let's take them off the hook. As the \nauthor of the amendment said, let's let the Bank stand on their own. \nLet them make that guarantee on their own.\n  In our communities, our banks make loans to small businesses every \nsingle day. I know the gentlewoman from Wisconsin knows that. There is \nnot a taxpayer backstop to those loans. If they don't pay those loans \nback, the bank loses. Why are the biggest corporations getting the \nbackstop of the American taxpayer? This one makes sense. This one makes \nsense.\n  Let's all stand together and say the American taxpayer, the American \nfamily is not going to back up the biggest banks. Let's get away from \nthe crony capitalism. It is not going to kill the Bank. It is a good \namendment. This is the place and the time for reform. Maybe it should \nhave happened 6 months ago, but with regular order, it gets to happen \ntoday. Let's stand together for American families and against crony \ncapitalism.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much \ntime I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger).\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting in these \ngreat conversations, good debate, nobody has said that this doesn't \nmake money for the taxpayers. They try to make the link and everything \nelse, and that is fine.\n  My friend from Wisconsin just said, well, if this amendment kills the \nBank, it is because, et cetera, et cetera. This amendment is aimed to \nkill the Bank because it is a poison pill amendment on Ex-Im. That is \nwhat all these amendments are. They are attempting a last-ditch effort \nto destroy something that has really, frankly, provided a lot of jobs \nin my district and provided a lot of exports from my district.\n  We talk about protecting taxpayers. Protecting taxpayers from what, \nan extra $500 million? Are we protecting them from a smaller deficit? \nIt doesn't make sense. I am not sure why certain folks have made this \nthe hill to die on. There are a lot of better hills to die on, to \nfight, to argue in this.\n  I will tell you a quick story. I went to Ethiopia 6 months ago or so. \nI flew to Ethiopia on a Boeing Dreamliner. Now, I know a lot of people \nlike to call out names of big companies, but I didn't go to Ethiopia on \nEthiopian Airlines on an Airbus. The fact that I was on a Boeing \nDreamliner means that the parts and components are made in my district \nfor that Dreamliner, which means there are people who have a job \nbecause Ethiopian Airlines bought a Boeing.\n  Let's kill this amendment and save the Bank.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on my side?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the \nbalance of my time.\n  I have listened carefully to the arguments that are being made on the \nopposite side of the aisle, and I listened carefully to Mr. Duffy. \nEvidently, he does not know or does not understand that those big \ncorporations that he talked about are hiring small businesses in his \ndistrict. He does not understand that these are the suppliers to these \nbig companies. These are the families who are benefiting from the jobs \nand the contracts that they have been able to get.\n  Evidently, listening to my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, \nthey really don't understand the Ex-Im Bank. They really don't \nunderstand its support for our ability to export, thus creating jobs.\n  While on the one hand they talk about how great our country is and \nhow competitive we are, how competitive we need to be, they don't \nunderstand that, just as Mr. Fincher said, other countries such as \nChina are just hoping that we cannot reopen this Bank. They are just \nhoping that we will not support our exporters, because they are going \nto support their exporters 100 percent.\n  If you care about jobs, if you care about contracts, if you care \nabout small businesses, you would not be opposing this Bank. As a \nmatter of fact, there are those who would say: I am surprised that \nMaxine Waters is such an advocate for the Ex-Im Bank; we did not expect \nher to be. But I want you to know, I have worked with the Chamber of \nCommerce. I have held meetings in my district.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, a couple different things. I am a little \nsurprised, Mr. Chairman, to hear some of the advocates here today \nbecause some of them, including the most recent speaker, were actually \nagainst the Bank when there was a different party in charge of the \nWhite House.\n  I hear today that this is supposedly about jobs, jobs being created. \nBy the way, that is a claim that not even the Export-Import Bank makes \non its own. It has never come into our committee and said, ``We create \njobs.'' It comes into our committee and says, ``We support jobs.'' We \nare not really sure what that means. We have asked them. They are not \nreally sure how to count it. In fact, there is really good evidence \nthat they are counting it wrong.\n\n  Let's say for the sake of argument, Mr. Chairman, that they do create \njobs. They also destroy jobs. Every time the government gets involved \nin the market and creates jobs someplace, they destroy it someplace \nelse. It is just much harder to see. So it is very difficult for us to \nsay: Look, this job was destroyed by the Export-Import Bank.\n  But I will tell you this, my local banks in rural South Carolina \ncan't go to the Treasury and borrow money for free every time they want \nto. If they could, they might be able to create some more jobs as well.\n  We have a distortion to the market, Mr. Chairman, plain and simple. \nThat is all this is. Are there going to be winners? Absolutely. There \nis a lot of them, as a matter of fact. In fact, you\n\n[[Page H7701]]\n\ncan go buy stock in some of them if you want to. Are there losers? \nAbsolutely. You will never see them. You will never see them. They are \nin Union County, South Carolina, maybe. I don't know because we will \nnever see the jobs that are not created because of the distortion \ncreated by the Bank.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity not to kill the Bank. If the Bank \nreally is as profitable as you say it is, this should be fine.\n  By the way, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger) has left and \nsaid that no one is getting up to say the Bank doesn't make money. Here \nI am. The Bank doesn't make money. First of all, if you made it count \nright, it wouldn't make any money. But, in my lifetime, we have had to \nbail this institution out to the tune of billions of dollars. How soon \nwe forget those types of things, Mr. Chairman.\n  We are going to pass this amendment. It is not designed to kill the \nBank. It is designed to get the taxpayers off the hook in case the Bank \nmakes the same mistakes today that it has made in the past.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded \nvote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Mulvaney\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1032, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. STRENGTHENING PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION AND RISK \n                   MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) Limitations on Sectoral Credit Exposure of the Bank.--\n     Section 2 of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. \n     635), as amended by section 95001 of this Act, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l) Limitations on Sectoral Credit Exposure of the \n     Bank.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Bank shall not guarantee, insure, or \n     extend (participate in the extension of) credit in connection \n     with a transaction in a single industrial sector if the \n     provision of the guarantee, insurance, or credit would result \n     in the total credit exposure of the Bank in the sector being \n     more than 20 percent of the total credit exposure of the \n     Bank.\n       ``(2) Effect of excessive sectoral credit exposure.--If, as \n     of the end of a fiscal year, the credit exposure of the Bank \n     in a single industrial sector exceeds the limit specified in \n     paragraph (1), the Bank may not guarantee, insure, or extend \n     (participate in the extension of) credit in connection with a \n     transaction in the sector until the President of the Bank \n     reports to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services \n     of the House of Representatives that, as of the end of the \n     calendar month preceding the month in which the report is \n     made, the credit exposure of the Bank in the sector does not \n     exceed the limit.''.\n       (b) Limitations on Bank Assistance Benefitting a Single \n     Person.--Section 2 of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 \n     U.S.C. 635), as amended by section 95001 of this Act and \n     subsection (a) of this section, is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(m) Limitations on Bank Assistance Benefitting a Single \n     Person.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Bank shall not guarantee, insure, or \n     extend (participate in the extension of) credit in a fiscal \n     year if the provision of the guarantee, insurance, or credit \n     would result in a single person benefitting from more than 10 \n     percent of the total dollar amount of credit assistance \n     provided by the Bank in the fiscal year.\n       ``(2) Effect of excessive benefit for a single exporter.--\n     If, in a fiscal year, a person has benefitted from more than \n     10 percent of the total dollar amount of credit assistance \n     provided by the Bank in the fiscal year, the Bank may not \n     guarantee, insure, or extend (participate in the extension \n     of) credit so as to benefit the person until the beginning of \n     the 2nd succeeding fiscal year.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on October 1, 2016.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I was on a working group last year under the auspices \nof the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services with, amongst \nother people, the good gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher), who has \nnow left us for dinner. No, there he is. One of the things that the \nopponents and proponents of the Bank could all agree on was the fact \nthat the Bank was poorly run when it came to managing its risk. \nSpecifically, it has what bankers call market concentration. It puts \ntoo many of its eggs in one basket. In fact, one particular industry, \naircraft and avionics, takes up almost 30 percent of the Bank's \nportfolio.\n  We had a banker on that committee who worked with us. He said no \nself-respecting private sector bank would ever allow that to happen. \nThat is simply bad management. It is not credible management. It is not \nresponsible management to the shareholders. The bad news here, of \ncourse, Mr. Chairman, is the shareholders are the people who pay us.\n  What does this amendment do? It tries to bring some of the private \nsector sanity into the Export-Import Bank and say: Look, you are going \nto have to abide by rules that ensure diversification of risk, both \nwithin industries and across companies.\n  If this were really a bank and not just a political extension of the \ncurrent administration, they would probably be doing this. If the Bank \nwas run by a banker and not a political bundler, the Bank would \nprobably already be doing this. But since it is a political extension \nof this administration, since it is run by a political bundler and not \na banker, it falls to us to make sure that the Bank follows some \ncommonsense rules about to whom it lends and how much it lends to them.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Yet again the gentleman from South Carolina is offering an amendment \ndesigned to kill the Ex-Im Bank and compromise its reauthorization in \nthe highway bill conference. By imposing arbitrary caps on the Bank's \nability to meet the needs of American exporters, regardless of the \nsector they represent, the amendment would starve certain sectors of \nthe financing they need, resulting in a needless loss of U.S. jobs.\n  I am concerned the amendment would also create incentives for \nbusinesses to be the first in line to get the limited amount of \nfinancing that is available for that particular sector or industry and \nwould also undermine its mandates to serve sub-Saharan Africa, small \nbusinesses, and renewable energy exports.\n  Given the Bank's extremely low default rate, it is hard to envision \nhow this amendment would help the Bank better manage its portfolio.\n  I urge Members to reject this poison pill amendment so that we can \nreauthorize the Ex-Im Bank without delay.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, these amendments are getting more and more \nstrange as the evening wears on.\n  The favorite indictment of this Bank, I think, is that it picks \nwinners and losers, and yet here is an amendment that does exactly \nthat. It puts these artificial caps on sectors. Mr. Chairman, this Bank \nis demand driven, and if the world demands shifts, why would we create \nbarriers to U.S. firms meeting that demand? These caps just mean that \nthe U.S. can't compete for growing market trends.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  This is a poison pill amendment, and I urge the Members to reject \nthis so we can reauthorize the Bank immediately.\n\n[[Page H7702]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent).\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to my friend Mr. \nMulvaney's amendment. He is a friend. I do want to say that this \namendment puts not only a cap, but statutory quotas on industry sectors \nfor the full 5-year authorization. It ignores market forces.\n  The amendment would mirror the French quota system in their export \ncredit agency, which is ineffective. Rapidly developing industries like \nunconventional gas--and I represent a gas State, where we do a lot of \nMarcellus shale--and the industrial Internet would be disadvantaged \nunder this policy.\n  It creates incentives for businesses to rush to be the first in the \ndoor and get under the arbitrary cap, resulting in missed opportunities \nand inequitable treatment of U.S. exporters and U.S. workers. This \nwould make the Bank ineffective and unable to fill in the gaps in the \nprivate sector or to help American businesses compete on a level \nplaying field.\n  I also have to note, too, that I suspect that many of the amendments \nthat we are seeing here tonight are not designed to make the bill \nbetter, but to simply take it down. As I said, Mr. Mulvaney is my \nfriend, but I suspect if his amendment is adopted, he probably still \nwouldn't be inclined to support the legislation, unless he tells me \notherwise.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina has 3 minutes \nremaining, and the gentlewoman from California has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Arbitrary limits, I had to laugh about that one, Mr. Chairman, when I \nwas making my notes, because I was in a committee meeting today with \nthe same folks making the argument now, saying that Congress does that \nall the time. In fact, I think the person who made that argument is \nsitting across the aisle from me today.\n  I am just glad that folks making the argument now in opposition to \nthis amendment aren't in charge of private banks. In fact, if they \nwere, they would probably be in jail, because a lot of the same \nrestrictions on lending that are contained in Dodd-Frank are exactly \nthe rules that the Export-Import Bank is breaking right now.\n  We would never tolerate a private institution that allows the type of \nconcentration, both marketwise and geographically, that the Export-\nImport Bank has. Dodd-Frank would never permit it. Apparently, now it \nis okay, because we don't have private shareholders on the hook. We \nhave taxpayers on the hook. So, if things go bad, it is really not that \nbig a deal.\n  I will remind everyone here, Mr. Chairman, that the inspector \ngeneral's report has suggested exactly the type of reforms that are \ncontained in this amendment. Anyone with any banking experience or even \npeople from Tennessee with just a little common sense might be able to \nlook at the balance sheet of this Bank and say: ``Wait a second. There \nis too much concentration of various industries. There is too much \nconcentration of various geographic areas. This is a really, really bad \nway to run a bank.''\n  And it would be, of course, if this is a bank. But it is not a bank. \nIt is a government program. It should be run like a bank, however. And \nthat is what this amendment gives us the opportunity to do.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas).\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, I think it is relevant that we think for a \nmoment about the Bank.\n  Some of my friends here who press these amendments--which, I would \nremind you, you should vote against all of them--say that they are not \ntrying to kill the Bank. They are trying to do something.\n  Well, didn't the Bank expire in July? Isn't it no longer able to do \nnew business? Isn't that the definition of dead? By their lack of \naction, which is inaction, they killed it. Now they say, with their \nactions, they will resurrect it? Not likely, my friends.\n  Turn all these amendments down. Let's get on with the core business \nhere. Let's fight the fight we fought last week again, and one more \ntime let's give American business an opportunity to compete with the \nrest of the world.\n  Who knows--we might have to do this three or four more times, but \nlet's keep doing the right thing for American workers. Let's keep doing \nthe right thing for American business. That is all I am asking: just do \nthe right thing and abide by the decision of the House and the majority \nof the majority.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from South \nCarolina suggested that the Export-Import Bank was a political \nextension of this administration. If that is true, let's be real clear: \nit has been a political extension of every single administration since \nit was created in 1934.\n  All 13 Presidents have supported the Export-Import, all 13--Democrats \nand Republicans, liberals and conservatives. Sixteen times it has bean \nreauthorized in this Chamber. Virtually every time, it was done \nunanimously and overwhelmingly.\n  In earlier remarks, the other gentleman suggested that those of us \nwho oppose these amendments are trying to have it both ways. They also \nsay that we try to pick winners and losers with the Export-Import Bank.\n  Well, this amendment is exhibit A in picking winners and losers. It \ncompels diversification. It is not based on need and not based on \ncreditworthiness. Diversification for diversification's sake, that is \nnot what a good bank does, and that is not what the Export-Import Bank \ndoes. The Export-Import Bank meets a specific need in the marketplace; \nand when it does it, it creates jobs, jobs for Americans.\n  Oppose this amendment. Oppose all amendments.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina has 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, in closing on all of these amendments, I \nwant to touch on something we haven't had a chance to talk about here \ntoday.\n  There are a lot of people in here who are apparently very proud of \nthe Bank. They are happy with the way the Bank is run. They don't think \nthat, but for some token reforms and changes, the Bank needs to change \nvery much at all.\n  The last 6 years have been 75 years of combined prison time because \nof wrongdoing at the Bank. There were 90 criminal indictments and \ncomplaints, 49 criminal judgments, and more than $223 million--a \nquarter of a billion dollars--in court-ordered fines and restitution \nbecause of wrongdoing at the Bank.\n\n  We are proud of that? That is something that doesn't need serious \noverhaul? That is something we can just tweak around the edges because \nwe have done it for so long?\n  Maybe that is part of the problem. Maybe it has been a really, really \nlong time since we have looked at this Bank under the microscope like \nwe should. Maybe we should not have rubberstamped it for the past 16 \nadministrations. Maybe the Bank should have followed the law that we \npassed in 2012 to reform itself.\n  What does it say about an institution, Mr. Chairman, that ignores the \nlaw that this Chamber passes, the Senate passes, and the President \nsigns? You combine that which can only be described as bureaucratic \narrogance with this--prison time, criminal indictments, judgments, \nfines and restitutions--and you have an institution that is in sad need \nof reform, Mr. Chairman, and this is it.\n  The amendments that you will see tonight are your only opportunity to \ndo that. We could have done it the other day on the motion to \ndischarge, but it was finely tuned so that that could not happen. This \nis it. We should pass not only this amendment, Mr. Chairman, but all of \nthe amendments.\n\n[[Page H7703]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Rothfus\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1032, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. GUARANTEE FROM UNITED STATES EXPORTER REQUIRED AS A \n                   CONDITION OF PROVIDING GUARANTEE OR EXTENDING \n                   CREDIT TO FOREIGN PERSON.\n\n       Section 2 of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. \n     635), as amended by section 95001 of this Act, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l) Guarantee From United States Exporter Required as a \n     Condition of Providing Guarantee or Extending Credit to \n     Foreign Person.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Bank may not provide a guarantee or \n     extend (or participate in the extension of credit) to a \n     foreign person in a fiscal year in connection with the export \n     of goods or services by a United States company, unless--\n       ``(A) the United States company--\n       ``(i) guarantees the repayment by the foreign person of the \n     applicable percentage for the fiscal year of the amount of \n     the guarantee or credit provided by the Bank; and\n       ``(ii) pledges collateral in an amount sufficient to cover \n     the applicable percentage for the fiscal year of the amount \n     guaranteed by the United States company; and\n       ``(B) the guarantee by the United States company is senior \n     to any other obligation of the United States company.\n       ``(2) Applicable percentage defined.--In paragraph (1), the \n     term `applicable percentage' means--\n       ``(A) in the case of fiscal year 2016, 10 percent;\n       ``(B) in the case of fiscal year 2017, 20 percent;\n       ``(C) in the case of fiscal year 2018, 30 percent;\n       ``(D) in the case of fiscal year 2019, 40 percent;\n       ``(E) in the case of fiscal year 2020, 50 percent;\n       ``(F) in the case of fiscal year 2021, 60 percent;\n       ``(G) in the case of fiscal year 2022, 70 percent;\n       ``(H) in the case of fiscal year 2023, 80 percent;\n       ``(I) in the case of fiscal year 2024, 90 percent; and\n       ``(J) in the case of fiscal year 2025 and each succeeding \n     fiscal year, 100 percent.\n       ``(3) Inapplicability to small business exporters.--\n     Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the provision \n     of a guarantee or credit in connection with an export by a \n     small business concern (as defined in section 3(a) of the \n     Small Business Act).''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I cannot understate the importance of this amendment, Mr. Chairman. \nThe House finally has an opportunity to begin today what may be a \nyears-long process of unwinding the Federal Government's massive loan \nguarantees. We need to do this to better protect hardworking taxpayer \ndollars so we can ensure that, when bills come due in 10 years for \nSocial Security, Medicare, and veterans' benefits, we will be able to \nmeet these commitments that Americans have earned and deserve.\n  My amendment also supports small businesses and ensures they can \ncontinue to export goods and services. In short, it is a win-win for \ntaxpayers and job creators alike.\n  My amendment builds a firewall to protect the American taxpayer in \nthe event that an overseas purchaser takes out a loan from the Export-\nImport Bank and stops paying it back. While the loan will still have a \ntaxpayer guarantee, the U.S. exporter that directly profits on the deal \nwill be responsible for a percentage of the loss before you go to the \ntaxpayers.\n  One need only look at the details surrounding the deal with NewSat, a \ntroubled satellite operator in Australia, to see why this amendment is \nnecessary. The American taxpayer lost $139 million of a direct loan \nfrom the Export-Import Bank because the deal wasn't properly \ncollateralized. Hardworking taxpayers should not be left paying for \nthese risky loans.\n  This is vitally important, Mr. Chairman. This amendment will allow \nelected Representatives to cast a vote on whether it is fair and \nprudent to facilitate transactions where profits stay in the private \nsector, but losses are passed on to taxpayers. This is often described \nas ``privatize the profits, but socialize the losses.''\n  Here is how the amendment works. First, it does not apply if any \nexporter is a small business. According to the Export-Import Bank's own \nfigures, nearly 90 percent of the Bank's transactions directly serve \nsmall businesses. This amendment does not touch this 90 percent and \nwill not impact local mom-and-pop businesses.\n  For big businesses, though, when a foreign government or corporation \ntakes out a loan from the Export-Import Bank to buy their products or \nservices, if that foreign purchaser then defaults on the loan, before \ndipping into the Bank's reserves--which belong to the taxpayers--the \nbig businesses would have to repay a percentage of the loan.\n  To minimize any potential disruptions, this reform is phased in \ngradually over the next decade, starting at a mere 10 percent for any \nlending that occurs in fiscal year 2016, 20 percent in fiscal year \n2017, and so on. Loans will still get made, the Bank will still \noperate, but the American taxpayers will have a layer of protection \nthat will mitigate any chance of the Export-Import Bank requesting a \nbailout, as it did in 1987 to the tune of $3 billion.\n  Why is this so important? Because American taxpayers are today the \nguarantor of more than $3 trillion in loans backed by numerous \nagencies, including the Export-Import Bank. This level of taxpayer \nleverage is not sustainable; and in 10 years, when we look into the \nfaces of our seniors and our veterans, I want to have the confidence \nthat we will have the resources we need to uphold the commitments we \nhave made to them.\n  Mr. Chairman, the modest reforms in this amendment are a small step \ntowards achieving that end. We can--we must--start this process today. \nI urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank her for \nher tremendous leadership on this issue. I join her; Mr. Heck of \nWashington; our whip, Mr. Hoyer; Congresswoman Moore of Wisconsin; and \nso many others on the Republican side of the aisle who have been such \nstrong leaders on reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Mr. Chair, some concerns have been raised here that I think are in \nneed of response.\n  In terms of this amendment, I rise in opposition to it and state that \nthe Bank's portfolio is well-collateralized, especially in the largest \nproduct sector, and it maintains a loss rate of less than one-quarter \nof 1 percent.\n  The Bank is also self-funded, largely through user fees collected \nfrom foreign customers, and has generated a surplus of close to $7 \nbillion, money that has been sent to the U.S. Treasury to help reduce \nthe deficit.\n  The previous speaker, Mr. Mulvaney, talked about some incidences of \nfraud that he said were associated with the Bank. I think it is \nimportant for our colleagues and those who are listening to this debate \nto know that those incidences of fraud were fraud exacted upon the \nBank, not by the Bank; and so the charge that this fraud was within the \nBank is just simply not true. These were people who tried to defraud \nthe Bank.\n  Now, there was one incidence of fraud that the members of the staff \nof the Bank referred to or called out--one incident. So I just don't \nwant anyone to\n\n[[Page H7704]]\n\nbe misled into thinking that, however it was characterized, it is a \nfact.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  That is why we have an IG, and that is why it is so good that in this \nbill, in terms of fraud and ethics, it creates a nonpartisan chief \nethics officer and requires a GAO review at least once every 4 years of \nthe Bank's fraud controls.\n  Legitimate concerns were raised, but the fact is the Bank should not \nbe associated with fraud that is being exacted against it as if it was \ncommitting fraud. That is just not so.\n  But it is a good evening because we are debating an issue that has \nstrong bipartisan support, that creates jobs, that reduces the deficit, \nthat increases our competitiveness overseas, that enables U.S. \ncompanies to have markets for our products overseas, not only big \nbusinesses that are addressed in this amendment. That is important as \nwell.\n  But for small and moderate-sized businesses who would not have the \ninternal resources to find markets abroad, the Ex-Im Bank is created \nfor that purpose.\n  I thank Mr. Dent and others who have been so much a part of bringing \nthis legislation to the floor. I think it is a victory for the American \npeople that we will have a bill that not only is good for our highways \nand in terms of transportation, but also reauthorizes the Ex-Im Bank in \norder to agree with the language in the Senate bill.\n  So all of these amendments, however well intentioned or well thought \nout, have the additional burden of taking down the Bank. Maybe you save \nthem for another day, but in the here and now, we do not need any \namendments on the Ex-Im Bank in the transportation bill just because \nthe Ex-Im Bank is authorized in the transportation bill in the Senate.\n  This House very thoughtfully passed our own authorization. I would \nhope that the Senate would agree to our language unamended.\n  Again, I commend all of you who made this evening possible, and I \nlook forward to a celebration of passing a highway bill that does not \ntake down the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chair, I am not as calm as the Leader in \nher remarks because I think enough is enough.\n  Not directed at the offerer of this amendment but to a previous \nspeaker: I cannot help but be reminded of Joseph Welch during the \nMcCarthy hearings when he said: Have you no sense of decency, sir, at \nlong last?\n  With one exception, these indictments were people outside the Bank \ntrying to defraud the Bank; yet, it is offered here today as a \nreflection on the 300 or 400 employees down there.\n  What do they do? Well, they have a default rate that is one-tenth the \nrate of transactions in trade by the private sector, one-tenth.\n  They have a collection rate that is the envy of the commercial \nbanking sector. They transfer funds to the Treasury, $6 billion or $7 \nbillion in the last generation. That is what these hardworking people \ndo.\n  Stop it. Stop making comments that reflect on all of these people who \nare hardworking civil servants, who are doing the job, and who are \nreducing the deficit.\n  Yes, they are supporting and creating jobs. What does ``support'' \nmean? Create or save. The GAO says that, not me, the GAO. So stop it.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher).\n  Mr. FINCHER. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Chair, again, let's go over the facts. We are getting off base.\n  The Bank doesn't lose taxpayer dollars. It returns money to the \nTreasury every year, $500 million to $1 billion.\n  We are reforming. This is a Republican reform bill. We should be \nhappy when Democrats want to cross the aisle and support Republican \nideas. This is a Republican reform bill.\n  And to the gentleman that makes the argument on this amendment, the \naircraft section of the portfolio is over on collateral 1.4 to 1.\n  These are bogus arguments. These are amendments to kill the Bank.\n  This is sad when people put their political scorecards above their \nconstituents. This is about jobs in all of our districts.\n  They are not using the facts. The facts are that this creates lots of \njobs at no cost, and we are reforming the Bank.\n  Read the bill. Read the bill, Mr. Chairman, and maybe we would have \nmore than 313 votes next time we vote on this.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I have heard a number of times tonight \nthat the Bank doesn't cost anything. But if you take a look at the \nCongressional Budget Office analysis and if you use fair value \naccounting, it costs $2 billion over 10 years. And there will be an \namendment later on talking about that.\n  I think people forget about the $3 billion taxpayer bailout that \nExport-Import asked for in 1987.\n  Finally, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were fine until they weren't, and \nthey left the taxpayers with a $150 billion tab.\n  I am looking 10 years down the road, Mr. Chairman, looking at the \ndebt that this country continues to accrue and thinking about the \nobligations that we have to meet in 2025 for our seniors, for our \nveterans. I want to make sure that we are not going to have a bailout \nat that time of this institution.\n  All this amendment does is says, who bears the risk of loss, the \ntaxpayer or the entities that made the profit. It is phased in over \ntime. Small businesses are protected.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas).\n  Mr. LUCAS. I thank the ranking member, and I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chair, I would simply note that the provision requires U.S. \nbusiness to factor in new costs of a guarantee for repayment to the Ex-\nIm Bank, in addition to the fees and interests already required. Those \nadditional costs would make U.S. business less competitive.\n  Now, that said, once again, I urge my colleagues to turn back this \namendment, turn back all 10 amendments.\n  Remember, the Bank expired in July. When my friends say they don't \nwant to kill it, they already have. Now they are just trying to keep it \nfrom being brought back to be able to function as a part of our \neconomy.\n  Look through the amendment process we are going through here. Look at \nthe whole process we are involved in. Understand what is really \noccurring.\n  Nothing ever happens by accident in politics--right?--or the \nlegislative process. Understand the fight we are engaged in.\n  Turn back this amendment. Turn back all these amendments. Let's get \non with it. If we could have made things better 6 months ago, we would \nhave, but we weren't allowed to.\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, this amendment has \nbeen offered in an attempt to delay and derail the Bank's \nreauthorization.\n  Despite the implication made by the gentleman's amendment that Ex-Im \nis undertaking and mismanaging excessive risk, it is important to be \nclear on the fact that the Bank has a portfolio that is well \ndiversified regionally and by sector, spread across over 170 countries \nand dozens of industries.\n  The Bank's portfolio is also well collateralized, especially in its \nlarger product sector, and it maintains the loss rate of less than one-\nquarter of 1 percent.\n  Moreover, Ex-Im Bank's strong portfolio has withstood the test of \nnumerous market disruptions in the past.\n  Finally, the Bank is also self-funded largely through user fees \ncollected from foreign customers and has generated a surplus of close \nto $7 billion, money that has been sent to the U.S. Treasury to help \nlower our deficit.\n  So I urge all Members to reject this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, again, I think people have a short memory \nof\n\n[[Page H7705]]\n\nwhat happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the $150 billion loss \nthat those institutions incurred.\n  This amendment does not end the Bank. It allows loans to continue to \nbe made. It simply puts a firewall between a potential loss and the \ntaxpayers. Who bears the risk of loss? The taxpayers or the entity that \nmade the profit?\n  I suggest that there should be phased in over time 10 percent the \nfirst year, just 10 percent--that is a miniscule ask--that those who \nmake a profit from this Bank have a little skin in the game. Small \nbusinesses are exempted.\n  I ask for support of this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote \n``yes.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Royce\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1032, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PROHIBITION ON AID TO STATE-SPONSORS OF TERRORISM.\n\n       Section 2(b)(2) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 \n     U.S.C. 635(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) in the paragraph heading, by inserting ``or State-\n     Sponsors of Terrorism'' before the period;\n       (2) in subparagraph (A)--\n       (A) by striking ``or'' at the end of clause (i);\n       (B) by redesignating clause (ii) as clause (iii) and \n     inserting after clause (i) the following:\n       ``(ii) in connection with the purchase or lease of any \n     product by a country that is designated as a state-sponsor of \n     terrorism, or any agency or national thereof; or''; and\n       (C) in clause (iii) (as so redesignated), by inserting ``or \n     a state-sponsor of terrorism'' before the period;\n       (3) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) and (D) as \n     subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively, and inserting after \n     subparagraph (B) the following:\n       ``(C) State-sponsor of terrorism defined.--In this \n     paragraph, the term `state-sponsor of terrorism' means a \n     country the government of which the Secretary of State has \n     determined, for purposes of section 6(j)(1)(A) of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C.

Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Royce) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, I would explain to my colleagues at the \noutset that I, frankly, think we should voice vote this amendment \nwithout objection. I think it is misguided to oppose it because this \namendment is not part of this fight over Ex-Im.\n  What this fight is over, what this amendment is over, is my \nexperience in terms of the President using waivers. I will explain to \nyou my worry if we don't close this loophole, which I frankly think it \nwould be very easy to close because I think the Senate would agree with \nus.\n  But Export-Import Bank loans and guarantees obviously would be \nabsolutely off limits to state sponsors of terrorism if we write the \nlaw correctly. The worst of the worst--Iran, Syria, Sudan--should have \nthe Bank door slammed shut, period.\n  That is what this amendment does. No administration wiggle room, none \nat all.\n  One country where the Ex-Im has not operated in recent years is Iran. \nThis is because of our sanctions. But, of course, much of this \nsanctions regime is going to be suspended, misguidedly, as part of the \nPresident's nuclear deal.\n  So what does that mean?\n  For one, the administration is committed to making it possible for \nIran to purchase commercial aircraft. I think we can all agree, Ex-Im \nsupporters and opponents alike, that Iran should not be entitled to \nAmerican taxpayer-financed aircraft deals.\n  Iran has a long history of using its commercial airlines to support \nits terrorist proxies. Its commercial flights are now flying military \npersonnel to Syria. When I say ``now,'' I mean right now.\n  Iran is on a roll in the region undermining our partners and backing \nthe murderous Assad regime in Syria.\n  Now, some parts of U.S. law, most notably in the Foreign Assistance \nAct, do prevent Ex-Im from engaging with state sponsors of terrorism. \nBut these commonsense prohibitions are subject to Presidential waivers, \nand we have seen the President abuse waivers to pursue his agenda over \nand over again on Iran, no matter what Congress thinks.\n  Without consulting Congress, the administration signed us up for an \nagreement that will waive sanctions year after year until Iran has \nnuclear breakout capability. That is the way I think this ends.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, the Foreign Affairs Committee that I chair is \ncontinuing to examine the Iran agreement in great detail. We understand \nhow this administration has abused its authority to force a deal that \nallows the Ayatollah to keep a path to a nuclear weapon, in my view, \nwith little regard for the views of the American people or their \nRepresentatives in Congress.\n  This is not just about Iran. The administration is unilaterally \nbending, ignoring, and rewriting law to advance his agenda here at home \ntoward Cuba and elsewhere.\n  So this amendment protects against executive overreach. It would \nstrengthen existing law by prohibiting any bank activities in \nconnection with the purchase or lease of any product by a country that \nis designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, to include any agency or \nnational of that government, and it prohibits the waivers that are \ncurrently exercised by the President.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  That means that anyone who is a national of Iran or an appendage of \nthat state sponsor of terrorism cannot benefit from the Bank. The \nIranian Government and its Revolutionary Guards--which is increasingly \ninvolved in transportation, in energy, in construction, and in \ntelecommunications--are set to profit from the President's nuclear \nagreement. Now, that is bad enough. But they shouldn't be getting Ex-Im \nbacking on top of that.\n  Mr. Chairman, given my experience with this President with the \nwaivers he has already given, I want that loophole closed. I don't \nthink there is a reason for a debate on this. I think it should be \nvoice-voted, and I think the Senate will concur in that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, this amendment, more than any other, is\n\n[[Page H7706]]\n\nthe one most clearly aimed at fracturing the majority coalition that \nhas overwhelmingly backed the reauthorization of the Export-Import \nBank.\n  For Members who might feel pressure to vote for this amendment, I \nurge you to keep in mind that you would also be voting to send the Ex-\nIm provision in this bill to conference and directly into the hands of \nChairman Hensarling and Chairman Shelby, which will prove fatal to the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  Moreover, the Foreign Assistance Act as well as the omnibus spending \nbill the House adopted last December both prohibit Ex-Im support to \nstate sponsors of terrorism, and there is no reason to believe that \nwill change.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge Members to appreciate the extraordinary \nefforts it has taken Members on both sides of the aisle to get us to \nthis point, and I call on my colleagues to reject this poison pill \namendment that is designed to upend the reauthorization of the Bank.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that, with or without passage of \nthis amendment, the transportation bill with the Ex-Im language is \ngoing to conference with the Senate. That is the next step in this \nprocedure.\n  I understand some believe this, and I understand some have been told \nthat this in some way affects that conference. I don't think so. It is \ngoing to go to conference. I do not understand the reason to object to \nthis because I think, frankly, whether you are for Ex-Im or against Ex-\nIm, at the end of the day, you don't want the President to have this \nparticular waiver. I don't think Members here want that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), who has had so much courage.\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, first, before we talk about the substance of the \namendment, let's look at the lay of the land. I am a farmer by trade. \nThat is always something you do, you look at the lay of the land.\n  The six principal authors of the 10 amendments offered today, all \nmembers of Financial Services, none of them were proponents 6 months \nago when we were attempting, pleading to bring this bill up for \nconsideration.\n  None of these six, as I remember, demanded that we bring the bill up \n3 months ago when frustration caught up with us. None of these six \nsigned the discharge petition to use a rule of the House to allow this \nbody to have its say. I don't believe any of these six authors actually \nvoted to discharge the petition or voted for the final product last \nweek when 313 Members of this body and a majority of the majority voted \nfor it. So understand the lay of the land. Understand the nature.\n  Now, I have the greatest respect for the chairman of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee. I sat next to him for 20 years on Financial \nServices. He is extremely sincere. My friends, the issues he brings up \nin this amendment are relevant, but his chairmanship of the committee \nhe presides over has primary jurisdiction on this.\n  This particular amendment would address a small part of one part of \nthe things the Federal Government does. Maybe we need a bill to address \nall of these kinds of situations. Maybe we need--as we should have had \non Export-Import in Financial Services--a thoughtful and considerate \nprocess to craft a good, solid piece of legislation. I know he is \ncapable of it. I know he can do it. I want him to do it.\n  But let's do it in that concept of regular order in regular process. \nLet's not take this situation where we have had to do extraordinary \nthings to give the House a chance to make the decision. Let's not take \nthis situation now and in the spirit of the folks who set up the \ndischarge process 100-plus years ago say: Well, the House decided, but \nreally the House's opinion doesn't matter. Now we are going to redo it. \nWe are going to go a different way.\n  Now, Mr. Chairman, I have faith this evening that, after my \ncolleagues have listened to this debate on 10 amendments, when they \ncome to the floor and vote on all 10 amendments, they will turn all 10 \ndown. I am sorry, my colleagues, that you have to do this, because we \nshouldn't be here doing this tonight. This was decided last week.\n  But I hope if we will send a clear message and turn back all 10 \namendments, that this will be over with. Let's not do this again next \nweek. That is contrary to the spirit of the House.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), another member the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have tremendous respect for the author \nand his intention here, but any amendment to the Ex-Im title means the \nEx-Im title is open to the conference, which will kill the Ex-Im Bank. \nSo we should not adopt an amendment that mostly restates existing law. \nWe have, already, provisions which prevent the Bank from financing \nstate sponsors of terrorism.\n  First, the Bank's own charter, which I helped draft, prohibits them \nfrom extending loans or any assistance to any entity that violates U.S. \nsanctions.\n  Second, as the gentleman points out, the Foreign Assistance Act \nprohibits any aid to state sponsors of terrorism but allows for a \nPresidential waiver, but that is a national security waiver, which is \nvery limited.\n  I commend the gentleman for his amendment because it has caused the \nEx-Im Bank to issue, just an hour ago, a pledge not to seek any waiver \nunder any circumstances that they can concurrently conceive of.\n  But third, and most importantly, the last 10 appropriations bills \nhave an absolute ban on the Ex-Im Bank helping state sponsors of \nterror, and there is no waiver allowed. Now, I would like the next \nomnibus bill, which already has this provision in it, to have the \ngentleman's language in it as well, and I look forward to working on \nthat.\n\n                                                 November 4, 2015.\n     Re: Letter Concerning Prohibitions Related to State Sponsors \n         of Terrorism.\n\n     Hon. Fred P. Hochberg,\n     Chairman and President, Export Import Bank of the United \n         States, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hochberg: Thank you for your letter outlining \n     the position of the Bank in opposition to support for exports \n     to countries designated state sponsors of terrorism.\n       As we have discussed, there may be an effort to sell or \n     lease civilian aircraft to Iran Air or other Iranian \n     airlines, and that there may be efforts to secure export \n     credit agency support for such sales or leases. I am \n     therefore grateful for your acknowledgement that there is no \n     scenario that you currently foresee where a Presidential \n     Waiver would be sought to provide loans for export of any \n     items to these countries or any person from those countries.\n       I understand, of course, that unforeseen and even bizarre \n     circumstances may arise in international affairs; but given \n     the current state of our relations with these countries, I am \n     pleased to hear that you cannot anticipate any scenario where \n     we would provide Ex-Im Bank assistance to state sponsors of \n     terrorism.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Brad Sherman,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 November 4, 2015.\n     Hon. Brad Sherman,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Sherman: Pursuant to applicable law, the \n     Export-Import Bank of the United States does not finance any \n     transactions for designated state sponsors of terrorism. As \n     you know, transactions involving the three existing state \n     sponsors of terrorism--the Republic of Sudan, the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran, and the Syrian Arab Republic--are already \n     subject to numerous additional restrictions. As Chairman and \n     President of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, I \n     do not anticipate any scenario in which the Bank would seek a \n     waiver from the President of the United States as \n     contemplated by (i) section 620A of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371), or (ii) the Arms Export Control \n     Act (22 U.S.C. 2780(g)), in connection with a transaction \n     involving a country designated as a state sponsor of \n     terrorism, or any transaction involving any person from any \n     such countries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Fred P. Hochberg,\n                                           Chairman and President.\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded \nvote.\n\n[[Page H7707]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Schweikert\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1032, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _____. USE OF FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.\n\n       The Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635 et seq.) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 16. USE OF FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.\n\n       ``The Bank shall prepare the financial statements of the \n     Bank in accordance with fair value accounting principles.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my fellow Members, let's do some basic accounting, \nsomething we would all remember from our accounting 101 class. How many \ntimes tonight in the debate have we had the discussion: Oh, Ex-Im Bank, \nits losses are absolutely tiny? I have heard numbers tonight of 1.7 \npercent. But do any of you remember the hearing with the head of the \nExport-Import Bank where we asked the question: Can you tell me your \nimpairment?\n  Remember, a charge-off is a loss; an impairment is someone who is not \npaying.\n  Mr. Chairman, the head of the Ex-Im Bank just stared at us with \nreally angry eyes. He just stared at us. It turns out that the Bank \ngames their losses. This is how they report such a great number.\n  If I turned to you and said, ``Hey, your neighborhood bank has a loan \non the books that has sat there for 55 years without a payment,'' \nwouldn't you think that would have not been in the impairment category \nthat is not reported under their current accounting methodology, but \nwould have been charged off or forced to be charged off? Could you \nimagine a Dodd-Frank-regulated bank keeping a loan with no payment for \n55 years? They still have a $36 million loan to pre-Castro Cuba on \ntheir books. We found lots of this sort of stuff because of the \naccounting methodology.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very simple. It just basically says \nto do what the rest of the financial world has to do and use fair value \naccounting.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition \nto the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nSchweikert), which would do little to strengthen or improve the Export-\nImport Bank. Rather, the amendment is a cynical attempt to inaccurately \nand artificially inflate the cost of the programs offered by the Bank. \nAll this would achieve is confusion regarding the real-world state of \nthe Bank's fiscal health.\n  The fact of the matter is the Export-Import Bank has been \nextraordinarily careful in its risk management, which has resulted in a \ndividend to taxpayers of close to $7 billion. This is real money, and \nto pretend it isn't real for accounting purposes just isn't credible.\n  Overwhelmingly, majorities in the House and Senate have passed \nidentical reauthorization measures that deliberately excluded this \nprovision, and adding it back now would only serve to undermine the \nBank's reauthorization.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nSherman), who serves on the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman, this Bank is important. That is why Ronald \nReagan said on January 30, 1984, that the Export-Import Bank \ncontributes in a significant way to our Nation's export sales. We \nshould not adopt an unnecessary amendment, the effect of which would be \nto kill the Bank.\n  Now, this amendment deals with accounting. As co-chair of the CPA \nCaucus, I understand the importance of solid accounting rules. As a \nCPA, we are the referees that make sure that accounting rules are \nfollowed.\n  The amendment talks about fair value accounting, more properly \ndescribed as fantasy value accounting. Don't confuse fair value \naccounting with anything that is used in private enterprise or anywhere \nelse. It is not the same as generally accepted accounting principles. \nStick with generally accepted accounting principles. Stick with the \nprinciples consistent with the CBO, and those principles show you that \nthe Bank makes money for the Treasury, which is why it transfers half a \nbillion to a billion dollars a year.\n  Under fantasy value accounting, we don't look at whether the Bank is \nmaking money. We look at whether they would be making money if we lived \nin a fair world. So you would say, for example, in looking at the cost \nof funds and what it takes to borrow money, you could look at the \naccounting statements of Pizza Hut and say: Don't look at what they \nactually paid as interest costs, but what they would have paid in a \nfair world where they had the same interest rate as Jack's Pizzeria.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  Well, maybe we don't live in a fair world. But the fact is, generally \naccepted accounting principles are to determine whether a company or \nentity is making or losing money in the real world. Stick with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. Stick with the CBO. Stick \nwith the CPAs. Stick with GAAP. Say ``no'' to fantasy value accounting.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  You would be happy to know and my friend from California would be \nhappy to know CBO actually supports fair value accounting.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher), a real champion and a \nleader to reauthorize the Bank.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Chairman, once again, let's go back to the facts. \nThe facts are this is a Republican reform bill. The gentleman from \nSouth Carolina is listening. This doesn't cost the taxpayer a dime.\n  The scare tactics from my colleagues that are trying to kill the Bank \nare not going to work. This returns $500 million to $1 billion per year \nto the Treasury to help pay down the debt.\n  My colleagues that are in opposition to this talk about us picking \nwinners and losers, the supporters of the Ex-Im Bank. Well, do you know \nwhat? We are picking winners: American jobs. Those are the winners \nhere.\n  This is shameful that we are having this debate tonight at 10:00 on \nan issue that could have been handled in our committee a year ago. And \nthe gentleman talks about hearings. Well, we haven't had any hearings \nin how many months? I don't know if we have had any this Congress. We \nhad some last Congress. We haven't had any this Congress.\n  This is how we fix issues. We have hearings, we have markups, we \ndebate them in committee, and then we move items to the floor. But that \ndidn't happen this time.\n  So what we have is we have 10 amendments. As the gentleman from \nOklahoma said a few minutes ago, the Bank is already dead. They \nsucceeded. But they want to bury the Bank now.\n  Let's put American jobs first and put political scorecards and trying \nto out-conservative each other for some ranking in some book last. \nLet's work for our districts and not play political games, Mr. \nChairman.\n  I urge my colleagues, once again, to vote ``no'' on all of these \namendments. Let's put people back in charge.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, may I request how much time is \nremaining on both sides?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 3 minutes remaining. \nThe gentlewoman from California has 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 90 seconds to the good \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney).\n\n[[Page H7708]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to encourage my colleagues, if \nthey vote for one and only one of these Export-Import Bank amendments, \nthey should vote for this one.\n  In fact, I would bring to their attention that they probably have \nalready voted for it before because, in the last two Congresses, we \nhave voted to put the Federal agencies on fair value accounting and \npassed that out of the House. We have already done it. I don't know \nwhere the objections were at that time, but we have already done this \nas a House, and we should do it again.\n  To the gentleman from California's point regarding GAAP, let's be \nhonest with people. Let's be honest. The government doesn't use GAAP. \nThe government does not use GAAP the way that most ordinary people \nunderstand it. We use GAAP for government, which is entirely different.\n  Let's just settle on this amendment so that we can count in a way \nthat people understand, that if you lent money to the Batista regime \nbefore Castro and it hasn't been paid yet, maybe it is a bad loan; if \nyou lent money to Chiang Kai-shek, maybe that is a bad loan. Let's \nstart counting in ways that ordinary people can understand. This is not \na poison pill. It is just good governance.\n  And, most importantly, Mr. Chairman, it would not change the way the \nBank functions in any way whatsoever. All it would do is change the way \nthe Bank counts and tells Congress and the American people how it is \nperforming. I strongly encourage that if you are going to vote for one \nExport-Import amendment, this would be the one.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, this is what our \naccountant friend, Mr. Sherman, called fairytale value accounting. But \nfurther than that, President George W. Bush calls this fuzzy math.\n  We have heard everything this evening. We have had every attempt to \ntry to kill the Export-Import Bank, and now we are into this fuzzy, \nfairytale math that is being presented by my friend.\n  I urge my friends to vote ``no'' on this amendment. I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, all right. So fuzzy math, even though \nwe now require the International Monetary Fund to use fair value \naccounting, even though many of you, when you voted for the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program, demanded fair value accounting. We now demand \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when they are doing their projections, to \nuse fair value accounting. And a whole bunch of us in this room have \nvoted for that.\n  Let's actually touch on that. Mr. Chairman, forgive me because I am \ngoing to try to find the most elegant way to say this.\n  My friend from Tennessee now multiple times has referred to a \nscorecard. Okay? So how many people are voting for this for donations? \nJust a theoretical question. I mean, if you are going to impugn, be \ncareful.\n  Many of us have been working on this issue since the day we arrived \nat this body before it was ever a political issue bouncing up through \nthe blogosphere. This is a problem.\n  Our amendment here, a fair value accounting, has actually been \nsupported by the gentlemen sitting across from me who opposes this. You \nhave all voted. You have all voted to put all of government on fair \nvalue accounting.\n  But now all of a sudden, when it is an actual reform to the Ex-Im \nBank because we might actually understand the value of risk and what is \nreally going on and actually maybe understand what belongs in the \nimpairment category instead of the charge-off category, we would get \nsome honest information. That is what this amendment will do.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 23 Offered by Mr. Westmoreland\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 23 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n       Page 1032, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROCEDURES REQUIRED IN RESPONSE TO COMMENT ALLEGING \n                   ECONOMIC HARM WILL RESULT IF PROPOSED BANK \n                   TRANSACTION IS APPROVED.\n\n       Section 3(c) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 \n     U.S.C. 635a(c)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(11) Procedures required in response to comment alleging \n     economic harm will result if proposed bank transaction is \n     approved.--If the Board of Directors receives a comment from \n     a representative of a United States company, in response to a \n     notice that the Board has caused to be published in the \n     Federal Register, that alleges that the company will suffer \n     economic harm if a proposed Bank transaction is approved, \n     then, unless the Board unanimously votes to do otherwise, the \n     Board shall provide for--\n       ``(A) a 60-day discussion period that begins at the end of \n     the comment period otherwise required by law, with respect to \n     all comments received by the Board in response to the notice, \n     which period shall be extended by not more than 60 days if at \n     least 1 Board member recommends such an extension; and\n       ``(B) an opportunity for any such commenter who makes such \n     an allegation to appear before the Board and be heard with \n     respect to the notice if at least 1 Board member recommends \n     that the commenter be invited to do so.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I want to clarify a few things. This \nis not a poison pill. My amendment is not a poison pill.\n  My friend from Oklahoma said that he wanted to play by the rules. \nThat is what I want to do. I have got an amendment that I never had an \nopportunity to submit. Do you know why? Because of the discharge \nposition.\n  The authors of the discharge petition chose to have it brought up \nunder a closed rule. So I never got a chance. My 700,000 people never \nhad a chance.\n  Now, I don't know how many people in Frog Jump, Tennessee, buy wide-\nbodied planes. I am sure there are probably one or two that buy them. \nBut I have got 6,000 Delta employees, both current and retired, that \nlive in my district.\n  What this amendment does is it allows a fair playing field to where \nyou can go to the board of directors at Ex-Im Bank and give your \nanalysis, not to the Ex-Im--that is almost like giving your complaint \nto the opposition's attorney. We want to go to the board because it is \nnot fair.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the record a Wall Street Journal article \ncalled ``Boeing Helped Craft Own Loan Rule.'' They have been cooking \nthe books.\n  All we want to do is have a chance where we can go to the board of \ndirectors and present our case because, when Ex-Im is cooking the books \nwith Boeing, that doesn't leave us much of a chance.\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 12, 2015]\n\n                   Boeing Helped Craft Own Loan Rule\n\n                           (By Brody Mullins)\n\n       Washington.--When the Export-Import Bank sought to respond \n     to critics with tighter rules for aircraft sales, it reached \n     out to a company with a vested interest in the outcome: \n     Boeing Co., the biggest beneficiary of the bank's assistance.\n       For months in 2012, according to about 50 pages of emails \n     reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the bank worked with \n     Boeing to write rules that would satisfy critics in Congress \n     and the domestic commercial airline industry--while leaving \n     most sales of Boeing's airplanes to foreign carriers \n     unscathed.\n       Ex-Im Bank, which helps finance the purchase of U.S. \n     exports through loans and guarantees, is the target of \n     Republicans who want to kill it, in part because they say it \n     mostly provides subsidies to America's largest companies. The \n     Boeing emails will add fuel to that fight.\n       The previously unreported documents, obtained through an \n     open-records request, show how the two sides swapped ideas, \n     drafts and data on sales of wide-body airplanes. Ex-Im Bank \n     officials pushed their Boeing counterparts for information. \n     Boeing suggested changes to the bank's draft proposal.\n       They reveal an extraordinary level of coordination between \n     public officials and corporate executives. In a message one \n     Saturday morning, Bob Morin, then the bank's\n\n[[Page H7709]]\n\n     head of aircraft financing, sent a plea: ``If Boeing expects \n     Ex-Im Bank to continue supporting wide-body aircraft, we need \n     to get this right.''\n       When Congress renewed the bank's charter in 2012, the bank \n     was required to publish its methodology for determining which \n     transactions were significant enough to trigger an additional \n     ``economic-impact review'' and, potentially, rejection.\n       The requirement didn't specifically include aircraft \n     purchases, but Delta Air Lines Inc. and some lawmakers wanted \n     the bank to include them in the rules, too.\n       That's when Boeing and Ex-Im Bank started discussing how \n     the rule should be written. Many of the emails between the \n     bank and Boeing deal with the guidelines the bank was \n     creating to determine which aircraft transactions would \n     trigger the additional review.\n       The collaboration appears to have worked. In the nearly two \n     years since the rule went into effect, no Boeing sales have \n     been nixed as a result.\n       Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush recently joined \n     the chorus of conservatives questioning the bank's purpose. \n     In late February, he told a gathering of the Club for Growth, \n     a conservative advocacy group, that the government should \n     consider whether this kind of financing ``should be phased \n     out.'' The bank's current authorization expires June 30 and \n     the lobbying battle is heating up.\n       Its usual supporters include lawmakers of both parties, \n     including House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) and Minority \n     Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), as well as the U.S. Chamber \n     of Commerce, major labor unions, manufacturers and Wall \n     Street banks.\n       Officials at Boeing declined to comment on the emails. In \n     general, said Tim Myers, president of Boeing Capital Corp., \n     Boeing's aircraft-financing unit, ``it would be only \n     natural'' for the bank to ask for input since Boeing is the \n     only U.S. maker of wide-body commercial aircraft.\n       Tim Keating, the company's top Washington lobbyist, called \n     the interaction an example of how government should work: \n     ``There doesn't have to be a full hostile relationship \n     between the regulator and the regulated,'' he said.\n       Matt Bevens, a spokesman for Ex-Im, said other countries \n     have their own export-financing agencies, but Ex-Im is the \n     only one that assesses the economic impact of its \n     transactions. Mr. Bevens, speaking on behalf of the \n     individual employees named in the emails, said the bank \n     developed the new guidelines voluntarily and that it would \n     have been ``irresponsible if Ex-Im Bank had failed to consult \n     the only American manufacturer of commercial aircraft.''\n       Bank supporters say foreign airlines would buy planes from \n     European rival Airbus Group NV without Ex-Im financing. \n     Boeing customers are among the biggest recipients of Ex-Im \n     Bank loan guarantees. In the most recent fiscal year ended \n     Sept. 30, 2014, the bank helped Boeing sell 61 wide-body \n     planes to foreign airlines by guaranteeing more than $7 \n     billion in loans.\n       Overall, in that fiscal year the bank guaranteed $20.5 \n     billion in financing for U.S. exports. The bank charges a fee \n     on its loans and made $675 million in profit that it sent to \n     the U.S. Treasury.\n       Yet while the bank helps some American exporters, it irks \n     other domestic firms.\n       Delta, for one, says the bank's financing gives rivals such \n     as Emirates Airline, Thai Airways International PLC and Air \n     India an advantage in their aircraft purchases that isn't \n     available to U.S. carriers. For some foreign airlines, Ex-Im \n     Bank's financing can be less expensive than a standard \n     commercial loan.\n       It's amid such criticisms that the Ex-Im Bank and Boeing \n     collaboration began. In August 2012, a bank official \n     forwarded a draft proposal on the economic-impact trigger to \n     several senior executives at Boeing and its aircraft-\n     financing unit.\n       ``Please note that this is an internal Ex-Im document still \n     in draft form, but we wanted to get your input on several \n     aspects of it prior to further developing the paper,'' wrote \n     Claire Avett, an Ex-Im policy analyst on Friday, Aug. 31.\n       ``We look forward to working closely with you to define \n     concrete next steps to be able to achieve these ends,'' she \n     wrote, referring to imminent internal deadlines.\n       The next morning, Saturday, Sept. 1, a second bank official \n     sent a follow-up email. ``We do not have a lot of time,'' \n     wrote Mr. Morin, the Ex-Im official in charge of aircraft \n     financing.\n       The emails suggest Ex-Im Bank officials wanted Boeing's \n     help to write guidelines that would limit the number of \n     additional reviews on aircraft purchases.\n       ``Subjecting and applying other transactions to detailed \n     analysis under economic impact procedures has had the effect \n     of killing most of those deals,'' wrote Mr. Morin, in the \n     Sept. 1 email. ``Accordingly, it is very important that we \n     establish the correct procedures here,'' he said.\n       Mr. Bevens, the Ex-Im Bank spokesman, says those deals were \n     killed by delays and uncertainty created by the review \n     process, not the review process itself. He said those delays \n     are why Boeing and its suppliers opposed subjecting aircraft \n     purchases to potentially lengthy scrutiny.\n       A few hours later on Sept. 1, a senior official at Boeing \n     Capital responded that the company was working ``to look at \n     what data we can pull together.'' The Boeing official, Kristi \n     Kim, director of aircraft financial services at Boeing \n     Capital, said the company was building model impact studies \n     ``to see how the data would vary.''\n       Tim Neale, a spokesman for Boeing, said the company's goal \n     was to ensure that the reviews were ``based on reasonable \n     criteria.''\n       On Sept. 6, James Cruse, a senior vice president at Ex-Im's \n     policy and planning group, wrote to Boeing to thank the \n     company for its input. ``We recognize we are pushing and \n     pressing you in ways that are not in your natural strike zone \n     (and may verge toward ridiculous),'' he wrote.\n       The next month, the partners delved into nitty-gritty \n     details, including the time frame that would be used to \n     assess economic impact (shortening the time period to 12 \n     months might be best, one Boeing official suggested). They \n     settled on 12 months.\n       They also discussed who would conduct the reviews, if they \n     were ever triggered. Boeing itself was an option because it \n     had access to industry data. Other options were Ex-Im Bank or \n     an outside consulting firm.\n       In one email where the two sides discussed who should \n     conduct the analysis, Ms. Avett, the Ex-Im Bank policy \n     analyst, asks for input on ``what would be most palatable to \n     Boeing.''\n       In the end, Ex-Im Bank took the job of performing the \n     reviews. In the two years since the new rules went into \n     effect, Ex-Im has helped finance roughly 50 aircraft deals. \n     Just one of those--a lease deal of Boeing planes by Aeroflot \n     Russian Airlines--triggered the detailed economic review. \n     Ultimately, that transaction was approved.\n\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Emirates Airline probably has the money to pay for \nthese wide-bodied jets. But I respect Mr. Heck from Washington because \nhe is fighting for people that work in his district. That is what I am \ntrying to do. I am trying to work and fight for those folks in my \ndistrict.\n  All we want is an opportunity to take an analysis, a real analysis, \nnot one that the Ex-Im Bank called Boeing and said: You know what? You \nneed to revise this number so we can understand or we can make a claim \nfor the analysis that you need the money.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong \nopposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nWestmoreland), which, with all due respect, is a solution in search of \na problem that, if adopted, will only serve to undermine the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. businesses.\n  The fact is the Ex-Im Bank already has a process in place for \nproviding public notice and comment under which any member of the \npublic, including companies who believe they may have been harmed, may \nsubmit comments which the board reviews prior to approving any \ntransaction.\n  Lengthening this approval process by an additional 4 months, as the \ngentleman's amendment would do, would only serve to hurt our exporters \nby preventing them from competing in time-sensitive deals. Our U.S. \nexporters need and deserve every competitive edge they can get.\n  I urge my Members to reject this unnecessary and burdensome \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to tell the \ngentlewoman that it is not 4 months. It is 60 days. Is 60 days too much \nto ask that you could go present your case in front of the board of \ndirectors? I think that is just fair.\n  To the gentlewoman from California, I understand, but you are just \nreading something that your staff has given you. It is not 4 months. \nThis is a new idea. I never got the chance to offer this amendment.\n  Mr. Fincher, with the discharge petition, evidently wrote a perfect \nbill. I have been doing this for 25 years. I have never seen a perfect \nbill. We are trying to perfect the bill that Mr. Fincher wrote and that \nthe discharge petition brought to the floor on a closed rule where \nnobody could have any amendments.\n  All I am trying to do is get a fair shake for my folks, just like Mr. \nHeck of Washington is trying to get a fair shake for his. Give me the \nopportunity. Give us an opportunity to do that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, what the gentleman \ndoesn't realize is we are all trying to get a fair chance for our \nconstituents, the small businesses and the jobs.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n\n[[Page H7710]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member.\n  Here we have another Delta amendment once again. The Ex-Im Bank \nalready, Mr. Chairman, has a process in place for providing public \nnotice and comment. Companies can provide feedback, which the board \nreviews prior to approving any transaction.\n  I can tell you that this is very dilatory again. All of Delta's \nlawsuits have all been thrown out. This is only another attempt to \nforce the Ex-Im Bank to delay. The frustrating delay is doing its work.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote against this dilatory amendment.\n\n                              {time}  2200\n\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Georgia has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, my favorite literary theme is \nillusion reality, where you do not know whether you are in an illusion \nor you are in reality. It is greatly used throughout our culture and \ngreat movies, like ``The Stunt Man,'' with Peter O'Toole, or in classic \nliterature, like ``Ulysses,'' by--who?--James Joyce.\n  It is not a good axis on which to pivot around an argument regarding \npublic policy; so let's leave the illusion behind and go to reality. \nHere is the reality:\n  The Ex-Im does support jobs--164,000 last year. GAO, which you keep \nciting, approved its methodology. What is the proof? We have already \nlost nearly 1,000 jobs since you shuttered the doors of the Ex-Im. The \nreality is this is unilateral disarmament if we fail to reauthorize it. \nEvery other developed nation has an export authority.\n  The reality is that this reduces deficit. The Ex-Im reduces deficit. \nEvery year for 20 years, since the enactment of the Credit Reform Act, \nit has transferred cash. The heck with the accounting system--cash. The \nreality is a lot of these small businesses don't have an alternative.\n  Steve Wilburn, who is the CEO of FirmGreen, stood before us last year \nand said: If you have got an alternative for my pending deal in Korea, \ntell me what it is. He lost the deal because of the cloud over Ex-Im. \nAn Indian company got the job. This issue is about jobs.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I don't know what the gentleman is \ntalking about with regard to reality because the reality is that my \nconstituents are losing jobs, and that is not fair.\n  I believe the gentleman is an attorney. All we want is an opportunity \nto go to the people who can make a decision and ask them to make that \ndecision within 60 days. I am not going to go to the attorney who is \nfighting me and say: ``Hey, here is my analysis--or here is my thing. \nTake it, and give it to somebody else.'' That is the fox looking after \nthe henhouse, and that is not the way we need to operate.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to \nhow much time I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher).\n  Mr. FINCHER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, this already is allowed in the current charter. I know \nthe gentleman from Georgia wants to play political games, but this is \nalready happening. Yes, it is. This is just another attempt to try to \nkill the Bank--to keep it dead, to bury it.\n  It is sad, Mr. Chairman. We worked on this reform package--this \nRepublican reform package--for a year and a half. Where was the \ngentleman from Georgia with his amendment? Mr. Mulvaney with his \namendments? and the other Members in this body with their amendments \nduring this year and a half? We didn't get to have a committee process, \nMr. Chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, where was the process by which he could offer his \namendment? No, Mr. Chairman. They wait until they could try to bury the \nBank here tonight and kill thousands of jobs and reward China and \nRussia.\n  We have to vote ``no'' on all of these amendments. Kill them all. \nLet's revive American jobs and do what is best for our constituents.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, to the gentleman from Frog Jump, if \nhe would read section 2(e)(7)(c) to (d), he would understand that my \namendment tries to amend the procedure. Now, I know he wrote the \nperfect bill, but I am trying to help the gentleman perfect it.\n  Mr. Chairman, the other thing is I never saw the gentleman's bill. I \nnever had a chance to amend the gentleman's bill. If the gentleman had \nallowed the open process--the right process--that the gentleman from \nOklahoma talked about, then I would have had a chance to have offered \nmy amendment; but, unfortunately, they chose to have a closed rule. So \ndon't talk to me about process, because the process has not been \nfollowed here.\n  I just want to make it clear that all I am trying to do is the same \nthing as everybody here is doing. I am trying to represent my \nconstituents. I think I deserve a chance to do that, and I think we \ndeserve a chance to perfect the bill that Mr. Fincher and the others \nbrought to the floor under a discharge petition.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), one of our champions on the \nreauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Mr. LUCAS. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, I will note to my colleagues that I think the world of \nthe gentleman from Georgia. He is a wonderful fellow as he is trying to \nhelp his people, but politics is like life--a lack of action is an \naction. When there was no action to help move an Export-Import \nreauthorization bill this spring or this summer, then the opportunity \nto do all of these great things went away. We all knew it was going to \nexpire in July, and the people in critical positions chose to let that \nhappen. Discharge was just an opportunity to resurrect what has already \ndied.\n  Now, I would say this:\n  Let's finish the process. Let's put it back on the books for 4 years. \nLet's start the hearing process. If there are reforms and changes that \nneed to be made, then let's file a new bill, and let's go with it; but \nlet's not stop the opportunities economically that are created by this \nin the intervening period of time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would say respectfully to my friend from Georgia, who \nhas out-Southerned me, you are wrong on this one, sir.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n             Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Young of Iowa\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Amend the table of contents by inserting after the item \n     pertaining to section 62001 the following:\n\n            TITLE LXIII--REQUIREMENTS REGARDING RULE MAKINGS\n\nSec. 63001. Requirements regarding rule makings.\n\n       Page 988, insert after line 20 the following:\n\n            TITLE LXIII--REQUIREMENTS REGARDING RULE MAKINGS\n\n     SEC. 63001. REQUIREMENTS REGARDING RULE MAKINGS.\n\n       For each publication in the Federal Register required to be \n     made by law and pertaining to a rule made to carry out this \n     Act\n\n[[Page H7711]]\n\n     or the amendments made by this Act, the agency making the \n     rule shall include in such publication a list of information \n     on which the rule is based, including data, scientific and \n     economic studies, and cost-benefit analyses, and identify how \n     the public can access such information online.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Iowa (Mr. Young) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We talk a lot about transparency and accountability around here. We \nhear about transparency and accountability needs from our constituents \nregarding the Federal Government. It is time to quit just talking the \ntalk and walk the talk.\n  The question is: How do rulemakers get their conclusions? How do they \ncome to a decision when they are working on rules and regulations?\n  They have certain science and data and criteria and analyses that \nthey look at, but we don't often get to see that. We hear their \nconclusions, and we wonder: How did they get to that conclusion? They \nused science, data, and analyses.\n  My amendment simply says that those scientific tools, data, and \nanalyses have to be made public and just posted online. It is pretty \nsimple. The data they used needs to go online so we can see it all as \nwell and have the same benchmark and be on the same page. Why shouldn't \nAmericans have access to this as well? Why shouldn't we have a more \ntransparent government? Just post a link on the Internet. Let's walk \nthe talk on transparency.\n  This amendment has been approved before as part of the REINS Act that \npassed 249-159. Now, the REINS Act looked at the whole Federal \nGovernment, but this amendment just pertains to the Department of \nTransportation. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is \ncommon sense. It is what our constituents demand--common sense and \ntransparency.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Foxx). The gentlewoman from Wisconsin is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, this amendment would not only undo all of \nDodd-Frank but all financial market regulations past, present, and \nfuture. I support the cost-benefit analyses mandates that are already \ncontained in Federal securities laws and in President Obama's executive \norders.\n  This particular amendment, of course, is dilatory, and it would mean \nthat rulemaking would take even longer as the SEC has struggled to meet \nthe impossibly subjective economic cost-benefit standards to stave off \nupcoming court battles over competing economic impact projections.\n  Not only that, Madam Chair, but the most dangerous part about this \ninitiative is that this would open the door to the most powerful \nindustry participants. If it were possible to make rules, they could \nchallenge the rules in a way that achieved their most narrow interests, \nand it would be to the detriment of investors or to the less affluent \nmarket participants. In this way, the most powerful industry interests \nwould not only be able to use the courts to undo consumer protections, \nbut they would also seek competitive advantages over competitors.\n  Current law already requires the SEC to conduct economic analyses, \npursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Congressional Review Act, \nand the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as other agencies do.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I heard my friend from the other side talk about the SEC and Dodd-\nFrank and executive orders. We are just, really, talking about any \nrules and regulations pertaining to this act--the transportation bill, \nprimarily the Department of Transportation.\n  I believe that it is very important that we have more transparency \nand accountability in government. I do not see what is wrong with the \nAmerican people being allowed to see the data, the cost-benefit \nanalyses, the science, and the criteria of those who make these rules. \nWhat is so wrong with that, with being on the same page?\n  I simply ask my colleagues to support this amendment. Transparency \nand accountability, we talk about it a lot, but we don't do enough of \nit. I have some other great transparency and accountability amendments, \nand we will worry about those later. Right now, I am asking my \ncolleagues to support transparency and accountability. Let the American \npeople see how we make decisions that affect their lives.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, will the Chair advise me as to how much time \nI have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Wisconsin has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, I appreciate the fact that the gentleman has \nclaimed that he is restricting this to the highway bill; but, again, it \nis problematic because it would really impose cost-benefit analyses on \nall rulemaking under the highway bill, as amended.\n  It would require several rulemakings from the SEC that are related to \nemerging growth companies, private security transaction exemptions, and \ndisclosure reforms. It would require the SEC to comply with this \nadditional hurdle that is administratively burdensome and that opens up \nthe SEC to additional litigation risks. It is not just limited to the \ntransportation bill just in terms of its multiplier impact.\n\n                              {time}  2215\n\n  This legislation is just yet another veiled attempt to stop the Ex-Im \nBank, which we have discussed earlier today, because it, again, would \ncreate a sufficiently high bar to pass new rulemaking and open up every \nSEC rule to ongoing litigation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Transparency is a good thing. Shining sunlight is a good thing. It is \nthe best disinfectant out there.\n  Why can't we know, the American people, the science and the cost \nbenefit behind the rules and regulations that are inflicted upon the \nAmerican people, good or bad, whatever they are?\n  Madam Chairman, the other side, my friend mentioned the Ex-Im Bank. I \nam not in that battle with this amendment. This is just about general \nrules and regulations, the science behind them. Why can't the American \npeople know what it is? We will all be on the same playing field, so we \nknow what we are talking about. It is a good thing.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, this has been misnamed as a transparency \nbill. It is not a transparency bill. This cost benefit bill literally \nis a race-to-the-courthouse bill, and we would just be in an endless \nlitigious position.\n  We are already late with the transportation bill. We have already \ncreated great uncertainty for all of our cities, counties, and towns in \nAmerica. Why would we now want to subject our broken bridges and our \nbroken transportation system to yet another dilatory tactic that sort \nof slows down our ability to create good jobs and to fix our \ninfrastructure?\n  Madam Chair, I would urge all Members to vote against this initiative \nbecause it is wrong-headed at a time when we really need to get our \ntransportation infrastructure improvements back on track.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time \nto close.\n  So we can't find out what the science is. At the same time, we don't \neven know who these nameless, faceless folks are in the bureaucracy who \nare putting out these rules and regulations. Why are we to be left in \nthe dark? What is wrong with transparency? Sunlight is the best \ndisinfectant. The American people are tired of this, are tired about \nthis veil around our government.\n  I don't care what administration it is, Republican, Democrat, why \nshould it matter. I put my name on a bill and amendment. You do, too. \nThese rules and regulations that come out, we have no idea who these \npeople are. They could be very well intended and that is fine. We don't \nknow what their titles are either. Are they experts in their fields? We \ndon't know. Where is the transparency?\n\n[[Page H7712]]\n\n  This amendment passed in a bipartisan way before. I am asking for my \ncolleagues to support it this time.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. MOORE. Madam Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Pompeo) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to have the GAO \nstudy an important issue that goes to the fairness of our \ntransportation user-fee system. For a decade, Congress has been \ndiverting millions of dollars in tax revenue into the highway trust \nfund at the expense of the general aviation community. This provision, \ncommonly known as the fuel fraud tax, was included in the 2005 highway \nbill. It was originally created to fight a problem that didn't exist \nand has now diverted hundreds of millions of dollars from aviation into \nthe highway trust fund.\n  This is simply unfair. It has to be fixed. The highway trust fund \nshould and must be supported by the user-fee system, just as the \naviation community is supported by a fuel tax.\n  Madam Chair, hopefully we can all agree that general aviation should \nnot be paying for this highway infrastructure. At the very least, \nrevenues paid by U.S. aviators under the fuel fraud provision should be \nreinvested in modernizing our Nation's airports and their navigation \nsystem.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Shuster and the ranking \nmember on this important issue, and I urge my colleagues to vote for \nthis amendment.\n  With that, Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Kansas (Mr. Pompeo).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Foster\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 12, after the item relating to section 62001, insert \n     the following:\n\nSec. 62002. Determination of certain spending and tax burdens by State.\n\n       Page 988, after line 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 62002. DETERMINATION OF CERTAIN SPENDING AND TAX BURDENS \n                   BY STATE.\n\n       (a) Calculation of Federal Revenue Contributions by \n     State.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Treasury, acting through \n     the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, shall \n     calculate the Federal tax burden of each State for each \n     calendar year.\n       (2) Calculation of federal tax burden.--For purposes of \n     calculating the Federal tax burden of each State under \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall--\n       (A) treat Federal taxes paid by an individual as a burden \n     on the State in which such individual resides; and\n       (B) treat Federal taxes paid by a legal business entity as \n     a burden on each State in which economic activity of such \n     entity is performed in the same proportion that the economic \n     activity of such entity in such State bears to the economic \n     activity of such entity in all the States.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than the date that is 180 days after \n     the beginning of each calendar year, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall--\n       (A) submit to Congress a report containing the results of \n     the calculations described in sections 1 and 2 with respect \n     to such calendar year; and\n\n[[Page H7720]]\n\n       (B) publish the report on a publicly accessible website of \n     the Internal Revenue Service.\n       (b) Annual Report on the Flow of Transportation Funds by \n     State.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than the first Monday in \n     February of each year, the Secretary of Transportation shall, \n     in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, submit to \n     the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the Committee on \n     Ways and Means of the House of Representatives a report that \n     includes--\n       (A) a description of the total amount of the funds \n     authorized by this Act which were obligated with respect to \n     each State during the last ending fiscal year,\n       (B) a description of the total amount of revenue \n     contributed from each State to the Highway Trust Fund during \n     such fiscal year.\n       (2) Determination of state amounts.--For purposes of this \n     subsection--\n       (A) In general.--the State with respect to which an amount \n     is obligated and the State from which revenue is contributed \n     shall be determined under principles similar to the \n     principles for determining the Federal tax burden of each \n     State under subsection (a).\n       (B) Special rule for general fund transfers.--For purposes \n     of paragraph (1)(B), any transfer from the general fund of \n     the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund during any fiscal year \n     shall be taken into account as revenue contributed from each \n     State in proportion to each State's Federal tax burden (as \n     determined under subsection (a)) for the calendar year in \n     which such fiscal year began.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Foster) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their hard work on this bill.\n  Madam Chairman, my amendment is simple. It requires the Department of \nTransportation to send an annual report to Congress on how much funding \neach State has received from the highway trust fund and how much each \nState has contributed to the highway trust fund both directly through \nthe gas tax and related fees and taxes and indirectly through transfers \nfrom the general fund.\n  To understand why this is important, let's step back and ask how it \nis that we actually decide how much transportation money is spent in \neach State. The bulk of this funding takes the form of formula grants \nto States with overall allocations often set by whatever was done in \nprevious years. This may tell us a lot about congressional politics in \nyears gone by, but it tells us very little about good public policy.\n  All of this serves as a smokescreen which begs the real question: How \ndo we actually allocate our highway spending?\n  Now, I am a scientist, and I look at the facts.

Madam Chair, this plot shows the excellent correlation \nbetween the per capita transportation fund spending in each State with \nthe number of Senators per person that the State has. And that says a \nlot about how broken our transportation trust fund allocations are.\n  So how do we allocate transportation spending? Is it calculated per \ncapita, with each American getting roughly the same amount of \ntransportation spending? If this were the case, then transportation \nmoney would ultimately follow Americans to whatever States they chose \nto live in and could be applied to the best use in each State: elegant \nmass transportation systems in urban States, highways through the \nwilderness in rural States, and well-maintained commuter highways in \nsuburban States. Spending in this way would not be a distortion of our \neconomy.\n  But, Madam Chairman, that is not what we do. In fact, per capita \ntransportation spending varies by more than a factor of seven from \nState to State driven by a mysterious formulae handed down from \ngeneration to generation in Congress. So, in my State of Illinois, we \nget about $107 per person per year in transportation spending, and I \nhave a hard time explaining to my constituents why citizens of other \nStates should get $200, $400, $600, or more every year in Federal \nhighway spending.\n\n                              {time}  2330\n\n  The States that are getting rooked like this generally are the larger \nStates, as can be seen on this plot. In order to rectify this, I \nactually filed an amendment to replace the complex historical formulae \nwith a simple per capita allotment, which would have benefited the \nStates which contain 240 Members of the U.S. Congress. I was very \ndisappointed that it was decided that this amendment would not be in \norder.\n  Or perhaps we should divide the highway trust fund by economic \nproductivity and actual highway usage. In this case, each State should \ntake out from the Federal highway trust fund the same amount that it \npaid in in taxes. This approach would have an element of basic fairness \nand eliminate the economic distortions from massive transfers of wealth \nbetween the States.\n  But that is not what we do either. Many States are getting out of the \nFederal highway trust fund several times more money than they paid into \nit, while other States, States like Illinois, New York, Florida, New \nJersey, California, Michigan, Colorado, and many others are getting \nrooked. So the highway trust fund has simply become a vehicle for a \nmassive redistribution of wealth from one State to another.\n  Getting to the bottom of this is what my amendment is about. My \namendment would require the Department of Transportation to calculate \nin each year how much each State receives from the highway trust fund. \nThe report would also include an accounting of how much revenue each \nState put into the highway trust fund through both the gas tax and \nrelated contributions and contributions that were made through funds \ntransferred from general revenue.\n  While it is relatively easy to figure out how much revenue was \ncollected from each State via the gas tax or personal income tax, \ndetermining the same for business tax is less straightforward. A \nbusiness, for example, may file its taxes in Delaware, but most of its \neconomic production might occur in a factory in Ohio.\n  My amendment would require the IRS to assist the Department of \nTransportation in this analysis by looking not just at where a company \nfiles its taxes, but the State in which those tax dollars are \ngenerated. This kind of analysis has sporadically been done by private \nentities and nonprofits, but there has never been a sustained effort by \nthe Federal Government to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n[[Page H7721]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Williams\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 563, line 15, insert ``primarily'' before ``engaged''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Williams) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Chair, I am a second-generation auto dealer. I \nhave been in the industry for most of my life. I know it well.\n  As such, my one-word amendment will fix Senate language that puts \nunintentional new burdens on all rental car establishments.\n  My amendment will clarify the Senate language so it only applies to \nactual rental car companies, like it is supposed to.\n  The definition in the underlying bill, which the House never passed, \nis so broad that it sweeps up dealers who offer loaner vehicles or \nrentals as a convenience for their customers. My amendment leaves the \nregulations on all rental car companies, which compromise 99 percent of \nthe market, intact.\n  The Senate language is flawed because it simply is not tailored to \nsmall business. For example, under the bill, vehicles would be grounded \nfor weeks or months for such minor compliance matters as an airbag \nwarning sticker that might peel off the sun visor or an incorrect phone \nnumber printed in the owner's manual. The regulations in this bill are \nnot proportionate.\n  Another problem is that this bill favors multinational rental car \ncompanies at the expense of small businesses. This bill will regulate a \nsmall-business dealer with a fleet of five loaner vehicles the same way \nit would regulate a massive rental car company with hundreds of \nthousands of vehicles in their fleet.\n  The bill even allows large rental car companies additional compliance \ntime, which further disadvantages small businesses. Madam Chair, large \nbusinesses have regulatory and legal staffs available on-hand to help \nwith this burden, and they have the capital to pay millions of dollars \nin regulatory compliance costs.\n  The average small-business owner, however, is his or her own legal \nand regulatory staff. Without my amendment, this bill would impose new \ngovernment inspections, additional recordkeeping requirements, and new \npenalties up to $15 million on small businesses.\n  The Senate bill also gives the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration the authority to add more regulatory burdens as \nappropriate, and that is too open-ended.\n  Without my amendment, this bill could make it impractical for small-\nbusiness dealers to provide loaner or rental cars to their customers \nbecause it mandates vehicles be grounded for minor compliance matters \nwith a minimal impact on safety, and that is not what Congress' intent \nis or should be.\n  Madam Chair, in tax law, employment law, and other areas, Congress \nhas recognized the difference between big business and small business. \nLet's not regulate our Main Street businesses like multinational \ncorporations. Frankly, Main Street is hurting enough as it is.\n  Vote ``yes'' on the Williams amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, Mr. Williams' amendment unreasonably \nlimits the application of the Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental \nCar Act that is included in the Senate amendments to H.R. 22.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps), \nthe woman who has really been a leader for safety in the car rental \nfield.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Chair, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the Williams amendment.\n  This amendment would needlessly exempt auto dealers from critical \nvehicle safety requirements included in the underlying bill.\n  While Federal law currently prohibits auto dealers from selling new \ncars subject to a recall, there is no similar law prohibiting rental \ncompanies or auto dealers from renting or loaning out unrepaired \nrecalled vehicles.\n  I introduced the Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act to \nclose this loophole and prohibit rental car companies and auto dealers \nfrom renting or loaning vehicles under safety recall until they are \nfixed, and I am pleased this legislation is in the underlying bill.\n  This harmful amendment, however, would put lives at risk by exempting \nauto dealers from complying with this commonsense safety requirement.\n  GM, Honda, Chrysler, and other car manufacturers who have issued \nsafety recalls, are loaning out tens of thousands of cars to customers \nwhile the repairs are being made. Consumers expect that the loaner cars \nthey receive when they take their own cars into a dealership for \nrepairs are safe to drive. But rather than ensure these loaners are \nsafe, the Williams amendment would allow car dealers to give out loaner \ncars that have the same exact defect as the car that is being repaired.\n  The auto dealers are justifying this amendment by claiming that some \nsafety recalls aren't actually important enough to require immediate \nrepairs. This is ridiculous. NHTSA does not issue frivolous recalls. \nAll safety recalls pose serious safety risks and should be fixed as \nsoon as possible. Any claim otherwise is simply not true.\n  Madam Chair, it only takes one car with an unrepaired safety recall \nto tragically end a life. That is what happened to Raechel and Jackie \nHouck when their rented PT Cruiser caught fire and crashed into a \ntractor-trailer due to an unrepaired recall. And that is what happened \nto Jewel Brangman when she was killed by the unrepaired Takata airbag \nin her rented Honda Civic.\n  Loaned cars from auto dealers should be no different. The Williams \namendment would let these auto dealers off the hook and allow them to \nloan out defective cars to unsuspecting consumers. It creates a \nnonsensical double standard for rentals and loaner cars not based on \nhow unsafe they are, but based on who is renting or loaning them to the \npublic. Keeping unrepaired recalled cars parked in the lot and out of \nthe hands of consumers is common sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Williams amendment to \nensure all consumers can be confident that their rental car or their \nloaner car is safe to drive, regardless of whether they get it from a \nrental company or a dealership.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for her \nleadership.\n  I understand that everyone has car dealerships in their districts and \nthey are an important part of our economy, but this amendment serves \none purpose and one purpose only: allowing car dealers and rental car \ncompanies to evade responsibility.\n  Just like rental car companies, car dealerships rent and lease \nvehicles regularly. And just like rental car companies, car dealerships \nshould not be renting or leasing cars that are subject to a safety \nrecall without first repairing the defect. These are safety recalls on \ncars the auto manufacturers themselves have deemed necessary to repair.\n  Can you imagine bringing your car to a dealer to get a deadly Takata \nairbag replaced and then being given a loaner car with the same deadly \nTakata airbag to drive while your car is being repaired? That is the \nsituation that this amendment would allow.\n\n  Of all those subjected to the Safe Rental Car Act, car dealerships \nare in the best position to fix these recalled cars quickly.\n  Instead of this amendment, which weakens the Senate provision, the \nRules Committee should have made in order the gentlewoman's amendment \nexpanding the provision to ensure used cars are not sold until recalls \nare fixed.\n  Whether or not renting cars is the company's primary business makes \nno business. A defective car is a defective car.\n\n[[Page H7722]]\n\n  Rental companies and auto dealers alike have a responsibility to \ntheir customers, and we have a responsibility to ensure that consumers' \nlives are not put at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), my good friend who is an auto dealer.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman.\n  Madam Chair, I am fascinated. I have been here for 5 years. And the \nfact is that people who don't have any idea about how a business is run \nare constantly telling people how to run their business; they are \npeople who don't have the foggiest idea of who auto dealers are or who \nour responsibility is to and the fact that all recalls are not created \nequal.\n  There is not a single person in our business that would ever put one \nof our owners in a defective car or a car with a recall. But that could \nhappen. That could happen.\n  So if you are telling me that, because the wrong phone number is \nprinted in an owner's manual, that is a recall, we have to get that car \noff the road, my God, can you imagine what would happen to this owner \nif they opened up that glove box and saw that? What a horrible \nsituation to put them in. Now, you shake your heads and you say, no, \nthat is not what is going on.\n  Now, please, this is what I do. This is who I am. We are a third-\ngeneration automobile business, sold thousands of cars. And these \npeople are not just customers. They are our part of our extended \nfamilies.\n  But somehow we believe that, if we can redefine, if we can tell \npeople: ``This car has been recalled. You can't possibly get in it'' \nand you say: ``Well, what is the recall?'', well, you know what? One \npound per square inch on the tire pressure is not printed correctly. \nThat is horrible. How could that possibly be? You have got to get that \ncar off the road.\n  You are subjecting automobile dealers to the same things that you are \nsubjecting rental car companies who don't have to worry about it \nbecause, by the way, as those cars come off the road in a recall, the \nfactories pay them for those cars as they sit waiting to be repaired. \nThere is no loss of revenue for a rental car company. That is why they \nare so happy about it.\n  And what will they do with us when we take a car off the road? They \nwill say: ``Send your customer to us and we will rent them a car.''\n  If you can't see the difference, if you can't see the unequal balance \nin it, then there is a problem here. If a safety recall is a safety \nrecall, that is one thing. But if it is something else that is \ncosmetic, that is something altogether different, to group them all \nunder the same umbrella and say: ``This is a problem. This is a problem \nhunting for some type of an issue and there is no issue here. There is \nnone of us in our business that would ever put any of our owners in an \nunsafe car.\n  But I will tell you what. I wish some of these ridiculous amendments \nwould expire.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\n                              {time}  2345\n\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Auto dealers, much like us here in Washington, D.C., have a \nreputation to uphold. No auto dealer in his right mind would loan a \nvehicle to his customers that is unsafe to drive or operate. Auto \ndealers should not have to ground all of their loaner vehicles because \nof minor issues like a sticker that might peel off the sun visor \nbecause something was misspelled in the owner's manual. Auto dealers \nwant to provide great service and be able to loan their customers \nvehicles so they can go to work, drop their kids off at school, go to \nthe grocery store, and visit the doctor. These small business owners \nshould not be regulated like huge, multinational car rental agencies.\n  I urge Members to support my amendment and protect small businesses.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mr. Kinzinger of Illinois\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XXXIV of division C, add \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 34216. AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN INFORMATION ON MOTOR \n                   VEHICLE EQUIPMENT.\n\n       Section 30118 of title 49, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Information on Defective or Noncompliant Parts.--\n       ``(1) Provision of information by suppliers.--A supplier of \n     parts that are determined to be defective or noncompliant by \n     the Secretary under subsection (a) or (b) shall identify all \n     parts that are subject to the recall and provide to the \n     Secretary and each affected manufacturer, not later than 3 \n     business days after receiving notification of the \n     determination, for each affected part--\n       ``(A) all part names;\n       ``(B) all part numbers; and\n       ``(C) a description of the part.\n       ``(2) Provision of information by manufacturers.--Upon \n     receipt of notification of a determination by the Secretary \n     under subsection (a) or (b) or notification from a supplier \n     of parts under paragraph (1), a manufacturer of motor \n     vehicles shall--\n       ``(A) identify the vehicle identification number for each \n     affected vehicle; and\n       ``(B) not later than 5 business days after receiving such \n     notification, provide to the Secretary, in a searchable \n     format determined by the Secretary--\n       ``(i) the vehicle identification numbers identified under \n     subparagraph (A); and\n       ``(ii) the specific part names, numbers, and descriptions \n     used by the manufacturer for all affected parts the sale or \n     lease of which is prohibited by section 30120(j).\n       ``(3) Availability of information on the internet.--In the \n     case of information provided by a manufacturer under \n     paragraph (2)(B), the Secretary shall make such information \n     available, or require the manufacturer to make such \n     information available, on an Internet website that may be \n     accessed by any person who sells or leases motor vehicle \n     equipment for purposes of assisting such person in complying \n     with section 30120(j).

Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment that would improve vehicle safety \nand ensure that businesses have the necessary information to comply \nwith section 8 of the TREAD Act.\n  Every day, professional automotive recyclers sell over a half a \nmillion original equipment manufacturer parts which are harvested from \ntotal loss or end-of-life vehicles and are resold to consumers, repair \nshops, and dealers. These parts are designed by automakers and are \nmanufactured to meet their requirements. Even when a vehicle may reach \nthe end of its useful life, many parts have a greater lifespan and can \nbe subsequently recycled, resold, and reused. This offers consumers \nwith additional choice to purchase a quality recycled part at a lower \ncost.\n  In 2000, Congress enacted the TREAD Act to increase vehicle safety by \nprohibiting the resale of recycled auto parts that are subject to a \nrecall and have not been remedied. Congress passed this legislation \nwith the safety of the driving public in mind. However, the ability of \nprofessional automotive recyclers to identify and remove recalled parts \nfrom the supply chain is severely limited.\n  Earlier this year, Secretary Foxx responded to a question for the \nrecord on this subject following a House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee hearing. He recommended that\n\n[[Page H7723]]\n\nautomotive manufacturers provide part number information in an \nefficient and easy-to-use format directly to recyclers and others who \nneed the information to support auto safety. My amendment does just \nthat and will ensure these businesses can identify such parts and \nremove them from their inventory.\n  Our friends in the European Union have already implemented \nregulations requiring such a system that includes the VIN, OE parts \nnumbers, and the OE naming of the parts. I know we have the \ntechnological capabilities to similarly improve vehicle safety, and I \nam hoping that my colleagues will show their commitment to improving \nthe recall process with an ``aye'' vote. Now is the time to pass this \nmeasure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although \nI am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Illinois is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, while I am not going to oppose the \namendment, I do have some questions about it.\n  For this reason, it seems to me that this amendment is not likely to \nbe all that effective in getting defective parts off the market: It \nonly requires parts suppliers and automakers to supply information when \na recall is first ordered by the Secretary of Transportation. It does \nnot apply in the most common recall scenario when a manufacturer \nprovides notice of a recall.\n  So NHTSA is going to be asked to expend valuable resources to set up \na new system for auto part information, and that system, it seems to \nme, should at least be effective in getting defective parts off the \nmarket and off the roads in all circumstances of recalls.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. I appreciate my friend from Illinois' \nresponse. I would be happy to work with her in the future on this.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 15 Offered by Ms. Schakowsky\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 574, insert after line 6 the following new sections:\n\n     SEC. 34216. IMPROVED VEHICLE SAFETY DATABASES.\n\n       Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary shall increase public accessibility to and \n     timeliness of information on the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration's vehicle safety databases including \n     by--\n       (1) improving organization and functionality, including \n     modern web design features, and allowing for data to be \n     searched, aggregated, and downloaded;\n       (2) providing greater consistency in presentation of \n     vehicle safety issues;\n       (3) improving searchability about specific vehicles and \n     issues through standardization of commonly used search terms \n     and the integration of databases to enable all to be \n     simultaneously searched using the same keyword search \n     function; and\n       (4) improving the publicly accessible early warning \n     database, by--\n       (A) enabling users to search for incidents across multiple \n     reporting periods for a given make and model name, model \n     year, or type of potential defect; and\n       (B) ensuring that search results, in addition to being \n     downloadable, are sortable within an Internet browser by \n     make, model name, model year, State or foreign country of the \n     incident, number of deaths, number of injuries, date of the \n     incident, and type of potential defect.\n\n     SEC. 34217.

Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, in the wake of the GM and Takata \nrecalls, it became apparent that major changes were needed to improve \ninformation sharing, enhance safety, and strengthen accountability \nmeasures. This amendment addresses some of those issues, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Before I explain the contents of this amendment, it is important to \nexplain what is not in the amendment.\n  There are no new civil penalties for companies that fail to \nadequately protect drivers and the public. There is no ``imminent \nhazard authority'' to enable NHTSA to get the most dangerous cars off \nthe road as soon as possible. While I believe those changes are sorely \nneeded, I knew that the Republican majority would oppose them. What is \nleft are some of the more obvious reforms for auto safety, and there is \nno reasonable excuse to oppose the amendment.\n  This amendment would improve the functionality of the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration's Web site to enable better and \nmore detailed searches, to standardize terms so that consistent \nproblems can be identified faster, and to improve the early warning \ndatabase so that consumers can determine whether a vehicle they drive \nor plan to drive has a history of dangerous incidents.\n  My amendment would also increase the amount of information provided \nto consumers who are purchasing or leasing used vehicles, including \nspecific vehicle damage history and recall repair history. It would \ninclude that information in the Used Car Buyers Guide, which already \nmust be posted on each used vehicle that is offered for sale; and it \nwould inform consumers about the Web site, which is where they can find \nmore information about their specific vehicle history.\n  The investigations into the GM and Takata failures were made more \ndifficult by the fact that comprehensive safety records were not \nmaintained by many manufacturers. This amendment would fix that by \nensuring that those records are preserved for 20 years.\n  Auto manufacturers are not currently required to remedy recalled \nvehicles if those cars were sold more than 10 years before the recall. \nThat makes no sense, especially when the average car on the road is \nmore than 11 years old. This amendment would require all defects to be \nremedied at no cost to the car owner no matter how long the car has \nbeen owned.\n  With more than 30,000 deaths a year, we have a long way to go in \nreducing deaths and serious injuries on our roads. There are things we \ncan and should do to enhance auto safety, and Congress has a long track \nrecord of doing just that.\n  For example, a bill I sponsored, which was signed into law by \nPresident Bush, established a rulemaking to require technologies that \nwould enable drivers to see behind their vehicles. By 2018, rear \ncameras will be standard for all cars. That rule will prevent more than \n100 deaths and many more injuries each year.\n  This amendment would require NHTSA to continue that progress by \nrequiring research into technologies and then developing standards that \ncould reduce injuries and deaths for rear seat passengers and \npedestrians.\n  Finally, this amendment eliminates the flawed system of regional \nrecalls. Regional recalls limit remedies to specific States. This \nprevents vehicles which have traveled across the country from being \nrecalled.\n  Takata issued regional recalls for its airbags, but with high \nhumidity being a factor in airbag explosions, it makes no sense that \nits regional recall missed, for example, Washington, D.C.--a swamp, \nwith all due respect. While most of Takata's regional recalls were \nexpanded nationally, not all of them were, and some drivers can't \nlegally get their vehicles remedied free of charge. We can't allow this \nregional recall system to continue.\n  Again, these are commonsense, safety-focused provisions that would \nenhance consumer information, vehicle safety, and accountability.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, for some time now, the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, its Subcommittee of Oversight and Investigations as well as \nits Subcommittee of Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade, have been \nlooking into recalls and automobile safety.\n  We have heard about problems within the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration and about problems within the automobile \nindustry, itself. There is a lot to fix, and there are provisions to \nget after those issues in terms of recommendations from the Inspector \nGeneral's Office.\n  Serious flaws of the basic operation of the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration were revealed earlier this year in a widely \nreported inspector general's report. In an unprecedented move after the \ninspector general's report was released, the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration publicly committed to a timeline to implement all \nof the inspector general's recommendations because of the serious and \ndirect impact on NHTSA's ability to fulfill its core mission.\n  You do worry that the direction in which this amendment purports to \nnow go is going to send resources in the wrong direction. It is going \nto be very, very friendly to the Plaintiff's Trial Bar, but, really, \nthat is not where our focus should be. Of course, the Plaintiffs' Bar \nwants to be able to download, sort, and map all of the incidents \nattributable by an automaker so that they can file class action \nlawsuits--very, very good for the Plaintiffs' Bar, not necessarily so \ngood for the consumer.\n  The problem is there is a real cost in going in this direction. More \nresources are diverted to defending non meritorious lawsuits, and that \nmeans less can go into safety and quality. Effectively, this provision \nstarves the consumer in order to feed the Plaintiffs' Bar.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, I would say to my colleague, as the \nchairman of the subcommittee I serve on and that deals with auto \nsafety, I know, for a very long time, he has certainly seen the \nlegislation that I have offered in the past, and this is the first time \nthat I have heard that argument.\n  The idea of this legislation was to pair down the bill that I had \nintroduced into the kinds of safety enhancements that the gentleman and \nmany of the Republicans on the committee also had in their legislation.\n  The goal is one thing: to make sure that we provide more safety, \nstrengthen accountability, and that we share more information with \nconsumers. The amendment addresses those issues. It has avoided, \nstudiously, the more controversial parts of auto safety bills\n\n[[Page H7725]]\n\nthat maybe, someday, we can come back to, but the goal was to get a \ngood start.\n  I am disappointed that there is opposition to this amendment, but I \nstill urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I would just restate that this amendment takes us in the wrong \ndirection; so I urge my colleagues to vote in opposition to the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Illinois \nwill be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  0000\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 16 Offered by Mr. Mullin\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title XXXIV insert the \n     following new part:\n\n                   PART IV--ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES\n\n     SEC. 34441. REGULATION PARITY FOR ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS \n                   VEHICLES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In promulgating regulations, the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Administration \n     shall ensure that any preference or incentive provided to an \n     electric vehicle is also provided to a natural gas vehicle.\n       (b) Revision of Existing Regulations.--Not later than 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Administrator shall revise any regulations of the \n     Administrator in existence as of that date concerning \n     electric vehicles as necessary to ensure that the regulations \n     conform to subsection (a).\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, the EPA currently regulates the tailpipe \nemissions of automobiles sold in the United States. In order to \nincentivize the use of alternative fuels, the agency provides \nregulatory credits to automakers that produce alternative fuel \nvehicles.\n  The EPA has provided greater incentives for manufacturers to produce \nelectric vehicles rather than natural gas vehicles, even though natural \ngas is a growing and inexpensive source of fuel with a clean emission \nprofile.\n  If we are going to incentivize alternative fuel vehicles, we need to \nmake sure that natural gas vehicles are on a level playing field. My \namendment does exactly that, encouraging the broader adoption of \nnatural gas vehicles. It instructs EPA to provide the same incentives \nfor the production of natural gas vehicles that it already provides for \nelectric vehicles.\n  In States like mine in Oklahoma, natural gas is cheap, but filling \nstations for vehicles can be few and far between. Consumers are \nhesitant to buy natural gas vehicles because they are afraid they won't \nhave access to filling stations.\n  The surface transportation bill encourages the build of natural gas \nrefueling corridors. My amendment will add to the effort by encouraging \nautomakers to produce the vehicles that will actually consume the \nnatural gas fuel.\n  This is a commonsense amendment, pro competition, and a reform the \nauto industry needs. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment, which would undermine the Obama administration's \nhistoric vehicle fuel economy and tailpipe emission standards.\n  The EPA and the Department of Transportation rules provide huge \nbenefits. They help consumers save money at the pump, reduce reliance \non foreign oil, and reduce the carbon pollution that threatens our \nclimate and our health. By 2025, these rules are expected to save \nAmerican families $1.7 trillion on fuel costs, cut greenhouse gas \nemissions by 6 billion metric tons, and reduce America's dependance on \noil by more than 2 million barrels per day.\n  These are rules that have been an overwhelming success due in large \npart to the high level of coordination and participation of multiple \nstakeholder groups in their development. We are talking about groups \nlike automobile manufacturers, State and local governments, the United \nAuto Workers, consumer groups, environmental organizations, and the \npublic. In short, these rules are good for American consumers, \nmanufacturers, and the environment.\n  The Mullin amendment would undermine the success of existing and \nfuture car rules by requiring EPA to extend any ``preference or \nincentive'' provided to electric vehicles to natural gas vehicles as \nwell.\n  The amendment also requires EPA to go back and make retroactive \nchanges to the tailpipe rules already on the books. Some of these rules \nwere finalized 3 years ago, and reopening these carefully coordinated \nnegotiations makes no sense.\n  The Mullin amendment would effectively say that natural gas vehicles \nand electric vehicles are exactly the same, but they are fundamentally \ndifferent in terms of their tailpipe emissions and the miles per gallon \nthey get on the road.\n  Natural gas vehicles already receive numerous incentives under the \ntailpipe and fuel economy rules, and natural gas vehicles are an \nestablished and functioning technology, so there is little need to \nincentivize them further for reasons of technological innovation. This \nis in contrast with electric vehicles for whom many of the current \nincentives are designed.\n  The amendment is also not justified from a climate perspective. \nElectric vehicles have the potential to be game changers, especially \nwith low greenhouse gas electricity. On the other hand, natural gas \nvehicles continue to depend on a fossil fuel with no such game-changing \npotential. Also, because natural gas is already a very viable fuel for \nheavy-duty vehicles, additional incentives would essentially be bonuses \nfor using a fuel that would have been used anyway. So this would dilute \nthe heavy-duty vehicle GHG program.\n  The Mullin amendment would give windfall incentives to automobile \nmanufacturers that produce natural gas vehicles, creating a loophole \nthat will allow them to produce other dirty and less efficient vehicles \nand still meet their tailpipe emissions and fuel economy requirements. \nThis sets a dangerous precedent that subverts essential rules that were \ndeveloped through an open public rulemaking process, including all \nstakeholders, and undermines critical U.S. energy conservation \npolicies.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I appreciate what the gentlewoman is \nstating. All we are trying to do is listen to the President, too, when \nhe says he has an all-the-above approach on energy.\n  The gentlewoman states that electric vehicles are a clean way to \ndrive around, but I must remind the gentlewoman that the power that \nthey are charged by typically is produced by coal and natural gas power \nplants. So the argument that she is saying just simply doesn't make any \nsense.\n  The EPA has already said that their emissions fits within their \nprofile. What we are saying is let's truly have an all-the-above \napproach and allow natural gas to be on a natural, clean playing field.\n  If we are going to talk about having a real conversation and not \nplaying politics, then we shouldn't be playing winners and losers with \nthis administration and the real fight, which is against--anti-fossil \nfuels altogether.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, my view is, if it ain't broke, don't fix \nit. We have had a good deal of success with the current rules, and to \nchange the game plan right now, I think, is a disservice to consumers, \nto all the other stakeholders, including the auto manufacturers, the \nunions, the consumer groups, and everybody who has\n\n[[Page H7726]]\n\nweighed in and bought in to these rules.\n  So I would urge a ``no'' vote on the Mullin amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I obviously encourage a ``yes'' vote, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.

Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Burgess) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, the thesis of this amendment is to secure \ngood government reforms at the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration.\n  We want to make certain that we are able to exercise strong oversight \nof the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and we want to \nmake certain that NHTSA is staying within its authorized jurisdiction.\n  We took some ideas that were raised by the minority, amended them to \nreflect things like the longer life of cars. We asked manufacturers to \nhold onto safety information for a longer period of time. We extend the \ntime for free recall fix requirements.\n  Lastly, we have added the bipartisan Low Volume Motor Vehicle \nManufacturers Act of 2015 and provided adjusted funding levels to the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration to advance their \nimportant safety work.\n  This is an important amendment, and I urge my colleagues to accept \nit.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chairman, by reducing appropriations for \nvehicle safety programs, Mr. Burgess' amendment is making it impossible \nfor NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, to \nactually carry out its critical vehicle safety functions.\n  At the same time that this amendment drastically cuts funding for \ncritical safety functions, the amendment also requires more reporting \nthat diverts necessary resources, both people and dollars, from NHTSA's \nmission to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce economic costs from \ntraffic crashes.\n  The average age of cars on the road in the United States has hit a \nrecord high at 11\\1/2\\ years. That is just the average. Many cars are \neven older.\n  Instead of fully acknowledging this reality, this amendment only \nrequires manufacturers to keep limited safety records for 15 years and \nonly requires recall repairs to be free of charge for 10 years. The \nrecent GM ignition switch recall covered vehicles that were more than \n10 years old. That means that, under this amendment, some owners of \ndefective GM cars could have to pay to have the defect repaired.\n  The amendment also exempts from motor vehicle safety standards \nreplica cars. Brand-new cars would not have to meet any safety \nstandards as long as they look like a car that was made 25 years ago. \nThese cars could be exempt from seatbelt and airbag requirements, basic \nbut crucial safety equipment. We have no idea how many replica cars \nwill end up on the roads. Although each low-volume manufacturer is \nlimited to 500 vehicles, there are no limits on the number of \nmanufacturers.\n  The low-volume provision would also exempt manufacturers of replicas, \nunlike all others who manufacture cars in small batches, from the EPA's \nemission standards concerning greenhouse gasses. Replica cars also \nwould be exempt from State inspections and emissions testing and \nevaporative emission standards. In the wake of the recent VW scandal, \nit is unthinkable that we would make it easier for any manufacturers to \nbypass emission standards and to continue to put public health at risk.\n\n[[Page H7728]]\n\n  The amendment also allows automakers and others to use compliance \nwith guidelines as evidence of compliance with motor vehicle safety \nstandards. By prohibiting NHTSA from using guidelines for enforcement \npurposes, the majority obviously recognizes that nonbinding guidelines \nare not the same as actual safety requirements. But at the same time, \nthis amendment allows automakers to evade liability by showing that \nthey complied with nonbinding guidelines instead of having to prove \nthat they complied with safety mandates. This double standard makes no \nsense.\n  Instead of ensuring that automakers are held responsible for safety \nviolations they commit, this amendment gives them yet another out. This \namendment will adversely affect the public health and safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chairwoman, as I advised earlier in speaking to \nanother amendment, some significant flaws in the basic operations of \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration were revealed \nearlier this year and reported in an inspector general's report.\n  Again, in an unprecedented move, after the IG report was released, \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration publicly committed \nto a timeline to implement all of the inspector general's \nrecommendations because of their serious and direct impact on NHTSA's \nability to fulfill its core mission. I am grateful to NHTSA that they \nhad this commitment to these reforms.\n  Just like the Senate language, our amendment does provide for \nadditional funding to the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration. This amendment would increase NHTSA's funding by 23\\1/\n2\\ percent for fiscal year 2016 and over 27 percent for fiscal year \n2017 from the authorized levels in the underlying bill. Maybe we don't \ngo as far as the Senate, but these are significant and generous \nincreases.\n  Again, I will urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0015\n\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, actually there is an increase in my \nchairman's amendment. It is also a significant decrease from what the \nSenate has added to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \nBecause we have so many deaths on the road, and NHTSA has been \nsignificantly underfunded, it definitely makes sense to as fully fund \nthem as they can to provide their mission of auto safety.\n  So, for that reason and all the others I listed, I certainly urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  This amendment also requires the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration to issue an agenda on December 1 of every year detailing \nthe agency's policy priorities, their planned rulemakings, and any \nprojected alterations to the agency structure. Actually, that is a good \nidea. Regulated entities, especially, should have an idea of what the \nfocus of the agency is going to be in the upcoming months and years.\n  The last time the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \npublished a planning report was 2011. They are asking us for more \nmoney. We are providing them with more money. All we ask is they \nprovide us a glimpse into what their strategy is as to how that money \nwill be effectively spent.\n  This is a good amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 18 Offered by Mr. Neugebauer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

ELIMINATION OF SURPLUS FUNDS OF FEDERAL RESERVE \n                   BANKS.\n\n       (a) Elimination of Surplus Funds.--Section 7 of the Federal \n     Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 289 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in the heading of such subsection, by striking ``and \n     Surplus Funds''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``deposited in the \n     surplus fund of the bank'' and inserting ``transferred to the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for transfer \n     to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the general \n     fund of the Treasury''; and\n       (2) by striking the first subsection (b) (relating to a \n     transfer for fiscal year 2000).\n       (b) Transfer to the Treasury.--The Federal reserve banks \n     shall transfer all of the funds of the surplus funds of such \n     banks to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n     for transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in \n     the general fund of the Treasury.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Chair, I rise today to offer amendment No. 18 with the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), my good friend.\n  First, let me say I don't think it is good policy that we are trying \nto fund transportation from other sectors of the economy. This \namendment does seek to address two major issues in the budget offset \nsent over from the Senate--the Federal Reserve dividend increase and \nthe g-fee increase.\n  Moving forward with the Federal Reserve dividend reduction without \nstudying it could have a devastating consequence for the supervision of \nthe financial sector and the stability of the Federal Reserve System. \nThe cost that banks, especially community banks, could face as a result \nof the dividend reduction would be passed on to hardworking consumers. \nAt a time when many Americans continue to struggle from the unintended \nconsequences of Dodd-Frank, it would be dangerous and irresponsible to \nmove ahead with the Senate version.\n  Second, this amendment addresses what I see as a further entrenchment \nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This is particularly timely because just \nthis week we learned that Fannie and Freddie may need to tap the \nTreasury once again and saddle the taxpayers with the bill. This \namendment further protects the taxpayers. Allowing Congress to continue \nto raise g-fees will make comprehensive housing finance reform \nimpossible.\n  Our amendment addresses both problems by liquidating and dissolving \nthe Federal Reserve capital surplus account. The Federal Reserve \ncurrently has about $29 billion in capital surplus account. This \naccount is made up of the earnings that the Federal Reserve has \nretained from investing member banks' money. Let me say that again. The \nsurplus account is made up of earnings that the Federal Reserve has \nmade from investing member banks' money. The Federal Reserve continues \nto hold this account in surplus at a time when our Nation is over $18.5 \ntrillion in debt. This is not a perfect policy, but it is better than \nthe alternative.\n  This preserves the budget neutrality of the transportation bill and \ncounters irresponsible proposals sent over to us by the Senate. \nFurther, it protects consumers from potential for cost increases while \nreforming the surplus account to meet the needs of the current fiscal \ncrisis.\n  When the surplus account was created, no one could have imagined the \ndebt and deficits that we are facing. It is appropriate to liquidate \nthis account to meet today's realities.\n  Moving forward, I hope that this body will ensure that transportation \nfunding comes from transportation users and not completely unrelated \nsectors of the economy.\n\n[[Page H7729]]\n\n  Madam Chair, in closing, I include for the Record a joint trade \nletter of support from 27 banking and housing groups in support of \namendment No. 18.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n                                                 November 4, 2015.\n     Hon.

Member \n     banks of the Federal Reserve are required by law to purchase \n     stock in regional Federal Reserve Banks. This stock may not \n     be sold, transferred or even used as collateral, unlike \n     virtually every other asset a bank holds. These funds \n     represent ``dead capital'' for the financial institution. The \n     dividend that the Senate is considering reducing reflects the \n     unique structure and constraints of this arrangement that is \n     required by law, as this is money that otherwise would be \n     used by banks for lending and to provide other services to \n     customers.\n       The Neugebauer-Huizenga amendment would also remove from \n     H.R. 22 an extension of higher Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \n     guarantee fees. The purpose of these fees is to prospectively \n     guard against credit losses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. G-\n     fees should only be used to protect taxpayers from mortgage \n     losses, not to fund unrelated spending. Each time g-fees are \n     extended, increased and diverted for unrelated spending, \n     homeowners are charged more for their mortgages and taxpayers \n     are exposed to additional risk for the long-term. The g-fee \n     increase was originally included in the Senate highway bill \n     as a funding offset, but the Congressional Budget Office has \n     scored the House bill as being budget neutral without this \n     provision. It should be removed to ensure that potential \n     homebuyers are not kept on the sidelines by raising the cost \n     to purchase or refinance a home.\n       To ensure it is fully offset, the Neugebauer-Huizenga \n     amendment would use the Federal Reserve's ``surplus'' account \n     of earnings retained after paying operating expenses and \n     dividends. As a result of recent changes in the way the \n     Federal Reserve operates, these retained earnings are no \n     longer necessary. This amendment would use funds from this \n     account to pay for the extension of the Highway Trust Fund.\n       We urge the House to pass the Neugebauer-Huizenga amendment \n     to H.R. 22.\n       America's Homeowner Alliance, American Escrow Association, \n     American Bankers Association, American Land Title \n     Association, Center for Responsible Lending, The Clearing \n     House, Community Home Lenders Association, Consumer Bankers \n     Association, Consumer Mortgage Coalition, Credit Union \n     National Association.\n       The Financial Services Forum, Financial Services \n     Roundtable, Habitat for Humanity International, Homeownership \n     Preservation Foundation, Independent Community Bankers of \n     America, Leading Builders of America, Mid-size Bank Coalition \n     of America, Mortgage Bankers Association, National \n     Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals.\n       National Association of Home Builders, National Association \n     of Real Estate Brokers, National Association of \n     REALTORS, Real Estate Services Providers Council, \n     Inc., The Realty Alliance, Securities Industry and Financial \n     Markets Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Center for \n     Capital Markets Competitiveness, U.S. Mortgage Insurers.\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The \nNeugebauer amendment represents a poorly designed attempt to cover the \ncost of the highway bill. My colleague from Texas is concerned that the \nSenate's underlying provisions would cut the largest banks' guaranteed \n6 percent dividend payments from the Federal Reserve as well as extend \na 10 basis point fee on new mortgages, although not until 2021.\n  In place of those provisions, my colleague would eliminate the \nFederal Reserve surplus account without even considering whether it \ncould harm monetary policy or our economic security in the decades \nahead.\n  I previously expressed concern about using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nas a piggy bank to pay for unrelated government spending. Instead, \nRepublicans should finally take up housing finance reform. Despite \ncontrolling this House for almost 5 years and the Senate for nearly 2, \nRepublicans have entirely failed to reform the housing markets, despite \nclaiming that the mortgage giants caused the crisis.\n  Regarding the other Senate provision, I am not sure why the largest \nbanks should be entitled to a permanent dividend payment of 6 percent a \nyear. How many of my colleagues or their constituents have a safe \ninvestment that pays this well? In fact, most of my constituents are \nlucky to earn a penny a month on their bank account. Yet, when the \nSenate first proposed to cut these bank dividends, House Republicans \nurged that Congress first study what would be the effect before \nchanging the law.\n  The Federal Reserve surplus account, which Mr. Neugebauer proposes to \neliminate permanently to protect the bank dividends, has promoted \nglobal confidence in U.S. monetary policy for more than 100 years. \nFederal Reserve officials explained to the GAO that maintaining \ncapital, including the surplus account, provides an assurance of a \ncentral bank's strength and stability to investors and foreign holders \nof U.S. currency. That is why central banks around the world--including \nthe Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the German Central \nBank--all make use of surplus accounts. Nevertheless, my Republican \ncolleagues are willing to cut this monetary policy tool without knowing \nwhat the long-term effect would be.\n  During the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve took \nunprecedented action to prevent economic collapse by purchasing \ntrillions of dollars of assets. During the countless hearings with \nFederal Reserve chairs Bernanke and Yellen, my colleagues suggested \nthat the Federal Reserve is leveraged more than Lehman Brothers, \npointing out that the Fed surplus is inadequate to protect losses to \nthe taxpayer. But with this amendment, they would eliminate for all \ntime all Fed surplus which, based on Republican logic, would be \ninfinite leverage.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Madam Chair, folks that are watching this \nat this late hour are unfortunately seeing politics over policy. The \nranking member wants to agree but just can't let herself.\n  This policy that we have seen, 73 percent of the Democrats on her \ncommittee signed a letter saying we need to hit the pause button; we \nneed to make sure that we understand what this policy that got shipped \nover to us from the Senate is going to mean. Unfortunately, it has been \nplunged ahead, and we are moving ahead with this.\n  This is less than ideal policy that we are looking at, but our choice \nisn't good choice versus bad choice. Our choice is less than ideal \nversus very bad choice. What we are seeing here is that we need to \nexamine this further. It hasn't been looked at in over 50 years from \nthe Committee on Financial Services.\n  So I hope two things: one, that we are going to have a change in the \nway the House operates. I believe that that new day has arrived and \nthat we will be doing that, but we are not sure exactly what this fixed \nrate is going to be. I will point out, though, that with that 6 percent \nreturn, the Fed has been able to build up a $29 billion, with a B, \nsurplus account, which is where we are today.\n  Chairman Hensarling of the Committee on Financial Services had \nwritten the GAO requesting a study of that. I put out this letter, a \nbipartisan letter where we had 150 colleagues, that was forwarded. What \nwe are doing is a better offset. We are believing that this is a better \nway to go rather than raiding Fannie and Freddie and the g-fees and the \nbudget.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, \nespecially because I rise in favor of this amendment; not because it is \nperfect, but because it deals with a fundamental problem in the \nunderlying legislation.\n  How are we going to fund our highway system? Some would argue a tax \non motorists; some would argue the general revenue of the United \nStates. I\n\n[[Page H7730]]\n\ndon't know anyone who can really make the argument that we ought to \nhave a tax on home buyers to fund highways; yet that is what the \nunderlying bill does. It imposes a tax on everyone who gets a mortgage \nor refinances a mortgage and uses that for highways.\n  I am confident that if we pass this amendment, the conference \ncommittee will take a look at how to finance this bill and will come up \nwith a better way than the idea of imposing a tax on everyone. That \nbasically means middle class homeowners who use Fannie Mae or Freddie \nMac in order to buy a home or refinance a home.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I would like to draw to \nyour attention that Mr. Neugebauer's original amendment would have \npaused for 1 year and studied it. He changed it to strip the surplus \nforever and keep the dividend.\n  My Republican colleagues had every opportunity to ask Federal Reserve \nChair Janet Yellen about this amendment or, for that matter, her \nthoughts on what cutting the big bank dividend payments would be but \ndid not. Instead, they peppered her for 3 hours with sundry other \nquestions, failing to ask about one proposal, then considered late in \nthe day to eliminate a 100-year-old monetary policy tool.\n  Madam Chair, yesterday my Republican colleagues sought to hamstring \nthe Federal Reserve. I ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to close \nto the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), the distinguished \nchairman of the House Committee on Financial Services.\n\n                              {time}  0030\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Transportation ought to be funded out of transportation fees. It \nshouldn't be funded out of the functional equivalent of a bank account \ntax. It should not be funded on the backs of home buyers, or \nparticularly those taxpayers who are forced to backstop Fannie and \nFreddie.\n  If we are ever going to have a sustainable housing finance system in \nAmerica, these guarantee fees cannot be diverted.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from \nMichigan. No, they didn't come up with the perfect solution, but it is \nfar superior than this bank account tax and this home-buyer tax. It \nmakes no sense whatsoever.\n  So I urge the entire House to adopt the Neugebauer amendment and get \nrid of this terrible idea from the Senate.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 19 Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 19 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 942, strike lines 7 and 8 (and redesignate subsequent \n     clauses accordingly).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment \nto this transportation bill.\n  My amendment is simple. If the intent of the Federal Permitting \nImprovement Council section of this bill is to actually improve the \nFederal permitting process, then the EPA, which is not a principal \npermitting or reviewing agency, should not be allowed an outsized vote \nto obstruct the expedited process for covered projects created by this \nlegislation.\n  The bill establishes a new council for the purpose of streamlining \nthe Federal permitting process for projects of national importance. As \ncurrently constructed, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, is \ngiven far too big a voice in this process--an EPA that is known for \nbeing the primary obstructionist for every significant infrastructure \nand economic development project in the United States.\n  It is important to note that nothing in my amendment prevents the EPA \nfrom being invited to be a participating or cooperating agent and \nproviding information throughout this process to the council.\n  The council established by this bill will be composed of a minimum of \n16 members, and it takes a vote by the majority of the members of the \ncouncil in order for a covered project to be entitled to an expedited \nreview.\n  Currently, the bill allows the EPA too much influence in this \nprocess. This is wrong and will under mine goals of the rest of the \ncouncil.\n  In a memo regarding the Federal permitting process, the EPA itself \nstated: ``It is important to recognize the EPA is rarely, if ever, the \nprincipal permit or reviewing agency.''\n  It goes on further: ``EPA's role is most often one of providing input \nto processes managed by others. . . . In addition, where projects do \nrequire permits issued under Federal environmental laws, permitting \ndecisions are typically made by States under delegated or authorized \nprograms. EPA is not responsible for the day-to-day administration of \ndelegated or authorized permitting programs.''\n  By the EPA's own admission, the agency is never the primary reviewing \nentity. It defies common sense that EPA would have a vote when other \nagencies and States that actually manage the permitting process don't.\n  Intentional actions and shear incompetence from the EPA continue to \nimpose Federal permitting delays and kill jobs throughout the country. \nThe Wall Street Journal recently reported that the EPA coordinated with \nspecial interest groups to veto a mine project in Alaska.\n  Media reports have also documented ``close coordination between the \nEPA and environmental groups in drafting the controversial Clean Power \nPlan, which would mark the demise of coal-fired plants in the United \nStates.''\n  My amendment is endorsed by Eagle Forum, Americans for Limited \nGovernment, Concerned Citizens for America, the Arizona Department of \nTransportation, the Arizona Small Business Association, the Bullhead \nChamber of Commerce, the Lake Havasu Area Chamber of Commerce, the New \nMexico Cattle Growers' Association, the New Mexico Federal Lands \nCouncil, and the Town of Fredonia.\n  If the intent of this bill is to improve the Federal permitting \nprocess, then the EPA, which is not a principal permitting or reviewing \nagency, should not be allowed an outsized vote for critical projects \nthat already have investments of $200 million or more.\n  I fully support the intent of the council created by the bill and the \ncommittee's work in that regard. I believe the process utilized could \ncreate tens of thousands of jobs and significantly benefit our economy. \nLet's not let the EPA screw it up.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with job creators, ranchers, local \nchambers of commerce, small businesses, transportation officials, and \ncountless other organizations and individuals throughout this country \nthat are tired of the EPA's obstructionism, and support my amendment. \nYou are either with them or you are with the EPA.\n  Vote ``yes'' on my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 20 Offered by Mr. Goodlatte\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 20 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 964, line 6, insert after ``the participating \n     agencies'' the following: ``and the project sponsor''.\n\n[[Page H7731]]\n\n       Page 964, line 7, strike ``and''.\n       Page 964, line 11, strike the period and insert the \n     following: ``; and''\n       Page 964, after line 11, insert the following:\n\n       (III) in the case of a modification that would necessitate \n     an extension of a final completion date under a permitting \n     timetable established under subparagraph (A) to a date more \n     than 30 days after the final completion date originally \n     established under subparagraph (A), the facilitating or lead \n     agency submits a request to modify the permitting timetable \n     to the Executive Director, who shall consult with the project \n     sponsor and make a determination on the record, based on \n     consideration of the relevant factors described under \n     subparagraph (B), whether to grant the facilitating or lead \n     agency, as applicable, authority to make such modification.\n\n       Page 964, after line 15, insert the following:\n       (iii) Limitation on length of modifications.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Except as provided in subclause (II), the \n     total length of all modifications to a permitting timetable \n     authorized or made under this subparagraph, other than for \n     reasons outside the control of Federal, State, local, or \n     tribal governments, may not extend the permitting timetable \n     for a period of time greater than half of the amount of time \n     from the establishment of the permitting timetable under \n     subparagraph (A) to the last final completion date originally \n     established under subparagraph (A).\n       (II) Additional extensions.--The Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget, after consultation with the project \n     sponsor, may permit the Executive Director to authorize \n     additional extensions of a permitting timetable beyond the \n     limit prescribed by subclause (I). In such a case, the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall \n     transmit, not later than 5 days after making a determination \n     to permit an authorization of extension under this subclause, \n     a report to Congress explaining why such modification is \n     required. Such report shall explain to Congress with \n     specificity why the original permitting timetable and the \n     modifications authorized by the Executive Director failed to \n     be adequate. The lead or facilitating agency, as applicable, \n     shall transmit to Congress, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget, and the Executive Director a \n     supplemental report on progress toward the final completion \n     date each year thereafter, until the permit review is \n     completed or the project sponsor withdraws its notice or \n     application or other request to which this title applies \n     under section 61010.\n\n       (iv) Limitation on judicial review.--The following shall \n     not be subject to judicial review:\n\n       (I) A determination by the Executive Director under clause \n     (i)(III).\n       (II) A determination under clause (iii)(II) by the Director \n     of the Office of Management and Budget to permit the \n     Executive Director to authorize extensions of a permitting \n     timetable.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I and Regulatory Reform Subcommittee Chairman Marino offer this \namendment to bridge the gap between two vital pieces of legislation: \nChairman Marino's RAPID Act, H.R. 348, which the House passed on \nSeptember 24, 2015, and Senators Portman and McCaskill's Federal \nPermitting Improvement Act, S. 280.\n  These bills have been companions for multiple terms in our effort to \nstreamline the process by which Federal agencies review and decide upon \napplications for federally funded and federally permitted construction \nprojects. Permit streamlining reform is essential to create new, high-\npaying jobs and strengthen our economy. It is a priority of the House, \nthe Senate, and the President.\n  S. 280 was incorporated by a floor amendment into the Senate \namendments to H.R. 22 and, so, is included in the base bill before us. \nIn two of the three key respects, it substantially achieves the House \ngoals embodied by the RAPID Act: to shorten the time it takes to \nconclude litigation over Federal permitting decisions, and require \nlitigants first to present the substance of any claims before \npermitting agencies during their administrative reviews.\n  The Senate text, however, falls short in the third key respect: \nreliably expediting the time agencies have to conclude their reviews \nbefore acting to approve or disapprove permits. The Senate language \nincludes many important steps toward this goal, but multiple loopholes \nin the language open the door for deadlines without end and without \nstandards.\n  The amendment Subcommittee Chairman Marino and I offer fixes this \nproblem by establishing firm checks and balances through which the \nDirector of OMB and the Executive Director of the Federal Permitting \nImprovement Steering Council can prevent abusive extensions and assure \nthat permit applications are reviewed within reasonable deadlines.\n  The amendment embodies a pre-conferenced resolution of the \ndifferences between the RAPID Act and S. 280 as incorporated into H.R. \n22 that Subcommittee Chairman Marino, I, Senator Portman, and Senator \nMcCaskill all support.\n  If the House adopts this amendment, it will perfect the bill to \nassure powerful permit streamlining reform, paving the way for good \nprojects to move forward more quickly, delivering high-quality jobs and \nimprovements to Americans' daily lives. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment and \ntitle 61 of the underlying bill, which adopts the text of S. 280, the \nFederal Permitting Improvement Act.\n  Before addressing my substantive concerns, I have serious procedural \nobjections to the inclusion of title 61 in a transportation funding \nbill.\n  S. 280, the Federal Permitting Improvement Act, was attached to the \ntransportation bill on the Senate floor through a manager's amendment \noffered by Senate Majority Leader McConnell. It was adopted without \nadequate debate in an expedited process just days before the August \nrecess. The bill has not been introduced in the House. Neither the \nHouse nor the Senate has had a hearing on the text of this bill, which \ninvolves a nuanced area of the law with broad implications for public \nhealth and safety.\n  Moving to the substance of title 61, this bill is a misguided attempt \nto restrict public input and challenges in the permitting process under \nthe National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.\n  Over 40 years, NEPA has saved time, money, and protected the \nenvironment, all while providing a framework for wide-ranging input \nfrom all affected interests when a Federal agency conducts an \nenvironmental review of a proposed project.\n  Title 61 of H.R. 22 discards this commonsense approach by severely \ncurtailing the public's right to challenge permitting decisions in \nseveral ways.\n  First, title 61 restricts challenges of major Federal projects to \nonly parties who file comments within the bill's 45- to 60-day window. \nThe bill requires that these comments must be sufficiently detailed to \nput the lead agency on notice of the issue on which the party seeks \njudicial review. In other words, a party would have to litigate the \nissue in the 45- to 60-day comment period--an extremely tall order for \nthe public.\n  Second, title 61 requires that courts consider the potential for \nsignificant job losses and other economic harms in considering whether \nto enjoin a project that has been challenged.\n  The bill further requires that courts presume that these harms are \nirreparable, even if they aren't, tilting the outcome in favor of \nprivate interests and away from the public's interest in health, \nsafety, and the environment.\n  This is a radical departure from our laws and would have the \npractical effect of allowing a project to proceed even where there is \nongoing litigation. Indeed, by the time a court determines that a \nproject violates the law, a project could already be completed.\n  Third, under current law, the public has 6 years to bring claims \narising under most Federal laws, which provides for citizens to \ndiscover latent harms of projects. Title 61 only provides for 2 years \nfor challenges to the Nation's most complex projects requiring a \nFederal permit.\n  Madam Chairman, title 61 presents a false choice between funding \ntransportation projects and accepting bad legislation without debate or \nproper consideration that would potentially have disastrous effects on \nthe public's right to challenge Federal permitting decisions in court. \nThis is yet another pro-\n\n[[Page H7732]]\n\ncorporate, anti-safety provision designed by the donor class to \nrestrict access to the courts by the common people.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield such time \nas he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino), who \njoins me in offering this amendment.\n  Mr. MARINO. I thank Chairman Goodlatte for yielding.\n  For two terms now, enacting legislation to streamline the Federal \npermitting process has been among my primary goals. Three times now, \nthis House has passed the RAPID Act, a bill that I sponsored in both \nthe 113th and 114th Congresses.\n\n                              {time}  0045\n\n  Our goal has been to fix the flaws in our Federal permitting process \nthat often doom worthy projects that could collectively create millions \nof jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity.\n  In just my home State of Pennsylvania, one 2011 study found that the \nstalled energy projects alone would produce an average of over 56,000 \njobs a year and over $44 billion in economic output.\n  The potential growth in the American economy is staggering. Worthy \nprojects across the country should not die on the vine while awaiting \nFederal bureaucratic approval.\n  This amendment achieves these goals, and I am pleased to offer it \nwith the chairman. It builds upon the reforms already encompassed in \nseveral bills passed by the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee and signed into law. Perhaps most importantly we have reached \nagreement on this amendment in a bipartisan fashion.\n  It has been one of the honors of my time in Congress to reach not \nonly across the aisle, but across Chambers, to work with Senator \nPortman and Senator McCaskill on these reforms and this amendment.\n  I urge all my colleagues and Members to join us in supporting this \nimportant amendment that will put Americans to work and help stimulate \neconomic growth.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Chair, this is a bad amendment that \nhurts the public interest, and for that reason I would ask that my \ncolleagues vote along with me to disapprove of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Madam Chair, this is a very good amendment that will help create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs by getting projects that have been \ndelayed all across this country moving. It is supported by many on both \nsides of the aisle in both Chambers of this institution.\n  We have worked closely with Democrats and Republicans, and we have \nworked closely with the White House on this language. This is ready for \nprime time. This is ready to go.\n  It is very appropriate to include it in this legislation because \ntransportation projects will be the biggest beneficiary of this \nstreamlining of permitting that will take place as a result of adoption \nof this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying \nbill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 21 Offered by Mr. Hensarling\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  People are still hurting in this economy, Madam Chair. We all know \nthat. We need to do everything we can, as the House, to promote \neconomic growth.\n  It is very difficult in this Chamber and in this institution to come \nby bipartisan legislation. But I am proud to say, in the House \nFinancial Services Committee, we have passed numerous pieces of \nbipartisan legislation. They are modest because they are bipartisan. \nBut they are, nonetheless, important and can make a difference in \npeople's lives.\n  There are 15 bills that have already passed the House Financial \nServices Committee either unanimously or near unanimously and then have \ngone to the House to be debated and have been passed, almost all of \nthem, unanimously by voice vote or near 400-plus votes.\n  They are bills like H.R. 2064, to help with emerging growth company \nregulatory reforms; H.R. 1525, that simplifies some of the Security and \nExchange Commission disclosures; H.R. 432, the Small Investment Company \nRegulatory Relief Act; and a number of bills like these that have \ntypically passed our committee 57-0, for example, 60-0, 53-0, and then \nhave gone on to pass the House by voice vote.\n  Again, these are bipartisan bills. They are modest bills, but they \nhappen to be germane to this transportation bill because of the revenue \nstream, the funding source, the pay-for in the transportation bill.\n  So because they have already been debated in committee, passed in the \ncommittee, debated in the House, passed in the House, we are simply \npackaging 15 of these bills together because there is an opportunity to \nhave these become law and benefit the American people.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Madam Chair, this amendment combines 15 Financial Services bills that \nhave had broad bipartisan support and passed through the committee and \non the House floor. These bills address important issues that range \nfrom helping to preserve affordable rental housing to providing \nregulatory relief to small banks and reporting companies, to affording \nstart-ups, emerging growth companies and community financial \ninstitutions with greater flexibility to raise capital.\n  Let me be clear. I have supported these bills in committee and on the \nfloor. But, Madam Chair and Members, this Congress is made up of two \nHouses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Just as we were \ngiven the opportunity to debate and amend these bills, taking into \naccount concerns from our constituents and interested stakeholders, the \nSenate should also be given the opportunity.\n  I am also concerned with the other amendments and their potential \nnegative effect on this set of bills. For example, Representative Young \nhas an amendment that would require each rulemaking in the highway \nbill, as amended, to include a list of information upon which it is \nbased, including data, scientific and economic studies, and cost-\nbenefit analysis, and identify how the public can access such \ninformation online.\n  What this means is that the Securities and Exchange Commission, in \nconducting its rulemaking under Chairman Hensarling's amendment, would \nface this additional administrative hurdle, including the innocent-\nsounding cost-benefit analysis.\n  However, cost-benefit analysis is a tool that has been used by the \nindustry and the opposite side of the aisle both in agencies and in the \ncourts and in Congress to delay, weaken, or kill necessary reforms. \nSuch analysis encourages second-guessing, favors easily quantifiable \ncosts over less tangible benefits, and is extremely resource intensive.\n  That is why my Democratic colleagues and I have opposed its \napplication to the SEC, an agency that already performs economic \nanalysis for its rulemaking and has enough on its plate with its \nadditional responsibility under the JOBS Act and the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  Requiring the SEC to conduct an onerous cost-benefit analysis is even \nmore concerning with the Republicans'\n\n[[Page H7737]]\n\nrefusal to adequately fund the agency. So the meager existing funds \nwould have to be diverted from other important SEC functions, like \nenforcement and investigations.\n  Cost-benefit analysis in Representative Young's amendment is also \nopposed by consumer advocates like the Coalition for Sensible \nSafeguards.\n  While, again, I support the 15 Financial Services bills in this \namendment, I oppose this process of pushing them through the House \nattached to the highway bill.\n  Madam Chair and Members, again, this is about process. I do believe \nthat the Senate should have the ability to debate these bills.\n  Coming out of the Financial Services Committee, we are tasked with \nthe responsibility to take a very complicated subject matter, Financial \nServices matters, and to make sure that we give every Member an \nopportunity to have input, to have credible debates. I just believe \nthat the Senate should have that opportunity.\n  So while we have supported these bills--and Mr. Hensarling is \nabsolutely correct--we had an opportunity to do that because we \nunderstood them very well. We debated them. We had an opportunity to \nhave input to ask questions, to do everything that you need to do to be \nwell informed about legislation that you are either supporting or \nopposing.\n  Again, this is about process. I just simply believe that the Senate \nshould have the right to debate.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I was listening carefully to my ranking member, and I think the \ntranslation is: I was for the bills before I was against the bills. I \nthink she just said she supported all of these on the committee and the \nfloor, she just doesn't support them tonight. And, apparently, the \nreason has something to do with the fact that the Senate, the other \nbody, the other Chamber, perhaps hasn't gone through the same process \nthat we have.\n  I didn't know it was our business to do the Senate's business. Our \nbusiness is to propose and support what the House has done. So I don't \nknow if the ranking member sees the other body as a group of shrinking \nviolets who cannot take care of themselves, who will somehow be \noverwhelmed by one particular amendment.\n  I would remind all Members there is this thing called a conference \ncommittee between the House and the Senate to work out differences. \nThey have many matters in the Senate bill that have not been debated in \nthe House, yet those will be taken up in conference committee.\n  So it is late in the evening, Madam Chair, as you well know, and I \nhave heard a lot of very, very interesting things throughout the hours \nand hours of debate.\n  But I simply cannot understand how Members will come to the floor and \nessentially tell us: ``We were for all of these bills, but we are no \nlonger for all of these bills. We were for them before we were against \nthem because we are just afraid the Senate somehow can't take care of \nthemselves.''\n  I think we should reject that. These are bills that were passed \nunanimously and near unanimously in the House. They are bipartisan. \nThey include Republican bills, Democrat bills.\n  As much as I respect the ranking member, this argument makes no sense \nto me whatsoever.\n  The House has already spoken on these matters. Let's get the people's \nbusiness done. I urge all Members to adopt the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 22 Offered by Mr. Mullin\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 22 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-326.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Upton), I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 1032, after line 4, add the following:\n\n                      DIVISION J--ENERGY SECURITY\n\n     SEC. 99001.

ENERGY SECURITY VALUATION.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Energy Security Valuation Methods.--\n     Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Energy, in collaboration with the \n     Secretary of State, shall develop and transmit, after public \n     notice and comment, to the Committee on Energy and Commerce \n     and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate a report that develops recommended United States \n     energy security valuation methods. In developing the report, \n     the Secretaries may consider the recommendations of the \n     Administration's Quadrennial Energy Review released on April \n     21, 2015. The report shall--\n       (1) evaluate and define United States energy security to \n     reflect modern domestic and global energy markets and the \n     collective needs of the United States and its allies and \n     partners;\n       (2) identify transparent and uniform or coordinated \n     procedures and criteria to ensure that energy-related actions \n     that significantly affect the supply, distribution, or use of \n     energy are evaluated with respect to their potential impact \n     on energy security, including their impact on--\n       (A) consumers and the economy;\n       (B) energy supply diversity and resiliency;\n       (C) well-functioning and competitive energy markets;\n       (D) United States trade balance; and\n       (E) national security objectives; and\n       (3) include a recommended implementation strategy that \n     identifies and aims to ensure that the procedures and \n     criteria referred to in paragraph (2) are--\n       (A) evaluated consistently across the Federal Government; \n     and\n       (B) weighed appropriately and balanced with environmental \n     considerations required by Federal law.\n       (b) Participation.--In developing the report referred to in \n     subsection (a), the Secretaries may consult with relevant \n     Federal, State, private sector, and international \n     participants, as appropriate and consistent with applicable \n     law.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 512, the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I am offering this amendment on behalf of \nChairman Upton. I would like to thank him for his leadership on the \nenergy issues.\n  This is a noncontroversial provision that had bipartisan support when \nit was reported out of the full committee. I would urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n\n                              {time}  0100\n\n  Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Olson) for the purpose of supporting the amendment.\n  Mr. OLSON. Madam Chair, I thank my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Madam Chair, a special thanks to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nUpton), my committee chairman, for having this amendment in this \nimportant highway bill. This amendment is common sense. There is a \ngreat saying in America, ``The third time is a charm.''\n  These exact words have passed this body three straight times. In the \n112th, the 113th, and the current 114th Congress, this exact language \nhas passed this body without objection, all ``yea'' votes. It is \nnoncontroversial.\n  This amendment does one simple thing. It ensures that our power grid \nwill be reliable in a power crisis, and that crisis won't become a \nlegal crisis as has happened at least two times in the last 10 years.\n  It is the same scenario: there is a power crisis, the entity that \ncontrols the grid says to keep that grid up and running, the operator \nsays we will see our permits from EPA, they do that, and they are sued. \nThis amendment says to stop that practice. If you are told to keep the \ngrid up and running, you can do that for at least 16 days.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment one more \ntime because right now we have the chance to have it go to the \nPresident and become signed into law to make our grid safer and more \nreliable for future Americans.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nOlson) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the Senate amendments to \nthe bill (H.R. 22) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \nemployees with health coverage under TRICARE or the Veterans \nAdministration from being taken into account for purposes of \ndetermining the employers to which the employer mandate applies under \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, had come to no \nresolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/house-section/article/H7740-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7740-H7741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. MULLIN.
