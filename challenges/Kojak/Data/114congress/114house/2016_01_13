It is clear he doesn't understand the solutions that will get \nour Nation back on track with the American people, not Washington \nbureaucrats.\n  President Obama promised hope and change, but his failed agenda has \nbrought the wrong kind of change, and many North Carolinians are losing \nhope.\n  Fortunately, Republicans are committed to restoring confidence in \nAmerica and empowering her people to make their own decisions and \npursue their own dreams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/13/house-section/article/H333-7", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H333-H334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING KOREAN AMERICAN DAY\n\n  (Mr. HONDA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HONDA.

Since their arrival, the Korean \nAmerican community has enriched and strengthened our Nation's society, \nculture, Armed Forces, economy, politics, education, and arts.\n  From serving in high-level posts in our government to making strides \nin entrepreneurship and medicine, Korean Americans continue to leave an \nindelible mark in our Nation's history and makeup.

His \nmilitary service included a combat tour of duty in Afghanistan. His \npersonal awards include the United States Army Commendation Medal, the \nArmy Achievement Medal, and the Army Good Conduct Medal.\n  Like so many other veterans before him, Ethan Edelman served his \ncountry with honor, with dedication, and with courage.\n  Ethan Edelman left the United States Army to enroll as a student at \nMetropolitan State University in Denver, Colorado.\n  Last year, Ethan Edelman, tragically, took his own life on Veterans \nDay, a day that carries so much emotion for those of us who have served \nthis great Nation in uniform.\n  Ethan Edelman will always be remembered for his service to this \ncountry.

Gaelic brought \n56 men, 21 women, and 25 children across the Pacific Ocean from Korea \nto America in search of a better future.\n  On Korean American Day, our Nation celebrates a community that has \nmade tremendous contributions to this country. Since 1903, the Korean \nAmerican population has grown to almost 2 million and has become \nintricately woven in the fabric of our country.\n  Korean Americans have made contributions in all aspects of American \nlife. They are our servicemembers, our doctors, businessmen, teachers, \nand community leaders. They are our neighbors and, most importantly, \nour friends.\n  For centuries, Korean immigrants and their descendants have helped \nbuild America's prosperity. Their culture enriches our lives in so many \nways as they uphold the important values of community, hard work, and \nfamily that make America strong.\n  I am proud to be a part of New York State, which has the second \nlargest Korean American population in the U.S. I am honored to join my \ncolleagues and friends in celebrating all that the Korean Americans \nhave done for our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/13/house-section/article/H334-5", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SMALL BUSINESS HURT BY FEDERAL OVERREACH\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA.

Today we will send him \na measure blocking the EPA's waters of the United States power grab, a \nproposal rejected by both Houses of Congress, two Federal courts, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, and many States.\n  The EPA's plan would grant jurisdiction over fully 95 percent of my \nhome State of California, allowing an unaccountable Federal agency to \ninsert itself into land use decisions once again across our State.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President spoke glowingly of small business America \nlast night. Between waters of the United States, his rejection of \nhealth options plans for Americans, and forcing minimum wage proposals \nupon small businesses and their employees, small businesses don't have \na chance. They don't have a chance to survive and thrive in this \ncountry.\n  If the President really wants to work with Congress in a constructive \nway, he can start today by rejecting the waters of the United States \npolicy that is hurting small businesses, farms, and ranches, and \nactually help us build the water supply we need in California and the \nWestern States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/13/house-section/article/H334-6", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H334-H335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TIME FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE ACTION\n\n  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. DeFAZIO.

But you have to wonder if the \nlights are on or anybody is home down there at the Justice Department. \nHello? I don't think there is anybody there.\n  I believe that this illegal occupation, this destruction of Federal \nproperty, was directly emboldened by the fact that the father of the \ntwo leaders, Cliven Bundy, stood down the government 2 years ago when \nhe owed $1 million.\n  Other ranchers pay their grazing fees, and he refuses to do it. He \nwas grazing in areas that were prohibited. He stood down the government \nat the point of a gun, and he is still illegally grazing.\n  Nobody--nobody--at the Justice Department has seen fit to lift a \nfinger against him. There is no ongoing prosecution. They haven't put a \nlien on his cattle.\n  He celebrated the anniversary of the takeover and said: This is how \nit is done.\n\n[[Page H335]]\n\n  Now his sons are replicating that in my State of Oregon, where we \nabide by the laws.

The Vikings shut the \nSeahawks out completely.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on S.J. Res. 22.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The question of what is and is not waters of the United States has \nbeen the subject of debate for many decades. The reason this question \nis so important and contentious is because, if water or land is \nFederal, it is subject to regulation by the Federal Government.\n  The Clean Water Act was originally intended as a cooperative \npartnership between the States and the Federal Government, with the \nStates being primarily responsible for the elimination and prevention \nof water pollution and the oversight of waters within their borders.\n  This successful partnership has given rise to monumental improvements \nin water quality throughout the Nation since the Clean Water Act's \nenactment in 1972 because not all waters need to be subject to Federal \njurisdiction.\n  Following the Supreme Court's decision of SWANCC and Rapanos, \ndetermining the appropriate scope of jurisdiction on the Clean Water \nAct has been confusing and unclear. Both the regulated community and \nthe Supreme Court called for a rulemaking that would provide this \nneeded clarity. The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers voluntarily \nundertook a rulemaking to respond to the need for clarity, and that is \nwhen things went terribly wrong.\n  If the agencies had taken the time to consult with the States and \nlocal governments and to actually listen up front to the issues that \nour States, counties, cities, and townships are facing, the agencies \nwould not have had to admit to Congress in multiple hearings that their \nproposed rule created confusion and uncertainty, but they did not take \nthis time for consultation.\n  If the agencies had followed the proper rulemaking process, we \nwouldn't have had a proposed rule that cut corners on the economic \nanalysis, used incomplete data, and took a cursory look at the economic \nimpacts of the rule on just one of the many regulatory programs under \nthe Clean Water Act, but they did not follow the rulemaking process.\n  If the agencies had done things right, the substantive comments filed \non the rule would not have been nearly 70 percent opposed to the rule.\n  If the agencies had done things right the first time, the Committee \non Transportation and Infrastructure wouldn't have had to respond to \nthe more than 30 States and almost 400 counties which requested the EPA \nwithdraw or significantly revise the proposed waters of the United \nStates rule and move H.R. 1732, a bill the House passed in May of 2015 \nthat was a bipartisan bill, that would have sent the rule back to the \nagencies so they would go through the correct process.\n  If the agencies had properly developed the rule in a joint fashion, \nthe Army Corps of Engineers would not have been cut out of the process \nand would not have had to send last-minute letters through the chain of \ncommand that questioned decisions that were being made in the final \nrule and that pointed out multiple issues that would make the rule \nnearly impossible to implement and legally questionable.\n  If the agencies had actually set out to clarify jurisdiction and not \nto simply gift themselves unlimited discretion to regulate whatever \nthey wanted,\n\n[[Page H336]]\n\nthey would not have needed to have conspired to influence and skew the \npublic comments during the open rulemaking process or to promote and \njustify an agenda that the majority of States opposed and have sued to \nstop.\n  Recently, the Government Accountability Office issued a legal opinion \nrelated to its investigation of the EPA regarding the waters of the \nUnited States rule that drastically increases the agencies' authority \nat the expense of the States.\n  The GAO's findings are plain and simple: The EPA broke the law. By \nusing social media tactics, the GAO called ``covert propaganda'' and \n``grassroots lobbying,'' the EPA undermined the integrity of the \nrulemaking process and violated the trust of the American people.\n  The agencies simply did not do things right. In fact, they did things \nvery, very wrong. And now we have a rule on the books that is \nreflective of a completely flawed process.\n  Today the waters of the United States rule goes far beyond merely \nclarifying the scope of the Federal jurisdiction under Clean Water Act \nprograms. It vastly expands Federal power. The clarity this rule \nprovided is simple: Everything is Federal.\n  The rule misconstrues and manipulates the legal standards announced \nin the SWANCC and Rapanos Supreme Court cases, effectively turning \nthose cases that placed limits on the Federal Clean Water Act \njurisdiction into a justification for the agencies to expand their \nassertion of Federal authority over all waters and wet areas \nnationally.\n  The agencies chose to write many of the provisions in the proposed \nrule vaguely in order to give Federal regulators substantial discretion \nto claim Federal jurisdiction over most any water or wet area whenever \nthey want.\n  This vagueness will continue to lead the regulated community without \nclarity and certainty as to their regulatory status and leaves them \nexposed to citizen lawsuits and massive government fines.\n  In addition, since many of these jurisdictional decisions will be \nmade on a case-by-case basis, they will give the Federal regulators \nfree rein to find jurisdiction.\n  This rule, in essence, establishes a presumption that all waters are \njurisdictional and shifts the burden to prove they are not to the \nproperty owners and to others in the regulated community. This rule \nwill set a very high bar for the regulated community to overcome.\n  The administration even explicitly acknowledged that it wants maximum \ndiscretion in its Statement of Administration Policy for H.R. 1732, \nstating that it opposed the bill because it would constrain the \nagencies' regulatory discretion.\n  The rule undermines the successful Federal-State partnership and \nerodes State authority by granting sweeping, new Federal jurisdiction \nto waters never intended for regulation under the Clean Water Act.\n  In justifying the need for this rule, the agencies claimed that \nmassive amounts of wetlands and stream miles are not being protected by \nthe States and that this rule is needed to ``protect'' them.\n  Yet, the agencies continue to claim that no new waters would be \ncovered by the rulemaking, which raises the question of how the rule \ncan protect these supposedly unprotected waters without vastly \nexpanding Federal jurisdiction over them. The agencies are talking out \nof both sides of their mouths.\n  The reality is that States care about and are protective of their \nwaters, and wetlands and stream miles are not being left unprotected.\n  More than 30 States have sued the Federal Government over this rule. \nWho can blame them? States and local governments and the regulated \ncommunity all repeatedly expressed concern that the agencies have cut \nthem out of the process and have failed to consult with them during \nevery step in the development of this rule.\n  The agencies engaged in a flawed process from the beginning, ignoring \ntheir State and local partners and ignoring each other, and gifted \nthemselves virtually limitless authority over land in this country that \ncould contain water.\n  Furthermore, they broke the law by illegally influencing both the \npublic comment period and lobbying against congressional efforts to get \nthem to change their course.\n  S.J. Res. 22 halts this appalling overreach by the executive branch. \nThe stakes are simply too high not to act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We are ultimately here because of a failure by the United States \nCongress to act. The last time Congress revisited the Clean Water Act \nwas in 1987. There are very few Members here today who were elected at \nthat time.\n  The reason we have the Clean Water Act is that--I remember a time \nwhen I was young when the Cuyahoga River caught fire because of \nindustrial waste and when the Willamette River in my State was an open \nsewer because it was a convenient place to dump your municipal human \nwaste.\n  It was a disaster for our country, and we decided to deal with that \nproblem under Republican leadership, which we did quite successfully. \nBut now we realize it is a little more complicated than just keeping \nout the point source pollution from industrial waste and/or municipal \nwaste.\n  There are other threats to our clean water, one of the most precious \nthings we have. Read the CIA documents or the planning by the Pentagon. \nWars will be fought over water. We can't sully this precious resource, \nand I think there is pretty substantial agreement on that. The question \nis: What, where, and how do we protect the waters of the United States?\n  This is incredibly confusing. We have a split Supreme Court, with \ncontradictory decisions out of the Supreme Court, and we are now, \ntoday, living under Bush-era guidance regarding the Clean Water Act.\n  That unfortunately is described by people from the extremes of the \ndebate--from the American Farm Bureau Federation to the Natural \nResources Defense Council--as totally unworkable, inconsistent, \nincomprehensible, and it provides no certainty to farmers or to \nconservationists or to developers or to anybody else. That is what we \nare living under. We are living under those rules today.\n  Here is a quote from the American Farm Bureau:\n\n       A hodgepodge of ad hoc and inconsistent jurisdictional \n     theories, which, ultimately, will result--and is resulting--\n     in increased delays and costs to the public at large.\n\n  That is what we are living under because this new rule, which the \nHouse today will act to overturn, is not in effect. What is in effect \ntoday is Bush-era guidance.\n  If this legislation were to pass and become law, which it won't \nbecause the Senate has already failed to muster a veto-proof majority \nover there on this issue--so this is all kind of a show--the provisions \nof this resolution or disapproval are so broad that all of the work \nthat went into constructing this new rule could not be replicated in \nany manner.\n  Essentially, we would be stuck forever unless we change the law, and \nCongress hasn't acted on the Clean Water Act for 30 years. Unless we \nchange the law, we would be stuck forever with an ad hoc, inconsistent \nhodgepodge of jurisdictional theories, which are resulting in increased \ndelays and costs to the public at large. That is the ultimate result, \nwere this to pass and become law.\n  Now, I will admit that the administration caused a good deal of the \nproblem here today. The rule, as initially promulgated by the EPA, was, \nI would say, turgid at best, and it caused incredible confusion. It \nseemed to have jurisdictional theories, et cetera, et cetera, very much \nlike the Bush rule.\n  There was an uproar from Members of Congress, farmers, developers, \nand conservationists. Everybody had concerns about their initial rule. \nSo what did they do? They went out and they listened. They had a \nmassive number of comments to which they meaningfully responded, and \nthen they found a few areas where they did make major improvements.\n  Do I think it is a perfect rule? No. But the courts will decide where \nit is adequate or inadequate, and then that would give direction to a \nfuture Congress to actually act and do its job on the Clean Water Act. \nThat would be desirable.\n\n[[Page H337]]\n\n  It does deal with roadside ditches. There are huge concerns about \nroadside ditches. A good change. It has the explicit exemption of \nmunicipal separate storm sewers from the Clean Water Act. Again, that \nwas the confusing part of their first rule.\n  It permanently exempts groundwater and water-filled depressions \nrelated to fill or gravel mining activities. There is a huge concern \nwith gravel extraction activities in my State.\n  Also, a litany of erosional features, artificial ponds, and \nartificially irrigated areas were exempted from the Clean Water Act, \nwhich very explicitly and clearly benefit farmers and developers.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  In fact, this subject came up at our joint hearing on this issue. \nSenator Inhofe brought this up. This was subjected to the Clean Water \nAct regulatory process. They wanted to turn this into a warehouse \nfacility to develop the land. It is very marginal at best as farmland.\n  Army Assistant Secretary Darcy confirmed, upon a question from me, \nthat, in fact, under her new rule and guidance, this property would be \nexempt; but under the Bush rule, it isn't. So they can't develop it \nunder the Bush rule, but they could develop it under the new rule, \nwhich we seek today to overturn.\n  So this new rule is an improvement. Is it perfect, no. In fact, I \nthink the courts might find it wanting in a number of ways, which would \nrequire further action by Congress. To merely say we reject it, we want \nto live under the Bush rule--which everybody hates and says doesn't \nwork--forever doesn't make a lot of sense. Also, acting here today, \nwhen the Senate has already made it clear that they don't have a veto-\nproof majority, shows that we are wasting time.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, just for a little bit of clarity, H.R. 7232 \nthat was passed out of the House, it was to rescind this proposed rule \nand for the agencies to start over. That is actually the position of \nthe American Farm Bureau. They do not support this proposal. They want \nto start over and get a rule that does have clarity.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S.J. Res. \n22, the resolution of disapproval for the waters of the United States \nrule. The ranking member pointed out that the Bush rule creates \ntremendous uncertainty. He is correct, absolutely correct. We need to \nmake sure we change it.\n  This rule that the President has put forward has 32 States that have \nfiled lawsuits against it. Thirty-two States have said: no, this \ndoesn't work.\n  For decades, the Federal regulators worked as partners with the \nStates to significantly improve water quality across this country. \nThose situations that the ranking member talked about that happened 40 \nand 50 years ago aren't happening today. The States have worked very \nclosely with the Federal Government to make sure that we have clean \nwater, that we are protecting that precious resource we have.\n  Now, I will say right up front, because I know someone is going to \ncall me out on it, the Governor of Pennsylvania did not file a lawsuit. \nWell, he is a liberal Democrat who has an extreme environmental agenda. \nHe doesn't really care about the farmers of Pennsylvania, nor does he \ncare about the building industry in Pennsylvania. This Governor is \nwrong on this issue.\n  Again, 32 States have said ``no'' to this rule. The Federal \nGovernment shouldn't be regulating every drop of water. Again, \nPennsylvania, like every other State, is supposed to bear primary \nresponsibility for regulating the waters within its own borders, but \nthat will change when the EPA and the Corps of Engineers blatantly \nignore Pennsylvania and the other 49 States, the limits of the Federal \njurisdiction published in this rule.\n  The gentleman knows full well, across this country, there are \nprotests going on, and also in the State of Oregon. The Federal \nGovernment, again, has an overreach, keeps pushing out there. This rule \nwill be the same thing. The Federal Government will push out and reach \nout and do things that weren't intended to be in the law.\n  Just about every wet area in the country is open to Federal \nregulation under this rule. Jobs will be threatened, the rights of \nlandowners and local governments will be trampled. That is the \nfrustration out in America today. The Federal Government keeps pushing, \npushing, pushing, and doing things that really don't have a significant \nimpact on the environment or other areas of their jurisdiction, and \nthey cause great harm to individuals out there. So that is why there is \ntremendous frustration in this country today.\n  There are clear problems with this rule. Again, the administration \nbasically concocted this proposal in a vacuum. Pennsylvania and the \nother States were asked about this rule. As I said, 32 States have \nfiled suit against it. That is significant. That is almost three-\nquarters of the States that have said ``no'' to this rule. That is a \nprime example, again, of why Americans are sick and tired of this.\n  Every day I hear from farmers, homebuilders, small businesses, and \nothers in my district. Some farmers have said they won't be able to \npass on their family farm because of the cost associated with this \npower grab. As I said, I have no doubt that is what is going to happen. \nThis will continue to expand if we don't stop it here today and send a \nstrong message to the President to, as the subcommittee chairman said, \ntake this rule back.\n  Let's start over. Let's include the States in the development of this \nrulemaking. The EPA and the Corps need to listen to the States as \npartners as they have done for many, many years\n  Just last night, the President of the United States stood on this \nHouse floor and talked about the need for eliminating rules that are on \nthe books. Well, how about let's not put rules on the books that are \ngoing to cause great harm and great damage to many sectors of the \neconomy, to many American people. This is a time when the President can \nshow us that those words last night weren't hollow, that they were \nmeaningful, and that he wanted to reach across the aisle. Here is a \nchance.\n  There were a number of Senators on the other side of the aisle who \nvoted for this. The last couple of times we have passed WOTUS bills \nhere in the House, we have had bipartisan support. Here is an \nopportunity for us to work together.\n  Again, last night we listened to the President. We heard him say some \nwords, some words good. Again, if they are not willing to listen to the \nCongress on this issue, the very first order of business after he stood \nthere last night and talked about, as I said, the need to reduce rules, \nas I said, how about let's not put a rule in place that is going to \ncause great harm to this country.\n  The Congressional Review Act was put in place for just this very \npurpose. This is an opportunity for us to all join and do exactly what \nthe ranking member has asked for, certainty in the rule. Reject \nPresident Bush's rulemaking. Let's put a rule in place the States can \nsupport and the American people can support\n  I urge all Members to support S.J. Res. 22.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Well, the chairman and I have established a good record of working \ntogether. I would love to get a commitment here to work together, to go \nthrough a full reauthorization of the Clean Water Act and clarify these \nmany issues, what we want to protect and what we want to be excluded \nfrom the jurisdiction. The Congress has the authority to do that. I \nthink we should undertake that. It would be very difficult.\n  To say that repealing this rule, which does have some clarifications \nof the Bush rule--that would return us to the Bush-era regulations, a \nhodgepodge of ad hoc and inconsistent jurisdictional theories that are \nresulting in an increase in delays caused to the public at large, \ndoesn't seem like a good result. So unless we choose to act and clarify \nthe law, that is what we are going to be stuck with.\n\n  Under this resolution, absent another specific action by Congress, \nthey can't use any of the work that went into developing this rule or \nthe data. It can't\n\n[[Page H338]]\n\nbe substantially the same. We would have to further authorize them to \nbegin a new rulemaking.\n  There was unprecedented public comment, 207 days of public comment. \nThere were 1 million comments received. There were 400 public meetings. \nThere was a special consultation process for the States and local \nofficials. Now, my State and the State of Pennsylvania apparently were \npretty satisfied with that. There are other States that weren't, but \nmaybe they didn't go to the meetings.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. \nNapolitano).\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 22, \nthe Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution on the EPA and \nCorps of Engineers clean water rulemaking.\n  I thank my ranking member, Peter DeFazio, for his strong advocacy and \ndedicated leadership in protecting the waters of the United States.\n  Congress has a long history in supporting the Clean Water Act. Back \nin 1972, Congress overrode President Nixon's veto of the Clean Water \nAct, demonstrating bipartisan support for the Federal regulation of our \nNation's waters.\n  The message was very clear: Human health would no longer take a back \nseat to big business. We need to protect our people. Never mind \nbusiness, agriculture, and some others, what about the people who drink \nthe water and use it for everyday purposes?\n  Now, more than 40 years later, we are set to vote to overturn the \nclean water protection rule, a rule that for the first time in over a \ndecade provides clarity for regulated parties and protection for our \nNation's rivers and streams.\n  What message are we sending out today? Clearly, we are not telling \nthe American people that what water the American people have left is \nnot worth protecting.\n  Mr. Speaker, when developing the clean water protection rule, the \nadministration went to unprecedented lengths to engage with \nstakeholders, including ranchers, farmers, and municipalities. They \nheld over 400 stakeholder meetings on the rule and reviewed close to a \nmillion public comments on the rule. I say public, because the public \nwas also partly commenting on this.\n  It is evident that EPA and the Corps wholeheartedly considered these \ncomments and concerns because many of the clean water rule's reforms \nbenefit industry, agriculture, and municipalities. These reforms \ninclude limiting permits for ditches and municipal storm water sewers \nand codified exemptions for certain agriculture, construction, and \nmining activities.\n  Let us not forget that farmers and developers alike call the Clean \nWater Act's current--I am talking again about the current one--\nregulatory process ad hoc, inconsistent, and costly.\n  The rule we are attempting to overturn would keep the old Bush \nadministration-era confusing regulations in place and potentially \nprohibit the President and his future successors from developing a \nclean water rule in the future.\n  As we stand here today, I can't think of one good reason to pass this \nresolution. The same groups that asked for this rule actually benefited \nfrom the rule, but they are now asking us to do away with that rule. \nThe only thing I can surmise is that those who oppose this rule would \noppose any rulemaking that did not drastically limit the application of \nthe Clean Water Act or, to put it another way, these groups are simply \nopposed to the Clean Water Act entirely.\n  In California, 99.2 percent of the population gets its water from \ndrinking water systems that rely on water bodies protected by this \nrule. With numbers like that on the line, intervening now is simply \nreckless.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in strong opposition \nto the resolution.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Gibbs and certainly \nthe entire committee, Chairman Shuster and others, for their work on \nthis issue.\n  I rise today in strong support of this legislation. I certainly \nappreciate clean water.\n  However, the EPA's waters of the U.S. rule, or WOTUS, is one of the \nlargest abuses of executive power in modern history and poses a \nsignificant threat to America's economy. Under the rule, the EPA and \nthe Army Corps of Engineers will have the power to dictate land use \ndecisions and farming practices of agricultural producers and \nbusinessowners all across the country.\n  To give you an idea of the scope of the overreach and to illustrate \nwhy my colleagues from urban districts should also be concerned about \nthis rule, I want to share with you an example of EPA and the Army \nCorps' abuse in Douglas County, Nebraska, with a population of over \n500,000, in my home State. The President also happens to be visiting \nthis county today.\n  In 2005, the county began the process of submitting the proper \nenvironmental permit applications needed to extend a section of road \nabout 1 mile. The project was designated as having the lowest level of \nenvironmental impact. However, construction is not slated to begin \nuntil at least 2019.\n  Why the delay? There is a small ditch which runs adjacent to the \nproposed project. Within the ditch, there is a small rut about 6 to 8 \ninches wide and no more than an inch deep. It has no ordinary high \nwater mark, and there are no wetland plants growing in the ditch. \nHowever, the Corps declared this ditch a water of the United States, \ncosting the county thousands of dollars and numerous years.\n  This was never the intent of Congress when the Clean Water Act was \npassed. The act clearly limits Federal jurisdiction to navigable \nwaters. In fact, the term ``navigable'' appears more than 80 times in \nthe Clean Water Act. There is no way one can tell me that an inch-deep \nditch is a navigable water.\n  Congress has a responsibility to guard against these bureaucratic \npower grabs by executive agencies. This is why I introduced the \ncompanion bill to this legislation immediately after the rule was \nfinalized. My resolution gained more than 70 cosponsors, with \nsupporters from both sides of the aisle.\n  Thanks to the expedited procedures established under the \nCongressional Review Act, after we vote on this legislation the bill \nwill proceed immediately to the President's desk. My hope is the \nPresident will listen to the American people and roll back this new \nrule.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 19\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Ohio has 16 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The gentleman just made an excellent point. It is absolutely \nunbelievably stupid and absurd that that ditch should have held up a \nneeded project in an urban area, but that is because of the Bush rule, \nthe rule that today we are saying should be in place indefinitely or \nperhaps forever.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  That ditch is specifically exempt under the newly adopted rule, which \nhas been suspended by litigation. If the gentleman wants to deal with \nthe ditch problem, it has been dealt with. Unfortunately, the courts \nhave put a stay on it. But now the gentleman wants to throw out the new \nrule, which would exempt ditches like that, and go back to the Bush era \nrule, which is what caused that problem--cause and effect.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say, please, Members, vote \n``no'' on this resolution. It is a very bad idea. What is happening \nhere, for the folks listening, is that the EPA has come up with a rule \nthat is going to strengthen protections for drinking water for 117 \nmillion people.\n  Our Republican colleagues have brought forth a resolution to \ndisapprove of the rule, leaving people vulnerable to the status quo. \nThis comes out to about one in three Americans across the country and \nperhaps one in five Minnesotans in my home State.\n  Now, I am critically concerned about all of America--I am a U.S. \nCongressman--which leads me to the situation in Flint. The fact is \nthat, by clarifying that waters are protected under the Clean Water \nAct, the rule would reduce the amount of pollution entering major \nrivers and waterways. This would mean less corrosive water, which is \npart of\n\n[[Page H339]]\n\nwhat led to the water crisis being seen in Flint, Michigan, right now.\n  When the highly corrosive water of the Flint River passes through \nFlint's service pipes, it leaches lead out of the pipes and into \nresidents' drinking glasses, bathtubs, and swimming pools. The water \ncrisis in Flint reminds us that failure to step up and protect our \nwater supply puts the lives of the public in danger. Eight thousand \nchildren are now facing poisoning because of this nasty situation.\n  In Flint, residents were forced to pay for water that was poisoning \nthem, by an unelected emergency manager. A mother and Flint resident, \nLee Ann Walters, started bathing her children with bottled water, as \nshe learned that her children were showing signs of lead poisoning and \nthat the lead levels in her tap water were seven times higher than the \nminimum safety standard. The entire city has been exposed to dangerous \nlead levels, including as many as 8- to 10,000 children.\n  If this does not compel us to stand up and fight for clean water, I \ndon't know what will. We absolutely need to say ``no'' to this \nresolution that would expose us to dirty water.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I just want to go back down memory lane just \na second. My good friend from Oregon, when we were debating H.R. 1732, \nthe bill that said let's stop this rule and work up a rule that will \nbring clarity, he said that was a bipartisan-supported bill. But the \ngentleman said we didn't need to pass H.R. 1732 because whenever the \nrule comes out, we have the Congressional Review Act to take care of \nthe problem. That is what we are doing today.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, Congress gave the EPA jurisdiction over \nnavigable bodies of water large enough to support ship traffic. This \nEPA rule takes control over virtually every body of water in the United \nStates, including many agricultural and drainage ditches, ornamental \nlakes, and small creeks and streams on private property.\n  Now, in 2010, Mr. Oberstar introduced a bill to grant them this \npower, and the Pelosi Congress refused to pass it; so the EPA simply \ndecided to seize that power anyway.\n  This not only threatens to upend 150 years of State water and \nproperty rights laws, it also presents us with a grave challenge to our \nConstitution. If it is allowed to stand, this rule means that Congress' \nexclusive legislative powers have now passed unrestricted to the \nexecutive, including the power to repeal existing laws that guarantee \nto States supremacy over their own waters and the power to amend laws \nto seize vast new executive authority in direct defiance of this \nCongress.\n  This rule must not stand. It cannot stand.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my \nranking member and the chair of the committee for their diligence in \nrunning this committee and overseeing some of the most important \nlegislation for our Nation.\n  The Clean Water Act is the key Federal law used to protect our \nNation's waters and ensure that millions of Americans have access to \nclean water. The resolution of disapproval being considered today would \nblock the implementation of important administrative reforms aimed at \nclarifying key components of this Clean Water Act. These reforms \ninclude considerations on how we define tributaries to traditionally \nnavigable waters and sets out clear exclusions to the definition of \nwaters of the United States, among other changes that will help \nstreamline the regulatory process.\n  Countless municipalities, businesses, and industry stakeholders have \nexpressed concern around the confusing and outdated regulations \nestablished under the Bush administration. In fact, more than a million \npublic comments submitted to EPA and the U.S. Corps of Engineers have \ncontributed to the formulation of this final rule. The final rule would \nprovide much-needed predictability and clarity for these groups, and \nthat has got my attention.\n  In my home State of Texas, 43 percent of the residents get their \ndrinking water from sources that rely on small streams protected by the \nmost recent Clean Water Act and rule. The rule also restores \nprotections to more than 12,000 miles of streams that feed into Texas' \ndrinking water sources. Further delaying the implementation of this \nrule will continue to have a dramatic impact on my State of Texas and \nother States around the country.\n  I see a number of immediate problems with this resolution. For one, \nS.J. Res. 22 would block any future administration from ever clarifying \nthe regulatory confusion related to the Clean Water Act unless Congress \nauthorizes a new rule. In my opinion, that does not bode well for our \nability to protect such an essential resource as clean water for \nAmericans.\n  Thankfully, President Obama has already expressed his intention to \nveto this resolution if it were to reach his desk. Based on a vote on \nthis resolution in the Senate last year, Congress lacks the support to \noverride a veto.\n  This resolution is simply another attempt by this Congress to block \nthis administration from carrying out its regulatory duties to protect \nAmericans. I do not think that there is a single Member of this House \nwho would disagree that access to clean water is absolutely essential \nfor our well-being and health.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Here we are, dedicating even more \ntime to consider legislation that would block our ability to protect \nimportant waterways and wetlands from pollution.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this resolution amounts to nothing more than a misguided \ndirection. No one thinks that any American should be subjected to a \nquestionable quality of water. For this reason, I would urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am hearing a lot of comments made about the comment period. I just \nwant to reiterate that, of the substantial comments made, 70 percent of \nthem were opposed to the rule.\n  I think what is even more important and needs to really be made clear \nhere, the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, did an \ninvestigation, and they said the EPA broke the law because they used \ncovert propaganda through social media to skew the comments and biased \nthem to their agenda.\n  This creates a huge problem for me because this violates the \nintegrity, goes to the integrity of the comment period. The reason we \nhave a comment period is for stakeholders--in this case, States, \nfarmers, developers--and a whole array of different people to have the \nability to put comments in, and it's up to the Agency to make the best \nrule possible that will work for everybody and protect the environment.\n  The GAO said they broke the law, so we need to make that clear. The \ncomment period was flawed, and that is why we need to pass this bill \nand resend it.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana \n(Mr. Graves).\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, we are here today because the \nSupreme Court in 2001 and again in 2006 determined that the EPA and the \nCorps of Engineers' definition of waters of the United States was too \nbroad, and it directed them to narrow that rule, that definition, to \nbring it into compliance and within the four corners of the law.\n  This poster here indicates the absurdity of what we are dealing with. \nClearly, you wouldn't have folks out on a kayak in a field fishing. It \nis simply nonsensical. That is what we are facing today.\n  The EPA and the Corps of Engineers didn't come back and say, ``We are \ngoing to reduce the footprint. We are going to reduce the area that is \nnow subject to the jurisdiction of the Corps under waters of the U.S.'' \nThey came out with a rule that actually expanded it. They came out with \na rule that the cost of compliance didn't decrease, as you would \nexpect, based upon the rulings of the Supreme Court. The cost of \ncompliance grew, and there were many reports about discourse within the \nCorps of Engineers and the EPA in regard to the approach that is being \ntaken today. This is simply absurd to come in and attempt to regulate \nsnow melt and drainage and things like that.\n\n[[Page H340]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Louisiana, we drain about 42 percent \nof the contiguous landmass of North America. It is one of the largest \nwatersheds in the world. You can't take a definition of waters of the \nU.S. and try and apply it to Arizona and Louisiana. Waters of the U.S. \nis our State, based upon this definition. Much of the area of south \nLouisiana would be subject to this.\n  So what does this mean? It means it is an infringement upon our \nprivate property rights: homes, businesses, land that we bought, that \nwe own. We can't have the Federal Government come in and grow \njurisdiction beyond the scope of the law.\n  I want to be clear. I am not talking about paving all the wildlands \nand open lands that we have in the United States. We certainly want to \nprotect the environment, want to protect our water quality. But the \nirony here is that this is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA \ninvolved.\n  In my home State of Louisiana, we have the greatest rate of coastal \nwetlands loss in the United States, which I want to make note, Mr. \nSpeaker, is the fault of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is their \nfault. The greatest rate of wetlands loss in the United States, their \nfault. Then here they are standing up saying: We want to protect the \nenvironment and be good stewards of the environment, and we are going \nto grow the jurisdiction of this amendment.\n  This is absurd. This is not antienvironmental. This is simply \ncomplying with the law, and this rule clearly goes beyond the scope of \nthe law. You are not going to see scenarios like this because it is \nabsurd. That is what we are facing today.\n  What is going to happen is this rule is once again going to be thrown \nout by the Supreme Court. It is once again going to be thrown out. But \nwhat Americans are going to face between now and when this is thrown \nout is they are going to be facing additional scrutiny. They are going \nto be facing the additional cost of compliance. They are going to face \nthe additional encroachment and infringement upon their private \nproperty rights.\n  It is wrong. This isn't antienvironmental. This is within the four \ncorners of the law.\n  I strongly urge you to support this resolution.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to refer back to the chairman's trip down memory lane. \nIf he recalls the circumstance, we had not yet seen the revised rule. \nThe initial rule, many of us had objected to, and we hadn't seen the \nrevised rule. The majority wanted to stop the revised rule, again, \nsticking us with the Bush-era guidance. I guess they are in love with \nthe Bush-era guidance, which everybody from the Farm Bureau to Natural \nResources Defense Council hates and says doesn't work. The gentleman \nfrom Louisiana just referenced that.\n  In the interim, we will be under these really contradictory and \nunworkable rules of the Bush era. Congress should act to update the \nClean Water Act, and then we can have a vigorous debate over what areas \nwe want to cover and what areas we don't want to cover and perhaps get \na little more clarity.\n  Today we are here because they have promulgated a rule. It is \nsubstantially different from the draft rule, and they made clear that \nmany of the things that were discussed in the interim--it is going to \nregulate my bird bath, my pond on my farm, the puddles on my farm, the \nditches on my farm; it is going to preempt land use--all of those \nthings are specifically addressed in the final rule, which we want to \noverride, and they are exempt.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  It does not change exemptions for agriculture. It doesn't regulate \nerosional features.\n  I am not going to read all the specific language, but it is all right \nhere. The ditch issue in the urban area we heard about earlier is \nsolved under this, but it is still a problem today under the Bush-era \nrule, which is still the law of the land because the new rule was \nstayed by the courts. And now we want to kill it.\n  So we don't want to fix the ditch issue, I guess, and live forever \nunder the Bush-era rule. It doesn't regulate land use. If it did the \nthings the people on the other side were saying, I think you would find \n85, 90 percent of the Members of this House would be voting for this \nresolution of disapproval. The fact is it doesn't do those things and \nwe have very specific references to demonstrate that.\n  And then, on this issue of the illegal actions, again, I was getting \nemails and phone calls from people saying, my bird bath; my pond; my \npuddles; my roadside ditches. The forest industry is saying our \nroadside ditches.\n  Well, those things are all exempt now. But these things were out \nthere, and the EPA was trying to educate people and say: Here is what \nis in. Here is what is out. And they find the weeniest of little, \nstupid violations.\n  This isn't like lawbreaking. They used Thunderclap to actually tell \npeople a few things about this rule. They forgot to put on a \ndisclaimer. Oh, someone should go to jail for that. The right-wing nuts \noccupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and Cliven Bundy \nviolating Federal law, owing us a million dollars and not paying for \ngrazing like other people, they shouldn't be prosecuted. In fact, the \nchairman referenced those nuts earlier.\n  I find it offensive and insulting to say that there is some sort of \nprotest that relates to this discussion on the floor of the House by \nright-wing extremists who have taken over illegally and are destroying \nFederal property in my State.\n  And then, secondly, they had another violation beyond using \nThunderclap. They had a link that went to someone else's site. And on \nthat someone else's site, they were advocating for the rule. Wow. These \nare lawbreakers. These are the lawbreakers we want to go after.\n  This administration doesn't go after any lawbreakers, from Wall \nStreet criminals under the collapse or these right-wing extremists in \nthe West. I discussed that earlier in a 1-minute speech on the floor.\n  But the point here is that we have much better clarification now. The \ncourts are going to rule whether this is adequate or inadequate, \nwhether Congress needs to act further, whether the rule needs to be \nrevised.\n  We should let that process go forward. That would give us some \ndirection because we don't seem to be able to initiate on our own a \nreauthorization of the Clean Water Act and have a fair debate over what \nwe want to cover and not cover. But the default action--repealing this \nrule, doing nothing--binds us to the Bush-era rule indefinitely.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Once again, Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear. It was the \nGovernment Accountability Office investigation that said the EPA broke \nthe law. Regardless of how you interpret what they said, they broke the \nlaw. I think that goes to the integrity of the whole rulemaking \nprocess, that that is a dangerous precedent, moving forward.\n  We had the talk about this rule brings clarity. Yes, it does bring \nclarity because it pretty much makes everything under water all under \nFederal jurisdiction. It is like going from the frying pan into the \nfire.\n  That is why the American Farm Bureau and a whole host of other \nentities and almost two-thirds or three-quarters of the States have \nsued or are opposed to that.\n  So we need clarity. That is why Congress needs to commit to work to \nfix that. But this rule, going forward, is more obtrusive and is a big \nproblem. Like I said, it does mean that everything is under Federal \njurisdiction.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about ditches. They exempted \nditches, but they put five exemptions to put it back in. One I really \nlike says that, if water in a ditch eventually flows out of that ditch \nand into a tributary--which they expanded the definition of tributaries \ninto navigable waters--it is not exempt.\n  So tell me where in the United States there is a ditch that has water \nthat doesn't eventually flow into waters of the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 22, which vacates \nthis overreaching and, frankly, unnecessary\n\n[[Page H341]]\n\nwaters of the U.S. rule. It prevents the EPA and the Corps of Engineers \nfrom moving forward.\n  I think the problem that has made itself real prevalent--and the \nchairman just talked about this as well--is it is not what is on the \ntop line. It is what is on the exemption line.\n  You can talk about whatever you want to talk about, but the problem I \ncome to with this--because we have been dealing with this in my part of \nthe world--and I appreciate the previous speaker from Louisiana talking \nabout the watershed there--is that I am from northeast Georgia, where \nwe are in the foothills of the mountains.\n  So, in the bottom, you have the creeks, the tributaries. We have Lake \nLanier, the Chattahoochee River, Lake Hartwell. We have a lot of areas \nthat fall here.\n  What is interesting to me--and what my friend from across the aisle \nbasically said--and what is offensive to me is to come to a place and \nsay that, just because we are going to work on a Clean Water Act, we \nare going to work on a reauthorization, we take it from Congress and \nsay that people downtown in cubicles who do not know my district and \nwho understand that they have an agenda to push will make rules and \nmake regulations that affect the livelihood of people.\n  When you take it from Congress, where it should be, that is \noffensive. I agree with my friend. It should be here. But we have seen \na pattern in the last 7 years that, if it is not moving fast enough in \nCongress, go around it. That is not possible. The Constitution is not \nsomething you can forget every once in a while.\n  Now, you can make arguments all day long. You can call it whatever \nyou want to call it. I call it just plain dumb. Common sense, as my \ngrandma told me one time, is not common. I see that in Washington all \nthe time, especially in agencies.\n  We talk about why this is confusing. We had the EPA director sitting \nin committee last year asked these very questions about the rule. She \nanswered them one way, and at the very same time, back in my district, \nthe Ninth District of Georgia, they were being told a completely \nopposite answer.\n  Where she would say it is not affected, they would say: Oh, it is \naffected. They knew because they understood their district, and the \nAgency workers in the district understood what was going on.\n  So you can have this argument all you want. This needs to be vacated. \nAs previously said, the courts have already made a statement on this. \nThis is an overreach. This is a policy choice.\n  And I am sorry. The executive branch is to carry out the law, to work \nwithin the confines of the court ruling, not to determine that they \nhave pins on their chests and that they are elected by the people that \nthey represent. They are to follow the law.\n  If we need to continue on the Clean Water Act and to make arguments \nto say that, if you are against this, you want dirty water, you want \nbad pollution, you are against this, that is just a straw man that \nneeds to be burned down and buried.\n  We are looking for commonsense regulation. We are looking for stuff \nthat makes sense. I have a gentleman in my area whose land--100 acres--\nis his main asset. When you take these rules and set them on top of it \nand he has 18 usable acres, from dry ditches and gullies, that is a \nproblem.\n  Don't hand me this, that this is going to destroy the world. Don't \nhand me this from the red hills of north Georgia, where just years ago \nit was the farmers and those who knew that living off the land meant \nconservation, who turned those red clay hills into green, lush farms. \nDon't tell me that Washington needs to be the one to tell them how to \ndo conservation and to know what to do with a dry ditch on their land. \nThis is ridiculous.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  It would be interesting if the gentleman invited the EPA to come out \nand look at that farmer's land. I think they would find that he is \nexempt and he isn't down to 18 acres. There are misunderstandings.\n  And, also, the gentleman did say something about the courts have \nalready ruled. The courts haven't ruled. That is the problem. It is \ngoing to be 2 years before they get to the merits on this rule. And so \nthey essentially have stayed the new rule from going into effect. So we \ndon't have ditch exemptions.\n  It would be interesting to contrast the existing Bush rules--which \nwill be in place for at least another 2 years--to the new rules and \nhave someone come out and consult with that farmer and say: Actually, \nyou are kind of screwed here because of the Bush rules. But if we had \nthese new rules, we could just tell you to go ahead and farm on those \n100 acres. On previously converted cropland, ditches are exempt. You \nhave the agricultural exemptions. But sorry, you are stuck with \nsomething written in the Bush era.\n  That is the effect of Congress not acting. And I would agree with the \ngentleman. The fact is we should act and we could act. The gentleman \nhas jurisdiction over the committee which could reauthorize the Clean \nWater Act.\n  It has not been reauthorized since 1987, which is why we are \nsquabbling over administration interpretation of the Bush \nadministration--I hate to have to be talking about George Bush--and the \nObama administration as opposed to Congress having at some point done \nits job to reauthorize and clarify the Clean Water Act in those \nintervening 28 years.\n  I am not aware of any plans. The chairman has told me the agenda for \nthe coming year, but rewriting the Clean Water Act and debating the \nmerits and demerits of certain protections is not on that agenda, to \nthe best of my knowledge.\n  So the effects of what the courts have done is to stick us with the \nBush-era rules for 2 more years, and the effect of what we are doing \nhere would actually stick us with the Bush-era rules indefinitely. Pick \nyour poison.\n  The bottom line is we are doing a disservice to the country by not \ngetting these commonsense exemptions in place as soon as possible.\n  I have a number of letters from groups too numerous to reference that \nI will include in the Record. Being co-chair of the House Craft Brewers \nCaucus, there is a very strong representation by the craft brewing \nindustry because of their concerns about the need for clean water to \nmake good beer.\n\n                                              American Sustainable\n\n\n                                             Business Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2016.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 250,000 businesses, \n     and more than 325,000 entrepreneurs, executives, managers and \n     investors we represent, the American Sustainable Business \n     Council (ASBC) urges you to vote against the Congressional \n     Review Act (S.J. Res. 22) overturning the EPA's Clean Water \n     Rule.\n       Clean water is good for business, and companies like the \n     ones we represent know it. They need it for their operations \n     and for the overall health of their communities. Repealing \n     this rule would not protect economic growth; it would put it \n     at risk.\n       The EPA's rule comes out of a broad desire among all \n     stakeholders, following the Supreme Court's rulings in 2001 \n     and 2006, to clarify what the EPA's jurisdiction is under the \n     Clean Water Act. This ruling is based on sound science, and \n     does not expand the agency's power under the Clean Water Act, \n     only clarifying of what bodies of water it protects.\n       Of greatest concern to us, however, is the argument that \n     this rule will jeopardize economic growth. From our \n     experience, the real risk to our economy comes when clean \n     water protections no longer exist, and businesses lose \n     control over a crucial input in food and beverage production, \n     tourism, manufacturing, and any number of industries.\n       The EPA's rule gives the business community more confidence \n     that clean water sources, including streams and rivers, are \n     protected, and removes uncertainty surrounding the agency's \n     authority to protect our waterways. This is good for the \n     economy, and vital for businesses that rely on clean water \n     for their success.\n       The business community was given ample opportunity to share \n     its concerns and inform the EPA of the rule's potential \n     impact during the months-long comment period--as evidenced by \n     the more than 1 million comments submitted during that time--\n     and the EPA had abundant time to take any concerns into \n     account and use them to improve the rule.\n       Clean water remains a necessity for so many American \n     industries, from agriculture to manufacturing to tourism to \n     food and drink production. And it's what businesses across \n     the political spectrum want--national, scientific polling \n     from the American Sustainable Business Council found 80% of \n     small business owners favored rules protecting upstream \n     headwaters, as the EPA's rule would do, and 71% said that \n     clean water protections are necessary to ensure economic \n     growth.\n       Congress needs to let this rule stand, not create more \n     uncertainty for American businesses. We urge you to vote \n     against Congressional Review Act (S.J. Res. 22). American \n     businesses are relying on you to keep this\n\n[[Page H342]]\n\n     rule intact and ensure they can rely on this most crucial \n     resource.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Richard Eidlin,\n     Vice President of Policy and Campaigns.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 11, 2016.\n     Re Hunters and anglers strongly oppose S.J. Res. 22 \n         invalidating the final Clean Water Rule\n\n       Dear Representative: The undersigned sportsmen and \n     conservation organizations strongly oppose Senate Joint \n     Resolution 22, which the House of Representatives may vote on \n     this week and would invalidate the final Clean Water Rule. \n     This important rule clarifies Clean Water Act jurisdiction in \n     a manner that is both legally and scientifically sound.\n       This joint resolution is an extraordinary and radical \n     action to overturn a fundamental, once-in-a-generation final \n     rule that is critical to the effective implementation of the \n     1972 Clean Water Act, and that was adopted following an \n     exhaustive public rulemaking process. The resolution would \n     overturn a rule that finally resolves longstanding confusion \n     and debate, promotes clarity and efficiency for regulatory \n     programs promoting river health, and preserves longstanding \n     protections for farmers, ranchers, and foresters.\n       By using the Congressional Review Act, this joint \n     resolution not only wipes out the final Clean Water Rule but \n     also prohibits any substantially similar rule in the future. \n     It locks in the current state of jurisdictional confusion and \n     offers no constructive path forward for regulatory clarity or \n     clean water. America's hunters and anglers cannot afford to \n     have Congress undermine effective Clean Water Act safeguards, \n     leaving communities and valuable fish and wildlife habitat at \n     risk indefinitely.\n       This joint resolution dismisses the voices of the millions \n     of Americans, including businesses that depend on clean \n     water, who support the new rule and are eager to reap its \n     benefits. The agencies engaged in a very transparent and \n     thorough multi-year rulemaking process that included over 400 \n     stakeholder meetings and an extended public comment period \n     that produced over one million comments. Nearly 900,000 \n     members of the public commented in support of the Clean Water \n     Rule. A recent poll found that 83 percent of sportsmen and \n     women think the Clean Water Act should apply to smaller \n     streams and wetlands, as the new rule directs.\n       The Clean Water Rule clearly restores longstanding \n     protections for millions of wetlands and headwater streams \n     that contribute to the drinking water of 1 in 3 Americans, \n     protect communities from flooding, and provide essential fish \n     and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor \n     recreation economy. The sport fishing industry alone accounts \n     for 828,000 jobs, nearly $50 billion annually in retail \n     sales, and an economic impact of about $115 billion every \n     year that relies on access to clean water. The Clean Water \n     Rule will translate directly to an improved bottom line for \n     America's outdoor industry.\n       Opponents claiming the rule goes too far and protects water \n     too much have filed a barrage of nearly identical legal \n     challenges in numerous district and appellate courts across \n     the country. On October 9, 2015, the 6th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals temporarily stayed the Clean Water Rule nationwide. \n     The Clean Water Rule and those who oppose it will have their \n     day in court.\n       Meanwhile, we want Congress to know that despite these \n     legal challenges, conservationists across the nation are \n     steadfast in our support for the Clean Water Rule. After \n     nearly 15 years of Clean Water Act confusion, further delay \n     is unacceptable to the millions of hunters and anglers eager \n     to have their local waters fully protected again. We are \n     confident that, when the dust settles in the courts, the \n     Clean Water Rule will withstand challenges saying it protects \n     our water too much.\n       The Clean Water Act has always been about restoring and \n     maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity \n     of the Nation's waters. It is bedrock support for America's \n     more than 40 million hunters and anglers and for the 117 \n     million Americans whose drinking water depends on healthy \n     headwater streams.\n       We thank all of the members of Congress who stand with \n     America's sportsmen and women to block attempts to derail the \n     rule, and ask you to reject S.J. Res. 22 and any other \n     legislative action against the rule that may follow this \n     year.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Fisheries Society, American Fly Fishing Trade \n     Association, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, International \n     Federation of Fly Fishers, Izaak Walton League of America, \n     National Wildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation \n     Partnership, Trout Unlimited.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 2016.\n     Re Oppose extreme attack on clean water, S.J. Res. 22\n\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: The League of Conservation Voters \n     (LCV) works to turn environmental values into national \n     priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National \n     Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of \n     members of Congress on environmental legislation. The \n     Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters \n     nationwide, and the media.\n       LCV urges you to vote NO on S.J. Res. 22, the Congressional \n     Review Act ``Resolution of Disapproval'' of the Clean Water \n     Rule. This radical legislative measure would threaten \n     critical clean water safeguards for the waterways that \n     millions of Americans depend on for drinking water by \n     permanently blocking the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' final Clean Water Rule.\n       Since two confusing Supreme Court decisions over a decade \n     ago, millions of acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of \n     streams that contribute to the drinking water of one in three \n     Americans have been left vulnerable to toxic dumping and \n     destruction. After an extensive and thorough process, the \n     final Clean Water Rule provides clarity and certainty on the \n     waters covered under the Clean Water Act. These waterways \n     serve as habitat for wildlife, guard against flooding, filter \n     pollution, and help provide the clean water that our \n     families, communities, and economy depend on. The Clean Water \n     Rule enjoys wide support from businesses, conservationists, \n     sportsmen, farmers, state and local leaders, and the public, \n     including the over 800,000 people who weighed in during the \n     comment period and 80% of voters from all sides of the \n     political aisle.\n       S.J. Res. 22 is an extreme dirty water resolution that \n     would not only stop the Clean Water Rule, but would prohibit \n     the agencies from developing any ``substantially similar'' \n     measure in the future. This vague and harmful language could \n     prevent the agencies from ever issuing rules that establish \n     protections for the waters covered by the Clean Water Rule, \n     leaving our streams, wetlands, lakes, and rivers vulnerable \n     to pollution for generations to come.\n       We urge you to REJECT S.J. Res 22 a dangerous bill that \n     would block the Clean Water Rule and jeopardize the waterways \n     our children and grandchildren drink, swim, and play in. We \n     will strongly consider including votes on this bill in the \n     2016 Scorecard. If you need more information, please call my \n     office at (202) 785-8683 and ask to speak with a member of \n     our government relations team.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gene Karpinski,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Healing Our Waters-\n\n\n                                        Great Lakes Coalition,\n\n                                                 January 11, 2016.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the Healing Our Waters-\n     Great Lakes Coalition, I ask you to vote against S.J. Res. \n     22.\n       The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps \n     have spent years talking to the public, including state and \n     local governments, about providing clarity to which water \n     bodies will be covered by federal law. After being asked to \n     propose a rule by stakeholders from all sides, the EPA and \n     Army Corps did so after receiving nearly one million comments \n     regarding what they proposed. Many of these comments \n     suggested substantive changes on how to define what a water \n     of the United States is. The EPA and Army Corps incorporated \n     many of the suggestions in the rule finalized last year.\n       S.J. Res. 22 stops these clean water protections from going \n     into force. More radically, it prohibits the EPA and Army \n     Corps from proposing anything that would be substantially the \n     same as what has already been developed after years of \n     deliberation.\n       For years the Clean Water Act protected all wetlands and \n     tributaries in and around the Great Lakes. However, Supreme \n     Court decisions in 2001 (SWANCC) and 2006 (Rapanos) left many \n     of these wetlands, small streams, and lakes at increased risk \n     of being polluted and destroyed. This lack of protection in \n     particular left intermittent and headwater streams vulnerable \n     to pollution and adjacent wetlands open to be filled and \n     destroyed. Half of the streams in Great Lakes states do not \n     flow all year, putting them, and adjacent wetlands, at risk \n     of increased pollution and destruction. Over 117 million \n     Americans get their drinking water from surface waters, \n     including nearly 37 million people in Minnesota, Wisconsin, \n     Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New \n     York. More importantly, 83 percent of the population in Great \n     Lakes states are dependent on public drinking water systems \n     that rely in intermittent, ephemeral, and headwater streams.\n       Protecting and restoring wetlands and streams is critical \n     to the restoration and protection of the Great Lakes. \n     According to a review of more than a thousand publications \n     from peer-reviewed scientific literature conducted by an EPA \n     Science Advisory Board, streams, tributaries (e.g., \n     headwater, intermittent, ephemeral), and wetlands are \n     connected to downstream waters. The science overwhelmingly \n     concludes that upstream waters in tributaries (intermittent, \n     ephemeral, etc.) exert strong influence on the physical, \n     biological, and chemical integrity of downstream waters. \n     Common sense also tells us this is true. Pollution in a \n     tributary is carried downriver into bigger and bigger \n     waterways. Upstream waters also feed water to Great Lakes \n     rivers and streams.\n       We need clean water protections now for our Great Lakes. \n     Wetlands and tributaries provide vital habitat to wildlife, \n     waterfowl, and fish; reduce flooding; provide clean water for \n     hunting, fishing, swimming, and paddling; and serve as the \n     source of drinking water for millions of Americans. Healthy \n     waters around the Great Lakes also fuel tourism and other \n     industries that sustain jobs because of clean Great Lakes \n     water.

Res. 22). The ``Resolution of Disapproval'' \n     under the Congressional Review Act attacks the Clean Water \n     Rule, the Obama administration's landmark initiative to \n     restore safeguards against pollution and destruction for \n     lakes, streams, wetlands and other water bodies.\n       The Clean Water Rule restores important safeguards that \n     once existed for a variety of water bodies. Those safeguards \n     were eroded after a pair of Supreme Court decisions and by \n     policies the Bush administration adopted, which left many \n     water bodies inadequately protected or lacking the pollution \n     control requirements of the Clean Water Act. The rule \n     restores prior protections for many critical wetlands, which \n     curb flooding, filter pollution, and provide habitat for a \n     wide variety of wildlife, including endangered species and \n     wildfowl and fish prized by hunters and anglers.\n       The Dirty Water Resolution is an extreme action that seeks \n     to kill the Clean Water Rule using the Congressional Review \n     Act, which goes far beyond stopping a disapproved \n     administrative action. The Congressional Review Act says that \n     an agency may not adopt ``a new rule that is substantially \n     the same'' as the disapproved rule, and the breadth of that \n     requirement is very unclear.\n       In the context of the Clean Water Rule, it could be read to \n     prohibit EPA and the Army Corps from issuing any rule that \n     establishes protections for waters that the Clean Water Rule \n     covers, like lakes, streams, and wetlands. The Dirty Water \n     Resolution radically undermines the agencies' ability to \n     clarify the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act--despite \n     urging from industry associations, conservation groups, \n     members of Congress, state and local leaders, and Supreme \n     Court justices for such a clarification.\n       By pursuing this anti-clean water resolution, pro-polluter \n     members of the House of Representatives are seeking to kill a \n     commonsense and modest rule containing scientifically-sound \n     and legally-valid protections for the nation's waters, \n     including critical drinking water supplies.\n       Restored clean water protections enjoy broad support. In \n     polling for the American Sustainable Business Council, eighty \n     percent of small business owners--including 91% of Democrats, \n     73% of Independents and 78% of Republicans--said they \n     supported the then-proposed Clean Water Rule. A strong \n     majority, 71%, also said that clean water protections are \n     necessary to ensure economic growth; only six percent said \n     they were bad for growth. Similarly, a bipartisan research \n     team polled hunters and anglers nationwide and discovered \n     that 83% surveyed thought that the Environmental Protection \n     Agency should apply the rules and standards of the Clean \n     Water Act to smaller, headwater streams and wetlands. Support \n     for this policy was strong across the political spectrum, \n     with 77% of Republicans, 79% of Independents and 97% of \n     Democrats in favor.\n       We ask that you oppose the Dirty Water Resolution (S.J. \n     Res. 22) because it will undermine protections for our \n     drinking water supplies, flood buffers, and fish and wildlife \n     habitat. This attack on clean water is not only a waste of \n     the House's time but also an excessive and dangerous act that \n     jeopardizes clean water for generations to come.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance for the Great Lakes, American Rivers, American \n     Whitewater, Amigos Bravos, Arkansas Public Policy Panel, \n     BlueGreen Alliance, Central Minnesota Chapter of Audubon, \n     Clean Water Action, Conservation Minnesota, Earthjustice, \n     Endangered Habitats League, Environment America.\n       Environment California, Environment Colorado, Environment \n     Connecticut, Environment Florida, Environment Georgia, \n     Environment Illinois, Environment Iowa, Environment Maine, \n     Environment Maryland, Environment Massachusetts, Environment \n     Michigan, Environment Minnesota, Environment Montana.\n       Environment New Hampshire, Environment New Jersey, \n     Environment New Mexico, Environment New York, Environment \n     North Carolina, Environment Oregon, Environment Texas, \n     Environment Virginia, Environment Washington, Freshwater \n     Future, Friends of the Cloquet Valley State Park, Friends of \n     the Mississippi River.\n       Great Lakes Committee--the Izaak Walton League, \n     GreenLatinos, Greenpeace, Gulf Restoration Network, Hoosier \n     Environmental Council, Iowa Environmental Council, Kentucky \n     Waterways Alliance, League of Conservation Voters, Michigan \n     Wildlife Conservancy, Midwest Environmental Advocates, \n     Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, Minnesota \n     Conservation Federation, Minnesota Environmental Partnership, \n     Missouri Coalition for the Environment.\n       Natural Resources Defense Council, Nature Abounds, Ohio \n     Wetlands Association, PennEnvironment, Prairie Rivers \n     Network, Religious Coalition for the Great Lakes, River \n     Network, Save the Dunes, Shaker Lakes Garden Club, Sierra \n     Club, Southern Environmental Law Center, Surfrider \n     Foundation, Tennessee Clean Water Network, Wisconsin \n     Environment, Wisconsin Wildlife Federation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 11, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The undersigned public \n     health organizations urge you to oppose a piece of harmful \n     legislation: S.J. Res. 22, a Congressional Review Act \n     resolution to block the Clean Water Rule proposed by the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers. This resolution is a sweeping attack on the Clean \n     Water Act that could not only impair the Clean Water Rule, \n     but also our ability to protect clean water in the future. \n     The public health community recognizes that clean water and \n     healthy populations are inextricably linked and that polluted \n     water can expose Americans to harmful contaminants in \n     numerous ways. The public depends on water not only for basic \n     survival, but for recreation, bathing, cleaning and cooking. \n     The EPA and Army Corps should be allowed to implement a rule \n     that will improve water quality and protect the health of \n     America's families and children.\n       The Clean Water Act was designed to keep pollution, \n     including carcinogens, nutrient runoff, sewage and oil, out \n     of the nation's water. The EPA and Army Corp's rule seeks to \n     clarify the protection of streams and wetlands under the \n     Clean Water Act, including streams that provide some portion \n     of water to drinking water systems that serve nearly 117 \n     million people. The rule, which is based on peer reviewed \n     science, clarifies which waters are protected and which are \n     not, allowing EPA and the Army Corps to best protect water \n     quality and public health. Unfortunately, this bill would \n     block their efforts and prevent them from implementing the \n     law and ensuring the protection of water quality for millions \n     of Americans.\n       Clean water is one of our greatest necessities and a \n     cornerstone of public health. EPA and the Army Corps should \n     be allowed to better protect public health from water \n     pollution through this important science-based rule.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Public Health Association, Physicians for Social \n     Responsibility, Trust for America's Health.\n\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Sanford).\n\n[[Page H344]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure really \nfor three reasons. One, I come from the Lowcountry of South Carolina. \nThe First Congressional District is called the Lowcountry. It is called \nso for a reason, which is our land lies low.\n  I think of the farm I grew up on. My father got it about the time I \nwas born. The reality of this measure, if these rules promulgated by \nthe administration simply move forward, as has been referenced by \nseveral different speakers, that which he thought he got, he would have \ngotten a lot less of.\n  I think that, fundamentally, this is about private property rights. \nIt is about what Philip Howard talked about years ago in his book ``The \nDeath of Common Sense.'' I don't think it makes common sense to \nclassify as navigable waters of the U.S. so many of these dry \nstreambeds or dry areas in any part of this country.\n  I also think that this is fundamentally about the rule of law. We \nhave a real tension in this country, particularly during the time of \nthis administration, on: Do we stick with this 200-year tradition we \nhave had in place or do we move toward rule by edict?\n  I think it would be a huge mistake to go down the other avenue. But, \nfundamentally, that is what this debate is about. It is about how do we \ndecide things? There will always be disagreement. But how do we decide \nthings?\n  Finally, I think this is about taking something that wasn't partisan. \nI go back to the Clean Water Act, in its origination, was a bipartisan \nbill, but making it partisan by, again, executive overreach.\n  So my colleague from Oregon, who is a dear friend and I think a \nstrong advocate, mentioned the fact that he has strongly advocated for \ncraft brewers back home. It would take me many beers to buy into the \nnotion of moving forward without change.\n  I think this is about upholding a 200-year tradition in this country \non rule of law. I think it is about protecting farmers, whether they be \nin Johns Island, South Carolina, or the outskirts of Texas, or, for \nthat matter, it is about those of us who love the environment, but \nsticking with this tradition of deciding these things in this Chamber.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Conaway), the chairman of the Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S.J. Res. \n22, a resolution to disapprove the waters of the U.S. rule, a rule that \namounts to a massive overreach by the Obama administration's EPA.\n  This rule and the process in which the EPA developed it ignored \nstakeholders, ignored States, and, as reports have shown, even ignored \nconcerns from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal agency that was \nsupposed to be co-developing the rule.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Through hearings, letters, and public forums, we repeatedly asked the \nadministration to simply start over with a process that works with \nstakeholders to achieve the goals of the Clean Water Act, rather than \nact like a schoolyard bully. We all want clean water, and we can and \nshould work together to achieve it.\n  Unfortunately, all of these requests fell on deaf ears, and the \nadministration, in what has become an all-too-common pattern, moved \nforward to ram this bill through with little regard to the comments or \nthe concerns of Americans.\n  The final rule ignores the spirit and the intent of the law in that \nEPA has claimed Federal jurisdiction over essentially any body of \nwater, such as a farm pond, or even a ditch that is dry most of the \nyear.\n  America's farmers and ranchers deserve a government that will review \nand consider their thoughts, not a government that refuses to engage \nstakeholders and hands down orders from on high.\n  The process of developing the rule was flawed from the get-go, and \nthe final product was right on par with an administration that wants to \nimpose its authoritarian will on every inch of this great land.\n  That is why the House voted overwhelmingly in favor of H.R. 1732, the \nRegulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015. That is why I stand before \nyou today to ask my colleagues to support S.J. Res. 22. Americans \ndeserve better.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, we want to expedite this, but just really, I mean, we should \ndeal with reality on the floor.\n  Rule text 230.3(S)(2)(iv)(B): ``The following are not `waters of the \nUnited States' . . . ''--to go to this--``artificial, constructed lakes \nand ponds created in dry land such as farm and stock watering ponds . . \n. ''\n  There had been language in the original rule which said that they \nwould have to be used exclusively for farm purposes. This rule said \nthey can be used for farm purposes or any other beneficial purposes. So \nponds are not regulated.\n  How many times do we have to say it?\n  There are questions and interpretations and problems and, again, \nCongress should act. Congress should have hearings and write \nlegislation to reauthorize the Clean Water Act for the first time in 28 \nyears. Otherwise, we are going to be waiting 2 years for the courts to \nmake a decision and, in the interim, we are stuck with the Bush rule.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Smith), chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and \nTechnology.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for \nyielding me time, and I support S.J. Res. 22, which rejects the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's waters of the United States rule.\n  This rule is just another one of EPA's many attempts to expand its \njurisdiction and increase its power to regulate American waterways, \neven if that means invading Americans' own backyards.\n  The Science, Space, and Technology Committee's oversight hearings \nrevealed that the EPA made arbitrary decisions in writing this rule and \njustified it with phony science. And the Government Accountability \nOffice found that the EPA's use of social media to promote the rule \nactually violated the law.\n  The Obama administration will do anything and say anything to impose \nits liberal agenda on the American people. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport S.J. Res. 22 and disapprove the waters of the United States \nrule.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GIBBS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Well, I think this is the fifth time we have debated this issue on \nthe floor, clearly, subject to widely disparate interpretation in terms \nof where we are and how we best move forward.\n  I am not going to regurgitate the arguments. They have all been made. \nNot everybody has said it, but they have all been made.\n  But, again, I think that the best way forward--I mean, first off, \nthis resolution is going to be vetoed. It will go back to the Senate \nfirst because it is a Senate bill, and the Senate showed clearly that \nthey are far, far short of a veto override. So that will be the end of \nit, unless we want to take it up for the sixth time in the House and \npretend that somehow, by overriding a veto in the House, if that could \nhappen, that we are going to compel the Senate to re-re-reconsider its \nfailure to override the veto.\n  Hopefully we won't go through that charade. We don't have very many \nlegislative days this year. I think that time would be better spent, \nperhaps, on initiating hearings and looking toward, in the next \nCongress, Congress exerting its constitutional authority to revisit the \nClean Water Act, which hasn't been revisited in 27 years.\n  We have learned a lot about waters of the United States in the last \n27 years, what needs to be protected and what can be exempted. We have \ncertainly learned a lot since the Bush era when a rule was written that \nindiscriminately covers ditches, and other features of farms and \nroadwork. That was a mistake.\n  So we could, I believe, probably, like we did with the WRRDA bill in \nthe last Congress, or the surface transportation\n\n[[Page H345]]\n\nbill in this Congress, have a pretty vigorous debate, but come up with \na decent way forward, because nobody disagrees over the need for clean \nwater in this country. It is a precious, precious commodity.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, we have had a lot of good discussion and \ndebate today, and it is clear that we need to have clarity and \ncertainty for all the stakeholders, while we protect the environment at \nthe same time.\n  We tried to do that with H.R. 1732, which passed with bipartisan \nsupport here, and, obviously, it wasn't taken up in the Senate. So we \nare here with this Congressional Review Act.\n  I would like to talk about, if this rule goes through, what happens. \nReally, what happens is it greatly expands the power of the \nbureaucracy, and it gives them a lot of open, free discretion to make \ndecisions on a case-by-case basis.\n  But it is going to do something else. It is going to require farmers, \nStates, local governments, developers, homeowners to get permits from \nthe Federal Government to do pretty much anything, because they are \nunder Federal jurisdiction.\n  It also opens them up to citizens' lawsuits, frivolous lawsuits, but \nthey will defend themselves because when the Clean Water Act was \npassed, it was passed with tough penalties to go after the polluters \nthat we had back in the sixties and the seventies, and we have \naddressed a lot of that. So it is going to add costs, unnecessary \ncosts.\n  And I would argue, and nobody has mentioned this, but I would argue \nthat this rule can make us go backwards in the improvements we have \nmade in this country on water quality and protecting the environment. \nThe reason we can go backwards is because most people want to do the \nright thing. Most people want to protect the water. Farmers, I am a \nfarmer, I want to protect it because I am one of the first ones to \ndrink it. So we want to protect that.\n\n  But when you add up so much red tape and bureaucracy and costs, they \nare not necessarily going to do what they might have done otherwise. \nThey will just do what they have to do to get by. They won't put in \nbuffer strips. They won't do grass waterways. They won't do things to \nprotect the environment because they have got to get a permit to do \neverything. And they will just say: No, this is just ridiculous, the \nbureaucrats are going to come out here and hassle me. And they are just \nnot going to do it.\n  So that is what this rule does. It actually has the potential to hurt \nthe environment, and we need to protect the environment.\n  So we need to rescind this rule, revoke this rule, go back to the \ntable, the drawing board, and instruct our agencies to come up with a \ncommonsense rule, go through the process correctly, don't break the law \nwhen they do it, and talk to the States.\n  You know, it is incredible. As soon as they filed the new rule in the \nFederal Register, 20-some States immediately, almost 30 States \nimmediately, within 24 hours, filed a lawsuit. That ought to be a red \nflag that there is a problem.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Let's go back to \nthe drawing board and start over.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S.J. \nRes. 22, a bill providing for Congressional disapproval of the rule \nsubmitted by the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection \nAgency relating to a ``Clean Water Rule: Definition of Waters of the \nUnited States.''\n  Today, the House is debating S.J. Res. 22, a resolution under the \nCongressional Review Act (CRA) to disapprove the Administration's Clean \nWater Act Rule issued in June 2015.\n  The CRA is a blunt instrument and the resolution would not only \nstrike the rule in its entirety--throwing out decades of work and \nreigniting confusion and uncertainty among industry and conservation \ncommunities--it would block future administrations from ever resolving \nthe confusion surrounding the Clean Water Act's definition of ``waters \nof the United States.''\n  This joint resolution is an extraordinary and radical action to \noverturn a fundamental, once-in-a-generation final rule that is \ncritical to the effective implementation of the 1972 Clean Water Act, \nand that was adopted following an exhaustive public rulemaking process.\n  This joint resolution would overturn this rule that finally resolves \nlongstanding confusion and debate, promotes clarity and efficiency for \nregulatory programs promoting river health, and preserves longstanding \nprotections for farmers, ranchers, and forester.\n  America's hunters and anglers cannot afford to have Congress \nundermine effective Clean Water Act safeguards, leaving communities and \nvaluable fish and wildlife habitat at risk indefinitely.\n  Along the Texas Gulf Coast where Houston is located we have worked \nlong and hard to protect essential habitats for fish, crabs and bird \nestuaries.\n  This joint resolution dismisses out of hand the voices of the \nmillions of Americans, including businesses that depend on clean water, \nwho support the new rule and are eager to reap its benefits.\n  The President has communicated that this bill will be vetoed if \npassed in its current form.\n  The ``Resolution of Disapproval'' under the Congressional Review Act \nattacks the Clean Water Rule, the Obama Administration's landmark \ninitiative to restore safeguards against pollution and destruction for \nlakes, streams, wetlands and other water bodies.\n  The Clean Water Rule restores important safeguards that once existed \nfor a variety of water bodies that are the breeding grounds for fish.\n  The rule restores prior protections for many critical wetlands, which \ncurb flooding, filter pollution, and provide habitat for a wide variety \nof wildlife, including endangered species and wildfowl and fish prized \nby hunters and anglers.\n  We must reject this attempt to inject Congress into a regulatory \nprocess that is best managed by the agency experts who are well versed \nin the process and the objectives.\n  Although this issue of the children of Flint haven been poisoned by \nlead contamination of drinking water it is relevant to the broader \ndebate on clean water and what we must remain focused upon.\n  The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary federal law in the United \nStates governing water pollution.\n  It is credited for restoring clean water levels in the United States \nthat were contaminated by chemicals and pollutants being dumped into \nfresh water sources.\n  The law maintains the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of \nthe nation's waters by preventing point and nonpoint pollution sources, \nproviding assistance to publicly owned treatment works for the \nimprovement of wastewater treatment, and maintaining the integrity of \nwetlands.\n  It is one of the United States' first and most influential modern \nenvironmental laws.\n  The disapproval resolution would undo years of work by this and \nprevious Administrations to clarify which waterways are covered by the \nClean Water Act, reducing costly confusion and permitting delays and \nrestoring protections for streams and wetlands across the country.\n  The confusion surrounding which waterways are covered by the Clean \nWater Act protections originates from two Supreme Court decisions (2001 \nand 2006) which called into question whether the Act protects isolated, \nintrastate, non-navigable waters and waters and tributaries in the \nupper portions of a watershed.\n  Subsequent interpretive guidance by the Bush Administration has led \nto an inconsistent, patchwork system frustrating the regulated \ncommunity and general public concerned with health and safety of our \nwaterways.\n  In April 2014, in response to requests from regulated industry and \nthe conservation communities, the Obama Administration published a \nproposed rule, replacing the Bush Administration-era guidance \ndocuments, to reduce regulatory uncertainty and establish a dear \nprocess for asserting Clean Water Act jurisdiction over waters. The EPA \nheld more than 400 public meetings and listened to a significant amount \nof public comment on the proposed rule. The final rule was issued on \nJune 29, 2015.\n  In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit \nstayed the Clean Water Act Rule nationwide. Accordingly, the rule is \ntied up in Federal and state courts and, therefore, is not in effect.\n  House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Ranking Member \nPeter DeFazio opposes this damaging disapproval resolution and is \nurging Members to vote NO.\n  The White House has threatened to veto this disapproval resolution if \nit reaches the President's desk: The Administration strongly opposes \nS.J. Res. 22, which would nullify a specified Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) and the Department of the Army (Army) final rule \nclarifying the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act (CWA). \nThe agencies' rulemaking, grounded in science and the law, is essential \nto ensure clean water for future generations, and is responsive to \ncalls for rulemaking from the Congress, industry, and community \nstakeholders as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  If enacted, S.J. Res. 22 would nullify years of work and deny \nbusinesses and communities the regulatory certainty needed to invest\n\n[[Page H346]]\n\nin projects that rely on clean water. S.J. Res. 22 is not an act of \ngood governance. If the President were presented with S.J. Res. 22, his \nsenior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n  There is broad opposition to this disapproval resolution from the \nconservation, consumer, science, and recreational sports communities \nincluding: Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, Greenpeace, League of \nConservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, \nSouthern Environmental Law Center, Consortium of Aquatic Science \nSocieties, American Fly Fishing Trade Association, International \nFederation of Fly Fishers, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, The Izaak \nWalton League, National Wildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt \nConservation Partnership, and Trout Unlimited.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \nsubmit any extraneous materials on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to recognize Congressman Russell for his work on this \nlegislation, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act. I think we \nshould all reflect on the reason for this resolution, one of the \nreasons, and that is that, since the Obama administration sealed the \nnuclear deal with Iran, Iran has been on a bit of a tear. It has \naccelerated its missile program at the request of President Rouhani. It \nhas taken an additional American hostage. It has stepped up the \nslaughter in Syria.\n  Days after that agreement was finalized, you had Iranian rockets \nfiring 1,500 yards off the U.S. aircraft carrier Truman. And just \nyesterday, Iran detained 10 U.S. sailors, which was not appreciated, \nespecially coming on the aftermath of firing those rockets near the \nTruman.\n  Now, we are all relieved to learn this morning that the sailors have \nbeen released. Yet, in what could be a matter of days, Iran will cash \nin with $100 billion-plus in sanctions relief of money which is now in \nescrow. And I am sure it has occurred to many of us that if Iran \nbehaves this way now, in a few days, when it gets its hands on this \nbankroll, especially given the fact that that money is going to the \nIRGC, not to the Iranian people, what other actions are we going to see \nfrom the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps?\n  We had a story this weekend, front page, in the weekend edition of \nThe Wall Street Journal, and the headline of that story is ``Nuclear \nDeal Fuels Iran's Hard-Liners.'' Iran's hard-liners will be the biggest \nwinner out of this.\n  The Revolutionary Guards, the same radical forces that held these 10 \nU.S. sailors, that force and their proxies control many of the \nindustries that will benefit from the influx of hard currency and new \ninvestment. Whether it is energy or construction, they control it. This \nICBM program, they control it.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Just as many of us warned prior to this deal about the appetite for \nenforcement, once this deal gets underway, there is no pushback from \nthe administration on this. Since the nuclear deal, Iran has tested two \nballistic missiles. Now, that is in violation of the U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution. This administration's response was to announce and \nthen abandon new sanctions within a very short timeframe, apparently to \nnot offend the Supreme Leader, to not risk its flawed nuclear deal.\n  When it comes to Iran, we need a policy of more backbone, not more \nbacking down, because it was not supposed to be this way with this \ndeal. In announcing the nuclear deal, President Obama claimed that \nAmerican sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human \nrights abuses, and its ballistic missile program will continue to be \nfully enforced. Those were the President's words, and just after that, \nwith Secretary Kerry's argument testifying before the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee.\n  This legislation is a first step in holding the administration to \nthese commitments. Under the bill, before the President can lift \nsanctions on a particular person or bank or company to implement the \nnuclear deal, he must certify that their removal is related to Iran's \nnuclear program alone. That is who we were told would be getting the \nsanctions relief--not those tied to terrorism, not those tied to Iran's \nballistic missile or other illicit weapons programs that were under \nsanction from the U.N. resolutions.\n  When the Treasury Department sanctioned Bank Melli in 2007, it noted \nthat the institution had provided banking services to the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard Corps and the Quds Force. The Quds Force is in \ncharge of assassinations outside of Iran. As we all know, the \nRevolutionary Guards have committed acts of terrorism and committed \nthose missile tests that we just recently saw. Why, then, is this bank \nset to receive sanctions relief in the coming days?\n  Bank Sepah, one of Iran's largest banks, will be another big winner \nof sanctions relief in the coming days. When that bank was designated, \nand that was January of 2007, then-Treasury Under Secretary Stuart \nLevey noted with this argument: ``Bank Sepah is the financial linchpin \nof Iran's missile procurement network.''\n  What we have to think about here is there is one reason--one reason--\nwhy a state develops ICBMs. It is to deliver a nuclear payload. It is \nto deliver a weapon. So, he says it is the financial linchpin and ``has \nactively assisted Iran's pursuit of missiles capable of carrying \nweapons of mass destruction.''\n  Indeed, Iran's ballistic missile program is advancing under President \nRouhani. He just called for the program to be accelerated. That is what \nwe have in the face of this agreement. We should not be letting this \nbank off the ropes, opening it for business from Europe to Asia.\n  To be clear, those Iranian banks and individuals not supporting \nterrorism and not supporting ICBMs can be delisted--that was what was \noriginally represented to this Congress--but not those threatening our \nnational security, and not those making threats to\n\n[[Page H348]]\n\nus while the Ayatollah is saying ``death to America,'' ``death to \nIsrael.''\n  That is what this legislation does, and it is the policy that the \nadministration explained to this House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                              Committee on Financial Services,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2016.\n     Hon. Ed Royce,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing concerning H.R. 757, the \n     North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2015, and H.R. 3662, \n     the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, both of which were \n     referred to the Committee on Financial Services in addition \n     to your Committee.\n       As a result of your having consulted with the Committee on \n     Financial Services concerning provisions of the bills that \n     fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to discharge our \n     Committee from further consideration of the bills so that \n     they may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor. The \n     Committee on Financial Services takes this action with our \n     mutual understanding that, by foregoing consideration of H.R. \n     757 and H.R. 3662 at this time, we do not waive any \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or \n     similar legislation, and that our Committee will be \n     appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar \n     legislation moves forward so that we may address any \n     remaining issues that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. \n     Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of \n     an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving this or similar legislation, and \n     requests your support for any such request.\n       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter \n     confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 757 and \n     H.R. 3662 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of \n     letters on this matter be included in your Committee's report \n     to accompany the legislation and in the Congressional Record \n     during floor consideration thereof.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                 Committee on Foreign Affairs,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2016.\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Financial Services, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror \n     Finance Transparency Act, and for agreeing to be discharged \n     from further consideration of that bill.\n       I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure \n     does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on Financial Services, or prejudice its \n     jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar \n     legislation in the future. I would support your effort to \n     seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any \n     House-Senate conference involving this legislation.\n       I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 3662 into the \n     Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. \n     I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and \n     look forward to continuing to work with your Committee as \n     this measure moves through the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Edward R. Royce,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ENGEL . I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this measure.\n  First, I do want to thank my good friend, Chairman Ed Royce. It is \nnot very often we find ourselves on different sides of foreign affairs \nissues, which is a credit to the way he runs our committee; but in this \ncase, in my view, this bill isn't the right fit or the right approach.\n  We should go back to the drawing board, rather than ramming through a \npartisan measure that will never become law. We should go through our \nnormal process of drafting legislation in a bipartisan way with input \nfrom both sides, rather than advancing something that was put together \nwithout a single Democrat having any input whatsoever. As a result, \nthis bill does not have a single Democratic cosponsor.\n  If we are going to pass legislation like this, it only works if we do \nit in a bipartisan way--as Americans--not as Democrats or Republicans. \nWe should come back here with a bipartisan bill that can actually move \nforward, just as we have done again and again and again on the Foreign \nAffairs Committee.\n  The question here is not whether Iran is a good player. Iran is a bad \nplayer. In fact, it is a terrible player. It is important that we do \nact on the challenge of Iran. Like Chairman Royce, I oppose the Iran \ndeal, but our side lost the debate. The deal is in place. Now we need \nto make sure that Iran is living up to its commitments under that deal, \nthat every word of the deal is enforced, that we crack down on Iran's \nother bad behavior, and that we take steps to shore up the security of \nIsrael and our other allies in the region. That is the kind of bill I \nwant to support, and we can do it together.\n  This bill doesn't address any of the issues. Instead, this bill would \nestablish an impossible standard for the President. The bill says that, \nin order to remove a person or a company from the nuclear sanctions \nlist, the President would have to certify that the person or company \nnever, at any point, engaged in sanctionable behavior, including \nsupport for Iran's weapons of mass destruction programs. Well, if they \nhad never engaged in sanctionable behavior, why would they be on the \nsanctions list in the first place? It just doesn't make sense, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  Now, this could be a drafting flaw or it could be just about \nembarrassing the President, but it would make it impossible for the \nUnited States to meet its obligations under the JCPOA. That worries me \nbecause, rather than holding Iran's feet to the fire and strengthening \noversight, we seem to be going down the same path we have taken with \nthe Affordable Care Act. Sixty-two times we voted to repeal it. A \ncouple of months ago, we had a vote which essentially repeals the \nJCPOA, and now we are doing it a second time. Will we do it 60 more \ntimes? It is a waste of all of our time. Let's put our heads together \nand come up with a bipartisan bill that really works.\n  Now, 62 times to vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act; my opinion \nis, those were symbolic votes because we knew the President would never \nrepeal his own bill. Today, this is a symbolic vote because we know the \nPresident is never going to sink his own agreement. My constituents \ndon't want symbolic votes, Mr. Speaker. They want results. Symbolic \nvotes won't help us crack down on Iran's support for terrorism or their \nother dangerous behavior.\n  Again, I am confident that we can work in a bipartisan way to craft \nlegislation. We have done it again and again and again on the Foreign \nAffairs Committee. Just look at the Iran sanctions bill that Chairman \nRoyce and I wrote in 2013. It passed unanimously out of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee--unanimously. And we have people who believe in their \npolitics from the right to the left and everywhere in between, but it \nwas unanimous because we did it in a bipartisan way and it made sense. \nIt came to the floor, and it passed by a vote of 400-8. That is the \nkind of thing we should be doing now on this very serious issue.\n  So if we are serious about this issue, that is the approach we need \nto take. I am confident that in the days ahead, I will be working with \nChairman Royce and all of our Members to bring forward good, bipartisan \nlegislation, but this bill is the wrong way to go.\n  I don't impugn anybody's motives. I know people worked hard on this. \nBut this is just simply, in my opinion, the wrong way to go. So, Mr. \nSpeaker, I will vote against it, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Russell), the author of this legislation.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, 19 August 2015, and I quote the President \nof the United States:\n\n       I made sure that the United States reserved its right to \n     maintain and enforce existing sanctions and even to deploy \n     new sanctions to address those continuing concerns, which we \n     fully intend to do when circumstances warrant.\n       It is imperative that we take steps to deal with Iran's \n     destabilizing activities and support for terrorism. This \n     involves continued enforcement of international and United \n     States law, including sanctions related to Iran's nonnuclear \n     activities.\n\n  I am quoting the President:\n\n       We will maintain powerful sanctions targeting Iran's \n     support for groups such as Hezbollah, its destabilizing role \n     in Yemen, its backing of the Assad regime, its missile \n     program, and its human rights abuses at home.\n\n  This was in direct response, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman who is \nsaying that he is not for upholding these things today. We had many in \na bipartisan fashion who voted against this agreement. The President \nhas stated clearly that, under the terms of the\n\n[[Page H349]]\n\nComprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of \n2010, he would not interfere with the terrorist list, that he would not \ninterfere with the human rights list.\n  But the simple fact is--and I have read every single word of the \njoint agreement--there are hundreds of people in Annex II on that \nsanctions list. Among them are more than 50 that are on the terrorist \nlist and the human rights list as violators. The President said that \nthey will not be lifted off, and yet there they are. That is what this \nbill does.\n  It is interesting that last week--and I quote a letter by our \nesteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker--and \nhere is the letter that they sent to the President of the United States \nreinforcing why this bill is such a good idea:\n\n       Iran's destabilizing behavior in the region and continued \n     support for terrorism represent an unacceptable threat to our \n     closest allies as well as our own national security. As the \n     international community prepares for implementation of the \n     joint agreement, Iran must understand that violating \n     international laws, treaties, and agreements will have \n     serious consequences. We call on the administration--this is \n     their words, Mr. Speaker--to immediately announce new, U.S. \n     sanctions against individuals and entities involved in Iran's \n     ballistic missile program to ensure Iran is held accountable \n     for its actions.\n\n  I continue to quote this letter:\n\n       Inaction from the United States would send the misguided \n     message that, in the wake of the joint agreement, the \n     international community has lost the willingness to hold \n     the Iranian regime accountable for its support for \n     terrorism and other offensive actions throughout the \n     region--including Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and the Gaza \n     Strip. This behavior--including ballistic missile tests, \n     as the chairman spoke about--poses a direct threat to \n     American national security interests and those of our \n     allies.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this was signed by Representative Lowey; our esteemed \ncolleague that is at the podium now on the other side of the aisle, Mr. \nEngel; the leader of the Democratic National Committee for Congress, \nDebbie Wasserman Schultz; and our esteemed colleagues Mr. Sires, Mr. \nConnolly, Mrs. Davis of California, and Mr. Nadler.\n  Do you know what? We agree with them. We agree totally with them that \nthese sanctions should be upheld, that the law is the law, and that the \n2010 Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act is still the \nlaw. That is what this bill does.\n  There have been claims that it was not done in a bipartisan fashion, \nand I find this somewhat puzzling because I personally talked to Mr. \nEngel about this bill. I went item by item through it and what its \ncontent was. I reached out to the Democratic leadership in August. I \nhave been working this bill since July. So, yes, we can do it in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  I regret, because I am a freshman and only have fought on three \ncontinents and have a foreign affairs and national security background, \nthat I am not on the Foreign Affairs Committee. But that doesn't \ndenote, Mr. Speaker, a lack of understanding of the way the world works \nand what the threat is in the United States of America when we have \nmade a law that says that, if you are a terrorist or a human rights \nviolator, we are not going to allow you to have sanctions relief under \nthe JCPOA. The President said that that is what he is going to do. \nDemocrats and Republicans have said that is what they will uphold. That \nis what this bill does, and yet we see, puzzlingly, opposition to these \nvery things.\n  Here is what the bill is: Annex II of the joint agreement lifts \nsanctions for hundreds of individuals for nuclear proliferation or \nhuman rights violation or terrorist violation. More than 50 of these \nindividuals and entities have been identified on the joint agreement \nfor sanctions relief. This simply requires that, before those are \ndelisted, the President certify why. It doesn't say they can never come \noff. Read section 4. It is pretty clear. It says that the President \nmust certify justification on why that is the case.\n  What this bill is not: a knee-jerk reaction, a partisan ploy that is \nquickly crafted due to recent events. We have been working for months \non this.\n  The bill was crafted without major efforts--not true, as I have \nproven this morning. This is upholding the law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge that we have the discussion. I know my colleagues \nfeel deeply about this. I know that they also would like to see this \ncontinued. Let's pass this bill.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Deutch), my friend and colleague. He is a very valued \nmember of the Foreign Affairs Committee and ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member, Mr. \nEngel, for his leadership today.\n  I deeply appreciate the bipartisan way that he and Chairman Royce \nhave run our committee when it comes to the goal that we all share of \npreventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. I am also grateful for \nthe commitment that my friend Mr. Russell has made to this same issue \nand to his service to our country.\n  This legislation, unfortunately, doesn't advance this goal that we \nshare, nor does it prevent Iran's other provocative, illegal, and \ndestabilizing regional activities.\n  I opposed the nuclear deal. I have been clear about my concerns with \nthe deal itself and with what Iran might try to do with billions of \ndollars in sanctions relief. I have also been clear about my \nfrustration that the ballistic missile tests undertaken by Iran in \nviolation of U.S. and international law have not yet resulted in \nsanctions either by the United Nations Security Council or by the \nadministration.\n  Given the dangerous behavior that we have seen out of Iran in the \npast months and weeks with respect to its illicit ballistic missile \nprogram and its continued funding of Hezbollah in Syria, we should be \nworking together to put forward legislation that strengthens the \nenforcement of the JCPOA and prevents Iran from continuing its \nsponsorship of terror, its illegal missile development, and its gross \nhuman rights violations. This bill, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, doesn't \ndo any of those things.\n  Some of my colleagues claim the bill will prevent entities from \ngetting sanctions relief under the deal that have ties to terrorism or \nWMD proliferation. I expressed directly to the administration that they \nneed to ensure that any entity that is subject to sanctions relief \nunder the nuclear deal be carefully investigated and resanctioned if \nthey are found to be engaging in support for terrorism or human rights \nabuses, but this bill doesn't do that.\n  Instead, it requires certification that the 400 entities named in the \nJCPOA have never engaged in activities related to terrorism or the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction. This standard will result \nin the administration devoting significant time and resources to a \ncertification that can never be met, while also preventing--importantly \npreventing--implementation of the JCPOA. Instead of devoting the \nnecessary resources to sanctioning individuals and entities that \nsupport terrorism and violate human rights--dangerous activities that \nwere never part of the nuclear deal--it devotes enormous resources to a \nprocess that won't accomplish that. Iran must pay the price for its \ncontinued bad behavior.\n  Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today adds several of \nIran's terrorist proxies to the banking provisions of the Comprehensive \nIran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act, one of our most \nimportant sanctions laws. Of course we want to stop banks from \nfacilitating transactions to these terrorist organizations; but, \nunfortunately, some of our European friends attempt to distinguish \nbetween the military and political wings of terrorist groups. They \nshouldn't. There is no distinction. I have spoken out against this \npolicy.\n  Nevertheless, because of this discrepancy, by naming these specific \nterrorist groups in CISADA, this bill has the potential to cut off \nEuropean banks from the U.S. financial system. Now is the time, Mr. \nSpeaker, for us to be working with our allies to craft the toughest \ninternational sanctions to crack down on Iran's dangerous activities.\n  Mr. Speaker, whether you supported this deal or not, as Mr. Engel \nsaid, it is going forward.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield the gentleman from Florida an additional 1 minute.\n\n[[Page H350]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. DEUTCH. I thank my friend.\n  We should be looking for bipartisan ways to ensure that it is \nenforced with vigor and with the most stringent verification and \ncompliance. If a violation occurs or if Iran continues to engage in \nillegal activities that were never a part of this nuclear deal, we must \nensure that we have the tools to enact punishing new sanctions, \nhopefully, with the support of our international partners, but \ncertainly with the full, bipartisan support of the United States \nCongress.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I cannot speak about Iran on the floor of the \nU.S. House without making clear that every one of us--435 Members of \nthe House of Representatives--stand united in our commitment to \nbringing home from Iran Jason Rezaian, Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, \nSiamak Namazi, and, my constituent, Bob Levinson. They sit in Iran, but \nwe look forward to welcoming them home.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, \nNonproliferation, and Trade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time \nand for his work on this legislation.\n  I do want to comment that the ranking member, Mr. Engel, I value his \nwisdom on the issue of Iran, and especially in defense of Israel. We \nhappen to disagree on this specific legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, the nuclear agreement that the administration made with \nIran was still a bad deal for America. As a former judge down in Texas, \nI know that when the bad guys do bad things, you don't reward bad \nconduct.\n  At a time when the administration needs to be strong and firm, it \nseems to be showing wobbly knees on this deal. Now we are left with a \ndeal where the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism is only a few \nsmall steps away from a nuclear bomb. The administration's continued \nleniency with Iran is conceding even more than what is required in the \ndeal. The administration is making this bad deal even worse.\n  The President promised the American people that this bad deal still \nallows nonnuclear-related sanctions on Iran. Good for the President. \nGreat promise.\n  Iran, not to the shock of any of us, has violated some of the rules \nthat they are to abide by. They violated two U.N. resolutions \nrestricting ballistic missile tests last month.\n  The Treasury Department told Congress it would levy new sanctions on \nIran, primarily financial sanctions. That would support the President's \npromise to America. But at the last minute, the State Department got \ninvolved and said, whoa, no sanctions, not so fast--and no sanctions. \nMore shaky knees, Mr. Speaker.\n  Why does the administration waffle on calling Iran out for \nviolations? America's national security interests seem to take a \nbackseat to confronting Iran politically.\n  I support H.R. 3662. This is an important bill to ensure the \nPresident can't lift sanctions on those institutions and individuals \nwho are involved in terrorism. Remember, Mr. Speaker, Iran is still the \nnumber one world state sponsor of terrorism, and they are continuing \ntheir mischief throughout the world. We don't need to make it easier \nfor Iran's terrorist proxies to get even more money than the $150 \nbillion that they are getting in the deal.\n  With this bill, the President must prove to Congress that a person or \nentity has not given financial or materiel support to a terrorist \norganization before removing them from the sanctions list. Sounds \nlogical to me, Mr. Speaker.\n  Sanctions unrelated to the nuclear deal must remain in place. The \nnational security of the United States is at stake.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Price), my friend and colleague, and a member of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague.\n  I rise in strong opposition to this deeply misguided legislation.\n  Reports from international experts, nuclear watchdogs, and \nrepresentatives of our international coalition make clear that Iran is \non its way to fully dismantling its nuclear weapons program. Breakout \ntimes at this moment have already been tripled and quadrupled.\n  We need to understand, just because the JCPOA does not deal with all \nof Iran's abuses doesn't mean that we shouldn't solve the nuclear \nissue. We have already had that debate. Iran is still a state sponsor \nof terrorism, and the proposed expansion of its ballistic missile \nprogram is particularly troubling. These issues must be addressed.\n  But a nuclear-armed Iran would only make these abuses more dangerous, \nand it would be wildly foolish to suggest that we must forego our only \nreal opportunity to keep a nuclear weapon out of the regime's hands \njust because these ancillary issues remain. This bill would do exactly \nthat. It would scuttle the JCPOA, the result of years of international \nnegotiation and diplomacy in cooperation with our international \npartners. Absent the nuclear agreement, Iran could resume its nuclear \nprogram without international oversight, could go back to that 3-month \nbreakout time, and, by the way, continue the state sponsorship of \nterrorism, continue its human rights abuses, and continue its ballistic \nmissile expansion.\n  In short, this bill would snatch the feet from the jaws of victory as \nthe dismantling of Iran's nuclear program proceeds. It would be \nreckless in the extreme, and I strongly urge my colleagues to reject \nit.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Roskam), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, and \nthe cosponsor of this bill.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Thank you, Chairman Royce, for your leadership on this \nissue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Mr. Russell's initiative.\n  Last night, Mr. Speaker, there was a murmur throughout the room here \nwhen the President was giving the State of the Union message. I am \nparaphrasing, but when he made the assertion that essentially the \nUnited States is perceived well around the world and, in fact, better \nthan ever before, there was an audible sense of outcry. People were \nreally concerned about that assertion. Then the President went on to \nmake his point.\n  I think it is an admonition for us all to recognize, as Judge Poe \nsaid a couple of moments ago, there is a wobbliness in this \nadministration. In other words, how many provocations are the Iranians \nable to move forward and the administration is inert? How many \nprovocations can the Iranians push and the administration remains with \nno action?\n  I will tell you something. This is just off the news. Reuters is \nreporting that the Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, the head of the \nIranian Armed Forces, says that the naval incident that is being \nreconciled today, that this should be a lesson to whom? To \ntroublemakers in Congress--troublemakers in Congress--who oppose \nIranian aggression.\n  I think Mr. Russell's approach here is very commonsense. It says \nthose who have been complicit in sponsoring terror in the past ought \nnot be getting the benefit of the sanctions regime being raised; they \ndon't get the benefit of participating in that. This has to be \ncertified clearly, according to Mr. Russell's language, and it makes \nall the sense in the world.\n  The notion that somehow the administration is incapable of doing this \nI don't find persuasive. I think we need an administration that can \nmake these certifications, that does make these certifications, and if \nthey can't, then these terror financiers ought not be getting the \nbenefit of sanctions relief.\n  I urge passage of this bill.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Sherman), a very valued member of our committee and \nranking member on the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I voted for every sanctions bill on Iran \nthat has come to this floor--I helped draft many of them--and I am \nready to help draft, work on, and vote for sanctions bills on Iran \nbecause Iran continues its behavior in the area of missiles, and \nterrorism, and keeps seizing American hostages. I am ready to work on \nand support legislation to impose sanctions on Iran even if it is \nopposed by the administration. After all, almost every sanctions bill \npassed by this Congress was opposed either by the George W.\n\n[[Page H351]]\n\nBush administration or this administration.\n  We need a good process to draft good legislation that will do what \nPresident Obama told us we would do, and that is use sanctions to deal \nwith Iran's nonnuclear wrongdoing. But we need a good process that will \nget us good legislation. Unfortunately, this is a bill that is the \nproduct of a bad process, a flawed process, and the bill itself is \nflawed.\n  Let's look at the process.\n  Almost 100 cosponsors, but all of them from one party. No Democrat on \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee was invited to help draft the legislation \nor even invited to cosponsor it. Now this bill comes to the floor under \na closed rule, a rule that prevents us from offering amendments that \nwill deal with the flaws in the bill. There are at least two such \nflaws.\n  The first is that the bill deprives the President of the authority to \ndelist 489 entities. It locks those entities onto the SDN list, but it \nleaves out 269 other entities, creating two classes of entities: one \nwhich must stay on the list under almost any circumstance I can think \nof, the other which the President can remove. And there is no \nparticular reason for the 269 entities to be treated differently than \nthe 489. All of them have been involved in supporting Iran's \nproliferation and terrorist efforts.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Second, this bill creates too high a standard for the President to be \nable to remove an entity. He has to certify that it has never at any \ntime in history engaged in even the most trivial transaction with a \nwhole list of terrorist entities. We need a better drafting of that \nportion of the bill that deals with delisting entities, perhaps \nentities that have changed their behavior for well over a decade.\n  I look forward to a bipartisan process and to, hopefully, an open \nrule. We see that reflected in the fact that I have introduced \nlegislation, as just an example, that would impose additional sanctions \non Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and that is sponsored by the \nchairman of our committee and by the immediate past chairman of our \ncommittee.\n  I know our committee can work in a bipartisan way to create better \nlegislation than that which is before us, and we need additional \nsanctions on Iran drafted carefully because Iran has engaged in a \nmissile test in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, because \nIran's support for terrorism and Assad is responsible for the deaths of \ntens and tens of thousands--hundreds of thousands--of people in Syria \nand Yemen and because Iran used to hold four, but now holds five, \nAmerican hostages. Fortunately, it does not hold our U.S. Navy sailors, \nbut it holds five American civilians.\n  It is consistent with American policy and with this administration's \npolicy. They negotiated a nuclear deal. They kept it only on the \nnuclear issue not because America has conceded and has accepted and has \ngiven Iran carte blanche to engage in terrorism and hostage-taking, but \nbecause the President's policy was that we would deal with these issues \nseparately. It is time for us to deal with these issues separately \nthrough well-drafted, bipartisan legislation.\n  I am confident that, in the weeks to come, the administration will \nuse its existing power to sanction additional entities as a result of \nIran's illegal missile test, and I am confident that our committee will \ncraft bipartisan legislation that will do what we know we need to do to \ndeal with Iran's wrongdoing outside the nuclear area.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Trott), a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. TROTT. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3662.\n  When President Obama announced the nuclear agreement, he promised \nthat sanctions against Iran's support of terrorism, human rights \nabuses, and its ballistic missile program would continue to be \nenforced. All this bill does is require the President to keep his word.\n  If the bill passes, the President won't be able to give Hezbollah, \nHamas, and other terrorist groups billions of dollars. They will not be \nable to use billions of dollars to continue testing long-range missiles \nin violation of U.N. resolutions.\n  Who can disagree with this goal? The President probably disagrees.\n  Some suggest that, if the bill reaches his desk, he will veto it. All \nwe in Congress can do is to try and remind the President about his \npromises surrounding this deal.\n  This might also be a good time to remind the President about Iran's \nbehavior over the past 2 months. They convicted and imprisoned one of \nour journalists. They detained another American. They released five al \nQaeda prisoners. They have not released the four Americans they have \nbeen holding for years. They have tested their ballistic missiles. They \nfired a missile that came close to one of our naval vessels. And in the \nlast 24 hours, they held 10 American sailors.\n  It may well be true that neither Iran's behavior nor this bill will \ncause the President to realize he made a mistake in trusting Iran. I \nwill rely on historians for that.\n  It is unfortunate that this debate and this bill are necessary to \nremind the President that we expect him to keep his promise, his \npromise to withhold billions of dollars in sanctions relief that Iran \nwill otherwise use to spread terror and will use to develop ballistic \nmissiles that are aimed at our shores.\n  Ranking Member Engel may be correct in that our actions today are \nsymbolic, but we troublemakers in Congress have no choice. Whenever \npossible, we must try to remind the President that he cannot do a good \ndeal with a bad guy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3662.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I inquire as to how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Byrne). The gentleman from New York has \n14\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Shimkus), the chairman of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce's Subcommittee on the Environment and the Economy.\n  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. I appreciate the chairman's leadership. The gentleman \nknows how hard I work in supporting freedom and of my opposition to \ntotalitarian regimes.\n  Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, we passed H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions \nEnforcement Act. Unfortunately, I missed that vote--that happens here \nsometimes--and the gentleman knows how I fully support it.\n  Again today we address a problem with a rogue regime: Iran. I voted \nagainst the flawed Iranian deal. Iran still holds a marine veteran, a \ncontractor, an American pastor, and a Washington Post reporter. They \nhave tested two ballistic missiles. Sanctions should not be waived by \nthe U.S. That is why I support this bill.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Stewart), a member of the Committee on Appropriations and of the \nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. STEWART. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, in my work on the Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence, I have spent an awful lot of my time on these types of \nissues. I think there is much we can say about this bill, but at the \nend of the day, it comes down to two fundamental questions. They are \nreally quite simple.\n  The first is: Do you believe that the President will hold Iran \naccountable?\n  In an interview yesterday, I challenged the other person to show me \nthe President's foreign policy success because I believe in this \nadministration there has been 7 years of foreign policy failure, from \nChina, to Russia, to Afghanistan, to Syria. The list is long. We have \nto ask: Do we trust the President to implement policies that keep the \nworld more or less safe?\n  The second question is just as simple: Do we trust Iran?\n  I asked Secretary Kerry to show me a single example of Iran working \nwith us or with our allies in any positive fashion. They are, as has \nbeen said\n\n[[Page H352]]\n\nhere, the world's greatest sponsor of terrorism.\n  Recently they broke U.N. agreements not to test ballistic missiles. \nThey have held our soldiers. From Hezbollah, to Hamas, to Syria, they \nfoster terror and darkness everywhere they go. Do we trust Iran? Very \nsimply, the answer is no, which is why this bill is so important.\n  It helps us to hold Iran accountable. It helps us to hold their \nproxies accountable. It removes the incentives for them to continue to \nexpand their power and their policies and their goals, which are \ncounter to U.S. and Western goals throughout the world.\n  That is why I support this bill. I urge my colleagues to as well.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from New York for his \nkindness. I acknowledge the chairman of this committee for his \ncourtesies in debating this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I think it is important for all of us to \nacknowledge the safe return of our United States sailors and to \nrecognize that the United States was persistent and determined and, as \nwell, made no apology and that the Iran Government moved quickly to \nreturn them.\n  Let it be very clear that our sailors did nothing wrong. Obviously, \nwhen other sailors are in trouble, let me thank those who remain, as \nour heroes do. They leave no person, in essence, behind. So I am very \ngrateful, and I know their families are grateful that they are safe.\n  That, Mr. Speaker, is a distinctive point from where we are today. \nEveryone knows that Iran is a bad actor. Some of us on this floor voted \nfor the Iran non-nuclear agreement while others did not. But I believe \nthat we do ourselves harm when we continue to renegotiate or to re-\nvote, as we have continued to do 62 times with regard to ObamaCare.\n  This legislation would restrict the President's ability to lift \nsanctions on Iranian entities, thereby preventing the U.S. from \ncarrying out its commitment under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction, signed in Vienna, Austria, on July 14, 2015.\n  Specifically, the bill would require the President to certify that \nthe delisted entity has not knowingly facilitated a significant \nfinancial transaction or has provided significant financial services to \nthe IRGC or to terrorist affiliates.\n  This, of course, would be a very difficult and hindering aspect of \nthe President's responsibilities in his role as the Commander in Chief. \nIt would specifically prevent the delisting of 400 banks, companies, \nand individuals that are engaged in Iran's nuclear program, \nparticularly the Central Bank.\n  Section 2 would require the President to certify to Congress that any \nentity from the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions list has not \never knowingly facilitated a significant financial transaction.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this legislation impedes, prohibits, \nand stops the President and the next President, as our representative \nof the face of America internationally and who has the responsibility, \nfrom enforcing this agreement. It was done primarily to stop Iran's \nnuclear efforts.\n  I, too, as one who has supported this legislation, believes that \nsanctions should be increased and that we should respond to Iran's \nballistic missile episode, but there are ways to do that by \nstrengthening the sanctions, not by tying the hands of the Commander in \nChief--the President of the United States--and not by renegotiating \nthis on the floor of the House to the extent that we have, in essence, \ngiving the President no latitude with which to negotiate.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation because it is not \nlegislation that enhances our place. It takes away from the President's \nauthority, and it makes it very difficult to interact with Iran. Let me \nbe very clear: Iran has its troubles, and it is a bad actor, but I will \ntell you there are better ways to handle this situation.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3662, the Iran \nTerror Finance Transparency Act.\n  We are here again wasting valuable time on measures we know have no \nreal chance of survival beyond these debates.\n  I strongly oppose this futile measure to block all efforts to enforce \nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n  H.R. 3662, would prevent the U.S. from implementing the JCPOA by \ntying the Administration's ability to fulfill U.S. commitments under \nthis long negotiated deal to unrelated, non-nuclear issues.\n  The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror \nFinance Transparency Act, which would prevent the United States from \nimplementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) by tying \nthe Administration's ability to fulfill U.S. commitments under the deal \nto unrelated, non-nuclear issues.\n  This bill includes provisions that connect the United States' JCPOA \ncommitment to provide sanctions relief by delisting certain Iran-\nrelated individuals and entities, including banks, to non-nuclear \nissues outside of the scope of the JCPOA.\n  Certain provisions would effectively preclude delisting of \nindividuals or entities on Implementation Day of the JCPOA--the day on \nwhich the International Atomic Energy Agency verifies that Iran has \ncompleted key nuclear-related steps that significantly dismantle and \nconstrain its nuclear program--based on activity that may have taken \nplace and ended long before Implementation Day and involving persons or \nactivity that will no longer be sanctioned post-Implementation Day.\n  By preventing the United States from fulfilling its JCPOA \ncommitments, H.R. 3662 could result in the collapse of a comprehensive \ndiplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran \nfrom acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  Such a collapse would remove the unprecedented constraints on Iran's \nnuclear program that we achieved in the JCPOA, lead to the unraveling \nof the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a \ndevastating blow to America's credibility as a leader of international \ndiplomacy.\n  This would have ripple effects, jeopardizing the hard work of \nsustaining a unified coalition to combat Iran's destabilizing \nactivities in the region, calling into question the effectiveness of \nour sanctions regime and our ability to lead the world on nuclear non-\nproliferation.\n  The Administration has consistently made clear that the purpose of \nthe nuclear negotiations, and ultimately the JCPOA--was to address one \nissue only: the international community's concerns over Iran's nuclear \nprogram and to verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  The JCPOA is the critical mechanism through which the United States \nwas able to garner international support for our sanctions and achieve \na diplomatic resolution.\n  As we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through \nimplementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed and \nshares the deep concerns of the Congress and the American people about \nIran's support for terrorism.\n  Powerful sanctions targeting Iran's support for terrorism, its \nballistic missile activities, its human rights abuses, and its \ndestabilizing activities in the region remain in effect.\n  Anyone worldwide who transacts with or supports individuals or \nentities sanctioned in connection with Iran's support for terrorism or \ndevelopment of WMD and their means of delivery, including missiles--or \nwho does the same with any Iranian individual or entity who remains on \nTreasury's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, \nputs themselves at risk of being sanctioned.\n\n  Up until this point, Iran has been meeting all commitments under the \nJCPOA--any impediments to the United States ability to uphold its \ncommitments jeopardizes the security of our nation.\n  The President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation \nthat prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA.\n  According to the Statement on Administrative Policy, if presented \nwith H.R. 3662, the President will VETO this bill.\n  Let's just take a quick look back at some of the President's foreign \npolicy achievements:\n  The capture and neutralization of Osama Bin Laden which brought an \nend to a nearly decade long manhunt.\n  The withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq which helped to bring an end \nto a costly war, helping our country save billions of dollars in U.S. \ntaxpayer funds.\n  The current Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which has been \ninstrumental in deterring and stemming Iran's nuclear ambitions and \nenabling security in the global society.\n  The repealing of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, an aspersion on the personal \nprivate matters of those who have dedicated their lives to protecting \nour nation.\n  Signing into law the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), an \nimportant treaty\n\n[[Page H353]]\n\nthat showcases how the U.S leads by example by signing a treaty that \nrequires both the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear \nwarhead arsenals to 1,550 each, a 30 percent reduction from the 2002 \nTreaty of Moscow and a 74 percent reduction from the 1991 START treaty.\n  Neutralization of al Qaeda propagandist and foreign fighter recruiter \nAnwar Al Awlaki, one of the main leaders in the Al Qaeda in the Arabian \nPeninsula (AQAP).\n  Indeed, under President Obama's leadership, our country's military \naid to Israel has increased remarkably with the eye towards deepening \nand expanding U.S./Israeli relations--an important aspect of our \nnation's foreign policy and geopolitical efforts to promote peace in \nthe region.\n  Not to mention historical deals on the environment vis a vis Cop 21, \norganizing over 200 nations on strategies to protect the environment \nand proposed trade deals that will organize and facilitate the United \nStates stamp on the Asian economy.\n  This president's foreign policy achievements in promoting the \nsecurity of our nation are irrefutable.\n  Any serious legislation addressing Iran should be done as it has been \ndone up until now, in a bipartisan way.\n  H.R. 3662 is an entirely partisan bill that excluded the \nparticipation of all Democratic Members in drafting this measure or \nsupporting it.\n  This bill is fundamentally flawed and I urge all Members to vote \nagainst it.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Lance), who is the cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. LANCE. I thank Chairman Royce and Mr. Russell for their \ntremendous leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3662, the Iran \nTerror Finance Transparency Act.\n  The detention and interrogation of 10 American sailors near the \nStrait of Hormuz is the latest in a significant list of Iranian acts of \naggression against American interests since President Obama signed the \nIran nuclear agreement in October. Thank God our sailors have been \nreleased. They never should have been detained.\n  In recent weeks, we have witnessed two reported long-range ballistic \nmissile launches, the revelation by Iran of a new underground missile \ndepot, the firing of rockets near U.S. Navy ships in the Strait of \nHormuz, and the Tehran government continuing to hold American hostages. \nThese provocations and the lack of response from the White House have \nmerely emboldened Iran to increase its aggression. Iran believes it can \nact against American interests with impunity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the underlying legislation and to \nstop the lifting of sanctions on Iran that would provide billions of \ndollars in economic relief.\n  Let's send a clear message that Iran's aggression against the United \nStates and its allies will not go unchallenged by Congress. History \nwill judge our actions on this issue as history will judge the \nPresident and the administration on their actions on this issue. Let \nhistory be the judge. Let's support H.R. 3662.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nRussell), author of this legislation.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on \nthis bill.\n  There have been a lot of accusations about what is in this bill and \nthe content. The fact of the matter is, what is being quoted is simply \nnot in the bill.\n  It says that it would deprive the President of the authority to make \ndecisions. That is simply not the case. Page 2, line 20; page 5, line \n17; page 7, line 7: ``The President may lift''--spelled out--if he \nmeets the certification criteria. What is that criteria? That they are \nno longer conducting activity and they have justification for that \nrelief.\n  Where this language ``never at any time'' is being quoted, Mr. \nSpeaker, by my esteemed and caring colleagues on this issue--I know how \nthey feel about this issue personally, and I commend them for it \nbecause we are on common ground here--but they are quoting something \nthat is simply not in the bill. When they say ``never at any time,'' \nthat is simply not there.\n  The President may lift the sanctions. What we are calling for is a \ncertification as to why. If he comes in and makes the case--look, this \nbank has corrected its behavior, general Soleimani has had some \nepiphany and he is no longer a terrorist--then, fine, we can have that \ncertification, and the President does that.\n  Talking about several of them and that there was no bipartisan \neffort, every single speaker that has said that there was not a \nbipartisan effort I have personally been in contact with--personally--\ntalking on this particular issue. So that is simply not the case. I am \nkind of hurt by that because I reached out to all of them, and I didn't \ndeny any of them a chance for amendment, for dialogue, or discussion. I \ndo think that we have much common ground to go on here.\n  I think it is also important that it says that it doesn't advance \ngoals. It is upholding the law. The law, which is the Comprehensive \nIran Sanctions and Divestment Act of 2010, says that if there are \npeople on terror and human rights list, that they shouldn't come off \nwithout certification. We agree. That is why we are saying we have to \nhave the similar certification for those that overlap on the joint \nagreement. That is why we have identified them.\n  The hundreds of others that were mentioned by the opponents of this \nmeasure, Mr. Speaker, they weren't on those lists. That is why they are \nnot there. They weren't targeted for this. Only those that are on the \nterror and human rights or nuclear proliferation with missiles list, if \nthey are there, then that is why they have been targeted.\n  This isn't apparently about the merit of the measure or how we feel \nabout the national security of the United States. It has now become an \nissue about process. Well, I guess that experience doesn't matter. It \nis about process. We need to do what is right for the country, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Let me first clear up, I think, what is a misperception. There are \nroughly 700 Iranian entities on our sanctions list. Of those, only 200 \nare removed from sanctions and those are those who were involved in the \nnuclear program. It is not true that the JCPOA removed sanctions on \nentities that are engaged in terrorism or proliferation or human rights \nviolations. This is black and white in the JCPOA.\n  Entity by entity, we know exactly who will be removed. None of them \nare involved in terrorism or other malign behavior. We know who will be \nremoved. There is a list in the annex. I have it right here, every \ncompany that will be removed, and none of them are removed for \nterrorism or other malign behavior. So I want to make that very, very \nclear.\n  Let me say that I think everyone on both sides has good intentions, \nand I think that we don't disagree about Iran. The question here is not \nwhether Iran is a bad player or a good player. I don't trust the \nIranians. I voted against the deal, and I don't believe anything the \ngovernment says. That is not the question here.\n  The question is, how do you combat it in a unified way? We are not \ninterested in embarrassing the President, certainly not on this side of \nthe aisle. We are not interested in playing gotcha with the President \neither. We want to have a bill that has input from both sides so we can \naccomplish what both of us say we want to accomplish, and that is to \nhold Iran's feet to the fire.\n  I want to make sure that the JCPOA--again, which I did not support, \nbut again it is the law--that Iran is complying with everything it is \nsupposed to be doing. And that is where our efforts should be, to make \nsure that they do that, and then to also make sure that our allies like \nIsrael have the kind of help that they need to maintain their \nqualitative military edge and to have another memorandum of \nunderstanding with the United States that supports Israel. This is what \nwe should be concentrating on, not embarrassing the President or \nplaying gotcha. That doesn't do anything.\n  Mr. Russell, the gentleman from Oklahoma, did come up to me and ask \nme if I would cosponsor the bill, but that was after it was already \ndrafted, having no input into the bill. So that is not really a way of \nbeing collaborative, if you really want to be collaborative.\n\n[[Page H354]]\n\n  I appreciate what the gentleman from Oklahoma says. I don't doubt his \nsincerity, and he obviously worked very hard on this bill, but many of \nus have difficulties with it.\n  We don't have difficulties with the end goal, with what we want to \naccomplish. We have difficulties by the way this is done. This seems, \nagain, more to us like embarrassing the President, calling him names, \nthan really putting our heads together in a collaborative way and \nreally doing something that will hold Iran's feet to the fire.\n  So I believe in the old adage that politics should stop at the \nwater's edge when we are talking about foreign affairs. That is why I \nlove the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  Our Nation's security and our interests abroad are too important to \nlet partisan politics get in the way. Ninety-nine times out of 100, the \nForeign Affairs Committee operates in that spirit, and this bill is an \nexception to that. I think the lack of input from both sides of the \naisle, the lack of time the Foreign Affairs Committee didn't spend \nworking on it, is reflected in the final product. I am not pointing a \nfinger at anybody. Again, I think Mr. Russell is sincere about this. I \nthink we want the same thing.\n  This bill is deeply flawed. It would force the President to meet an \nimpossible standard on an issue where Congress had already spoken. That \nis no way to advance our interests abroad. That is no way to hold Iran \naccountable.\n  So let's vote down this bill, go back to the drawing board, and come \nback with bipartisan legislation that would actually help us achieve \nour aims. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Again, the question here is not whether Iran can be trusted. They \ncannot. Iran is a bad player. Three people on this side of the aisle \nwho spoke against this bill voted against the JCPOA. So it is not a \nmatter of just trying to rubberstamp what the administration wants or \nanything like that. No, we don't think that this bill goes in the right \ndirection. We don't want to embarrass the President. We want to work \nwith the President to make sure that Iran's feet are held to the fire.\n\n  Again, we had the vote on the Iran deal. I voted no, my friends on \nthat side of the aisle voted no, but we lost. So let's not repeat what \nwe have done with the Affordable Care Act, 62 times again and again and \nagain playing gotcha with the President.\n  Let's do something that really works. Let's put our heads together to \nmake it work. We can take parts of this bill and put it together into a \nbipartisan bill. I am not opposed to that. But we have got to do it \ntogether. Politics need to stop at the water's edge.\n  So let's now work together to ensure that Iran is complying with the \nJCPOA. That would be a positive step forward. Let's hold their feet to \nthe fire. Let's make sure they do what they are supposed to do, because \nI don't trust them anymore than anybody on that side of the aisle.\n  So I urge a ``no'' vote. Let's go back to the drawing board. Let's do \nwhat the Foreign Affairs Committee is known for doing for the past 3 \nyears under the leadership of Chairman Royce and myself. We believe \nthat we are the most bipartisan committee in the Congress. We believe \nthat is the way foreign policy should be created, and I know we can do \nbetter. Again, I don't impugn anyone's motives. Let's all put our heads \ntogether and let's come up with a bill that we can pass and be proud \nof.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate all the Members who have engaged in this debate. As \nRanking Member Engel noted, this is not usually the place we find \nourselves. What we have seen from Iran over the last few months is that \nthe Iranian threat isn't going away. So we will have to keep working \ntogether to address the Iranian threat, and I look forward to that \ncontinuing collaboration.\n  As the Iran nuclear agreement gets set for implementation, some 500 \nspecific individuals and companies and several banks are set to get \nrelief for their ties to the nuclear program. This bill simply asks the \nPresident to ensure that those receiving this reprieve are not involved \nin Iran's support for terrorism, nor are they involved in the missile \ndevelopment program that Iran continues to push for intercontinental \nballistic missiles.\n  Soon, maybe in a matter of days, Iran will get access to over $100 \nbillion in frozen oil assets, and this is not going to go to the \nIranians on the street. This is not going to go to small business in \nIran, to those that despise their government. It is going to go to the \nregime. It is going to go to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n  The reason it would work that way is because that is the entity that \nnationalized these businesses years ago, after 1979. They are the ones \nthat right now control approximately a quarter of the entire economy, \nincluding the major businesses, such as, for example, energy or \nconstruction.\n  If we look at what the U.S. Department of Treasury says about this, \nthey labeled the IRGC as the ``most powerful economic actor'' in the \ncountry. So this entity has deep reach into those critical sectors of \nthe economic infrastructure, as the Treasury Department tells us. The \nIRGC's largest business is its construction arm, which controls 800 \naffiliated companies and billions of dollars in assets.\n  These activities, in turn--and here is the problem, here is the nexus \nof the problem--fund Iran's ballistic missile program. What we had \nhoped for was, of course, to temper the appetite of the regime to move \nforward with that ICBM program. Instead what we see is a huge step-up \nseveral weeks ago as the President of Iran announced this huge step-up.\n  Now we see these ICBMs that are being launched and tested. We also \nsee the military activities, the regional aggression, the call for the \noverthrow of the governments in Yemen, which they actually carried out \nin Bahrain, and in Saudi Arabia. This is a huge problem because the \nIRGC are doing this.\n  Now, during our hearings, Members expressed concerns that there would \nbe no pushback from the administration when it comes to Iran's \naggressive behavior. This has, unfortunately, proven correct.\n  The response to two ballistic missile tests? The administration \nproposed a few modest sanctions. We were all notified about that. What \nhappened? As soon as Iran pushed back, what happened? The \nadministration pulled them back.\n  The Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, ordered his Defense Ministry \nto accelerate its missile program just weeks after the Obama \nadministration joined with his diplomatic partners to sweep Iran's past \nillicit nuclear weapons activities under the rug. Again, countries \npursue ICBMs for one reason: to deliver a nuclear warhead.\n  I ask for an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, I will vote against H.R. 3662--\nthe most recent attempt to undermine the Iran nuclear agreement. This \nlegislation would explicitly prevent the United States from \nimplementing its obligations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction (JCPOA).\n  We are all concerned about the prospects of a nuclear-armed Iran, \ngiven its history and nebulous relationship with the United States. \nThis is why I have consistently supported a diplomatic solution with \nother world powers, as sanctions do not work when applied by the U.S. \nalone. The JCPOA is our best path forward to enforce a non-nuclear \nfuture for Iran, particularly as we have countries, including China and \nRussia, join with us.\n  We're going to need to be diligent. Iran does have a number of \ninternal conflicts and bad actors. The clerics and some members of the \nIranian Revolutionary Guard are destructive components within a country \nwhose people have long suffered from the effects of sanctions. There is \nno indication that destroying this agreement would put us in a better \nposition to prevent Iran from revitalizing its nuclear program. If the \nagreement falls apart, we can always sanction later. In the meantime, \nwe ought to continue to give diplomacy a chance.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nrecognize the female pilots who served during World War II, known as \nthe Women Airforce Service Pilots, or the WASPs.\n  These brave and hardworking female pilots signed up, of their own \nvolition, were trained in over 12,000 aircraft, and stepped up to the \nplate to fill the shortfall of male pilots.\n  Despite the fact that the WASPs were merely considered civilians, \nthey served their country, delivering planes overseas in dangerous \nconditions and helping to train the male pilots for combat.\n  Thirty-eight of these WASPs died while serving their country, and \ntheir patriotic sense of duty is truly inspirational.\n  Unfortunately, these courageous women have been unjustly denied the \nhonor of burial at the Arlington National Cemetery. Why? Because they \nwere civilians.\n  As a cosponsor of H.R. 4336, I strongly urge the Secretary of the \nArmy to change its policy and allow these female pilots to be honored \nat Arlington National Cemetery.

Following graduation, she worked for the U.S. Space \nAlliance, a NASA contractor, before joining NASA in 2007.\n  As a flight director, Mary will lead teams of flight controllers, \nresearch and engineering experts, along with support personnel, in \nensuring the crew of the International Space Station have the tools \nthat they need to conduct their important scientific research.\n  Mr. Speaker, Mary is hoping to be certified as a flight director in a \nfew months, and will then be one of only 27 active flight directors for \nNASA.\n  Again, I congratulate Mary, her husband, Andrew, and their entire \nfamily on this commendable accomplishment.

Iran just took 10 of our sailors hostage for \n24 hours. Iran props up a dictator in Syria who has killed millions of \nhis own citizens. Iran is the world's number one sponsor of terrorism. \nIran is currently developing ICBMs and eventually will have nuclear \nweapons.\n  Russia invaded Ukraine, a country hungry for freedom. The Ukrainians \nlooked to the United States for leadership, and the United States \nwatched and basically did nothing. The Russians are still in Ukraine.\n  North Korea has nuclear weapons and ICBMs that can now reach the \nUnited States. ISIS and other terrorist groups control more territory \nand have more money than ever before in history. Last year was one of \nthe deadliest years of terrorist violence on record.\n  The fact is the world is not safer today. It is not a more stable \nplace than it was 8 years ago. The world is full of dangerous, rogue \nnations seeking to do harm.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Combined Insurance \nCompany of America in Glenview, Illinois, for receiving an estimable \naward. GI Jobs magazine announced its Top 100 Military Friendly \nEmployers for 2016, and for the second consecutive year, Combined \nInsurance was number one.\n  This is a prestigious honor, as Combined was ranked above 5,000 other \norganizations in the United States that were considered, and it marks \nthe fifth straight year that they made the Top 100 organizations.\n  Since 2010, Combined Insurance has hired over 2,500 veterans or those \nwith a military background. Their president, Brad Bennett, has \ncommitted to hiring an additional 2,800 more by the end of 2017.\n  Brad and his leadership team know that servicemembers at any rank \noffer employers skills such as discipline, independent work ethic, and \ncommitment. They actively recruit from all levels of the military, \noffering opportunities for former officers and those from the enlisted \nranks as well.\n  In addition to providing meaningful employment to our veterans, \nCombined also gives back to several veteran charities in both time and \nresources.\n  I hope more organizations will emulate Combined Insurance in their \nunwavering efforts to support our Nation's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/13/house-section/article/H357-6", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H357-H358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RIGHT TO LIFE\n\n  (Mr. ROKITA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROKITA.

Among these, of course, are life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness.\n\n[[Page H358]]\n\n  These rights extend to all persons, even those who are physically \nwith us, but yet unborn. Indeed, life inside a mother versus outside of \nher is ultimately a matter of geography.\n  The rights of the unborn must be protected, and I believe we can \nnever speak too strongly for those who cannot speak for themselves. \nProtecting life must be our top priority.\n  This debate is more than a simple disagreement about making choices. \nIt is a debate about fundamental, God-given rights, the first of which, \nof course, is the right to life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that this House, the people's House, has no \nhigher duty than to protect human life, no matter how big or how small \nit is or where it may be located.\n  As we approach the 43rd anniversary of Roe v.

Mr. Speaker, it is with sadness in my heart that I \nrise to acknowledge the death of a great leader in our community, Dr. \nJ.S. Stone, a graduate of Talladega College and a graduate of Meharry \nMedical School, who leaves his beloved wife, Gertrude, a dear friend, \nand three children.\n  This was a great leader and a great medical professional, committed \nto service in our community, serving on many, many boards and sharing \nhis great brilliance with all of us.\n  He had a residency at Texas MD Anderson and hospitals in Philadelphia \nand became one of the first African Americans to participate in the \nHarris County Medical Society and to practice in hospitals that, for \nthe first time, saw an African American doctor, such as St. Joseph, a \ncommunity hospital that has remained historic in our community.\n  Again, I want to pay tribute to him for his service in the United \nStates military as captain.\n  This is the kind of African American leader and a kind of American \nleader that stood tall, being born in 1930 in the face of segregation, \nbut he never let the ills of the world overcome him. He became a \nservant of the people--not elected--but he became a servant in medicine \nand serving them.\n  I honor him today and express my deepest sympathy to his family, his \nwife, his children, and to the entire community in Houston, for we have \nlost a fallen hero. He is a hero.\n  I say well done, good and faithful servant. May you rest in peace, \nDr. J.S.

Mr. Speaker, every year carbon monoxide kills over 400 \npeople and sends an additional 20,000 people to the emergency room. \nCarbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas, and poisoning from it \nmost often occurs in households with a malfunctioning heat source.\n  Because of its nature, it can be extremely difficult to detect a \ncarbon monoxide leak. Carbon monoxide detectors, however, are extremely \neffective in alerting families to a leak and have already saved lives.\n  I am introducing bipartisan legislation with Congresswoman Ann Kuster \nto allow States to apply for grants to purchase and install carbon \nmonoxide detectors in schools, in low-income homes, and, also, senior \nresidences at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  The grants will also help and train local and State fire officials on \nthe dangers of carbon monoxide and the best methods of prevention \nbecause, Mr. Speaker, it is important to educate the public on the \nrisks of carbon monoxide poisoning and what people should do to protect \nthemselves.

That is a very powerful tool of persuasion, not always \nguaranteed.\n  The Founding Fathers entrusted the power of the purse to the Congress \nas a way to give a check and balance to an out-of-control executive.\n  I don't need a bill.

Mr. Speaker, on January 13, 1903, 102 Korean \nimmigrants first arrived in the United States. Today we celebrate \nKorean American Day and the contributions of our Korean American \ncommunity. Earlier this week, we had a celebration right here on \nCapitol Hill, with many of my colleagues joining our local and national \ncommunity.\n  When I previously served as the State delegate and now, as a Member \nof Congress, I have been privileged to work with our Korean American \ncommunity in northern Virginia and throughout the 10th District through \norganizations such as the Korean American Association of the Washington \nMetropolitan Area; the Korean Medical Society; the Korean Women's \nChamber of Commerce, which has worked with us tirelessly on battling \nthe human trafficking issue. These are a few of the many organizations \nthat serve in our area.\n  I have also been privileged to visit with the Korean faith community \nand attended many cultural festivals, such as the annual KORUS \nFestival, which I\n\n[[Page H359]]\n\nwas honored to chair just last year, and Korean Independence Day, which \nwe celebrate annually in August with our local community--and I know we \ncelebrate it throughout our country--so that we can all unite in our \npassion for freedom and for the ``One Korea'' cause, something we are \nall united on.\n  Near my home in the 10th District is Meadowlark Botanical Gardens, \nwhich is home to the Korean Bell Garden, a gift to the community and to \nour park system from the Korean American Cultural Committee, which \nserves our whole community as a beautiful symbol of goodwill towards \nall.\n  I am proud to be a member of the Korea Caucus, and I appreciate that \ngoodwill and the goodwill that is found throughout our Korean American \ncommunity.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, having been the location for the State of \nthe Union Address last night, we agree that we care deeply about this \ncountry, but there were some things that were said here from this \nlectern right here, where national and international leaders speak when \nthey are invited to speak here in the House, that I felt needed some \ndeliberation.\n  It is noteworthy. My late mother, English teacher that she was--if I \nhad given this speech, the first thing she would have harassed me about \nwas that you start the first five paragraphs--and this is the content: \nI have come, I know, I also, I hope, I will keep, I don't, I want, I \nwant.\n  My mother would have made big red circles around there and said: \nEliminate the first person. It tells people that you care more about \nyourself. Get rid of that. Quit having so much first person.\n  Of course, she would have done the same thing toward the end of the \nspeech when we have: I hold, I know, I intend, I can't, I am asking, I \nsee, I will be, I can, I travel, I see, I see, I know, I see, I see, I \nsee, I see, I see, I see, I know, I believe, I stand.\n  No doubt my late mother would have taken a red pen and said: Son, if \nyou want to give a great speech, quit talking about the first person \n``I'' all the time. You have got to eliminate it if you want to give a \ngreat speech.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, since we care deeply about each other in this \ncountry, those who are in elected positions, I thought maybe, since the \ndoor is not always open to me at the White House--I know that going \nback to the ObamaCare days when the President said: If you have got \nbetter ideas, my door is always open.\n  I know my office kept trying to get me into that open door. I am sure \nthe President was telling the truth. I am sure his door was open. But \nthere were so many Secret Service agents and staff members between me \nand that open door, I was not allowed to come present my better ideas \non health care.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  I still have them. Hopefully, we will get a chance to work those in. \nSome of the things, Paul Ryan and I have been on the same page for \nyears; some of them are a little different. Tom Price has had some \ngreat proposals, Mike Burgess. We have a lot of doctors here that have \nhad some great ideas on how to fix it. From that experience, I know \nthat the door is not always open, so this is the format in which I have \nto point these things out.\n  When the President said, ``second, how do we make technology work for \nus and not against us,'' what immediately comes to mind is what many \nRepublicans have been concerned about and some of my Democrat friends \nhave been very concerned about. Don't seem quite as concerned under a \nDemocratic President as they were under President Bush, but, \nnonetheless, still concerned that the President asked, perhaps \nrhetorically, how do we make technology work for us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would humbly submit that the President has got \ntechnology working for the administration pretty well. You have got NSA \nthat has been amazing in their ability to use algorithms and sort \nthrough emails. You have got the Federal Government, as we found after \nthe Snowden revelations, after we had been told by both Bush and Obama \nadministration officials that we are not checking people's phone calls, \nwe are not getting that information.\n  It turned out that, in the FISA court, both administrations had been \nseeking and getting blanket orders not consistent with the \nConstitution, which requires specificity. You have to specifically name \nwhat it is being searched for and specifically the reason you have for \nsearching it. There is no specificity. They just said: We want every \nlist of everybody's phone call in your phone company. The judge said: \nOh, sure, that is specific enough--every single phone call without any \nreason, just need the information. So you have got emails, you have got \nphone calls.\n  Then, of course, under ObamaCare, the Federal Government is going to \nget to have everybody's medical records. It sounds like crony \ncapitalism involved in having a deal with a private entity to gather \neverybody's medical records. So you will have the Federal Government \nand a private company gathering everybody's medical records.\n  Then we have the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that, under the \nguise of trying to protect people from unscrupulous banks, you have the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau say: We want every debit and \ncredit card record of everybody. That way we can watch for unscrupulous \nbanking practices and banks.\n  Well, that is not the way the Constitution requires things be done. \nAs a judge, if you wanted somebody's bank records, you had to come to a \njudge like me in a felony case and you had to have probable cause \nestablished under oath that there is probable cause to believe a crime \nwas committed, this person committed it, and only then would I sign an \norder allowing them to get someone's bank records. Not under the CFPB. \nUnder the guise of helping people, they are gathering people's bank \nrecords, whether they want them to have them or not. That needs to \nstop.\n  The President said: ``We have done all this while cutting our \ndeficits by almost three-quarters.'' The trouble is I remember back in \n2006 when Democrats were rightfully and righteously pointing out that \nwith a Republican President, President George W. Bush, and Republicans \nin control of the House and Senate, they felt it was outrageous that we \nwere going to have a $160 billion deficit, that we would bring in $160 \nbillion less than we would spend.\n  They were right. We should have had a balanced budget then. We were \ntrying to get there. We were pushing for cuts trying to get there. But \nthey convinced the American public Republicans can't be trusted; they \nhave got you a $160 billion deficit. You put us in charge, and we will \ncut that to get a balanced budget.\n  Then we got a Democratic President, a Democratic House, and a \nDemocratic Senate, and what happened? The budget that they gave us \ncreated about a $1.6 trillion deficit. So much for the $160 billion \nthat we were lambasted for allowing. They 10-times that right up to \n$1.6 trillion or so.\n  People need to understand, when the President says we have cut the \ndeficit by almost three-quarters, when you still haven't gotten back to \nthat $160 billion deficit that we were lambasted for back in 2006, you \nstill have not done an adequate job. We wish that the President and \nDemocrats in the Senate would work better with us so that we can get \nback more to the kind of budget the Democrats promised Americans back \nin the fall of 2006.\n  Then the President said: ``More and more wealth and income is \nconcentrated at the very top.'' I want to applaud the President, Mr. \nSpeaker, for stating the truth. Under his watch, more and more wealth \nand income has been concentrated at the top. The President has actually \nadmitted on the record a couple years or so ago that it is true that \nfor the first time in American history--it has never happened before \nunder any other President--the first time in American history, under \nPresident Obama's watch, 95 percent of all income in America has been \nreported went to the top 1 percent of income earners in America. \nNinety-five percent of the country's income went to the top 1 percent. \nIt never happened before, not under a Republican, not under a Democrat, \nnot under anybody. That has never happened before.\n\n[[Page H360]]\n\n  In fact, we feel the middle class shrinking, and it is not in a good \nway where they are moving up to the rich. They are moving down to the \npoor, and the poor are getting poorer. It is not because a free market \nsystem doesn't work. It is because the government, under this \nPresident, blew past the 73- or 74,000-page-per-year record that \nPresident Bush finally reached and now is pushing toward 80,000 new \npages of regulations every year that business has to live under.\n  The only chance you have is to be a big investment bank that got us \ninto trouble, that nearly brought down the country, because the \nregulations of this administration and the push that this \nadministration has had against community banks that did not get us in \ntrouble is about to bring them under. We are losing them constantly, \nand the big banks are getting bigger and more powerful instead of \ngetting lower to a point where they would not bring down the country as \nthey nearly did previously.\n  The President says: ``The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind \nwas an important start.'' My understanding was he was promising that he \nwould get rid of that. I thought when he got elected, okay, look for \nthe silver lining. He is going to get rid of No Child Left Behind. \nHallelujah, that is a good thing. Let's get the control back to the \nStates and the people as the 10th Amendment requires, because education \nis not an enumerated power. It is reserved to the States and people.\n  Before the Federal Government got involved, I know in Texas--I have \nseen the stats--it was nearly 75 percent of all education employees \nwere teachers in Texas. Makes sense. Then that year President Carter \nstarted the Department of Education. Now everybody has got to have a \nmassive number of bureaucrats at the State level and at the local \nlevel.\n\n  You have got to have people at the local school district providing \nall the data that is being demanded at the State capitol because it is \nbeing demanded here in Washington. So we are now about 50 percent of \nour employees in Texas--about--are teachers. Why 70 to 75 percent down \nto 50? Because we have a Federal Department of Education. The emphasis \nis on being bureaucrats, not on education, and we need to get back to \nthat. I sure wish that had been a promise the President had kept.\n  There are numerous promises and statements made. I am just \nhighlighting some here, Mr. Speaker. But when the President says, \n``Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far,'' I am not sure \nwhere that number is coming from. It may come from the same source that \nthe President used to say: ``Surveys show our standing around the world \nis higher than when I was elected to this office.''\n  In both cases, I haven't been able to find any basis whatsoever for \neither of those statements and would welcome hard, factual evidence, \nnot something they create and make up--it is easy to make things up--\nbut an actual survey. Because I have seen surveys that show that, even \nthough this President was raised as a child in a Muslim country back in \nIndonesia--he thought that that would get him more respect in Muslim \ncountries--the surveys I have seen show he has less respect in Muslim \ncountries than President Bush did, and that was bad enough. But at \nleast the countries had more respect for President George W. Bush. They \nknew he was serious and meant business.\n  Unfortunately, Muslim countries actually believe that they could \ntake--say, just hypothetically, Mr. Speaker--they could take 10 of the \nU.S. Navy sailors, just take them into custody, and this administration \nwould do nothing, nothing to retaliate or respond. As President Reagan \nmade clear and history showed, you get peace through strength. If you \ndon't get peace through strength, then the only way you get peace is \ntotal subjugation to a tyrant.\n  The President said: ``America is about giving everybody willing to \nwork a chance, a hand up.'' Yet this is the very President that, with \nexecutive orders, changed--this administration at least--and violated \nthe existing welfare reform laws because it was a requirement. If you \ncould work, you had to work.\n  I was thrilled to see a graph that a professor at Harvard had at a \nseminar up there at Harvard back in 2005. He showed that for 30 years \nof the welfare system, '65 or '66 to '95 or '96, that single moms' \nincome, when adjusted for inflation, was just flat-lined. Single moms' \nincome was flat-lined. No increase over 30 years and spending trillions \nof dollars, they were no better off.\n  Yet, after the welfare reform, after the Republican revolution under \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich, welfare reform required working, if people \ncould. They had a graph that showed that, for the first time since we \nstarted having welfare, from '96 through 2005 or through 2004, single \nmoms' income had a sharp increase over that period and was still headed \nup.\n  I am not sure if it was still headed up when this President took that \nrequirement away, which no doubt put them back on a flat line again, \nmaking them worse off. I am sure it is not intentional that he would \nmake single moms worse off; but when you have the data to show what \nhappens, it is very unfortunate he put single moms back on a path to \nlow income that never increases after adjusted for inflation.\n  The President said: ``I think there are outdated regulations that \nneed to be changed and there is red tape that needs to be cut. But, \nafter years now of record corporate profits''--that is a problem.\n  Outdated regulations--I am asking rhetorically, Mr. Speaker. Is that \nthe reason that he has set records with nearly 80,000 pages of new \nregulations where you have got the founders of some of the biggest \nbusinesses in the country saying: With all these regulations pouring \nout of Washington every year, I could never found the company that I \nhave today. I could never get started today because of these massive, \nbloated regulations?\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Here again, he takes a shot at big banks or Big Oil.\n  It is interesting, Mr. Speaker, if you look back at the President's \nproposal on his American Jobs Act--my American Jobs Act that I filed \nbefore his was a lot better, it would have stimulated the economy \nbetter--he said he was going to punish Big Oil.\n  But if you look at the deductions he was eliminating, they were \nbasically deductions that only the smaller, independent oil producers \ncould take, which kept them in business, and that Exxon--the big \ncompanies--didn't even take the deductions. They were not eligible to \ntake those that the President was going to eliminate.\n  Therefore, it was going to put out of business the independent oil \nand gas producers, which would be a boon to the Big Oil that the \nPresident said he didn't like.\n  He has talked about and railed against the big banks and the fat cats \non Wall Street, but it is as if there is a wink and a nod there: I am \ngoing to call you names, but I am going to let you make more money than \nyou have ever made in your lives while the rest of those in the country \nmake less money than they have ever made--because, under this \nPresident's policies and regulations, that is what happened.\n  He says that immigrants aren't the reason that wages haven't gone up \nenough. I hope that we will have a chance to show him the accurate data \nthat show, yes, that is the biggest reason that wages haven't gone up. \nFor all of the jobs that have been created, it looks like the number \nindicates it is the same number of immigrants that have taken jobs \nduring that time.\n  The President said that he plans to lift up the many businesses. Mr. \nSpeaker, that is the problem. This President thinks he is the one who \nlifts businesses or puts them down. It is true that he can destroy \nbusinesses, as he has done, but the fact that anyone thinks the \ngovernment is the one that lifts businesses is at the heart of the \nproblem with this administration, one of many.\n  The President says that, over the past 7 years, we have nurtured that \nspirit. He is talking about discoveries in DNA. Yet, with the 70,000 to \n80,000 pages of new regulations every year, there is not much spirit \nthere to nurture.\n  He said that we have protected an open Internet, but he failed to \nmention that the government took over the Internet. The FCC had said \nthat they were not going to take it over. Then he gave a speech, saying \nthat we were\n\n[[Page H361]]\n\ngoing to take it over. The next thing you know, they have taken it \nover.\n  He says that he is putting Joe in charge of mission control. He is \ntalking about curing cancer. I love the idea that we are going to cure \ncancer. That would be fantastic. A lot of loved ones I have lost have \ndied of cancer.\n  Then I heard he was going to put Joe in charge. Then I remembered, \nMr. Speaker, wasn't it he that was going to stamp out all waste, fraud, \nand abuse in the Federal Government, so he was going to put Joe in \ncharge, and we knew it could happen? It seems like he says he is going \nto put Joe in charge when he may not really be serious about doing \nanything or having any results. So we will see.\n  In any event, there are a lot of problems that he failed to address \nand the fact that he was being mocked by Iran as he was speaking about \nthe higher respect that other countries have. Go back to President \nReagan. The radical Islamists had so much more respect for President \nReagan. They didn't like him, but they had respect and fear.\n  Proverbs said: ``Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.'' There \nis a component of fear within respect. They had no fear of Carter, but \nthey had so much fear and respect for Reagan that they released our \nhostages the day he was sworn in. I am hoping and praying that we get a \nleader elected who takes office a year from now who has that kind of \nrespect.\n  He says that, when it comes to every important international issue, \npeople of the world do not look to Beijing or to Moscow to lead--they \ncall us.\n  I wish the President got more briefings or was able to attend more or \ngot better information if he is not getting this, but we have had a \nreal problem under his Presidency. People have been shocked, including \nsome here in this body--I was not really shocked--when Egypt and some \nof our Muslim ally nations have done airstrikes.\n  The big news was they didn't consult Washington, and people in the \nadministration were upset: Why didn't they check with us? I have met \nwith those people. They said: We can't tell this administration, \nbecause they will leak it to our enemies. We can't trust them.\n  For heaven's sake, this administration has declassified information \non nuclear weapons, trying to embarrass and harass Israel. They have \ntaken steps to try to prevent Israel from defending themselves.\n  Is it any wonder that Egyptian President el-Sisi--whom I have \ntremendous respect for--and other leaders, including Iran and other \nleaders in the Middle East, when they have got a problem, they don't \ntalk to Washington except for the largest supporter of terrorism, Iran?\n  Iran knows they can push President Obama around and his \nadministration, John Kerry. They can push them around, and they do. \nThey can take our sailors and not have any consequences. But when they \nhave got a real problem, they go to Moscow, because they know Putin is \na man who means business. I don't think he can be trusted. I think he \nis one of those with whom anything should be verified and that he \nshould be carefully watched.\n  Some people in this administration think Putin is an anathema and a \nmystery. They can't figure him out. He is one of the most transparent \nleaders in the world today. Those of us who know Russian history know \nyou can read him like a book. You can anticipate what he is going to \ndo. He is very transparent.\n  The President says that, as we focus on destroying ISIL, we don't \nhave a plan. We don't have strategic orders for our military to take \nout ISIL, but, somehow, he is focused on them. In having been all over \nnorth Iraq myself and in having met with Iraqi leaders, especially \nKurdish leaders--because they are the military leaders we can trust--I \nknow what they say.\n  In having just heard another report in September again, we have U.S. \nmilitary planes flying. They see trucks that are loaded with weapons \nand supplies for ISIL. We know they are going to ISIL as those are \nabout the only people using some of these roads, with the big trucks.\n  One of our A-10 pilots said his rules of engagement allowed him to \nneither crater the road and stop the supplies to ISIL and stop the \nweapons going to ISIL, nor did he have the authority to take out one of \nthe trucks unless one of the trucks fired at him, and only then could \nthey fire at that truck only. ISIL knows that, so they don't fire at A-\n10s or at any of our helicopters or aircraft. That is why most of the \nplanes that go out with ordnance come back with most of their ordnance. \nIt is because of this President's rules of engagement.\n  How else can you explain that, after 7\\1/4\\ years under Commander in \nChief and President George W. Bush, we lost right around 500 precious \nAmerican military lives in Afghanistan; and then, basically, when we \nwere told the war was over, for 7 years now under Commander in Chief \nObama, we have lost three to four times that many people and the peace?\n\n  When I talk to people privately--you won't get this in a public \nmeeting but in private meetings with our military--they indicate that \nit is our rules of engagement: We have to be worried that, if we defend \nourselves and live, we will go to Leavenworth for 20 years; so a lot of \nus would rather die as somewhat of a hero than go home and go to \nLeavenworth for defending ourselves.\n  So we have lost three to four times as many under President Obama--in \n3 months less time when the war was supposedly over--than we lost \nduring the actual war in Afghanistan. The President says that our \nforeign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda. I \nagree it must be, but, unfortunately, it isn't at this time.\n  I will just finish with this, Mr. Speaker. He points out that we also \ncan't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into \ncrisis. That is not leadership. That is a recipe for a quagmire, \nspilling American blood and treasure. Ultimately, it weakens us. It is \nthe lesson of Vietnam and of Iraq that we should have learned by now.\n  Mr. Speaker, Sam Johnson--after 7 years in the Hanoi Hilton as a \nprisoner of war in North Vietnam--was beaten and tortured. If you \nremember the scenario, Nixon had promised in 1972 to get us out of \nVietnam. He calls for the Paris peace negotiations. They start. North \nVietnam makes this show about storming out. So Nixon ordered the carpet \nbombing of Hanoi and North Vietnam for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of \nbombing, North Vietnam rushed back to the negotiating table and said: \nLet's get this done. And there was a peace deal.\n  As Sam Johnson and others were being taken to the bus to be taken to \nthe military plane to leave North Vietnam, he said one of the meanest \nofficers or higher officials there at the prison was laughing and said: \nYou stupid Americans, if you had just bombed us for 1 more week, we \nwould have had to surrender unconditionally.\n  Mr. Speaker, the lesson of Vietnam is this: If you are going to send \nAmerican military men and women into harm's way, give them everything \nthey need to win. Let them win, and then bring them home.\n  That is the lesson of Vietnam that this administration and many \nothers have not learned. That is why, instead of 500 military heroes \nlosing their lives in 7 years in Afghanistan, we have had three to four \ntimes that many lose their lives under President Obama. It is because \nthis lesson of Vietnam has not been learned. Give our military what \nthey need to win, and give them rules of engagement and orders to win, \nand then bring them home.\n  I hope and pray somebody gets that message in this administration so \nthat we have no more needless loss of life in foreign countries by the \nheroic, patriotic men and women of our military.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/13/house-section/article/H361-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H361-H362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1300\n               PROVIDING FOR AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.
