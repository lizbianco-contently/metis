Since 2003, volunteers like Alice Keighton, Joyce Speas, and \nmany others have donated their time at the bookstore, whose profits \nprovide funding for activities and necessities at the library.\n  This support makes quite a difference and helps the library inform \nand educate the citizens of Alleghany County.\n  My deepest appreciation to all of the friends of the library and all \nthe wonderful volunteers in Alleghany County, who do so much to make it \nsuch a special place to live, work, and visit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9210-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there has been a great deal of \ndiscussion about trade agreements, but there is another important piece \nof legislation that deals with Customs. This is an often obscure \nelement, but it makes a huge difference to be able to manage the \nhundreds of billions of dollars of products that leave the United \nStates and those that are imported.\n  The Customs bill represents important work by our Ways and Means \nCommittee and our colleagues in the Senate Finance Committee finally \nreaching conclusion. I am pleased with many of the key results. It \nincludes items that are not in the headlines, but are very important to \nthe people that I represent.\n  For example, the legislation will help our growing outdoor industry \nby creating new definitions and tariff classifications for recreational \nperformance outerwear.\n  It reduces costly taxes on outdoor footwear, which both supports the \noutdoor recreation industry and makes it more affordable for people to \nget outside and enjoy our beautiful parks and trails.\n  It includes the full ENFORCE Act, requiring immediate action to \ninvestigate and address trade cheaters and take measures to stop those \nwho continually attempt to circumvent the penalties already imposed \nupon them.\n  As our trade agreements become more complex, so, too, has trade \nenforcement. We can no longer rely on a handful of agencies to \neffectively protect our market from tax cheaters. It requires a whole \ngovernment approach, and this is why it is critical to see the bill \npermanently establish the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center to \ncentralize and enhance trade enforcement efforts.\n  It finally puts into law a ban on the import of goods made with child \nand forced labor. This will reshape markets and provide additional \ntools to confront horrific work conditions around the world.\n  Very important for me, it will help ensure our trade agreements \nactually are enforced. A lack of enforcement is a justifiable criticism \nof people who are skeptical of trade agreements, who wonder is it worth \nthe paper that it is printed on to have labor and environmental \nprotections.\n  Well, the greatest obstacle to enforcement has been lack of \nresources. Enforcing trade agreements is expensive, time consuming, and \nhighly complex. That is why I fought hard to include in this \nlegislation elements that I have introduced, along with Senator Maria \nCantwell, the Trade STRONGER Act, which creates a trade enforcement and \ncapacity-building fund which would not only provide more resources for \nthe enforcement of labor and environment violations, but helps the fund \nmanaged by the USTR be accessible government-wide, not only for \nenforcement, but for in-country capacity building, helping our current \nand future trading partners implement the labor and environmental \nprovisions they have committed to.\n  This is an important step forward because, regardless of what one \nfeels about a particular trade treaty, I think everyone agrees they \nought to be enforced.\n  This Customs bill, in addition to promoting the trade process more \neffectively and providing relief for some inequitable treatment for \nproducts so important to my constituents, establishes more resources to \nmake sure our trade agreements are, in fact, enforced.\n  This has been the result of long and arduous negotiations, but done \nin a spirit of cooperation and goodwill.\n  I particularly want to thank the efforts of Speaker Paul Ryan and \nWays and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady, who have worked with me in \na spirit of cooperation to make sure the enforcement provisions are \neffective. I appreciate this.\n  I think this will be an achievement that we all should support \nbecause we will all benefit from it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9210-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               E-FREE ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Kathryn is one of the tens of thousands of \nwomen that have been harmed by a permanent sterilization device, the \nmedical device known as Essure.\n  Essure was recommended as the optimal birth control solution for \nKathryn, despite a pre-existing autoimmune condition and a known nickel \nallergy. After the procedure, she felt severe pain, extreme bleeding, \nvomiting, and rashes, caused by the nickel-based device.\n  After 3 weeks of pain and discomfort, Kathryn paid $7,000 out of \npocket to remove the device. One coil was found in her uterus. She lost \n2 months of work and of her life. Kat's health has never been the same.\n  I rise as a voice for the Essure Sisters to tell this Chamber that \ntheir stories are real, their pain is real, and that their fight is \nreal.\n  Mr. Speaker, my bill, the E-Free Act, can halt this tragedy by \nremoving this dangerous device from the market. Too many women have \nbeen harmed.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join this fight and to join the bill \nbecause stories like Kathryn's are too important to ignore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9210-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9210-H9211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE MOST EFFECTIVE DEFENSE AGAINST AN ARMED TERRORIST IS AN ARMED \n                                AMERICAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, ever since the terrorist attack in San \nBernardino, leftist politicians have called for more restrictions on \ngun ownership for Americans. These are the same politicians who have \nworked for years to open our Nation to unprecedented and indiscriminate \nimmigration from hotbeds of Islamic extremism.\n  The most effective defense against an armed terrorist is an armed \nAmerican. If one person in that room in San Bernardino had been able to \nreturn fire, many innocent lives would have been saved. But \nCalifornians are subject to the most restrictive gun laws in the \ncountry, making it very difficult for law-abiding citizens to exercise \ntheir Second Amendment right to defend themselves. In a society denied \nits right of self-defense, the gunman is king.\n  I repeat: the most effective defense against an armed terrorist is an \narmed American. Yet, the President and his followers seek to increase \nthe number of terrorists entering through porous borders and lax \nimmigration laws while, at the same time, seeking to decrease the \nnumber of armed Americans.\n  Their latest ploy was announced by the President on Sunday and has \nbeen parroted by his Congressional allies this week, to the point of \ndisrupting the work of the House.\n  In the President's words, ``Congress should act to make sure no one \non a no-fly list is able to buy a gun.'' He asked: What could possibly \nbe the argument against that?\n  Well, while serving in the California State Senate a decade ago, I \ndiscovered suddenly I couldn't check in for a flight. When I asked why, \nI was told I was on this government list. The experience was absolutely \nKafkaesque.\n  My first reaction was to ask, ``Well, why am I on that list?\n  ``Well, we can't tell you.\n  ``Well, what criteria do you use?\n  ``That is classified.\n  ``How do I get off that list?\n  ``You can't.''\n\n[[Page H9211]]\n\n  I soon discovered that another California State Senator had been \nplaced on that list. A few months later, U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy \nfound himself on that list.\n  I at least had the Office of the Sergeant at Arms of the State Senate \nto work through, something an ordinary American would not. Even so, it \ntook months of working through that office with repeated petitions to \nthe government to get my name removed from that list.\n  The farce of it all was this: I was advised, in the meantime, just to \nfly under my middle name, which I did without incident.\n  In my case, it turns out it was a case of mistaken identity with an \nIRA activist the British Government was mad at. This could happen to \nany American.\n  The fine point of it is this: During this administration, the IRS has \nbeen used extensively to harass and intimidate ordinary Americans for \nexercising their First Amendment rights.\n  What the President proposes is that, on the whim of any Federal \nbureaucrat, an American can be denied their Second Amendment rights as \nwell with no opportunity to confront their accuser, contest the \nevidence, or avail themselves of any of their other due process rights \nunder the Constitution.\n  The concept that the left is seeking to instill in our law is that \nmere suspicion by a bureaucrat is sufficient to deny law-abiding \nAmerican citizens their constitutional rights under the law. Given the \nleft's demonstrated hostility to freedom of speech and due process of \nlaw, it is not hard to see where this is leading us.\n  I would support the President's proposal if it established a judicial \nprocess where an individual could only be placed on this list once he \nhad been accorded his constitutional rights to be informed of the \ncharges, to be given his day in court, to be accorded the right to \nconfront his accuser and contest the evidence against him and submit \nhimself to a decision by a jury of his peers. But that is the farthest \nthing from the left's agenda.\n  The President's proposal would have done nothing to stop the carnage \nin San Bernardino, where the terrorists were not on any watch list. \nIndeed, one was admitted from Saudi Arabia after the vetting that the \nPresident keeps assuring us is rigorous and thorough. And several of \nthe guns used in this massacre weren't even acquired directly but, \nrather, through a third party.\n  Of course the American people don't want terrorists to have guns. The \nAmerican people don't want terrorists in our country in the first \nplace. But the President's policies have left our Nation's gate wide \nopen while he seeks to take from Americans their means of self-defense.\n  So I leave off as I began. The best defense against an armed \nterrorist is an armed American. That is what the Second Amendment is \nall about. It is an absolutely essential pillar of our security.\n  Our Constitution is our best defense of all. It must be defended \nagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9211-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FRENCH RAIL/HOLOCAUST SETTLEMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness about \nHolocaust survivors' continued quest for justice, an ever-elusive goal \nstill nearly three-quarters of a century after living through the \ncrimes of modern humanity's darkest period.\n  Though it is said that the moral universe's arc bends toward justice, \ntime is not a luxury we can afford any longer for elderly Holocaust \nsurvivors.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Of the approximately half a million Holocaust survivors, around half \nof them live at or near poverty. Can you imagine that? Holocaust \nsurvivors should be able to live out the remaining days in comfort and \nwith the knowledge that their long-sought justice has finally been \nachieved.\n  Recently, Mr. Speaker, an agreement was reached between the \nGovernment of France and the United States regarding victims of \nHolocaust-related deportations during the Nazi era. The French rail \ncompany, SNCF, knowingly and willfully transported tens of thousands of \nHolocaust victims to concentration camps and near certain death during \nthe Second World War. They were paid to do this.\n  For over 70 years, SNCF, the French rail company and the French \nGovernment eluded any and all responsibility for these actions. For \nyears, I have been fighting for justice for all victims of the \nHolocaust.\n  On this issue in particular, I have joined Representative Carolyn B. \nMaloney of New York as she attempted to shepherd the Holocaust Rail \nJustice Act through Congress over the past few sessions. I want to \nthank the gentlewoman from New York for her leadership and her \nunyielding effort to hold SNCF accountable for its heinous actions.\n  While the agreement reached over SNCF's--remember, that is the French \nrail company--culpability in the deaths of tens of thousands of Jews is \nnot the optimal solution, it is imperative that we do hold these \nperpetrators accountable and that we win justice for as many Holocaust \nsurvivors and their heirs as possible.\n  However, Mr. Speaker, it is important that Holocaust survivors and \ntheir families are made aware of this agreement and the claims process. \nMany do not know of this.\n  For more information, questions, and to file a claim, the State \nDepartment has set up a Web site at www.state.gov/\ndeportationclaims.com. I know that is very difficult. Or you can call \n202-776-8385, or send an email to deportationclaims@state.gov.\n  That is a lot to take in.\n  Or contact your congressional Representative, and we can help.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to spread the word to make sure that \nevery Holocaust survivor eligible gets an opportunity to file a claim. \nI want to thank the continued efforts and the support of the many \nHolocaust survivors that I am blessed to have in my congressional \ndistrict who have been at the forefront in the fight for justice for \nsurvivors and their heirs.\n  My good friends, David Mermelstein, David Schaecter, Joe Sachs, Alex \nGross, Herbie Karliner, Jack Rubin, and so many others--they have seen \nthe unforgettable, and they have lived through the unthinkable. Yet, \nthey continue steadfast in the fight for justice against those who have \ncommitted the unforgivable and the unthinkable.\n  I, also, want to thank the others who have pursued justice for these \nindividuals at every turn, like my good friend and long-time \nconstituent, Sam Dubbin. Sam has been instrumental in highlighting \nfraud at the Claims Conference, that we know now, very clearly, \noccurred over decades and deprived Holocaust survivors of at least tens \nof millions of dollars, and the real numbers are likely even higher.\n  Next year, Mr. Speaker, I plan to introduce my bill, once again, to \nallow survivors to have their day in court. That is all the bill does, \nto have their day in court, because we now know that the Claims \nConference process has failed so many of the Holocaust survivors.\n  Mr. Speaker, time is of the essence. We owe survivors and their heirs \nevery opportunity to achieve justice. I urge my colleagues to continue \nthis fight on behalf of the remaining Holocaust survivors and their \nheirs to get the word out to their constituents and their local \ncommunity leaders.\n  If you know someone who may be eligible to receive compensation under \nthis incredibly horrific act done by the French rail company to \ntransport victims to certain death, please direct them to the State \nDepartment Web site. The deadline is May 31 next year. Let's get the \nword out as soon and as far as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9211-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9211-H9212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IRAN IS UNTRUSTWORTHY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to start by thanking my good \nfriend and colleague from Florida for her efforts in trying to make \nsure we are doing all we can for the Holocaust survivors.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that these are very turbulent and \nfast-moving times. As we train our focus on ISIS, however, I think it \nwould be a\n\n[[Page H9212]]\n\nvery foolish mistake if we lose sight of the terror threat from Iran, \nthe world's greatest state sponsor of terror.\n  In the past week, two alarming developments have exposed why Iran \ncannot be trusted:\n  First, a December 2 report from the International Atomic Energy \nAgency revealed that Iran had previously been working on nuclear \nweapons.\n  That is right, Mr. Speaker. Despite Iran's repeated insistence that \nits nuclear program had only been for peaceful purposes, the IAEA \nreport makes clear that Iran had an active nuclear weapons program.\n  In short, Iran lied, and it has been telling a very big lie for some \ntime. This deceit is precisely why we must not close the book on \nuncovering Iran's past nuclear efforts.\n  Second, Mr. Speaker, it has now been reported that on November 21, \nIran tested a ballistic missile, one capable of carrying a nuclear \nwarhead. This is a breach of multiple United Nations Security Council \nresolutions and is in obvious defiance of the 8-year ban on ballistic \nmissile work that was part of the nuclear agreement.\n  This is Iran's second such launch of a ballistic missile since the \nconclusion of the nuclear agreement. Regrettably, no such action has \nbeen taken against Iran for that first test in October. Instead, the \nU.N. Security Council is still debating on how to respond. They are \nstill debating. What message does that send?\n  Mr. Speaker, Iran cannot be given a pass for these flagrant \nprovocations. A failure to forcibly respond now with repercussions will \nonly encourage Iran to incrementally cheat in the future again and \nagain, as it already has.\n  The unavoidable truth is that simply looking the other way so as not \nto ruffle any feathers in Tehran will neither bring peace nor an end to \nbelligerent behavior from the Iranians. We know that Iran cannot be \ntrusted, plain and simple. We know that Iran will continue to test the \nworld's resolve.\n  The real question now, Mr. Speaker, is whether the world will even be \ninterested in responding. It is time for our voices to be heard loud \nand clear. The United States must step forward and lead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9212-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, it is sad to me that it \ntook the President 5 days to identify the attack in San Bernardino as \nterrorism. After I heard the tragic news last Wednesday, I knew in 5 \nseconds it was a terrorist attack.\n  The President needs to revisit the \n9/11 Memorial in New York City, which clearly establishes the timeline \nof the global war on terrorism. He can see copies of fatwas by Islamic \nextremists declaring war on modern civilization dated in 1996. The war \nhas never stopped.\n  The Second Amendment's right to bear arms has never been more \nimportant for citizens to protect their families. The thought that gun \ncontrol can stop terrorism is a diversion from the real threats. This \nwas revealed by the mass murders in Paris, despite French strict gun \ncontrol.\n  In the past weeks, the terrorists' mass murders have been horrifying, \nof Lebanese, Russians, and French, along with Americans in Iraq, \nIsrael, Paris, and San Bernardino, of Muslims, Christians, and Jews.\n  The President should change course to actually destroy ISIL, not just \ngive pathetic political lectures. We are facing an enemy that requires \nus to set aside partisanship to protect American families.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9212-8", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SOLAR INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, notably absent from the tax extenders bill \nreleased this week is a provision on which 174,000 American jobs \ndepend.\n  The solar investment tax credit, a 30 percent credit for the \ninstallation of solar on residential and commercial properties, was \nimplemented in 2006. The result has been an annual growth of 73 \npercent.\n  That growth allowed the industry to develop panels that have soared \nin efficiency and plummeted in price. Solar is our fastest growing \nenergy source and is responsible for 40 percent of all new generating \ncapacity brought online this year. Solar employment is growing at a \nrate 20 times higher than the overall economy.\n  If the solar investment tax credit is not extended, that growth will \nstop, demand will drop by 71 percent, and 100,000 jobs will be lost; \nbut a 5-year extension would create 60,000 jobs and allow the industry \nto come to maturity.\n  Mr. Speaker, tax legislation that does not include the solar \ninvestment tax credit is not serious about creating American jobs. I \nurge its inclusion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9212-9", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9212-H9213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE LIFE OF MARY CALDWELL PLUMER\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

But more than 2,000 suspects on the terrorist \nwatch list have already bought guns in our country. We don't need to \nadd to that list.

These activists \nare victims of constant mental and physical harassment and oftentimes \nare forced to endure unsanitary prison conditions.\n  Activists, including Tran Huynh Duy Thuc, Dang Xuan Dieu, and Ho Duc \nHoa, were falsely tried and imprisoned simply for practicing their \nright to assemble.\n  This year, in November, Burma, a country known for its horrendous \nhuman rights record, held its first free election, yet Vietnam \ncontinues to function as a single-party system. Today, on International \nHuman Rights Day, I urge Vietnam to finally open up its society and to \nempower its people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9213-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THOMAS GALLAGHER\n\n  (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of \nThomas Gallagher, an honorable public servant who passed away earlier \nthis week.\n  Following his service in the United States Air Force during the \nKorean war, Thomas earned an undergraduate and master's degree while \nsimultaneously pursuing his career in law enforcement and raising a \nfamily.\n  Thomas joined the New York City Police Department in 1957 and went on \nto serve the city for 37 years, rising all the way to the rank of \nassistant chief.\n  Mr. Speaker, Thomas Gallagher was the son of Irish immigrants. From a \nvery early age, he learned the importance of hard work and selfless \ndedication to his family and the community. Though he endured many \ntragedies in his life, including the loss of all three of his wives to \nvarious diseases, he never lost his zeal for life. He was often buoyed \nby the great pride he held for all three of his children, who rose to \nbecome great successes in law, business, and the Secret Service.\n  Thomas personifies the great American spirit. Not only did he \npersevere through trying times, he prospered. His was a life well \nlived, and I feel truly blessed to have known him and his great family.\n  May God now hold Thomas in the palm of His hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9213-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF PROFESSOR JOHN ARTHUR RASSIAS\n\n  (Ms. KUSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the life of a \ntruly extraordinary Granite Stater, Professor John Rassias, who passed \naway last week in New Hampshire at the age of 90.\n  Professor Rassias was a lifelong Granite Stater, a World War II \nveteran, and an internationally renowned language professor at my alma \nmater, Dartmouth College. He developed the Rassias method, a \nrevolutionary way of teaching languages that includes rapid-fire drills \nand dramatic flair, allowing students to be immersed in the language \nand culture.\n  He was an extraordinary mentor. His teaching style has been widely \nadopted at universities and institutions around the world, including in \nthe Peace Corps, where Dr. Rassias was the first director of language \nprograms in 1964.\n  His legacy extends far beyond simply teaching language. Dr. Rassias' \ndeep commitment to cultural dialogue and understanding shaped the \nperspective of countless students and inspired them to make the world a \nbetter place. He will be truly missed by the entire Granite State and \nmembers of the Dartmouth community throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9213-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9213-H9214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PINKY SWEAR FOUNDATION\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, the pinky swear promise is a universal \nsymbol to keep one's promise and one's word. For the Pinky Swear \nFoundation, keeping that promise means helping children who are \nbattling cancer and their families.\n  The foundation's work was actually started 12 years ago, after 9-\nyear-old Mitch Chepokas of Chanhassen, Minnesota, had been diagnosed \nwith terminal bone cancer and, while in his hospital room, overheard \nothers discussing that there would not be enough money for Christmas \nthat year.\n  Mitch decided that he would give away all of his money to those \nfamilies so they could celebrate the holidays, and he made his father \npinky swear to continue to make sure that they will\n\n[[Page H9214]]\n\nhelp children with cancer after he was gone.\n  Today the Chepokas family has been joined by others in the community \nand around the country who have agreed to help keep this promise and \nhelp in the fight against cancer.

Tragically, they also took the lives \nof three brave firefighters.\n  On August 19, 25-year-old Daniel Lyons, who is also a firefighter, \nwas with his friends and partners, Richard Wheeler, Andrew Zajac, and \nTom Zbyszewski, when their vehicle was overcome by flames. Daniel made \nit out of the fire truck alive but suffered burns over 60 percent of \nhis body.\n  A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to meet with Daniel. After he \nhad spent 3 months undergoing treatment at Harborview Medical Center in \nSeattle, he has a positive attitude about life, and is excited about \nhis opportunity to continue to serve.\n  This young man still wants to be a police officer. He lost his \nfingertips in this fire. He still believes that he--and I know he can \ndo this, and I want to be there for him--can accomplish his goal of \ncontinuing to serve as a police officer in the State of Washington.\n  As a former cop of 33 years, I could not be more proud of Daniel.

Mr. Speaker, Faisal Shahzad was already on the no-fly \nlist when he attempted to bomb Times Square in May of 2010. If he had \ndecided to walk into a gun store that day, he would have walked out \nwith a gun in hand. Fortunately, Shahzad's bomb failed to go off. But \nhad he, instead, purchased a military-style weapon that day, it could \nhave been very different.\n  It is absolutely against common sense that suspected terrorists can \nwalk into a gun store and purchase any firearm that they would like. \nThey can't walk onto a plane, mind you, but they can purchase a \nmilitary-style assault weapon and wreak havoc on a community.\n  Seventy-seven percent of the American people believe we should close \nthis loophole.

As elected officials, we have a \nresponsibility to do everything we can to protect our Nation. That is \nwhy I reintroduced H.R. 4089, the Student Visa Security Improvement \nAct, to further address potential threats to our national security.\n  It is clear there are significant gaps of vulnerabilities that must \nbe addressed in our student visa program.

I urge my colleagues to support this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9214-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLOSE THE TERRORIST GUN LOOPHOLE\n\n  (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House passed bipartisan \nlegislation to better protect our Nation by making our Visa Waiver \nProgram more rigorous. That is because we recognized, on a bipartisan \nbasis, that legal loopholes that make Americans less safe must be \nclosed.\n  Why can't we bring that same spirit to commonsense gun violence \nlegislation? That is a rhetorical question because I think we all know \nthat the gun manufacturing and sales industry and their puppet, the \nNRA, have a stranglehold on the Republican majority in this Congress \nthat has kept Congress silent for years on this issue, but that silence \nwill no longer be tolerated.\n  More than 2,000 suspects on the FBI terrorist watch list have legally \npurchased guns in the United States in recent years. Thankfully, one \nbrave Republican has dared to confront the gun lobby by introducing a \nbill to close this loophole. I demand a vote on that bill.\n  Americans are tired of hearing thoughts and prayers in response to \nmass shootings. They are sick of our regularly scheduled moments of \nsilence. Our silence has become the problem.\n  Americans want action to address the gun violence epidemic in this \ncountry. There is no better way to start than the bipartisan bill \nprohibiting suspected terrorists on the terrorist watch list from \nstockpiling assault weapons.\n  Let's have a vote on H.R. 1076. It is time to end Congress' shameful \nsilence on this critical national security issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9214-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9214-H9215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING VALOR CHRISTIAN'S STATE CHAMPION FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. COFFMAN.

The players stood\n\n[[Page H9215]]\n\nstrong, and their victory in the final minutes is a credit to the \ndetermination and commitment of the entire team and Coach Rod Sherman.\n  It is an honor to highlight the accomplishments of these young men, \nwho finished the season 12-2 and established an impressive 30-1 playoff \nrecord.\n  I would also like to recognize the championship game MVP, junior \nquarterback Dylan McCaffrey, who led the team on two touchdown drives \nin the final minutes to win the comeback victory.\n  Again, congratulations to the Valor Christian High School football \nteam on their impressive season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9215-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stop the silence and to \nencourage and stress that my colleagues need to take action to expand \nbackground checks and to close the loopholes.

However, despite the success of this law, it does not \napply to 40 percent of all gun purchases.\n  Mr. Speaker, 92 percent of Americans favor universal background \nchecks. It is well past time for us, as Congress, to reflect the will \nof the people that we represent, to pass legislation to expand \nbackground checks, and to close the loopholes.\n  Stop the silence.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Human Rights Day.\n  Sixty-seven years ago today, December 10, 1948, the U.N. General \nAssembly proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The \nUniversal Declaration set out a common understanding of the fundamental \nhuman rights that were to be universally protected.\n  Today, we recall the inalienable rights intrinsic to every human \nbeing. In many regions of the world, people continue to struggle to \nattain the most basic rights and respect for their basic human dignity. \nIn several regions of the world, defenseless civilians face attacks by \nterrorist organizations and networks that seek to intimidate, maim, and \nkill in the name of a distorted theology.\n  I join my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) \nand people everywhere in reaffirming our commitment to the fundamental \nrights and freedoms contained in the Universal Declaration, and urge \nall leaders to redouble their efforts to promote and guarantee them.\n  I also want to thank the human rights defenders everywhere, who so \noften carry out their work at great risk to themselves and their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9215-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NO GUNS FOR SUSPECTED TERRORISTS\n\n  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BEATTY.

To not bring the bipartisan bill, H.R. 1076, to the \nfloor for a vote is to deny us the opportunity to keep our families \nsafer.\n  This bill, H.R. 1076, is sensible and straightforward. If you are a \nsuspected terrorist, you should not be able to buy a gun. If you are a \nsuspected terrorist, you should not, Mr. Speaker, be able to buy a gun. \nI will say it today and tomorrow and repeatedly: if you are a suspected \nterrorist, you should not be able to buy a gun. We should not have guns \nand weapons of murder and terror.\n  I will no longer be silent. Mr. Speaker, we should no longer be \nsilent.

On this horrific day in San Bernardino, \nCalifornia, 14 people were tragically killed.\n  Mr. Shannon Johnson was one of the people whose life was cut short \nthat day. His friends and family say he enjoyed laughter, conversation, \nand music. He believed in the greatness of love, equality, and \nkindness, and treated others accordingly.\n  On December 2, Mr. Johnson, who was a native of Jesup, Georgia, in \nthe First Congressional District, displayed the ultimate act of heroism \nand sacrifice by shielding fellow coworkers from a hail of bullets. His \nlast words were: ``I got you.''\n  Mr. Johnson died a hero. My thoughts and prayers go out to his \nfriends and family.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a resolution \ncalling for reestablishing full diplomatic relations between the United \nStates and the nation of Belarus with the focus of exchanging \nambassadors between our countries. This resolution recognizes that the \nGovernment of Belarus has reached out to the West and has improved \npolitical conditions in their own country.\n  For example, the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe \nmonitored the recent Presidential election in Belarus and noted the \nprogress made in establishing a more democratic and open system.\n  Another example of Belarus' positive action is that it played a \nsignificant role in bringing about a cease-fire in Ukraine. It did this \nby hosting immense diplomatic talks between all\n\n[[Page H9216]]\n\nparties to the conflict. This was a major contribution toward restoring \npeace to that region.\n  Furthermore, on October 22 of this year, Belarus released all of its \nvery few political prisoners.\n  In response, the European Union and the United States have \ntemporarily lifted economic sanctions. Hopefully, that temporary \nsuspension of economic sanctions will become permanent as Belarus \ncontinues to improve its standing.\n  Exchanging ambassadors, as my resolution calls for, is a major step \nforward in the right direction. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this resolution, which I will submit to the Congress right \nnow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9216-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMONSENSE GUN REFORM\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because passing commonsense gun \nlegislation should really not be a partisan issue. What our country \nneeds is commonsense gun reform, but many in this Chamber won't even \ntake the first step: taking guns out of the hands of terrorists.\n  Time and time again, Republicans have voted to block debate. Let me \nsay that again: a debate. They won't even let us discuss Congressman \nPeter King's Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists \nAct, otherwise known as H.R. 1076. That is simply outrageous. We should \ndebate, yes, and we should vote up or down on this important bill.\n  This bill, which I am proud to cosponsor, would close a dangerous \nloophole that allows individuals on the government's no-fly list to \nlegally purchase guns. Let me emphasize this. These are people who are \ndeemed too dangerous to fly on planes, but they can and do purchase \nguns. If they are too dangerous to fly on an airplane, why aren't they \ntoo dangerous to have a weapon that fires 800 rounds per minute?\n  My Democratic colleagues and I remain committed to blocking dangerous \nindividuals from buying guns, and we remain committed to stopping the \nsenseless violence that has already taken too many lives in this \ncountry. It is past time to listen to the American people and not to \nthe NRA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9216-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REFORMING AMERICA'S EDUCATION SYSTEM\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago I \nreturned from the White House, where President Barack Obama signed \nhistoric reforms for elementary and secondary education into law.\n  I was proud to serve on the conference committee that was responsible \nfor settling the differences between the House and the Senate versions \nof the Every Student Succeeds Act, which has replaced No Child Left \nBehind.\n  This is legislation which has been years in the making and which will \nfinally put the control of education back into the hands of our States, \nour schools, and, of course, our parents and teachers across the \nNation.\n  It also calls for the U.S. Department of Education to study how title \nI funds are distributed. I have long been concerned that children are \nput at a disadvantage based on the populations of their school \ndistricts rather than on a concentration of poverty. I am hopeful that \nthis study will make the argument for a more equitable method of \ndistributing these funds to areas that are deeply affected by poverty.\n  This is a bill that I believe will make a real difference for \nstudents across the Nation. I was proud to see it gain overwhelming \nbipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9216-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICA'S GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC\n\n  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, we were elected to protect and serve the \nAmerican people against all enemies, foreign and domestic. One of the \nbest ways that we can uphold this sacred duty is to deal with the gun \nviolence epidemic that we have in America, which claims the lives of \nmore than 11,000 people each year.\n  One of the things that we should be doing is passing legislation to \nprevent individuals who are on the FBI's terrorist watch list, because \nthey are suspected terrorists, from being able to purchase guns. To me, \nthis seems to be a no-brainer.\n  If you are not able to fly because you are a suspected terrorist, you \nshould not be able to purchase an AK-47, an AR-15, or another weapon of \nmass destruction which is not used to hunt deer, but is used to hunt \nhuman beings.\n  It is time for House Republicans to stop functioning as wholly owned \nsubsidiaries of the NRA. It is time to cut the puppet strings from the \ngun lobby.

Mr. Speaker, given the challenges we face today \nwith the economy and the labor force, I have watched since December 2 \nso much dishonesty on this floor concerning the actions on December 2 \nand the ability for terrorists to purchase weapons automatically.\n  FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that \nevery time someone buys a weapon it is run through the FBI and they are \nnotified if someone is on the no-fly list.\n  I am a little concerned with the other side of the aisle as they keep \ntalking about having to protect our public when, in turn, they are \ntaking away the Constitution of our Nation.\n  If the FBI is sent this information, it is reviewed. If the \nterrorists are actually buying weapons and walking the streets, they \nshould be arrested, but they are not.\n  You can get on the no-fly list. I personally have been on the no-fly \nlist. It took me 6 months to get off of it. They didn't tell me who put \nme on it, why I was put on it, and what it was the result from. Six \nmonths.\n  Yes, I am an NRA board member. But to have people say that terrorists \nare running around buying guns is an outright lie. I will say that on \nthe floor. It is not true. It is part of the Constitution.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 3831) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nextend the annual comment period for payment rates under Medicare \nAdvantage, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3831\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Fairness in \n     Regulatory Timing Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENDING THE ANNUAL COMMENT PERIOD FOR PAYMENT RATES \n                   UNDER MEDICARE ADVANTAGE.\n\n       Section 1853(b)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w-23(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(or, in 2017 and each subsequent year, \n     at least 60 days)'' after ``45 days''; and\n       (2) by inserting ``(in 2017 and each subsequent year, of no \n     less than 30 days)'' after ``opportunity''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Tiberi) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3831, the Securing \nFairness in Regulatory Timing Act of 2015. This is a small but really \nimportant piece of legislation. I am pleased to have the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Thompson), my friend, here to discuss this important \nmeasure.\n  The House passed this measure earlier this year, in June, by \nunanimous consent. Now, we return to the bill to add the technical \ncorrections asked for by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nand the Senate so we can send this bill to the President's desk before \nthe end of the year.\n  Today, the Medicare Advantage program, known by many as the MA \nprogram, serves more than 16 million seniors across the United States \nof America, including my mom and dad. Enrollment has increased more \nthan threefold in the past 10 years and is expected to nearly double in \nthe next 10 years.\n  To ensure that seniors in MA plans across the country are able to \ncontinue to receive the high-quality care that they deserve, CMS is \nexpected to pay about $156 billion to more than 3,600 MA plans this \nyear alone. That amounts to nearly 30 percent of overall Medicare \nspending.\n  Typically, every year CMS sends out what it calls a rate notice to \nplans and Medicare Advantage companies that details the various payment \nrates, as well as benefit changes that the agency intends to make for \nthe following plan year that impacts people like my mom and dad. This \nnotice follows the standard process of a draft notice. It gets \npublished; then the public has a certain amount of time to submit \ncomments and questions; and then the agency publishes a final notice \nbased on that feedback that they receive.\n  However, MA and Part D aren't treated the same as the other major \npayment systems within Medicare itself. Right now, the current process \ntakes about 45 days, but only 15 of those days are allotted for the \ncommenting portion; 15 days for thousands of plans, millions of \nstakeholders to submit comments on proposed changes to a program that \namounts to one-third of all Medicare spending.\n  I could almost understand this if the rate notice were a short and \nconcise document, if it were easy to understand and simple to \nimplement. But it is not. In fact, the rate notice has grown from \naround 16 pages in 2006 to nearly 150 pages this year. That is over a \n900 percent increase. All the while, the time for the public comment \nperiod has remained static, exactly the same.\n  This means less and less time for the plans and Congress to conduct \nthe necessary review in order to provide CMS with the kind of feedback \nthat would better help the agency assess the impact of their proposed \nchanges to consumers. This is important because without accurate \nfeedback, CMS could inadvertently move forward with a proposed change \nto the Medicare Advantage program that might negatively impact those \nseniors--again, like my mom and dad--who depend on these plans for \naccess to their providers, to their doctors.\n  The legislation before us is simple, and it is straightforward. It \nextends the public notice period from 45 days to 60 days. Therefore, it \nwould double the extension of the comment period from 15 days to 30 \ndays. This is a commonsense, good-government fix we can make that will \ngive plans more time to understand the changes that CMS proposes and \nother constructive feedback in order to make the Medicare Advantage \nprogram, overall, more responsive to senior citizens' needs.\n  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this \nlegislation again and send it to the Senate so we can get it to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3831, the Securing Fairness in Regulatory \nTiming Act of 2015. Every year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices publishes its Medicare Advantage call letter and rate notice, \nwhich outlines payment rates and changes for the nearly 2,000 plans \nthat serve our most vulnerable population.\n  Nearly 10 years ago, the call letter and rate notice were less than \n20 pages long. However, since then, enrollment in Medicare Advantage \nhas nearly tripled, from 5.4 million to 16 million. Medicare Advantage \npolicies have become more complex, and the call letter and rate notice \nhas grown nearly tenfold, sometimes up to over 200 pages long.\n  At the same time, the time between the publishing of these draft \nnotices and the final notices, which is currently 45 days, has remained \nunchanged. During this 45-day period, in which there are only 15 days \nto comment on the proposed changes in the program, plans, stockholders, \nmembers, and staff, are expected to review 150 pages of regulatory \nchanges and understand the impacts of those proposed policy changes on \na program that provides essential medical care to over a third of \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  We know from our experience, every February and March, that this does \nnot lend itself to an efficient, effective, nor transparent process. \nMoreover, it\n\n[[Page H9218]]\n\nshortchanges CMS of thoughtful, constructive feedback that is necessary \nto improve a program that our seniors enjoy and rely on.\n  H.R. 3831 is a simple, straightforward bill that will improve the \ncurrent process by expanding the cycle from 45 to 60 days, and that \ngives plans, stakeholders, Members, and our staff 30 full days--double \nthe current time allowed--to analyze and provide feedback on the draft \ncall letter and rate notice.\n  This is a no-cost, good-government, bipartisan bill that will make \nthe process more transparent, fair, and advantageous for the \nbeneficiaries we serve. As my good friend from Ohio pointed out, we \nhave already passed this bill. It is only coming back for some \ntechnical changes. I would ask, and strongly recommend, that all our \ncolleagues vote in favor of this bill so we can pass it to the Senate \nand get on with our work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on H.R. 3831, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, just to close, I agree 100 percent with my \nfriend from California. I urge all our colleagues to support this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3831, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9218-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9218-H9223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on S. 808.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Denham), the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for giving me time to \nspeak on the Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act of 2015.\n  This is an important piece of legislation that will reform the STB to \nwork more efficiently to better regulate the railroads. This year is \nthe 35th anniversary of the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, \nwhich saved the railroad industry from bankruptcy.\n  Earlier this year, my subcommittee held a hearing on the successes of \nthe railroad deregulation. We heard how railroads were freed to act \nmore like true businesses by charging market-driven rates and being \nable to right-size their operations along rail lines, which made \neconomic sense.\n  This deregulation effort culminated in the creation of the STB in the \nInterstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995. The STB is a \nsmall but significant agency that conducts the economic regulation of \nthe railroads and has not been reauthorized since its creation.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  The bill we consider today would streamline and simplify regulatory \nactivities, a hallmark of this Congress.\n  While the STB has successfully overseen a stronger railroad industry, \nthis bill will help the rail industry better serve its customers:\n  First, it streamlines dispute resolution procedures and sets hard \ndeadlines for completion of rate cases to reduce litigation costs;\n  Second, it provides greater transparency into complaints received by \nthe STB and requires enhanced reporting by the agency;\n  Third, it rejects Big Government re-regulatory action that has been \nproposed in the past. Instead, it makes necessary reforms to the agency \nto improve its processes and procedures;\n  Finally, the bill has broad support from shipper groups across the \ncountry, including the National Grain and Feed Association, the \nAmerican Chemistry Council, The Fertilizer Institute, and the American \nFarm Bureau Federation.\n  I am pleased to stand here today and support the STB Reauthorization \nAct. It is only fitting that we are considering this bill just over 35 \nyears since Congress passed the Staggers Rail Act, which allowed the \nrailroads to thrive. I believe this bill will continue to make the STB \nand the rail industry better for the Nation's rail shippers, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this critical legislation.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am getting sick and tired of agreeing with my \ncolleagues. This is the way transportation issues are supposed to be: \nbipartisan, thoughtful, and relatively easy to pass.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support S. 808, which reauthorizes the STB, as \nyou have already heard. This Board has not been reauthorized since it \nwas created by the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of \n1995. That is ridiculous. It is about time we do it, and I am happy \nthat I am here today to participate in that.\n  For those who don't know, the Surface Transportation Board is \ncurrently a three-member, bipartisan agency within the Department of \nTransportation. They have regulatory jurisdiction over the rates \nfreight railroads charge their customers, mergers between railroad \ncompanies, new rail line construction, abandonment and conversion of \nexisting rail lines, and other such matters.\n  Though an agency very few Americans know about, the STB has a \nprofound impact on the availability and cost of goods across our \nNation. This bill makes a number of commonsense reforms to the Board.\n  It establishes the STB as an independent entity, rather than as part \nof the Department of Transportation, and expands Board membership from \nthree to five. I know that sounds like a small matter, but by doing so, \nit allows members to actually talk to each other without breaking \ncertain laws of members being unable to talk for obvious open \ngovernment purposes.\n  The bill requires the STB to streamline their processes for certain \nrate cases; sets rate review timelines for full, standalone cost rate \nchallenges; and requires the STB to initiate a proceeding to develop \nother methods to expedite rate cases.\n  For the first time, the STB will be able to initiate their own \ninvestigations on different allegations. Right now, current law \nrequires someone to bring a complaint before they can initiate a \nreview. This is a major improvement.\n  The bill requires the STB to establish a voluntary and binding \narbitration process to resolve rail rate and service complaints, and it \nrequires the STB to evaluate whether current large rate case \nmethodologies are sufficient, cost-effective, and are not unduly \ncomplex.\n  S. 808 is an important step forward on an important, if not widely \nknown, issue. I urge Members to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank Mr. Capuano, Mr. Denham, Mr. \nDeFazio, and, of course, our colleagues in the Senate for bringing this \nbill forward.\n  I think Mr. Capuano said it accurately: Transportation and \ninfrastructure bills should come to the floor in a bipartisan way, \nfiguring these things out, because this is good for America. It has \nnothing to do with Republicans or Democrats. It has to do with what is \ngood for the American people, what is good for the American economy.\n  The Surface Transportation Board is the Federal economic regulator of \nthe Nation's freight system, and that has been a real success story. \nSince the Staggers Rail Act was passed, I believe, as the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts mentioned, in 1980, our freight rail system is the \nenvy of the world. It is strong. It is vibrant. It does a great job. \nBut I know the STB reauthorization and making some of these significant \nchanges is going to be beneficial to everybody.\n  I think the gentleman from California ticked off a list of different \noutside groups or stakeholders and people that utilize rail that are in \nfavor of this. Again, they sat down and worked it out. This will allow \nthe STB to run\n\n[[Page H9222]]\n\nmore efficiently and, ultimately, again, as I said, improve the \nNation's economy.\n  I am not going to go through all the description--Mr. Capuano did a \ngreat job of that--of the changes that it makes and the authorities it \ngives them. It is going to streamline this and get these rate cases to \nthe STB faster and get us through that process quicker. That is \nextremely important. So I believe this legislation is a crucial step \nfor the railroad industry, the folks that use it on a day-to-day basis, \nand the American economy.\n  As mentioned, the Senate passed this bill with broad support, and I \nam pleased that we are moving this forward today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), my friend, the ranking member of \nthe Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for yielding. He has already explained in detail what is \nimportant about this legislation: the first reauthorization since the \ncreation of the agency, the streamlining of rate dispute processes, the \npotential of arbitration in the future, and enlarging the Board so they \ncan be more facile in terms of making decisions without violating \npublic meetings laws. All those things are very important. I am just \ngoing to add a little bit of what this means to me kind of stuff for \nanybody who might be interested.\n  When I was a relatively junior Member of Congress--I think I am \nprobably the only Member of Congress who has testified twice before the \nSurface Transportation Board--we had a huge crisis in the West--I think \nit was after the UP-SP merger--where my Christmas tree growers couldn't \nget railcars. So I famously made the ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' \npresentation to the Surface Transportation Board. We did, not too long \nthereafter, get some railcars delivered and got those trees to families \nall across the Western United States. That was important to an \nimportant little industry that we have in Oregon.\n  More importantly, I went to the Surface Transportation Board again. \nWe had something called RailAmerica, which was an accumulation of many, \nmany short line railroads across the country. It was bought by and \nbeing managed by one of those wonderful Wall Street hedge funds, who \nwere driving both our rail line and other rail lines into the ground. \nThey didn't have the slightest bit of interest in being in the rail \nbusiness. They were just trying to drain what money they could out of \nthose railroads.\n  One bright, sunny day, they decided to abandon the Coos Bay Railroad. \nIt runs from the Willamette Valley all the way down to Coos Bay, \nOregon, and back up to Coquille. It covers about 150 miles. It was the \nonly rail to the coast and to a major port in Oregon, the Port of Coos \nBay, North Bend.\n  They managed to get their equipment back, but they stranded railcars \nfull of lumber and other goods by saying: ``Sorry, it is done. We are \ndone.'' They didn't notify anybody. No proper procedures were filed. \n``We are abandoning the line, and we are going to rip it up, and we are \ngoing to sell the rails to the Chinese for scrap.''\n\n  Well, that didn't come to pass. I got together with the then-Governor \nand we brought some legal clout to the table. We partnered with the \nPort of Coos Bay, North Bend, and said what if we can get Federal and \nState money and buy this railroad? The hedge fund said they weren't \ninterested. They thought they could make more money by ripping it up, \nselling the right-of-way, and selling the scrap steel to China.\n  So I went to the Surface Transportation Board. The Surface \nTransportation Board made the hedge fund sell the railroad as a \nrailroad. As decrepit as it was, it was an incredibly critical piece of \ninfrastructure.\n  I took one of those horrible earmarks that we don't do around here \nanymore that I had gotten to improve the rail bridge over the harbor \nand got that converted in a technical correction to money to help \npurchase the railroad from this rotten hedge fund. The State partnered. \nThe port became the operator.\n  Last year, the Coos Bay Rail Link got the Short Line Operator of the \nYear award. It is providing a tremendous economic benefit and future \nfor the south coast of my district. And absent the regulators--we all \nwant to carry on about how bad regulators are, but when you have \nabusers out there like hedge funds that buy up critical infrastructure \nand couldn't give a damn about them--we need people like the Surface \nTransportation Board to preserve critical assets for our communities.\n  So I am thrilled to be here today to reauthorize, for the first time, \nthe Surface Transportation Board, streamline them, and enhance their \ncapabilities so that in the future, other aggrieved communities or \nbusiness sectors can go to the STB and get a quick judgment when they \nneed and deserve it.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Hunter) and the gentleman from California (Mr. \nGaramendi) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on H.R. 4188.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 4188, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015, is a product of \nbipartisan efforts to reauthorize the Coast Guard through fiscal year \n2017. The House passed similar legislation by a voice vote in May.\n  The bill makes several reforms to Coast Guard authorities, as well as \nlaws governing shipping and navigation. Specifically, the bill supports \nCoast Guard servicemembers, improves Coast Guard mission effectiveness, \nenhances oversight of the Coast Guard programs, encourages job growth \nin the maritime sector by cutting regulatory burdens on job creators, \nstrengthens maritime drug enforcement laws, and increases coordination \nwith partner nations, further strengthening port security. It does all \nthis in a way that allows this to be brought under suspension in a \nbipartisan way.\n  I want to commend Ranking Members DeFazio and Garamendi for their \nefforts in getting us to this point and, of course, the leadership of \nChairman Shuster.\n  I also want to thank the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard for \nthe tremendous job they do for our Nation. Coast Guard servicemembers \nplace their lives at risk on a daily basis to save those in danger, \nensure the safety and security of our ports and waterways, and protect \nour environmental resources.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  They do all this on aging, obsolete cutters, and aircraft, some of \nwhich were first commissioned in World War II.\n  Passing H.R. 4188 will help rebuild and strengthen the Coast Guard. \nIt will also demonstrate the strong support Congress has for the men \nand women of the Coast Guard and the deep appreciation we have for the \nsacrifices that they make for our Nation.\n  I urge all Members to support H.R. 4188.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, \n           and Technology,\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2015.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 4188, the \n     ``Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015,'' which was \n     introduced on December 8, 2015.\n       H.R. 4188 contains provisions within the Committee on \n     Science, Space, and Technology's rule X jurisdiction. As a \n     result of your having consulted with the Committee and in \n     order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the \n     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forgo action \n     on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our mutual \n     understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and \n     Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or \n     to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters \n     contained in the bill or similar legislation.\n       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding, and would request that you include a copy \n     of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record \n     during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in \n     advance for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of \n           Representatives,\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2015.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith\n     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \n         Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 4188, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015. I \n     appreciate your cooperation in expediting the consideration \n     of this legislation on the House floor.\n       As you know, the Parliamentarians were not able to render \n     an official decision as to the jurisdictional claim the \n     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology may have had. I \n     agree that the absence of a decision on this bill will not \n     prejudice any claim the Committee on Science, Space, and \n     Technology may have had or may have to this or similar \n     legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference \n     on the bill be necessary, I would support your effort to seek \n     appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any \n     House-Senate conference involving provisions in this \n     legislation on which the Committee on Science, Space, and \n     Technology has a valid jurisdictional claim.\n       I will include our letters on H.R. 4188 in the \n     Congressional Record during House floor consideration of the \n     bill. Again, I appreciate your cooperation regarding this \n     legislation, and I look forward to working with the Committee \n     on Science, Space, and Technology as the bill moves through \n     the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Shuster,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n\n[[Page H9240]]\n\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I am pleased to be here again at the end of another year to rise and \njoin Chairman Hunter, for whom I have great respect. We have been able \nto get some stuff done.\n  I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) for bringing this \nbill to the floor today to authorize the funding of the United States \nCoast Guard and to advance new policy initiatives to strengthen the \nprospects for the U.S. flag and U.S. maritime industry.\n  H.R. 4188, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2015, is carefully \ncrafted bipartisan legislation developed over the course of several \nmonths of negotiation within this House and with that other body. It is \ndeserving of robust support from Members of both sides of the aisle. I \nurge its quick passage by the House today.\n  I want to thank Chairman Hunter for all the leadership and the \ncooperative spirit in working with me and our other Democratic Members. \nHe addressed our concerns. They were handled and taken care of in the \nbill.\n  The willingness of Chairman Hunter and his outstanding staff and \nmembers of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee to \ncollaborate and work through the several nettlesome issues is very, \nvery much appreciated.\n  That is not to say this bill does not contain some items which I \nmight have some lingering concerns about, but they are few. As is the \ncase with every piece of legislation I don't personally draft all by \nmyself, this bill has those minor issues.\n  I am sure, if the chairman were to draft it all by himself, it would \nbe perfect, also. But we did it together, and it came out quite well.\n  I am extremely pleased that this legislation would provide stable and \nsufficient authorized funding levels for the Coast Guard for the next 2 \nyears. The importance of budget stability cannot be overstated. The \nCoast Guard is pressed daily to meet the demands of its 11 statutory \nmissions.\n  The last thing the Coast Guard needs is to face recurrent budget \nuncertainties, a circumstance which would leave the service's \nleadership unable to know exactly what resources and capabilities they \nhave available to address port and harbor security, illegal drug \ninterdiction, search and rescue, and law enforcement actions, along \nwith many other important activities.\n  I am also pleased this legislation continues to move the ball down \nthe field in the effort to strengthen and recapitalize a new fleet of \nPolar-class heavy icebreakers for the Coast Guard, and a cheer goes up \nbetween the chairman and myself if we can get that done.\n  It is clear that we are at the advent of Arctic operations for the \nCoast Guard, and it is vital that the service has the icebreaking \ncapabilities it will need to operate safely and effectively in this \nvery unforgiving maritime environment.\n  The bill will advance the completion of the materiel assessment of \nthe Polar Sea to determine, finally, if this heavy icebreaker can be \nreturned to service.\n  Additionally, this legislation authorized funding to allow the Coast \nGuard to maintain progress in developing requirements and preliminary \ndesign for a new heavy icebreaker. So we will figure out, hopefully, \nthis next year which way we will go.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation includes language that will \ncontinue to preserve the remaining LORAN-C infrastructure until such \ntime as the administration makes a final decision on whether or not to \nbuild out an enhanced LORAN or e-LORAN infrastructure to provide a \nreliable, land-based, low-frequency backup navigation timing signal to \nback up GPS, the Global Positioning System.\n  For several years, we have known that the relatively weak, high-\nfrequency GPS signal is fairly easy to corrupt, to degrade, or \naltogether disrupt, stop.\n  For this reason, the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, has called GPS \na potential single source of failure for important national defense \nassets. It is also a major liability across 16 sectors of critical \ninfrastructure.\n  If Russia, China, and the EU have land-based GPS backup systems, the \nquestion is: Why does the United States not have one?\n  This administration needs to make a decision now. At least language \nin this legislation ensures that we will have available the option of \nre-purposing what remains of the LORAN-C infrastructure for an e-LORAN \nsystem of the future.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I have already said it twice. I will say it \na third time. To Chairman Hunter and his staff, we like working with \nyou and we like you, too.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I enjoy working with the gentleman from \nCalifornia as well. It is a strange situation when we actually get \nstuff done. It is a California thing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California \n(Mr. Hunter), the chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime \nTransportation Subcommittee, for yielding me time. I also want to thank \nboth him and the Transportation Committee chairman himself, Bill \nShuster, for their work on this legislation.\n  This bill ensures the safety and security of our maritime borders and \nmaritime interests around the globe.\n  The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology shares jurisdiction \nwith the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee over important \nresearch and development programs carried out by the Coast Guard.\n  These programs improve search and rescue, navigation, marine safety, \nmarine environmental protection enforcement of laws and treaties, ice \noperations, oceanographic research, and defense readiness.\n  The bill also authorizes funding to help acquire a new Polar \nicebreaker and requires a study of alternatives for conducting \nicebreaking operations.\n\n  The Coast Guard's icebreakers are critical to the United States \nmissions in the polar regions, which include important research \nsupported by the National Science Foundation.\n  I look forward to the results of the study this bill calls for on \ncost-effective alternatives for icebreaking. This will help us ensure \ntaxpayer dollars are spent wisely and efficiently.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Hunter and Chairman Shuster for taking the \ninitiative with this critical legislation.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume, as \nlong as it is less than 3 minutes, to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. \nDeFazio), the ranking member of the committee.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I want to congratulate Chairman Hunter, Ranking Member Garamendi, and \ntalk just briefly about how important this legislation is.\n  The Coast Guard, first off, is now going to get 2 years of budget \ncertainty. That has been a real problem. It is pretty hard to run a \nmilitary organization that large on something that creates short-term \nuncertainty with your budget, particularly when they have to begin to \nplan for acquiring more major assets with larger ships.\n  In particular, we have just been talking about the icebreakers. I \nwent up to Seattle to visit the Polar Sea in its decrepitude. But the \ninteresting thing I found is that it is an absolutely unique hull \ndesign. The ice band contains materials that are no longer \nmanufactured. They are superior to current technologies.\n  There is substantial thought that this ship could be renovated using \nthe existing hull with a modern ship, modern engines, and electronics. \nThe ship has now been hulled. The hull is being evaluated, and we are \ngoing to do a cost-benefit analysis.\n  If we were to go down that path--and I believe it will prove to be \nthe best path--then that would provide additional spare parts for its \nsister ship, which is the only one we have got working, and then would \nset a template for rehabilitating that ship later.\n  The Russians have about two dozen icebreakers. Five, I believe, are \nnuclear powered.\n  The Chinese are building two large icebreakers. The United States of \nAmerica is down to one 45-year-old heavy icebreaker, which has an \nAntarctic mission, which means, for the\n\n[[Page H9241]]\n\nnext 6 months after it comes back, it is in dry dock and being \nrepaired.\n  We do not have any longer the capability of deploying north and south \nwith heavy icebreakers, despite the fact that the Northwest Passage \nlong dreamed of is about to open.\n  So for the United States of America maritime power to not have at \nleast two heavy icebreakers, if not a half a dozen, is absolutely \nabsurd, penny-wise, pound-foolish stupidity, on the part of former \nCongresses. I am glad that this Congress has seen the light and we are \nbeginning to move forward to re-institute that program.\n  The gentleman from California has been particularly persistent and \noutspoken about the LORAN-C system. I believe it is absolutely critical \nthat we maintain this infrastructure until we know what alternatives we \nare going to have. I think it is a critical national security asset.\n  And then, finally, to the more everyday national security-oriented \nduties of the Coast Guard in this bill, there is a particular provision \nthat is incredibly important to the State of Oregon and the State of \nSouth Carolina and to hundreds of people who make their living on the \nocean out of those two ports.\n  The Port of Newport, mid-coast Oregon, has an air rescue facility. \nThey do half the rescues in the mid-coast. Oregon has extremely cold \nwater year-round. We have some of the roughest bar entrances in the \nUnited States, and rescue time is critical in terms of saving lives.\n  The Coast Guard has been underfunded by Congress, and we are \nbeginning to rectify that. But in a budget-cutting mode last year, with \nno discussion with anyone, they proposed to close Newport and close \nCharleston.\n  Last year, in the omnibus bill at the end of the year, we put in \nplace a 1-year prohibition on the closure. This bill extends the \nstatutory prohibition on closing either of those two stations for 2 \nyears and then puts in place a very different and meaningful process, \nshould they ever wish to think about closing critical air rescue \nstations in the future.\n  First, it requires them to develop a program to manage their \nairframes and learn about and figure about how we are going to replace \nour helicopter fleets, which are about at the same point as these \nicebreakers. So they need that plan. They have to develop that.\n  Then, if they wish to close an individual station, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security will have to make a number of findings, that it \nwouldn't jeopardize life and safety and degrade rescue capabilities, a \npretty long list.\n  Then, if the Secretary makes that determination, the Secretary would \nhave to go forward in a public process to take input from those \ncommunities.\n  Then, if the Secretary further decided, after going through that, \nthat this was necessary and prudent and wouldn't jeopardize lives and \nsafety at sea, that future Secretary would have to submit the proposal \nto the Congress.\n  So we have effectively safeguarded the Newport and the Charleston \nstations in this legislation, and I believe we have safeguarded them \nfor all time.\n  I believe, also, Congress should give the Coast Guard adequate \nfunding so they can replenish and rebuild their air fleet and they \ndon't have to struggle and close stations that they know could \npotentially lead to loss of life.\n  So there are many, many things to recommend in this legislation. I \nwould expect Congress to nearly, if not totally, unanimously improve it \non this side. And then, hopefully, we can get the Senate to finally act \nbecause we need this done by January 1.\n\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Brown).\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and \nranking member for their work in moving the Coast Guard bill forward.\n  Transportation is one of the most bipartisan bills in this Congress. \nI am just so proud that we are really moving this Congress forward and \nputting the American people back to work.\n  The Coast Guard personnel serve this country and do a wonderful job, \nand I truly appreciate the hard work and dedication of these fine \nservicemembers.\n  The Coast Guard has been protecting our shores for more than 200 \nyears and has done an outstanding job. The Coast Guard was the first \nagency to react to the terrorist attacks on September 11 and provide \ncritical assistance during the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. This \nbill provides the resources and policy provisions that the Coast Guard \nneeds to continue their critical mission.\n  Assisting migrants and stopping drug shipments at sea, search-and-\nrescue missions, monitoring our ports, and protecting our homeland are \njust a few of the vital services that the Coast Guard provides, all of \nwhich is critical to my home State of Florida, where 14 deepwater ports \nand 1,200 miles of coastline are the gateway to America.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  This legislation also includes important provisions I have long \nchampioned that bring maritime laws into the modern era and recognize \nthe positive changes that have taken place in employment rights.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the men and women serving the \nCoast Guard for their hard work and their vigilance in protecting our \ncountry. This is a good bill, and it will allow the Coast Guard to \ncontinue protecting our Nation.\n  I strongly encourage its passing in both the House and the Senate and \nfor the President to sign it into law.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time \nremains.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California (Mr. \nGaramendi) has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Courtney), my colleague.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, as a co-chairman of the House Coast Guard \nCaucus and the Representative from southeastern Connecticut with a deep \nconnection to the Coast Guard, I rise in strong support of the Coast \nGuard authorization bill and the hard work of Chairman Hunter and \nRanking Member Garamendi.\n  Every single day, the men and women of our Coast Guard are operating \naround the country and around the world to enforce our laws and protect \nour country. This bill provides them the tools and support they need to \ndo this important work.\n  In particular, I want to highlight a specific provision in this bill, \nsection 219, that I was pleased to work with my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Blumenthal, and committee staff to bolster the \nNational Coast Guard Museum.\n  Despite a history that reaches back to the founding of our Nation, \nthe Coast Guard is the only armed service without a national museum to \nhighlight its heritage. Indeed, the Coast Guard this year is \ncelebrating its 225th anniversary, and it is actually older than the \nU.S. Navy. Thankfully, efforts are underway to change this.\n  The nonprofit National Coast Guard Museum Association is building \nnational support and funding for a new museum in New London, \nConnecticut. When completed, Mr. Speaker, this facility will be a \ntribute to all who have served and those who serve today in the Coast \nGuard, and I am proud to support their efforts.\n  Section 219 ensures that the Coast Guard can provide support to \npreserve and display its historical artifacts that will be a key part \nof the museum. This language opens the vault of the Coast Guard's rich \ntreasure of maritime artifacts from America's oldest maritime fleet to \nbe displayed for learning and understanding by the American public and \nthe world.\n  This is a huge boost to the effort to create a long-overdue museum \nand sends a powerful signal that this effort has the backing of \nCongress, the Federal Government, and the Coast Guard.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Commandant Admiral Zukunft; former \nCommandant Papp, who is his predecessor; Joann Burdian; Brittany \nPanetta; and Kent Reinhold in the Coast Guard legislative office for \nthe work that they have done with my office on this and other critical \nCoast Guard issues and, above all else, for their service to our \nNation.\n  I congratulate Chairman Hunter and Ranking Member Garamendi for their \nstrong advocacy for our Coast Guard and our Nation's maritime industry.\n\n[[Page H9242]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. Speaker, to my colleague Mr. Hunter and those who have assisted \nin the drafting of the bill, particularly our staff, I want to thank \nyou for making all of this possible.\n  This bill, which does extend the authorization for the Coast Guard, \nalso provides very, very important elements, most of which you have \nheard here today. I would urge its passing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Garamendi and all the \nstaff who worked so hard on this, and, again, the ranking member of the \nfull committee, Mr. DeFazio, and Chairman Shuster for their help, \nleadership, and support on this.\n  Explanation of Sec. 310. Atlantic Coast Port Access Route Study. This \nsection would require the Coast Guard to complete its on-going Atlantic \nCoast Port Access Route Study (PARS) by April 2016. This provision was \nincluded in H.R. 1987 because the House was concerned about the impacts \non navigation safety from the construction of certain offshore \nrenewable energy projects. The Study will assist the federal \ngovernment, as well as stakeholders, to understand potential impacts \nand whether the siting of these projects could pose hazards to safe \nnavigation, especially projects built in or near vessel traffic routes.\n  The Coast Guard's Atlantic Coast PARS working group has developed \nstandards and a methodology for assessing potential impacts on \nnavigation safety including high, medium and low or minimal impacts. \nThe purpose of the study and the reason for developing standards and \nmethodologies is to assist in future determinations of waterway \nsuitability for proposed development projects.\n  When the Atlantic Coast PARS began, it excluded the waters in and \naround Nantucket Sound. These waters are heavily traveled by commercial \nvessels, fishing and recreational vessels as well as passenger and \nfreight ferries. Because of increased vessel traffic and the potential \nimpacts to navigation from any future development, this section would \ndirect the Coast Guard to complete a separate port access route study \nof Nantucket Sound using the new standards and methodologies developed \nby the Coast Guard's working group. The Atlantic Coast PARS will help \nthe Coast Guard determine whether they should revise current \nregulations to improve navigation safety by establishing safety \nfairways, traffic separation zones or new vessel routing. The Nantucket \nSound PARS is intended to guide decision-makers to ensure that any \nfuture development in Nantucket Sound will have minimal impact and low \nrisk to navigational safety. This section would require the completion \nof the Nantucket Sound PARS by December\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 4188.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4188.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9242-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 3094\n\n  Mr. MICA.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, the Department of \nHomeland Security CBRNE Defense Act of 2015.\n  The threat from weapons of mass destruction is real and growing. We \nhave seen groups like ISIS make makeshift chemical weapons; and on the \nbattlefield last summer, a laptop reportedly retrieved from an ISIS \nhideout in Syria contained plans for weaponizing bubonic plague and \ndocuments discussing advantages of using biological weapons. They have \nalso boasted about plans to smuggle radiological material into the \nUnited States. With recent FBI stings in places like Moldova, we know \nthat there are sellers ready to supply the ingredients for these tools \nof terror, which brings us to the purpose of this legislation before us \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security must play a leading \nrole in defending our homeland from CBRNE threats. Departments and \nagencies across the United States Government have centralized their \nweapons of mass destruction programs to provide clear focal points for \ndealing with this threat. Within the Department of Homeland Security, \nhowever, leadership, expertise, personnel, and resources related to \nchemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive threats are \ndisbursed across numerous organizations within DHS headquarters. By \nconsolidating offices within the DHS headquarters with responsibility \nfor CBRNE, H.R. 3875 will ensure better coordination within the \nDepartment and interagency.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are living in dangerous times, and we must ensure the \nFederal Government is prepared to address these threats. This bill will \nensure that the Department of Homeland Security is able to do so.\n  Before I close, I would like to thank Chairmen Shuster and Smith for \ntheir cooperation in moving this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of \n           Representatives,\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 2015.\n     Hon.

McCaul,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Ford House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 3875, the \n     ``Department of Homeland Security CBRNE Defense Act of \n     2015''. This legislation includes matters that I believe fall \n     within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure.\n       In order to expedite Floor consideration of H.R. 3875, the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to \n     forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on \n     our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the \n     bill would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the \n     appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional \n     claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or \n     similar legislation that fall within the Committee's rule X \n     jurisdiction.\n       I request that you please place a copy of this letter and \n     your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into \n     the Congressional Record.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Homeland Security,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 2015.\n     Hon.

I appreciate your cooperation in allowing the bill \n     to move expeditiously under suspension of the House Rules on \n     December 8, 2015.

McCaul,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H9247]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3875, the Department of \nHomeland Security CBRNE Defense Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, we were here 2 days ago, and I said that the American \npeople are looking for the homeland to be safe. As I stand here today \nin the backdrop of a recent classified briefing for many Members, I \nagain say that the issue of homeland security is not a partisan issue.\n  I am very grateful to Mr. McCaul and Mr. Thompson of Mississippi, the \nranking member, for their bipartisanship and the bipartisanship of this \ncommittee. Working alongside the other jurisdictional committees--that \nincludes my other committee, Judiciary, that has, as their ranking \nmember, Mr. Conyers, and chairman, Mr. Goodlatte, and many other \ncommittees--our commitment should be to secure the American people.\n  So, in this instance, pursuant to the fiscal year 2013 Consolidated \nand Further Continuing Appropriations Act, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity was directed to evaluate its activities related to preventing \nand responding to threats posed by chemical, biological, radiological, \nnuclear, and explosive, CBRNE, weapons and to determine whether there \nwere ways to improve coordination of those activities.\n  Nearly 2 years later, DHS submitted its report to Congress and \nrequested that certain activities and offices within the Department be \nconsolidated to create a center of gravity for the DHS CBRNE \nactivities.\n  H.R. 3875 seeks to implement much of the Department's proposal. In \nparticular, the bill would bring the Office of Health Affairs, the \nDomestic Nuclear Detection Office, the Office of Bombing Prevention, \nthe chemical and biological risk assessment activities Science and \nTechnology Directorate, and staff from the Office of Policy and Office \nof Coordination Operations together in a single office, headed by a new \nassistant secretary.\n  I distinctly remember being in some of the meetings and hearings that \ndrew about some of these coordinated activities, and I believe the new \nassistant secretary will be a very effective tool for making America \nsafer.\n  During committee consideration of the measure, the committee accepted \nan amendment authored by Ranking Member Thompson to protect the \nmissions of the offices brought together and prevent some of the \ndisruption that could be caused by this kind of reorganization.\n  The amendment acknowledges that this reorganization will likely \nnecessitate new expenditures. For instance, DHS may need to utilize \nretention bonuses to retain highly skilled, much-sought-after nuclear \nand biodefense experts who otherwise would leave DHS because of their \nlowered position and reduced prospects for advancement. I believe we \nshould do that.\n  Ranking Member Thompson's amendment also protects the role of the \nChief Medical Officer as a leader within the Department on public \nhealth and medical issues by preserving the CMO's direct line to the \nSecretary.\n  The amendment allows for the establishment of a health division \nwithin the new office which could serve as a base of operations for the \nChief Medical Officer's public health activities.\n  I might comment very briefly further on this. We have found that we \nlive in a situation where, whether it is a natural disaster, but in \nthis instance a terrorist situation that comes about, there is \ncertainly major need for coordinated health activities that a person \nbriefed, informed, and trained under DHS, with the expertise, can give \nto local entities and States.\n  For example, a hospital in my community, St. Joseph Medical Center, \nis the only hospital in a very intense downtown urban center. We would \nbe interested in making sure that all of those health systems work.\n  As a nation, we cannot afford to have focus and attention toward the \nCBRNE mission diminished as a result of the unavoidable staff upheaval \nand infighting associated within any organization of this order.\n  Accordingly, I am pleased that H.R. 3875, as amended, will help \nbolster the Department's ability to carry out this reorganization \nwithout diminishing its ability to continue to carry out its CBRNE \nmission.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of H.R. 3875, the \n``Department of Homeland Security CBRNE Defense Act of 2015.''\n  As a Senior Member of the Homeland Security Committee, I served as \nRanking Member of the Border and Maritime Subcommittee during the last \nCongress and in a previous Congress chaired the Subcommittee on \nTransportation Security.\n  It is important that the House take up the issue of how the WMD \nprograms within the Department of Homeland Security are managed, which \nis why I am an original sponsor of the bill.\n  Events over the last Congress make it clear that Congress should be \neven more vigilant in providing for the protection of the United \nStates.\n  Congress should be mindful of the: United States' leadership in the \neffort to forge an enforceable and verifiable nuclear agreement with \nIran; deadliness of chemical weapons when they were used during the \nSyrian conflict against unarmed men, women, and children; and arrival \nof Ebola in Dallas, Texas and the cases that were treated around the \nnation.\n  The bill authorizes an Office of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, \nNuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) Defense within the Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS).\n  Departments and agencies across the U.S. government have centralized \ntheir weapons of mass destruction (WMD) defense programs to provide \nclear focal points for dealing with this threat.\n  However, DHS responsibilities in the chemical, biological, \nradiological, nuclear, and explosives areas continue to be spread \nacross many offices in the Department with varying authorities and \nfunctions, affecting strategic direction as well as interdepartmental \nand interagency coordination.\n  This bill will bring DHS into line with the Defense Department, State \nDepartment, CIA, and FBI, which each have a lead office or bureau \ncharged with defending America against chemical, biological, \nradiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) threats.\n  This is the result of many years of oversight by the Committee on \nHomeland Security on the Department's management of CBRNE activities.\n  The bill authorizes a CBRNE Office, led by a Presidentially-appointed \nAssistant Secretary.\n  The bill directs the Secretary to include within the new CBRNE \nOffice: the Office of Health Affairs; the Domestic Nuclear Detection \nOffice; risk assessment activities and personnel of the Science and \nTechnology Directorate; CBRNE activities and personnel of the Office of \nPolicy and Operations Coordination and Planning; and the Office for \nBombing Prevention.\n  The bill provides specific responsibilities of the Assistant \nSecretary and needed structure for the management of CBRNE activities.\n  DHS provided its proposal for consolidation of CBRNE activities to \nthe Committee in June.\n  The Subcommittees on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and \nCommunications; and Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and \nSecurity Technologies held a hearing in July on the Department's \nproposal.\n  I urge my colleagues on in the House to join me in supporting this \nimportant step forward.\n  Our work is not yet done, but we are creating the groundwork for a \nsafer and more resilient WMD deterrent, detection, and remediation \nfederal homeland effort.\n  I appreciate the Homeland Security Committee's interest in my bill \nH.R. 85, Terrorism Prevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection \nAct.\n  Like Chairman McCaul, and Ranking Member Thompson, I regard securing \nour nation's critical infrastructure from terrorist threats as a top \nnational and homeland security priority.\n  I share the understanding regarding how important it is to draft \nlegislation that addresses the cyber threat posed by computer viruses \nand worms designed to destroy or cripple industrial control systems \nthat sustain critical infrastructure is a serious challenge.\n\n\n                        recommendation: support\n\n  Fixing a Broken Bureaucracy--H.R. 3875 increases transparency and \naccountability at DHS by bringing the Department's fragmented WMD \ndefense programs under one roof and putting a lead official in charge.\n  Most security agencies (the Defense Department, State Department, \nCIA, and FBI) have a lead office or bureau charged with using their \nresources to defend America against chemical, biological, radiological, \nnuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) threats.\n  But DHS does not--its WMD defense programs are scattered across \nmultiple offices, a fractured approach that weakens our ability to \nconfront these dangers on the frontlines.\n  The disorganization creates inefficiency, generates confusion about \nwho is in charge at DHS, makes interagency collaboration more \ndifficult, and drives away top talent.\n  The CBRNE Defense Act combines six separate offices and programs into \none central CBRNE Office at DHS headquarters, led by a senior official \nwho reports directly to the Secretary.\n  Elevating a Critical Mission--H.R. 3875 creates a stronger, unified \noffice equipped to keep the nation safe from WMD threats, and\n\n[[Page H9248]]\n\nit ensures these issues will always stay on the Department's ``front \nburner.''\n  America faces persistent risk from terrorists and rogue states that \nwant to threaten our people with weapons of mass destruction.\n  But under the current structure at DHS, important WMD defense efforts \ncan get lost in the bureaucratic noise.\n  By consolidating these programs, the legislation will keep WMD \nchallenges on the radar of top officials.\n  It will also allow DHS to conduct its CBRNE activities more \nstrategically and effectively.\n  Streamlining Government--H.R. 3875 helps prevent taxpayer dollars \nfrom being wasted--and aims to reduce overlap and duplication wherever \npossible.\n  Hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent on failed \nCBRNE programs at DHS that were ill-planned and lacked effective \noversight and management.\n  This legislation ensures DHS programs for combating WMD threats will \nbe better coordinated and more closely monitored at the highest levels \nof the Department.\n  The bill simplifies the Secretary's ability to oversee the \nDepartment's WMD defense activities by consolidating standalone offices \nand streamlining the reporting structure.\n  I also creates the possibility of long-term savings by allowing the \nmerged offices to combine their administrative functions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. If the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas has no further speakers, I am prepared to close once the \ngentlewoman does.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for his \nleadership. I do not have any further speakers, but I would like to \nclose and thank the committee as well for considering a bill that is \nnow being reviewed--I want to thank the committee--H.R. 85, Terrorism \nPrevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, which I hope \ncontributes to all of our discussions about securing America.\n  This bill, Mr. Speaker, in particular, H.R. 3875, would consolidate \nimportant CBRNE activities within the Department of Homeland Security. \nI am hopeful that this reorganization will improve DHS' ability to \ncarry out its mission in this space.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, the diversity in the terrorist landscape is \nunprecedented. There are actors with aspirations to hit Western targets \nwith deadly conventional weapons. There are also actors that are \nactively seeking to secure radiological and other nonconventional \nweaponry to exact maximum death, destruction, and chaos.\n  The Department of Homeland Security, first established after 9/11, \nhas been designated and dictated to by the American people to keep them \nsafe. It has an important role to play to address these threats. It is \nmy great hope that this reorganization will help DHS take its CBRNE \nefforts to the next level.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me first thank my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, Ms. Jackson Lee and Mr. Thompson of Mississippi, for their \ncoordination on this bill. I think this committee, probably more than \nany other one, has operated in a very bipartisan fashion. I am proud of \nthat, as a chairman. I think in matters of national security, that is \nhow we should operate, to reach across the aisle to get good things \ndone for the American people to make them safer. So let me just say \nthank you for that.\n  I don't have to remind you, Mr. Speaker, the threats are real out \nthere. We got a classified briefing on San Bernardino, the pipe bombs \nthat were manufactured. In Dabiq Magazine, ISIS' latest publication, \nthey discuss the ease with which to move a nuclear device through \ntransnational criminal organizations into the Western Hemisphere: \nthrough Mexico and across our southwest border. That is precisely the \nkind of threat that this bill is designed to stop.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3875, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9248-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9248-H9255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1545\n     DHS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY REFORM AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3578, the DHS Science and Technology Reform and \nImprovement Act of 2015, makes targeted adjustments and strategic \nimprovements to the ways in which the Department of Homeland Security's \nScience and Technology Directorate, or DHS S, carries out its \nresponsibility to conduct research and development. These strategic \nimprovements will strengthen the Directorate and address some of its \nwell-documented challenges.\n  DHS S monitors the Nation's evolving threats and makes use of \ntechnological advancements to develop and deliver solutions to meet the \ncritical needs of the DHS components.\n  The legislation we are considering today provides a clear mission \nstatement for the Directorate and it codifies S's portfolio review \nprocess. This process engages key leadership and stakeholders to ensure \nthat research and development meets the Directorate and Department \ngoals.\n  Amendments considered at both the subcommittee and full committee \nfurther strengthen this legislation, including Mr. Richmond's amendment \nto codify integrated product teams, a mechanism that will support the \nDirectorate's ability to identify, coordinate, and align research and \ndevelopment efforts with departmental missions.\n  H.R. 3578 also ensures that the Directorate identifies technical \ncapability requirements and creates solutions with researchers and the \nprivate sector. It also bolsters S's role as coordinator of research \nand development across the Department.\n  This bill requires additional transparency by requiring S to link \nits budget with mission areas and programs.\n  Cybersecurity research and development is essential to support DHS' \nefforts to secure the dot-gov domain. The seriousness of this mission \nreceived heightened awareness after the OPM breach compromised the \nhighly sensitive and personal information of over 20 million Americans.\n  H.R. 3578 bolsters S's cybersecurity research and development by \nensuring sector specific agencies for critical infrastructure are \nincluded in the coordination of cybersecurity research and development \nand by codifying the Transition to Practice program to support the \nlifecycle of cyber projects, including research, development, testing, \nevaluation, and transition.\n  S is the primary research arm of the Department, managing the basic \nand applied research and development of science and technology for DHS' \noperational components. S's work includes supporting research and \ndevelopment for technologies to benefit first responders, the Nation's \nborder and maritime security, cybersecurity, and chemical and \nbiological defenses.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman \nSmith, of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for his support \nin moving this legislation forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation would strengthen the important role and \nwork of the Directorate to meet both the scientific and technological \nsecurity needs of our Nation.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, \n           and Technology,\n                                 Washington, DC, December 4, 2015.\n     Hon. Michael McCaul,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 3578, the \n     ``DHS Science and Technology Reform and Improvement Act of \n     2015,'' which your Committee ordered reported on September \n     30, 2015.\n       H.R. 3578 contains provisions within the Committee on \n     Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. \n     However, in consideration of your request to expedite this \n     bill for floor consideration, the Committee on Science, \n     Space, and Technology will forego formal consideration of \n     H.R. 3578. This is being done on the basis of our mutual \n     understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and \n     Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or \n     to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters \n     contained in the bill or similar legislation.\n       I appreciate that the Committee on Homeland Security has \n     consulted with the Committee on Science, Space, and \n     Technology and the two Committees have reached agreement on \n     the final text of H.R. 3578. I understand you acknowledge the \n     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's jurisdiction \n     over the legislation and that the Committee on Homeland \n     Security agrees to work with the Committee on Science, Space, \n     and Technology to develop and enact an additional homeland \n     security research and development measure early in 2016.\n       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding and would request that you include a copy \n     of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record \n     during the floor consideration of this bill.

Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \n         Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 3578, the ``DHS Science and Technology Reform and \n     Improvement Act of 2015.'' I acknowledge that by forgoing \n     action on this legislation your Committee is not diminishing \n     or altering its jurisdiction.\n       I also concur with you that forgoing action on this bill \n     does not in any way prejudice the Committee on Science, \n     Space, and Technology with respect to its jurisdictional \n     prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the \n     future. Furthermore, I would support your effort to seek \n     appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any \n     House-Senate conference involving this or similar \n     legislation.\n       In addition, I agree that the Committee on Homeland \n     Security will continue to work with the Committee on Science, \n     Space, and Technology to develop additional legislation \n     addressing homeland security research and development in \n     early 2016.\n       I will include copies of this exchange in the Congressional \n     Record during consideration of this measure on the House \n     floor. I appreciate your cooperation regarding HR. 3578, and \n     I look forward to working with the Committee on Science, \n     Space, and Technology as the bill moves through the \n     legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Michael T. McCaul,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n                                   Committee on Homeland Security.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise to support H.R. 3578, the Department of Homeland Security \nScience and Technology Reform and Improvement Act of 2015.\n  First, I want to say to the gentleman from Texas, thank you so very \nmuch for your leadership. Again, we have a great opportunity working \ntogether, along with your ranking member, Mr. Richmond, and the \nchairman of the full committee, Mr. McCaul, and, as well, Mr. Thompson. \nI believe we are continuously building blocks of security for the \nAmerican people.\n  Research and development is a key component of the Department of \nHomeland Security's mission to make America more secure and better able \nto prevent, respond to, and recover from natural disasters and \nterrorist acts.\n  In the constantly evolving threat landscape, technology-based force \nmultipliers are essential for managing our borders, safeguarding \ncyberspace, and making sure we are resilient in the face of disasters.\n  H.R. 3578 will improve the way the Science and Technology Directorate \nserves its customers within the Department in the first responder \ncommunity in three ways.\n  Before I say that, let me indicate to the chairman, we understand \nthat we are looking at generational gaps. Terrorists are young. People \nwho wish to undermine the landscape of cybersecurity can use, if I \nmight say, these young minds, these technocrats, to do things that we \nmay have never heard of, so our system must be resilient.\n  First, this bill requires S to engage in strategic planning and \npriority-setting exercises that will assist Congress in measuring the \nmanagement effectiveness and utility of the research and technologies \nit funds. This kind of self-assessment will make S a more effective \npartner to its customers and will help make its program more efficient.\n  Second, H.R. 3578 directs S to evaluate its university programs and \ncollaborative agreements and assess its efforts to broaden outreach to \ndiverse institutions, which may have a unique expertise to add to S's \nongoing work.\n  Given the current fiscal challenges, it is critical that we maximize \nthe way we leverage the capabilities of knowledge-rich universities, \nand this provision will help S do just that. In fact, I believe that \nthe universities are our richest source of talent, and not only for the \nresearchers and the professors, but certainly the students who are \nyoung, who are there to do good, of whom we can utilize both their \ntalents, their approach, and their intellect.\n  Finally, the bill encourages carefully targeted venture capital \ninvestments in the homeland security enterprise that can accelerate \nproduct development and add mission critical capabilities quickly and \nefficiently.\n  These targeted investments will help put better technologies into the \nhands of DHS boots-on-the-ground State and local first responders soon.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3578 codifies existing practices at S that are \nworking and will make S a stronger, more reliable partner in the \nhomeland security mission.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this important bipartisan \nlegislation, and, as well, I continue to look forward to working with \nthis subcommittee, among others, to begin to look at the cyber space \nand the cybersecurity infrastructure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Smith), my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from \nTexas (Mr. Ratcliffe) for his work on this legislation, for his earlier \ngenerous comments, and for yielding me time as well. I also want to \nthank both him and the gentleman from Texas, Michael McCaul, the full \ncommittee chairman, for their work on this legislation.\n  The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology shares jurisdiction \nwith the Homeland Security Committee over the research and development \nprograms carried out by the Department of Homeland Security. In the \ncase of this bill, H.R. 3578, it is the R of the Department of \nHomeland Security Science and Technology Directorate, which was \nestablished by legislation that originated in the House Committee on \nScience, Space, and Technology.\n  The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, likewise, shares \njurisdiction of the bill we just considered, H.R. 3875. That bill will \nassess and plan DHS research and development of chemical, biological, \nradiological, nuclear, and explosives defenses.\n  Next year, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology expects to \ncontinue to advance science and technology efforts to counter terrorist \nthreats to the homeland.\n  In anticipation of today's legislation, our committee exercised its \njurisdiction by holding two hearings. In September of 2014, the \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology's Research and Technology \nSubcommittee held a joint DHS S Directorate oversight hearing with \nHomeland Security's Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and \nSecurity Technologies Subcommittee.\n  The hearing focused on a series of Government Accountability Office \nreviews that found serious problems with management and coordination of \nR within the Department of Homeland Security. This includes \nfragmented and overlapping R programs and millions of taxpayer \ndollars spent on duplicative R projects.\n  The GAO recommended that the S Directorate develop stricter \npolicies and guidance to help define, oversee, coordinate, and track \nR across the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology conducted a follow-up \noversight hearing on October 27 of this year. At that hearing, Under \nSecretary Brothers described the progress made in its implementation of \nthe GAO's recommendations and updated us on the S Directorate's \ninitiatives to help DHS meet the full spectrum of threats.\n  The legislation before the House today reflects the work of the \nmembers of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the \nCommittee on Homeland Security to help the S Directorate meet a broad \nrange of homeland security challenges by stretching the technological \nenvelope.\n  The bill establishes a clear mission for the Directorate, updates its \nresponsibilities, and requires strategy and R plans to prioritize \naddressing homeland threats. It also authorizes targeted cybersecurity \nR projects and creates new S integrated product teams to develop \ntechnological solutions to meet the Department's mission areas and \naddress threats to the homeland.\n  Last week's horrifying terrorist attack in San Bernardino, \nCalifornia, just days after a terrorist attack in Paris, reminds us \nthat this legislation is ultimately about defending the American people \nand our country from terrorists.\n  Again, I thank Chairman McCaul for taking the initiative with this \ncritical legislation, and I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nRatcliffe) as well.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H9255]]\n\n  In order to meet the needs of those on the front line of homeland \nsecurity activities from Customs and Border Protection and the \nTransportation Security to local first responders, the Science and \nTechnology Directorate must rapidly develop and deliver innovative \nsolutions that advance DHS' mission.\n  I am convinced that the whole matter of cyber technology are the new \nfrontier of terrorism and that this Department must be, as it has been, \nvery well prepared with human personnel being on the front lines of the \nfirst responders, and must give them extra tools through S to help to \nfurther the mission of the security of this Nation. It is a complex and \ndifficult mission.\n  H.R. 3578 puts S on a pathway to making smarter and quicker R \ninvestment in technology and tools that help our first responders do \ntheir jobs better and more effectively.\n  With that, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 3578, and I thank the \nproponent of this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for her support and leadership in connection \nwith this bill. I would also like to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking \nMember Thompson for their leadership in moving this important bill \nforward.\n  Mr. Speaker, threats in technologies are always changing. This bill \nwill help DHS S find strategic and focused technology options and \ninnovative solutions to address homeland security capability gaps and \nthreats to our homeland.\n  I, once again, urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3578, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3578, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9255-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9255-H9257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1600\n              STATE AND LOCAL CYBER PROTECTION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. HURD of Texas.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hurd) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n[[Page H9256]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The need to address cybersecurity at the State and local levels is of \nthe utmost importance. From our local DMV offices and courthouses to \nour critical infrastructure, the exploitable vulnerabilities and \npossible consequences are alarming.\n  Yet, in the cybersecurity realm, State and local governments often do \nnot have access to the technical capabilities and training that the \nFederal Government does.\n  My bill, H.R. 3869, the State and Local Cyber Protection Act, is a \ncritical step in the resolution of this problem.\n  In 2010, the National Governors Association released a statement on \nthe importance of cybersecurity in protecting the ability of Federal, \nState, and local governments to perform their vital functions.\n  They stated:\n  ``Due to the breadth and scope of the State role in entitlement \nservices, facilitating travel and commerce, regulatory oversight, \nlicensing and citizen services, states gather, process, store, and \nshare extensive amounts of personal information. From cradle to grave, \nthe states are the nexus of identity information for individuals. This \nmakes the states prime targets for external and internal cyber \nthreats.''\n  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility involving all levels of \ngovernment and the private sector. While much has been done over the \nlast several years to improve the Nation's cybersecurity, a number of \nchallenges remain. This bill would allow State and local governments \naccess to the assistance, training, and tools, voluntarily and upon \nrequest, that are required to secure our Nation's information systems \nat every level.\n  This bill instructs the National Cybersecurity and Communications \nIntegration Center, the NCCIC, at the Department of Homeland Security \nto coordinate with States and locals on securing their information \nsystems.\n  The NCCIC will do so by assisting in the identification of system \nvulnerabilities and possible solutions for State and local information \nsecurity systems.\n  They will be developing a Web portal to communicate available tools \nfor States and locals, providing technical training for State and local \ncybersecurity analysts, providing assistance and implementing \ncybersecurity tools upon request, providing privacy and civil liberties \ntraining, and informing States and locals on the current cybersecurity \nguidelines already developed at the Federal level.\n  Lastly, the State and Local Cyber Protection Act would require the \nNCCIC to seek feedback from State and local governments once the law is \nimplemented and voluntary assistance has begun in order to gauge the \neffectiveness of these efforts and to ensure that progress is being \nmade.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has a substantial responsibility \nto States and locals in the cyber realm as State and local systems host \na wide range of sensitive PII and critical infrastructure data, making \nthem especially attractive for cyberattacks. By reinforcing the \nrelationship between DHS and State and local governments, we are \nsupporting and urging for the continued development of cyber protection \nfor our State and local governments.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3869, the State and Local Cyber Protection \nAct of 2015.\n  Let me first of all thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership \nin working on this legislation, to again acknowledge our chairs--Mr. \nMcCaul and Mr. Thompson--and also to acknowledge Mr. Ratcliffe and Mr. \nRichmond for their leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, the threat of the cyber attack is growing, and the \ndamage caused by those attacks, whether it is the theft of personally \nidentifiable information or the disruption of operations, is becoming \nmore costly.\n  FEMA has identified cybersecurity as an area for national improvement \nin its National Preparedness Report every year since it was first \npublished in 2012. That finding is based, in large part, on State self-\nassessments reflecting a lack of confidence in cybersecurity \ncapabilities. The threat posed by criminal and terrorist hackers \ncontinues to evolve even as State and local governments work to gain a \nstronger footing in the cybersecurity mission area.\n  Let me say that this country continues to grow, continues to increase \nits population, and continues to become dependent on the cybersecurity \ninfrastructure. Helping to engage State and local entities by training \nis a crucial, crucial action, if I might applaud the gentleman, but \nalso say it is a very important mission for both the Homeland Security \nDepartment and the Committee on Homeland Security. The Department of \nHomeland Security has resources and capabilities that, when shared with \nState and local governments, can help them step up their games.\n  H.R. 3869, the State and Local Cyber Protection Act of 2015, would \ncodify ongoing efforts by instructing the National Cybersecurity and \nCommunications Integration Center, the NCCIC, and the Department of \nHomeland Security to coordinate with State and local governments and \nto, upon request, provide assistance to secure their information \nsystems.\n\n  Information systems run water entities in our communities. I remember \nvisiting one that was up on the Web, if you will, that could be altered \nby a cyber attack. This legislation would codify DHS' ongoing \ncoordination effort to give assurances to State and local governments \nthat DHS stands ready to partner with them to protect their network.\n  Under this bill, DHS is authorized to assist State and local \ngovernments to deploy technology capable of diagnosing and mitigating \nagainst cyber threats and vulnerabilities.\n  H.R. 3869 authorizes DHS to provide training to State and local \nentities regarding integrating policies to protect privacy and civil \nliberties into their cybersecurity efforts.\n  It is increasingly important that all levels of government be capable \nof identifying information system vulnerabilities and of protecting \nthem from unauthorized access, disclosure, and disruption of data.\n  I will say to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) that we have \nalways, as a committee, been reminded of privacy and civil liberties \nissues while also protecting the American people. To build that \ncapability, the Federal Government has a role to play in assisting \nState and local entities by providing both technical training on \ncybersecurity and guidance on potential privacy and civil liberties \nimplications.\n  Mr. Speaker, many stakeholders throughout the country have told us \nthis bill is a vital, much-needed step in advancing national \ncybersecurity capabilities.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3869.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3869, the State and Local Cyber \nProtection Act.\n  As a Senior Member of the Homeland Security Committee, and Ranking \nMember of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations I am well aware of the \nterrorism and criminal risks to our nation's critical infrastructure, \ncivilian and privacy computer networks.\n  For this reason, I introduced H.R. 85, the Terrorism Prevention and \nCritical Infrastructure Protection Act, which directs the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to work with critical infrastructure owners and \noperators and state, local, and territorial to take proactive steps to \naddress All Hazards that would impact: national security; economic \nstability; public health and safety; and/or any combination of these.\n  This nation is presented with new challenges in confronting threats \nto our national security, and cybersecurity.\n  Critical infrastructure remains an essential area that must receive \nthe needed attention to protect it against all threats and all-hazards.\n\n[[Page H9257]]\n\n  Post-9/11 established the need to anticipate unexpected threats from \na variety of sources. The nation must plan to be a step ahead of our \nenemies in order to effectively detect, deter, and defend against \nterrorist attacks in whatever form they may arise, including \ncyberattacks to our nation's critical infrastructure.\n  It is for these reasons that I proposed H.R. 85, the Terrorism \nPrevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2015. This \nbill should it become law would greatly assist in our nation's ability \nto protect critical infrastructure from the worse effects of cyber-\nattacks.\n  The nation must be adequately prepared to fight cyber terrorism just \nas vigorously as we combat other form of terrorism carried out through \nphysical violence. We can be prepared to meet and defeat cyber \nterrorism threats with legislative efforts like H.R. 85, which would \noffer tools to effectively address terrorist attacks against critical \ninfrastructure.\n  The Terrorism Prevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act \ndirects the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to:\n  (1) better engage critical infrastructure owners and operators as \nvolunteers for the purpose of coordination of communication among \nstate, local, tribal, and territorial entities for the purpose of \ntaking proactive steps to manage risk and strengthen the security and \nresilience of the nation's critical infrastructure against terrorist \nattacks;\n  (2) establish terrorism prevention policy to engage with \ninternational partners to strengthen the security and resilience of \ndomestic critical infrastructure and critical infrastructure located \noutside of the United States;\n  (3) make available research findings and guidance to federal civilian \nagencies for the identification, prioritization, assessment, \nremediation, and security of their internal critical infrastructure to \nassist in the prevention, mediation, and recovery from terrorism \nevents.\n  The bill sets forth the terrorism protection responsibilities of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security as it relates to the Department's \nresponsibility to protection and defends civilian agencies and private \nsector networks from cyber-attacks.\n  H.R. 85, Terrorism Prevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection \nAct also provides guidance to the Secretary of Homeland Security \nregarding actions to be taken to:\n  (1) facilitate the timely exchange of terrorism threat and \nvulnerability information as well as information that allows for the \ndevelopment of a situational awareness capability for federal civilian \nagencies during terrorist incidents;\n  (2) implement an integration and analysis function for critical \ninfrastructure that includes operational and strategic analysis on \nterrorism incidents, threats, and emerging risks; and\n  (3) support greater terrorism cyber security information sharing by \ncivilian federal agencies with the private sector that protects \nconstitutional privacy and civil liberties rights.\n  Finally the bill directs the National Research Council to evaluate \nhow well DHS is meeting the objectives of this Act.\n  I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their support \nand collaboration in working with me to improve the bill for \nconsideration by the Full Committee and ultimately the House of \nRepresentatives as we work to ensure safety, security, resiliency, \ntrustworthiness of vital critical infrastructure networks, while at the \nsame time ensuring that data used for this purpose does not undermine \nthe privacy and civil liberties of Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, \nso I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, I include for the Record an article dated October 19 from \nThe Hill newspaper on boosting power grid defenses against ISIS.\n\n                     [From The Hill, Oct. 19, 2015]\n\n      Jackson Lee Pushes To Boost Power-Grid Defenses Against ISIS\n\n                         (By Katie Bo Williams)\n\n       Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) on Friday called for \n     action on a bill bolstering power-grid cybersecurity after a \n     Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official said the \n     Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is trying to hack \n     American electrical power companies.\n       ``No solace should be taken in the fact that ISIS has been \n     unsuccessful,'' Jackson Lee said. ``ISIS need only be \n     successful once to have catastrophic impact on regional \n     electricity supply.''\n       Caitlin Durkovich, assistant secretary for infrastructure \n     protection at DHS, told energy firm executives at an industry \n     conference in Philadelphia last week that ISIS ``is beginning \n     to perpetrate cyberattacks.''\n       Law enforcement officials speaking at the same event \n     indicated that the group's efforts have so far been \n     unsuccessful, thanks in part to a Balkanized power grid and \n     an unsophisticated approach.\n       ``Strong intent. Thankfully, low capability,'' said John \n     Riggi, a section chief at the FBI's cyber division. ``But the \n     concern is that they'll buy that capability.''\n       Jackson Lee, a senior member of the House Homeland Security \n     Committee and ranking member on the Judiciary Committee's \n     Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \n     Investigations, in January introduced the Terrorism \n     Prevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.\n       The bill directs DHS to work with critical infrastructure \n     companies to boost their cyber defenses against terrorist \n     attacks, part of a swath of legislation that has attempted to \n     codify the agency's responsibilities in that area.\n       Late last year, the Senate passed its version of the House-\n     passed National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure \n     Protection Act.\n       The bill officially authorized an already-existing \n     cybersecurity information-sharing hub at DHS.\n       Although a deadly attack on power plants or the electric \n     grid--a ``cyber Pearl Harbor''--is still only a hypothetical, \n     experts warn critical infrastructure sites are increasingly \n     at risk, as electric grids get smarter.\n       National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers told \n     lawmakers last fall that China and ``one or two'' other \n     countries would be able to shut down portions of critical \n     U.S. infrastructure with a cyberattack. Researchers suspect \n     Iran to be on that list.\n       In August, DHS announced the creation of a new subcommittee \n     dedicated to preventing attacks on the power grid.\n       The new panel is tasked with identifying how well the \n     department's lifeline sectors are prepared to meet threats \n     and recover from a significant cyber event.\n       The committee will also provide recommendations for a more \n     unified approach to state and local cybersecurity.\n       ``There is a great deal that has been done and is being \n     done now to secure our networks,'' Homeland Security \n     Secretary Jeh Johnson told the House Judiciary Committee in \n     July. ``There is more to do.''\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, State and local governments have been \nstruggling to keep pace with the evolving threats posed by cyber \nbreaches. They just cannot do it alone. We have the resources. This \nDepartment was crafted and designed to be able to reach out beyond \nthese parameters to ensure that local governments and State governments \nfelt that they were secure.\n  I believe that the enactment of H.R. 3869 would send a clear message \nabout our commitment to helping State and local governments address the \nperennial cybersecurity challenges that permeate their providing \nservices for their constituents, which have been identified every year, \naccording to the National Preparedness Report.\n  In having formerly chaired this infrastructure committee, I know that \nthe need still remains great and that we have an opportunity to keep \nbuilding and improving on that resource.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3869.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I concur with the gentlewoman. Once again, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 3869.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania). The question \nis on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) that \nthe House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3869, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend \nthe Homeland Security Act of 2002 to assist State and local \ncoordination on cybersecurity with the national cybersecurity and \ncommunications integration center, and for other purposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9257-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9257-H9262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FIRST RESPONDER IDENTIFICATION OF EMERGENCY NEEDS IN DISASTER \n                               SITUATIONS\n\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 2795) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nsubmit a study on the circumstances which may impact the effectiveness \nand availability of first responders before, during, or after a \nterrorist threat or event, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2795\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page H9258]]\n\n  \n\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``First Responder \n     Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations'' or \n     the ``FRIENDS Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAY IMPACT FIRST RESPONDERS \n                   DURING A TERRORIST EVENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall submit to the Committee on Homeland \n     Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a \n     report that describes select State and local programs and \n     policies, as appropriate, related to the preparedness and \n     protection of first responders. The report may include \n     information on--\n       (1) the degree to which such programs and policies include \n     consideration of the presence of a first responder's family \n     in an area impacted by a terrorist attack;\n       (2) the availability of personal protective equipment for \n     first responders;\n       (3) the availability of home Medkits for first responders \n     and their families for biological incident response; and\n       (4) other related factors.\n       (b) Context.--In preparing the report required under \n     subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the United States \n     may, as appropriate, provide information--\n       (1) in a format that delineates high risk urban areas from \n     rural communities; and\n       (2) on the degree to which the selected State and local \n     programs and policies included in the report were developed \n     or are being executed with funding from the Department of \n     Homeland Security, including grant funding from the State \n     Homeland Security Grant Program or the Urban Area Security \n     Initiative under sections 2002 and 2003, respectively, of the \n     Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 603 and 604).\n       (c) Homeland Security Consideration.--After issuance of the \n     report required under subsection (a), the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security shall consider the report's findings and \n     assess its applicability for Federal first responders.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hurd) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today to support H.R. 2795, the First Responder Identification \nof Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations.\n  Our country continues to be resilient because of the men and women \nwho keep us safe every day by putting their lives on the line. We can \nthank them by ensuring they have sufficient resources to do their jobs.\n  H.R. 2795 will take a national snapshot of the current policies and \nprograms that support first responders and their families in the event \nof a terrorist attack.\n  By requiring the Government Accountability Office to report this \nnational snapshot to Congress and to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, we will have a better understanding of the support \nsurrounding our first responders and their families.\n  Both the National Association of State Emergency Medical Services \nOfficials and the International Association of Fire Chiefs are \nendorsing this legislation because it promotes the critical work our \nfirst responders are always prepared to do despite the challenges they \nface. Events like the Ebola scare that hit the U.S. in 2014 alerted us \nto the impact these events have not only had on our first responders, \nbut also on their families.\n  I thank Ms. Jackson Lee for introducing this legislation and for \nworking with the Committee on Homeland Security to promote this \nimportant issue.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2795, the First Responder Identification of \nEmergency Needs in Disaster Situations, or the FRIENDS Act, as we have \nbeen very happy to call it as we have crafted it.\n  First responders are our Nation's heroes. We know that we are \ngathering together in these final weeks to make sure that we pass the \n9/11 health bill that provided for those who stood in the face of \ndanger during the tragedy of 9/11.\n  We know that first responders run into burning buildings, that they \nrescue people trapped by dangerous floods, that they put themselves in \nharm's way to protect others, and that, as we well know in these times, \nthey deal with terrorism.\n  Just last week, in San Bernardino, we saw brave first responders \nheroically pursue two individuals who were fleeing from the scene of a \ndeadly attack at an office holiday party.\n  We also know that, at the site of that incident, we saw a massive \nnumber of first responders who were going toward the building. Not \nknowing the threat or whether or not the individuals who had created \nthis massacre were still there or how many there were, they ran toward \nthe building.\n  To do their jobs, first responders must leave their homes and \nfamilies while the rest of us cling to ours. Whether it was to deal \nwith the aftermath of a terrorist attack, like the attacks of September \n11, or to give support during a catastrophic disaster, like Hurricane \nKatrina, first responders bravely leave home to save others.\n  I had firsthand experiences of both of those incidences, one, a \nnatural disaster and, one, a terrorist act.\n  I watched as firefighters stayed day after day after day and would \nnot remove themselves because they were engaged in recovering their \ncolleagues--their brothers and sisters--and those others who had \nperished. They stayed day after day.\n  That was a great hardship on those families. We know the stories. We \nknow that some of them were dealing with situations in which they may \nhave been the only parent or the only guardian.\n  In the situation of Katrina, I saw the Coast Guard stay in the area \ntime after time and the National Guard and other first responders come \nfrom all over the country and from even all over the world to be able \nto help those who were in need, and they stayed a very long time.\n  Unfortunately, today first responders are asked to answer the call to \naction without knowing whether their families will be safe as they work \nto rescue others. Our first responders deserve better.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  The FRIENDS Act directs the Government Accountability Office to \nconduct a comprehensive review of policies and programs designed to \nensure that first responders are able to do their job safely and \neffectively by assessing, among other things, measures to ensure first \nresponder families are safe and the availability of personal protective \nequipment is there.\n  During committee consideration of the FRIENDS Act, my friend from New \nYork (Mr. Higgins) offered an amendment to authorize GAO to evaluate \nthe availability of home med kits for first responders and their \nfamilies in assessing the preparedness of first responders, maybe even \nbeing able to take care of their neighborhood or their family or \nthemselves in the course of these disasters. I am pleased to support \nthe Higgins amendment, and I believe it adds to the bill.\n  H.R. 2759 also directs GAO to distinguish policies available in high-\nrisk urban areas, which may be better resourced, and rural areas where \nefforts to ensure preparedness for first responders and their families \nmay require creative leveraging of resources. Many of those areas have \nvolunteer fire departments and volunteers who need the assistance from \nthis act. This provision will ensure that the information included in \nthe report will be applicable and adaptable by various communities \nacross the country as they work to better protect their protectors and \nto give them the support system that they need.\n  Additionally, the FRIENDS Act directs the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to review GAO's findings and assess whether policies \nidentified could be applicable to Federal first responders. The FRIENDS \nAct has been endorsed by the International Association of Fire Chiefs, \nas well as the National Association of State EMS Officials, and the \nInternational Emergency\n\n[[Page H9259]]\n\nManagement Society, along with others.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to thank Ranking Member Thompson and \nChairman McCaul for their help in bringing this important legislation \nto the floor. Let me also thank the ranking member and chairman of the \nemergency preparedness committee and all of jurisdictional committees \nthat helped contribute to this. Let me also acknowledge the staffs on \nboth sides of the aisle who were enormously effective in helping to \nbring about this bill.\n  I want to thank Mr. Hoyer, who for many, many years was a co-chair of \nthe Congressional Fire Service Caucus on which I participated with him \nover those years, for his stated support of this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security, and the \nauthor and sponsor, I am proud to rise in strong support of H.R. 2795, \nthe ``First Responder Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster \nSituations of 2015,'' or the ``FRIENDS Act.''\n  I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their \ncooperation, assistance, and support in shepherding this important \nlegislation to the floor.\n  I appreciate Congressman Payne, the Ranking Member of the Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and \nCommunications, for his original co-sponsorship and strong support of \nthe FRIENDS Act.\n  The FRIENDS Act embodies the important and fundamental idea that we \nhave an obligation to ensure that the first responders who protect our \nloved ones in emergencies have the peace of mind that comes from \nknowing that their loved ones are safe while they do their duty.\n  The FRIENDS Act, which reflects stakeholder input and bipartisan \ncollaboration with the Majority, is an example of what can be achieved \nfor the American people when Members of Congress put the public \ninterest ahead of partisan interests.\n  I thank the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National \nAssociation of State EMS Officials, and the International Emergency \nManagement Society for their valuable assistance and input regarding \nthe FRIENDS Act.\n  I thank Kay Goss; the President of the International Emergency \nManagement Society, who provided technical assistance during the bill's \ndrafting process on the work of first responders to prepare for \ncatastrophic events.\n  Kay Goss was Associate FEMA Director in charge of National \nPreparedness, Training, and Exercises during the Clinton \nAdministration, the first woman confirmed by the Senate to serve in \nthat position.\n  I am passionate about the work of those who dedicate themselves to \npublic service.\n  I hold in high regard the service of firefighters, law enforcement \nofficers, emergency response technicians, nurses, emergency room \ndoctors, and the dozens of other professionals who are the ultimate \npublic servants.\n  Few persons outside their ranks truly understand why and how first \nresponders are able to do what they do every day--voluntarily and \ncheerfully risk placing their lives in harm's way to save a stranger.\n  First responders, whether as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, \nsearch and rescue workers, or emergency medical technicians make our \nlives safer, often at considerable risk to their personal safety.\n  H.R. 2795 provides Congress an opportunity to let our first \nresponders know that we do recognize and understand that they have \nfamilies and loved ones who they must leave behind when they are called \nto duty.\n  The GAO study that will be provided as a result of this bill will \nshed light on what is being done by local and state governments to \naddress the needs of first responder families when threats like \nHurricanes Sandy, Hugo, and Katrina hit communities, or when a \nterrorist attack like the ones seen in New York and Boston occur.\n  The report called for by the FRIENDS Act will also provide \ninformation on the availability of personal protective equipment for \nfirst responders.\n  The issue of personal protective equipment was an acute problem for \nfront line first responders during last year's Ebola crisis.\n  First responders including EMTs, emergency room doctors and nurses, \nas well as law enforcement and fire department professionals who \nresponded to emergencies were in need of guidance on how to effectively \ntreat a person with Ebola without becoming infected.\n  I joined members of the House Committee on Homeland Security in a \nFull Committee field hearing last year in Dallas, Texas, shortly after \nthe first case of Ebola was diagnosed in the United States.\n  That patient, Eric Duncan, lived in the Dallas area and was treated \nat a local hospital, but died of the illness.\n  As a result of coming in contact with Mr. Duncan two nurses at the \nhospital where he was treated became ill with the disease.\n  During the Dallas field hearing, I brought to the attention of the \nHouse Homeland Security Committee a letter from National Nurses United \ntransmitting the results of a survey of nurses, which found that:\n  1. Nearly 80 percent of respondents agreed that their hospital had \nnot communicated to them any policy regarding potential admission of \npatients infected by Ebola;\n  2. 85 percent of respondents agreed that their hospital had not \nprovided education on Ebola to enable nurses to interact with patients \nsafely;\n  3. One-third of respondents reported that their hospital had \ninsufficient supplies of eye protection (face shields or side shields \nwith goggles) and fluid resistant/impermeable gowns; and\n  4. Nearly 40 percent of respondents agreed that their hospital did \nnot have plans to equip isolation rooms with plastic covered mattresses \nand pillows and to discard all linens after use; fewer than 1 in 10 \nrespondents reported that they were aware their hospital had such a \nplan in place.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and a few hospitals around the \ncountry with infectious disease units knew the right protocols and had \nthe right protective gear to be used when treating an Ebola patient.\n  Ebola in the United States was a frightening thought for many, but I \nthink we saw the best of what first responders do each day--our doctors \nand nurses went to work and treated the sick and did what they always \ndo--take care of those in need.\n  In unanimously reported the FRIENDS Act favorably to the House, the \nHomeland Security Committee voted to support first responders and the \npeople who love them and need them most, their families.\n  The FRIENDS Act will help ensure that our healthcare workers, EMTs, \nfirefighters, law enforcement, and other local, state, and federal \nfirst responders can answer the call of duty secure in the knowledge \nthat they will have what they need in the way of health kits or an \nemergency response plan to enable them to perform their duty and return \nhome safely to their families and loved ones.\n  The GAO's comprehensive review of the range of policies and programs \nin place at the State level to address the preparedness and protection \nof first responders will also delineate high risk urban areas from \nrural communities; and the degree to which selected state policies were \ndeveloped or executed with funding from the DHS Grant Programs or Urban \nArea Security Initiative authorized by the Homeland Security Act.\n  The GAO Report's focus on the presence of the family of first \nresponders in an area affected by a terrorist attack and the \navailability of personal protective equipment is essential.\n  This will be the first report that focuses on the family as a \ncritical factor that should be considered in the work of first \nresponders during times of crisis such as a terrorist attack or public \nemergency.\n  The issue of families in areas that may be impacted by terrorist \nattack or other crisis was highlighted by the Ebola crisis in Dallas, \nTexas last year.\n  According to Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, who managed the \ncrisis, one of the chief concerns of first responders was keeping their \nfamilies safe.\n  Judge Jenkins recounted that discrimination against first responders \nand their families was a real concern because it was known that EMTs \nand the firefighters accompanying them responded to the home of the \nfirst known Ebola victim in the United States, Eric Duncan.\n  People were so fearful for themselves and their children's health \nregarding possible means of contracting Ebola they did not want their \nchildren attending a school with the child of first responders who \nmight come into contact with Ebola victims.\n  For this reason, Judge Jenkins requested the Commissioner of Public \nHealth, the top Ebola expert in the United States, and the Dallas \nCounty Medical Society explain to the public that there was a zero \npercent chance of transmission of Ebola in that scenario.\n  In Dallas County and around the nation first responders expressed \nconcerns regarding their lack of knowledge about the disease, as well \nas not having the right type of protective equipment to ensure their \nsafety in managing the care of possible Ebola victims.\n  These are certainly factors that one would expect to weigh on a first \nresponder called to respond to a terrorist attack or unprecedented \nemergency.\n  The bravery or dedication of first responders is not in question--\nthey are the people who run into burning buildings to save people whom \nthey may never have met.\n  The FRIENDS Act is a small token of the nation's gratitude and \nappreciation for all first responders do keep us safe.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I wish to acknowledge and thank Natalie Matson \nand her colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee's majority staff, \nMoira Bergin and her colleagues with\n\n[[Page H9260]]\n\nthe Minority staff, and Lillie Coney of my personal staff for their \ntechnical expertise and great work on H.R. 2795.\n  I urge all Members to support the nation's first responders and vote \nto pass H.R. 2795, the FRIENDS Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close since I have no \nfurther speakers, and I yield myself the remaining time.\n  One of the things that we wanted to do in the course of this \nlegislation is to make sure that the stakeholders were fully informed \nand thought this would be a constructive addition to their ability to \nserve the public and to be on call and to be away for long periods of \ntime from their families, which they have been called to do.\n  As I begin to reflect, I reflected on the wildfires in the West, the \nenormous flooding that we have had, and certainly we cannot forget the \nissues dealing with terrorism. The terrorism investigations, as \nindividuals who are victims are buried in California, the first \nresponders, law enforcement, and others are still on the job \ninvestigating what is occurring.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I include a series of letters into the Record from \nthe National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, who are \nindicating the importance of this legislation; a letter from the Office \nof the Mayor of the City of Houston, Mayor Annise Parker, who indicates \nthat as first responders risk their lives in responding to terrorist \nattacks and other emergencies, they and their families are at increased \nrisk; from the Houston Professional Fire Fighters, Association Local \n341, who have written on behalf of the 3,800 men and women of the \nHouston Fire Department, indicating the need for this legislation to \nprotect their families; from the National Association of State EMS \nOfficials, the International Association of Fire Chiefs on behalf of \nnearly 11,000 fire service leaders for introducing this legislation \nthat would provide adequate preparedness for their families; and an \narticle which is entitled ``Family Versus Duty: Personal and Family \nPreparedness Law Enforcement Organizational Resilience.''\n\n                                          National Organization of\n\n\n                             Black Law Enforcement Executives,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, December 9, 2015.\n     Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,\n     Rayburn House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congresswoman Jackson Lee: On behalf of the National \n     Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), our \n     Executive Board, local chapters, and members, I am writing to \n     express support for H.R. 2795, the First Responder \n     Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations \n     (FRIENDS) Act. Our nation's first responders risk their lives \n     in responding to terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and \n     other emergencies. Consequently, they and their families may \n     be at increased risk due to exposures they face in responding \n     to disasters. Directing the Government Accountability Office \n     to prepare a report that examines the preparedness and \n     protection of first responders and their families, including \n     an assessment of the grant funding available, will serve an \n     important function by evaluating existing resources to \n     protect first responders and their families and the need for \n     additional resources.\n       NOBLE feels that it is important that we equip our first \n     responders to protect our communities while also ensuring \n     that their families are safe.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Dwayne A.

Payne,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, \n         Response, and Communications, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       We are writing to express our support for the Jackson Lee \n     Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute titled, the \n     ``Families of Responders Identification of Emergency Needs in \n     Designated Situations'' or the ``FRIENDS Act.'' This bill \n     would provide an important report on the state of family \n     support planning for the families of first responders.\n       We believe that Federal family support planning is \n     important to homeland security because this area of \n     continuity of operations planning addresses the health and \n     safety needs of first responder families during terrorist \n     attacks or incidents as well as other emergencies. The \n     FRIENDS Act will be an important first step in engaging the \n     first responder community on the role of family in \n     preparedness and continuity of operations.\n       The FRIENDS Act would also engage first responder \n     organizations to get their perspectives on best practices in \n     family support planning programs on the local and state \n     levels.\n       For these reasons, we support the FRIENDS Act of 2015.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Paul R.

Sheila Jackson Lee,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Jackson Lee: On behalf of the nearly \n     11,000 fire service leaders of the International Association \n     of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would like thank you for introducing \n     your substitute amendment to H.R. 2795, the First Responder \n     Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations \n     (FRIENDS) Act. The IAFC supports this legislation, because it \n     will examine an important issue facing the nation's first \n     responders during a major terrorist attack: adequate \n     preparedness for the first responders' families.\n       During a major terrorist attack, fire, law enforcement and \n     EMS officials will be called upon to take heroic actions to \n     protect the public and provide fire and emergency medical \n     response. In the case of a large-scale incident or biological \n     attack, the families of these first responders also will be \n     at risk. Based on the experience of IAFC members during the \n     response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and last year's \n     response to potential Ebola incidents in the United States, I \n     know that the welfare of the first responders' families \n     weighs heavily on them as they serve the public. It is \n     important that federal, state, and local officials make plans \n     to provide for the safety of first responders' families in \n     order to ensure strong morale among\n\n[[Page H9261]]\n\n     local fire, law enforcement, and EMS officials during a major \n     terrorist attack.\n       The IAFC thanks the House Homeland Security Committee for \n     considering this substitute amendment to H.R. 2795. It would \n     direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine \n     planning for first responders' families during terrorist \n     attacks. We urge the GAO to highlight effective plans, so \n     that other jurisdictions can learn from them. We also support \n     Representative Higgins' amendment to make minor changes to \n     the bill, including examining the use of med-kits for first \n     responders' families.\n       Thank you for introducing this important legislation. The \n     IAFC urges the House Homeland Security Committee to pass both \n     this substitute amendment and the Higgins amendment. We look \n     forward to working with you to pass this legislation in the \n     House of Representatives.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                    Fire Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr,\n\n                                                    EFO, CFO, MPA,\n     President and Chair of the Board.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Family vs. Duty: Personal and Family Preparedness for Law Enforcement \n                       Organizational Resilience\n\n       It has been more than four years since Hurricane Katrina \n     opened our eyes to the personal struggles faced by law \n     enforcement officers in the wake of disaster. The law \n     enforcement response to Hurricane Katrina brought to the \n     forefront the challenges that ensue when the intended \n     responders become victims. Many law Enforcement Officers had \n     to make the choice between their responsibility to their \n     families and their duties as police officers. As law \n     enforcement officers, how do we balance the needs and safety \n     of our families with our duty to respond in a crisis? As \n     employers and managers of law enforcement officers what are \n     our responsibilities to our employees and their families in \n     developing and maintaining personal and family preparedness? \n     What steps can be taken by organizations to increase employee \n     and family preparedness of law enforcement personnel?\n       This article provides an overview of personal and family \n     preparedness of police officers and its relationship to law \n     enforcement organizational readiness. The role of the law \n     enforcement agency in developing and supporting personal and \n     family preparedness will also be reviewed. The overall goal \n     of this article is to develop the general elements of an \n     effective program for law enforcement agencies that advances \n     the personal and family preparedness of law enforcement \n     officers to increase the likelihood that officers will report \n     in emergency situations.\n\n\n    hurricane katrina: preparedness and organizational effectiveness\n\n       The New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) faced a multitude \n     of challenges in efforts to respond to the impact of \n     Hurricane Katrina that resulted in an ``almost total loss of \n     police capabilities in New Orleans.'' The official reports \n     crafted in the wake of the disaster identify several issues \n     that led to the ``collapse of law enforcement.'' These \n     identified problems included ``missing police officers led to \n     a law enforcement manpower shortage.'' While there were some \n     officers who were derelict in their duties in failing to \n     report, the vast majority had become victims themselves, or \n     dealt with family crises related to the disaster, making it \n     difficult or impossible to report for duty. There are \n     estimates that as much as 5 percent of the NOPD force were \n     stranded at home. Other elements, including the technological \n     failures of electric power grids, communications systems, \n     etc., can be overcome through effective continuity planning. \n     The loss of significant numbers of personnel through their \n     failure to report is completely debilitating for the law \n     enforcement function. Regardless of the technological \n     enhancements, policing is accomplished by people, without \n     them there is no maintenance of civil order.\n\n\n          previous research: ability and willingness to report\n\n       Although the conditions faced by NOPD in its efforts to \n     respond to Hurricane Katrina were of a scale not seen in our \n     modern history, ensuring that personnel are willing and able \n     to report for assignment is critical. This is an easier task \n     when notice of the potential crisis, such as an approaching \n     Hurricane, is known for several days in advance. Developing \n     the organizational agility for officers to report in sudden \n     unexpected conditions is more challenging.\n       There has been little research conducted directly on the \n     ability and willingness of police officers to report in \n     crisis situations. There have been several studies conducted \n     in the public health and healthcare community, and limited \n     studies among firefighters and emergency medical \n     technicians. While there are many parallels that can be \n     drawn across first response organizations, each has unique \n     challenges in different emergency situations that may \n     impact the willingness of responders to report.\n       There are two studies that have been conducted on the \n     ability and willingness of law enforcement officers to report \n     in disaster. A 2007 study of police officers in the \n     Washington, DC area by Demme revealed that family \n     preparedness and safety were the determinant factors in the \n     ability and willingness of law enforcement officers to report \n     for duty in the event of a biological incident. In an \n     unpublished study, Nestal (2005) examined the ability and \n     willingness of police officers in Philadelphia to respond \n     using the National Planning Scenarios outlined in Department \n     of Homeland Security preparedness guidance. The planning \n     scenarios presented fifteen disaster situations that range \n     from natural disasters to terrorist attacks. The study \n     revealed that based on the given scenario, 55-66 percent of \n     police officers reported they would refuse to adhere to an \n     emergency recall or would consider abandoning their position \n     based upon concerns for the safety of their family.\n       These studies illustrate the importance of family \n     preparedness to the resilience of law enforcement agencies in \n     disaster. Although further research is needed, these studies \n     make employee and family preparedness impossible to ignore in \n     overall agency preparedness efforts.\n\n\n      the role of the employer in employee and family preparedness\n\n       A recent study by Landahl & Cox (2009) examined the actions \n     being taken by first response organizations related to \n     employee and family preparedness and the attitudes and \n     opinions of senior leaders on the role of the employer in the \n     development of employee and family preparedness. The study \n     showed that 97 percent of homeland security leaders \n     identified that employee and family preparedness is an \n     essential element to organizational resilience during large-\n     scale emergencies. In addition, the results showed that a \n     majority (52.9 percent) reported that organizations should be \n     prepared to assume some responsibility for the care of \n     essential employees and their families. The study concluded \n     that ``there is a fundamental disconnect between problem \n     recognition by homeland security leaders and organizational \n     activities; only 29 percent of participants reported their \n     organizations had conducted training in or had written plans \n     to support employees and families during disaster.''\n       Essentially, the problem has been recognized, but little \n     has been accomplished towards a solution. Although the issue \n     of employee and family preparedness was exposed during the \n     response to Hurricane Katrina and recognized through \n     research, the issue remains absent from Department of \n     Homeland Security planning and preparedness guidance.\n\n\n    implementing policy to increase personal and family preparedness\n\n       Law enforcement agencies train officers for confrontations, \n     teach them how to investigate crimes and help them \n     develop skills to earn promotions. However, as leaders we \n     fail to teach our officers how to prepare their families \n     and themselves if they are called to duty during a crisis. \n     To improve the chances that law enforcement officers will \n     be in a position to make the decision to report in a \n     crisis situation, leaders should develop clear \n     expectations through policy and planning; including a \n     Mission Statement and Strategic Plan. According to \n     Whisenand, the agencies that have gone through difficult \n     times, managerially, have had three things in common. Each \n     of these agencies exhibited signs of a lack of leadership, \n     an absence of a shared vision and their strategic plans \n     were either poorly developed or had not been established. \n     Therefore, administrators should create a clear policy for \n     their officers so expectations are established before \n     disaster strikes.\n       Such a policy should include the following:\n\n\n                      emergency recall guidelines\n\n       Clear emergency recall guidelines allow officers to \n     understand the methods and expectations following the \n     notification of off-duty personnel to return to work. The \n     policy should establish how the decision will be made, how \n     officers will be contacted, reporting locations, and expected \n     time from notification to reporting. Notifications may be \n     accomplished through radio communication, telephone contact, \n     pagers, or media utilizing the Emergency Alert System. These \n     guidelines also establish who is exempt from returning. This \n     may include officers who are on vacation, sick leave, or \n     military duty.\n\n\n                          hold-over guidelines\n\n       These guidelines establish the process for extending the \n     tour of on-duty personnel. This should include the decision \n     process, which personnel may be affected.\n\n\n                          schedule assignments\n\n       While maintaining the flexibility to respond to a variety \n     of incidents, expected emergency pre-planned shift \n     assignments should be communicated to personnel. For example, \n     agencies may choose to implement 12-hour A/B platoon shifts. \n     The expectation should be communicated to personnel in order \n     to facilitate personal and family preparedness planning.\n\n\n                         levels of mobilization\n\n       Levels of mobilization should be established to set \n     parameters for how many personnel will report for duty. Will \n     the entire department report or will it be selected \n     divisions, or specialized units that will be mobilized.\n\n\n                         civilian support staff\n\n       Communicating policies and roles for support staff is \n     critical to emergency operations. They must be included in \n     policies and personal and family preparedness process.\n\n\n                           logistical support\n\n       Roles and responsibilities for logistical support of law \n     enforcement operations in disasters need to be clearly \n     defined. The Senate Hurricane Katrina report indicated that \n     there were deficiencies in that there ``did not appear to be \n     any pre-planning for food,\n\n[[Page H9262]]\n\n     water, weapons, and medical care.'' Officer's need to know \n     how they will be supported during disaster operations, will \n     they have off-shift food and lodging available? Concerns \n     about on-duty and off-duty support may impact officers' \n     willingness to report for assignment. The clear \n     articulation and communication of support that officers \n     can expect will allow for personal and family planning, \n     strong support efforts may increase response rates.\n\n\n                             family support\n\n       Agencies must determine their level of commitment to \n     support officer families and communicate the expected \n     relationship between the organization and families to \n     officers. There is a range of support that agencies can \n     provide to families ranging from basic home logistical \n     support to providing a shelter to locate officers' families \n     during a disaster or an emergency situation. If agencies do \n     not plan to provide support to families, they must \n     communicate this expectation and prepare officers and \n     families to be self-sufficient. The decision to provide no \n     support to families may impact recall and dereliction of duty \n     rates.\n\n\n                        anticipated emergencies\n\n       Following their experience in Hurricane Katrina, the NOPD \n     took a different approach in preparing officers to report for \n     duty prior to Hurricane Gustav in 2008. NOPD provided \n     employees paid time off to prepare and evacuate their \n     families if necessary before reporting for duty. The \n     effectiveness of the strategy on response rates could not be \n     measured as Hurricane Gustav largely missed New Orleans. Pre-\n     incident policies such as time off to prepare should be \n     considered and communicated to personnel.\n\n\n                policy enforcement/discipline guidelines\n\n       Policy should clearly articulate the consequences when \n     officers elect not to report for duty. Leaders must deal \n     decisively with the issue. The failure of the chief executive \n     to address such cases could erode confidence in their ability \n     to maintain discipline within the department. Failure to \n     enforce can also call into question the importance of such a \n     policy.\n\n\n                         training and exercise\n\n       Training in emergency policies should occur at least on an \n     annual basis and be reinforced regularly by supervisory \n     personnel. Training should include instruction in the \n     development of personal and family preparedness plans and \n     emergency kits. Emergency exercises should include the \n     extension to families, in order for officers to engage their \n     families in the potential impact of agency emergency \n     operations on the home.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The general public and agency leadership have the \n     expectation that law enforcement officers report for duty \n     when significant events or crises occurs. An established \n     policy that includes protocols, training, clear \n     organizational mission, and communication of the expected \n     relationship between agencies and families of officers can \n     help officers prepare and facilitate the decision to report \n     for duty. Agency executives must place high organizational \n     value on personal and family preparedness and reinforce it \n     through training, exercise, and the supervision process. \n     Provisions for the safety of officers' families should be a \n     key component of a plan. Planning and policy development can \n     steer the organizational culture to a culture of preparedness \n     that include the families of our most critical asset; our \n     people.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as I began, let me thank the first \nresponders of this Nation and thank their families for the sacrifice \nthat they make.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of \nthe House and offer the following resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). The Clerk will report the \nresolution.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Whereas the safety of the American people is urgently at \n     stake;\n       Whereas the integrity of the legislative process has been \n     seriously undermined by the influence of a powerful lobby, \n     causing the House leadership to prevent the American people's \n     representatives from considering commonsense measures to \n     prevent terrorists from purchasing assault weapons and \n     firearms from any licensed firearms dealer in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the first duty of Members of Congress is to protect \n     and defend the American people, and that duty is forsaken by \n     the failure of the House leadership to withstand the \n     influence of a powerful lobby controlled by the gun industry;\n       Whereas leaders of terrorist organizations have previously \n     urged sympathizers to exploit the United States' lax gun laws \n     in order to perpetrate domestic terror;\n       Whereas suspects on the FBI's Terrorist Watchlist can go \n     into a gun store anywhere in America and buy dangerous \n     firearms of their choosing legally;\n       Whereas since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists \n     have legally purchased weapons in the United States;\n       Whereas in that time period, more than 90 percent of all \n     suspected terrorists who tried to buy a gun in a store in \n     America walked away with his or her weapon of choice;\n       Whereas the House leadership ensures the ability of \n     suspected terrorists to continue to buy guns and refuses to \n     schedule legislation to close the terror list loophole;\n       Whereas since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary \n     school nearly 3 years ago, more than 1,000 mass shootings, \n     90,000 gun deaths, and 210,000 gun injuries have occurred; \n     and\n       Whereas mass shootings and gun violence are inflicting \n     daily tragedy on communities across America: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) a clear and present danger exists to the American \n     people; and\n       (2) in order to protect the American people and the \n     integrity of the legislative process, upon the adoption of \n     this resolution, the Speaker shall place H.R. 1076, the \n     ``Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists \n     Act'', as introduced by Congressman Peter King (Republican-\n     NY), on the calendar for an immediate vote.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentlewoman from California wish to \npresent argument on the parliamentary question whether the resolution \npresents a question of the privileges of the House?\n  Ms. PELOSI. I do, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, it is shocking to the American people that \nCongress refuses to keep guns out of the hands of those on the FBI's \nterrorist watch list. The gun violence epidemic is a public health \ncrisis that we have a responsibility to address. Failing to meet that \nresponsibility brings dishonor to the House of Representatives.\n  Public sentiment demands action. Eighty percent of Americans support \nlegislation to close the outrageous loophole that puts guns in the \nhands of people, again, on the FBI's terrorist watch list. In the last \ndecade, 90 percent of those on the FBI's terrorist watch list who tried \nto buy guns in America left the store with their weapons of choice.\n  In closing, in the people's House, we do nothing. We have not even \nallowed an up-or-down vote. In just over 1,000 days since Sandy Hook, \nwe have seen 1,000 mass killings, 90,000 gun deaths, and 210,000 gun \ninjuries in communities across America.\n  By refusing to act, we disgrace the House, we dishonor the American \npeople, and we erode America's faith in our democracy. We have no right \nto hold moments of silence without action to end gun violence. Give us \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will rule.\n  The gentlewoman from California seeks to offer a resolution raising a \nquestion of the privileges of the House under rule IX. The resolution \ndirects the Speaker to schedule a particular measure for an immediate \nvote.\n  One of the fundamental tenets of rule IX, as the Chair most recently \nruled on October 8, 2013, is that a resolution expressing a legislative \nsentiment does not qualify as a question of the privileges of the \nHouse.\n  By calling for a vote on a particular measure, the resolution \nexpresses a legislative sentiment in violation of the principles \ndocumented in sections 702 and 706 of the House Rules and Manual. \nAccordingly, the resolution does not constitute a question of the \nprivileges of the House.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the \nChair stand as the judgment of the House?\n\n\n                            Motion to Table\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I move to lay the appeal on the table.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on the motion to table will be followed by a 5-minute vote \non the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 2795.\n\n[[Page H9264]]\n\n  The

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of \n``Fearless'' Phyllis Galanti, an amazing woman and a true American \nhero.\n  On Tuesday, the House passed H.R. 2693 which honors Phyllis Galanti \nby naming the arboretum at the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center \nin Richmond, Virginia, as the Phyllis E. Galanti Arboretum.\n  When her husband, Paul Galanti, was shot down and taken as a prisoner \nof war in North Vietnam in June 1966, Phyllis did not respond with fear \nbut, instead, became a tireless advocate for American POWs around the \nworld.\n  ``Fearless Phyllis,'' as she became known, sought an audience with \nthe North Vietnamese leaders, collected almost half a million letters \nfrom the Richmond area, and personally delivered them to the North \nVietnamese embassy in Stockholm. She also gave hundreds of policy \npresentations to leaders like President Nixon and Secretary of State \nHenry Kissinger, becoming nationally known for her dedication to \nbringing home POWs.\n  Mr. Speaker, after over 7 years of separation, Paul and Phyllis were \nreunited in February of 1973 in Norfolk, Virginia. Even with her \nhusband home, Phyllis continued her work, confronting not only Vietnam, \nbut also the Soviet Union and Iran in her tireless quest to bring our \nboys home, eventually earning The American Legion Service Medal.\n  Her dedication to our prisoners of war is truly inspirational.

Because of that, Iran will \ncontinue to enjoy more and more of the plus $100 billion in unfrozen \nassets that they have not been accessible to.\n  If Iran is allowed to break the agreement without consequences, it \nwill only encourage more bad behavior and unrest in the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9265-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9265-H9266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HUMAN RIGHTS DAY\n\n  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n           Puerto Rico's Financial Crisis and the Way Forward\n\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the time.\n  I would like to begin this evening by yielding to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Duffy), my good friend and colleague.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.\n  Tonight I rise to talk about our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico.\n  If you have watched the news recently, you are well aware that there \nis an economic financial debt crisis taking place right now in Puerto \nRico. Our American brothers and sisters are going through an incredibly \ndifficult time.\n  The island is $73 billion in debt. That is 100 percent of their GDP, \nwhich is catastrophically high. This debt has had a huge impact on the \nlivelihoods of those who live on the island.\n  The unemployment rate is over twice what it is on the mainland. It is \nat 12.4 percent. Forty-eight percent of Americans on the island are \nliving in poverty. Again, half of the island citizens--Americans--are \nliving in poverty.\n  Ten percent of the 3.5 million people on the island are leaving and \nthey are coming to the mainland. It is great because they work hard and \nthey have an amazing culture. It is wonderful they are coming. But if \nyou are coming to the mainland, you should be coming because you want \nto come, not because you don't have economic opportunity in your home. \nWe don't want to force people away from their families and their \nneighbors and their community because they don't have economic \nopportunity.\n  We have to stand together in this House and stand with our brothers \nand sisters in Puerto Rico. We can't turn a blind eye. We have to work \nwith them. We have to work for them so we can address this crisis.\n  Yesterday I introduced a pretty simple and straightforward bill that \nwill help jump-start the Puerto Rican economy, help put people back to \nwork, grow their economy, better paying jobs, and lift people out of \npoverty. It is very simple. It is called the Puerto Rico Financial \nStability and Debt Restructuring Choice Act, and it has two prongs.\n  Prong number one is we are going to implement a financial stability \nboard that is going to help the island with the management of its \nbudget, its tax collection, and its finances.\n  Prong number two is Puerto Rico can access a chapter 9 bankruptcy. By \nthe way, every State in America can access chapter 9. It will be the \nsame rights as every State that we will offer Puerto Rico. It is pretty \nsimple and straightforward stuff.\n  I also think it is important to note that no one wants to have a \nfinancial stability board shoved down their throat, and the citizens of \nPuerto Rico don't want that either. That is why we give them the \nchoice. This doesn't go into effect unless the Puerto Rican legislative \nassembly approves the financial stability board and the Governor signs \nit so that they have a say in their future.\n  If we do this, we will allow Puerto Rico to restructure their debt, \nto get their finances in order, to grow their economy, and to let \npeople on the island start living the American Dream. If we do nothing, \nif we turn a blind eye and say that we are not going to offer the same \nbankruptcy option that every State has, we are turning our backs on our \nfellow American citizens on the island, and that is not who we are. We \nshould stand together.\n  Now, there are others who have proposed different solutions for the \nisland, and those solutions involve a bailout without real structural \nreform. I have got to tell you that, after the 2008 financial crisis, I \nthink Americans have had it up to here with bailouts. We usually go \nwith bankruptcy and financial reform, and that is what my bill does.\n  I would encourage all of my fellow Americans in this institution, \nwhether you are a conservative or a liberal, you are a Republican or a \nDemocrat, to note that our brothers and sisters, our fellow American \ncitizens in Puerto Rico, are going through tough times, and it is our \njob to stand with them, not turn our backs.\n  If we can pass this bill, it is going to be a new day on the island, \neconomic prosperity and opportunity. And then people have a choice to \nsay: Do I want to stay on the island, raise my family on the island, or \ndo I want to leave and come to the mainland?\n  The choice is theirs. They won't be forced into that choice just \nbecause they don't have opportunity on the island of Puerto Rico.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues and friends to reach out. Let's be \npart of the solution.\n\n\n                           Recovering America\n\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, as I walked through the airport \nrecently, I noticed a young teenager. She was traveling and was \nseemingly happy to be involved in whatever activity she was going to.\n  She wore a button on her lapel. It said: What you do matters. It \ncaught my attention: What you do matters. I liked it. I am not sure \nwhat was motivating her, but she wanted to communicate an important \nvalue to elevate an ideal. I simply admired her willingness to take a \nstand.\n  Mr. Speaker, I should say this now, though: There is a troubling \nstatistic out there, and a recent survey highlights this. A majority of \nAmericans do not identify with what America has become. Many people \nfeel our country is slipping away. In reality, most want to reclaim the \npromise of our great Nation.\n  Contrary to the barrage of negativity, most people hope for \njustifiable goals: to regain power over their own lives, to regain \npower over the government, and to regain power over their own economic \nprospects.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the strengths of America's system of government \nis its capacity for constant replenishment. Opportunities sometimes \npresent themselves unpredictably. That gives us a chance to reassess \nand realign in new and compelling ways, both to preserve important \ntraditions as well as to restore the future promise of our Nation.\n  A stronger America might be glimpsed through what I call four \ninterlocking principles, the first of\n\n[[Page H9267]]\n\nwhich is government decentralization; second, economic inclusion; \nthird, foreign policy realism; and, fourth, social conservation.\n  Let's take that first point. A return to a more decentralized \ngovernment will restore an important source of America's strength. When \nthe Federal Government grows beyond its effective purpose, it infringes \nupon basic liberty, it stifles innovation, it crushes creativity, and \nit impedes our responsibility for one another in the community.\n  A creeping tendency to nationalize every conceivable problem and \nnationalizing every conceivable discussion erodes the community's \ninput. While the Federal Government does have an important central role \nin maintaining the guardrails of societal stability, the rule of law, \nand a fair opportunity economy, America's governing system is designed \nto operate most effectively at varying levels. Those close to an \nopportunity or those close to a problem ought to have the first \nauthority to seize the opportunity or to solve the problem.\n  Second: economic inclusion. Economic inclusion should help America \nrecover from an arthritic economy. You see, Mr. Speaker, when power \nconcentrates in a Washington Wall Street axis, where the transnational \ncorporation is an emerging ruling entity and where small business--the \nsource of most jobs in America--is suffocated under increasingly \ncomplex dictates, the opportunity for a strong and vibrant marketplace \ndiminishes. A vibrant market actually expands the space for \nconstructive interdependency and community dynamism, fighting poverty, \nand driving innovation.\n  Third: foreign policy realism. Foreign policy realism should chart a \nnew course between isolationism and over-interventionism. America has \nan important leadership role to play on the world stage. Today, \nhowever, many Americans are alarmed by an exhausted, drifting, and \noften counterproductive foreign policy.\n  After World War II, America was cast in the role of the world's \nsuperpower and at great sacrifice. We, as a country, created the space \nfor international order. But now we live in a multi-polar world. Other \ncountries, which we helped empower through our generous sacrifice, must \ntake a seat at the table of responsible nations.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Leveraging America's strength through strategic international \npartnerships will help us navigate a 21st century that is marked by \never-shifting geopolitical frameworks.\n  The fourth point: social conservation. What does that mean? Social \nconservation preserves the condition for order, for opportunity, and \nfor happiness.\n  We must fight back against dimming hope and diminishing opportunity \nand darkening shadows. A healthy society depends upon more than \npolitics for the promotion of sustainable values. America has many \nmediating institutions, as we call it--important civic institutions, if \nyou will--which uphold greater ideas.\n  As an example, Mr. Speaker, I am a proud, long-time member of the \nRotary Club in Lincoln, Nebraska. At every Rotary Club meeting across \nthis country, in which hundreds of thousands of Americans participate, \nthere hangs a banner at the front of the club, and it reads: ``Is it \ntrue? Is it fair to all concerned? Will it build goodwill and better \nfriendships? Will it be beneficial to all concerned?''\n  Perfect. Beautiful. Perhaps we ought to hang the banner right here, \nMr. Speaker. That is a pretty good game plan.\n  As new leadership emerges on the national stage, perhaps this is the \nmoment to think critically about how we regain the high ground of \npurposeful government, an opportunity economy, a balanced foreign \npolicy, and a flourishing culture in a good society. We need to play \nall four quarters.\n  Ultimately, both the government and the marketplace are downstream \nfrom our culture; and with a heavy heart, I say this--everyone knows \nit--America's social fabric is fraying. Many people are experiencing \ndeepening anxiety about the future direction of the country. The recent \nattack in San Bernardino has only intensified the feeling. A crazed \ncouple, driven by its twisted religious ideology, murdered \nindiscriminately those at a social services center. It is a horrible \ntragedy and a grotesque irony, and our hearts feel for those who were \nso gravely harmed.\n  A genuine multiculturalism--long a hallmark of the American \nexperience--will continue to decay into discord unless two mutually \nsupporting conditions are sustained: a genuine appreciation of organic \ndifferences and a binding substructure of universal ideals and shared \nvalues. One such value is that we do no harm to others, and a religion \nthat teaches killing is no religion at all. Other important values \ninclude trustworthiness, thrift, citizenship, courteousness, and so on. \nBy the way, Mr. Speaker, a helpful list of these ideals, of these \nvirtues, is found in the Boy Scout Law.\n  This values crisis is compounding this three-part problem of \ngovernment overreach, economic exclusion, and cultural dislocation. A \ncentralizing government seems decreasingly able to understand, much \nless address, the needs of its citizens it should serve. In the midst \nof this divisive political season, partisan dysfunction, and \nbureaucratic inertia, it is all hindering the proper progress toward \naddressing our country's most pressing problems, and it overshadows \nimportant local initiatives where certain problems can best be solved. \nNot everything is a Federal issue. A private sector which is \nconsolidating corporate power, often underwritten by the State, is \ndisenfranchising the small business sector. A loss of genuine choice \nand genuine competition of economic pluralism reduces the ability of \npeople to participate, own, and innovate in a marketplace that is truly \nfree and can deliver widespread prosperity.\n  A culture of contrasting philosophies, more and more inflamed by \ncaustic rhetoric, is contributing to what some believe are \nirreconcilable social divisions. An impoverished account of \nindividualism, of a liberty reduced to autonomous choice and divorced \nof responsibility creates the conditions for social anarchy, which \nfurther creates the conditions for counterproductive government \ninterventions, lawless overreach, and intrusive market manipulations. \nThen add into this mix a confusing assortment of values choices that \nare driven more by experimenting elites than by the stability of sound \ntradition, and you have the recipe for harmful disruption. No wonder \nthere is so much sadness in the world.\n  As politicians and the media debate policy positions, we must \nunderstand that authentic solutions involve a return to essential value \npropositions. The application of proper principles to these problems \nwould enable us in Washington to better assuage widespread and \njustifiable angst with appropriate government policy, with appropriate \ngovernment decentralization, and with dynamic economic inclusion, \nsupported by a hope-filled culture. That is our answer.\n  As you enter my State--I live in Nebraska--the sign reads: ``. . . \nthe good life.'' A good life is found in freedom and responsibility. A \njust and orderly society is founded and sustained by persons who care. \nWhat we all do does really matter, just like my young teenage friend--I \nwould like to call her a ``friend''--displayed in the airport recently.\n  Mr. Speaker, late this summer, before school began, I took my younger \nchildren on a family trip to western Nebraska. Near Valentine, \nNebraska, which is in an area called the Sandhills, water from the \nunderground aquifer--it is called the Ogallala Aquifer--seeps out of \nthe ground and falls dramatically over rock formations and into a \nstream that then feeds into the Niobrara River. The area is called Fort \nFalls, and it is a part of the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge. \nThe stream's icy cold water flows like a river into the shallow warm \nwater that is running in the Niobrara. What is even more interesting to \nponder, as you look around, are the steep slopes on both sides of the \nbeautiful river. On the north bank, rocky hill formations are covered \nwith pine trees. On the south bank, the trees are much different. You \nsee the last reach of the eastern deciduous forest, with a mixed \nvariety of plants and hardwood trees just like you would see here in \nVirginia. It looks like California on one side, and across the river \nhere in Virginia on the other. Right there, where\n\n[[Page H9268]]\n\nI live in Nebraska, we are the geographic center of our country, where \neast meets west.\n\n  As a part of that trip, we also took a drive northward into the State \nof South Dakota, into the Black Hills, to a place called Mount \nRushmore. It happened to be the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally that weekend, \nso I and about 2 million other bikers were on the road. Everyone knows \nthe four faces on Mount Rushmore. Each of the four American Presidents \nembodied great qualities and faced significant challenges:\n  George Washington was a transcendent leader who purposefully walked \naway from power, giving our early Republic a chance to grow into a \nvibrant democracy;\n  Thomas Jefferson's life was seemingly full of conflicts and \ncontradictions, but his efforts gave rise to the Declaration of \nIndependence, which poetically expressed an understanding of the \ndignity and the rights of all persons, which so beautifully still \ninforms our culture and our government to this day;\n  Abraham Lincoln made a midcourse correction in his life. He rejected \nan early snarky, political, antagonistic attitude and turned toward a \nvision of that which is noble and good. His reputation as a skillful \nand humble leader extended well beyond the Civil War to many important \nendeavors, including the development of land grant institutions all \nover this country, like the University of Nebraska;\n  Theodore Roosevelt had to rebuild his life after his wife died at a \nyoung age. His boundless energy, translating into multiple \naccomplishments, perhaps helped him outpace a haunting melancholy from \nwhich he suffered. As an avid hunter, he grew to recognize the \nimportance of wildlife preservation. Beyond the natural places that he \npreserved, perhaps Roosevelt's greatest legacy was one of trust \nbusting--breaking up concentrations of economic power that locked so \nmany Americans out of a fair shot at economic opportunity.\n  Four great Presidents. Four men who sacrificed greatly to give us \nwhat we have today.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, many people in the country are experiencing a \nserious disquiet about all of these challenges that we are facing. They \nfeel disconnected from the ability to control their own well-being. \nThese concentrations of power are overwhelming the capacity of \nindividuals to shape their own environments. Political and economic and \ncultural cartels are growing more powerful, and, in some ways, they are \nmore hidden and destructive than in Roosevelt's time.\n  Of course, today, political problems are on everyone's mind. This \nconcentration of power stifles innovation and creativity; and as money \nflows into the political system, it pays for the polarization which \nhinders the ability of our body to find constructive solutions. This \ntranscends, by the way, the current partisan divide.\n  Our increasingly interconnected world offers significant benefits and \nopportunities to us, but globalization also introduces forces that can \nleave so many Americans feeling helpless. Transnational corporate \nconglomerates, often buttressed by oligarchic political systems, are \nshrinking the space for genuine choice and competition in the private \nsphere. As I talked about earlier, the stress of small business is very \nreal. This concentration of economic power endangers true free market \nprinciples, which should be working for the many.\n  On a deeper level, America's political disrepair and economic malaise \nsignal an underlying brokenness in our society, in our culture. \nPersons--humans--thrive in relationships with our families and \ncommunities in a healthy society, which creates the preconditions for \nthis human flourishing. Cultural consolidation and social discord have \nleft more and more people, again, feeling directionless and feeling \nalone. Weakening relationships and weakening social institutions \nforeshadow and prefigure political and economic problems. Ultimately, \nrenewing America--restoring America's government and economy--requires \nreclaiming a vibrant civil society, which is the true source of our \nNation's strength.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you have ever driven through those Black Hills, which \nI spoke of earlier--the one-lane tunnels and winding hairpin turns--\nthey form a very beautiful but a very arduous journey, even without all \nthe motorcycles around you. As you continue that journey, looking for \nsomething, an opening then appears in the trees, and you see it--that \nmagnificent piece of art, carved in stone, with four of America's \ngreatest Presidents.\n  Their likenesses are in the rock, timeless and unchanging; but the \nideals they represent must be reestablished in each generation. The \nrenewal of America will depend, in large part, on whether or not we can \ngrasp what these leaders stood for and whether or not we can make the \nsacrifices necessary to reclaim our country's potential in this time, \nour time.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we all do matters.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/10/house-section/article/H9268-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY.
