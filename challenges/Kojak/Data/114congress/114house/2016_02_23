Mr. Speaker, at approximately 8:40 p.m. \non February 25, 1991, an Iraqi Scud missile blasted through the \ntemporary barracks of the 14th Quartermaster in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.\n  Headquartered in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, the 69 members of the \nwater purification unit were deployed to Saudi Arabia for just 6 days \nwhen the attack occurred. Twenty-eight soldiers died that day, and 99 \nwere wounded, including 43 in the 14th.\n  The Scud attack proved to be the single most devastating attack on \nU.S. forces as the 14th Quartermaster suffered the single greatest \nnumber of casualties of any Allied unit during Operation Desert Storm. \nTo commemorate the 25th anniversary of this attack, I am introducing a \njoint resolution that honors the soldiers who were lost and wounded and \ntheir families.\n  The State of Pennsylvania lost more servicemembers during Operations \nDesert Shield and Desert Storm than any other State. A monument now \nstands in dedication at the Greensburg Army Reserve Center \ncommemorating the 69 names of the detachment soldiers. They were \nfathers, husbands, and sons. They were daughters and sisters. They were \nall citizen soldiers serving their communities, serving their country, \nand giving their lives to both.\n  I call on Members of Congress to cosponsor this resolution and honor \nthe service and sacrifice of the 14th Quartermaster of the United \nStates Army.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H821-7", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H821-H822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THANKING MEMBERS FOR VISITING FLINT, MICHIGAN\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated public \nservant of Louisiana, Mr. Leroy ``Slick'' Seal, who passed away \nrecently. He was 95 years old.\n  Mr. Seal was born on September 2, 1920, in Varnado, Louisiana, where \nhe was a lifelong resident and law enforcement officer. Leroy began his \ncareer in 1950 when then-Governor Earl K. Long appointed him to serve \nas the first marshal in Varnado.\n  When he left that post in 1954, he went on to work for the Louisiana \nDepartment of Wildlife and Fisheries until 1979. During that time, \nLeroy was selected by his peers as top woodsman and earned the position \nof major.\n  Mr. Seal moved from the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to serve \nas chief deputy of the Washington Parish Sheriff's office from 1981 to \n1991. He was elected chief of police in his hometown of Varnado in \n1992, where he served until 2008, though he continued to serve Varnado \nas a police officer until 2012.\n  Mr. Seal committed 60 years of his life to protecting the people of \nLouisiana. While in the line of duty as a law enforcement official, he \nwas inducted into the Louisiana Justice Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2013, \nhe was duly recognized by the Louisiana State Legislature where they \ndeclared September 2 Leroy ``Slick'' Seal Day.\n  Mr. Seal is survived by his children, Eathel Seal, Stanley Seal, and \nRandy Seal, as well as his 15 grandchildren and numerous great-\ngrandchildren, nieces, and nephews.\n  I commend Mr. Seal for all the work he has done for Louisiana. May he \nrest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H822-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BUNNY STEINMAN\n\n  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, when you run for public office, you get to \nmeet amazing people passionate about politics at every level. But the \nbest ones, the ones who inspire you, are the ones who remind you why \nyou got involved in the first place: to help others.\n  Today I rise in memory of one of the best. Bunny Steinman passed away \non January 20, but her impact on the Florida Democratic Party and our \ncommunity will surely last for decades.\n  Bunny was a born trailblazer. Long before retiring to south Florida, \nshe graduated from Syracuse. She earned a master's at Queens College. \nShe worked in public education for over three decades, all while \nraising three kids with her late husband, Joseph.\n  As her family mourns the loss of a mother and a grandmother, our \ncommunity mourns the loss of a friend, a leader, and a mentor.\n  Indeed, Bunny was so many things to so many people all at once. She \nwas a teacher who never stopped teaching, an activist who never stopped \norganizing, a Democrat who never stopped believing that America is \nstrongest when the right to vote is protected, when equal rights are \nrespected, and when every child has the chance to thrive.\n  Bunny Steinman, it was an honor to know you, to work with you, to \nrepresent you, and, most of all, to be your friend. We will honor your \nmemory by carrying forward your passion for progress and the betterment \nof all. You will continue to inspire us for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H822-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, last week our Nation lost an incredible man \nand jurist: Justice Antonin Scalia.\n  As a steadfast defender of the rule of law, Scalia was a pillar of \nthe Supreme Court for nearly 30 years. He was a man of God and a \nchampion of religious freedom.\n  In a recent speech, Justice Scalia reflected on the role of faith in \nsociety. While discussing his time in Rome in the aftermath of the 9/11 \nattacks, he recalled watching President Bush ask God to bless our \nNation and a later conversation he had with a jurist from a different \ncountry who expressed his own desire for his nation's leader to be able \nto publicly evoke God's name during a time of national crisis, as it \nwas forbidden.\n  This moving speech serves as a reminder of the importance of fighting \nfor our basic liberties that we hold so dearly. Justice Scalia, who \nconsistently demonstrated a deep understanding of what our Founding \nFathers intended, was a fierce and loyal leader in this fight.\n  It was through his strong adherence to our Constitution, his sharp \nanalytical mind, and his unwillingness to compromise his principles \nthat made him a brilliant jurist; though it was his unreserved vitality \nand unwavering love for his country that made him a widely admired and \nbeloved friend to his supporters and adversaries alike.\n  I had a chance to meet Justice Scalia a couple of different times and \nhear him and even talk with him and ask him questions. Indeed, I was \nblessed by that.\n  I rise today to extend my deepest sympathies to his family. He will \ncertainly be missed by our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H822-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 22, 2016.\n     Hon.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on S. 2109.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In the last 12 years, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or \nFEMA, has provided almost $100 billion in disaster relief and disaster \nassistance. However, a significant and increasing amount of these funds \nhave gone to cover FEMA's administrative costs that support the \ndelivery of disaster assistance.\n  The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, has been looking into \nthis for some time and found that, between fiscal year 1989 and fiscal \nyear 2011, the percentage of disaster assistance spent on \nadministrative costs doubled from 9 to 18 percent.\n  While FEMA has tried to implement internal controls to keep these \ncosts to a minimum, GAO has found that FEMA's administrative costs have \nnot decreased. In fact, GAO estimates that internal controls could save \nhundreds of millions of dollars in administrative costs.\n  S. 2109, the Directing Dollars to Disaster Relief Act of 2015, seeks \nto control and reduce rising administrative costs from major disasters \nby requiring the administrator of FEMA to develop and implement a plan \nto control and reduce its internal administrative costs.\n  I would like to commend and thank the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs for introducing \nthis important oversight measure, which will save taxpayer dollars.\n  I would also like to thank the Senate chairman for working with us to \nensure that the legislation includes a sunset provision and is \nconsistent with our House protocols.\n  As disasters become more frequent and severe, it will become critical \nto keep administrative costs in FEMA to a minimum, increase \nefficiencies, and ensure that resources are directed toward disaster \nvictims and the restoration of infrastructure.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n\n[[Page H824]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, S. 2109, the Directing Dollars to Disaster Relief Act of \n2015, requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to \ndevelop a plan to control and reduce its disaster-related \nadministrative costs and other activities.\n  The GAO has noted that FEMA's costs incurred in administering \ndisaster-related activities have increased substantially. FEMA has \nacknowledged the increase and has struggled to address this issue.\n  Most recently, in 2014, the GAO recommended that FEMA develop an \nintegrated plan to control and reduce disaster-related administrative \ncosts.\n  GAO also recommended that FEMA assess the feasibility of tracking \nadministrative costs by disaster program, such as public assistance and \nindividual assistance.\n  Finally, GAO recommended that FEMA clarify its guidance and minimum \ndocumentation requirements for State and local governments with respect \nto their direct administrative costs.\n  This bill, Mr. Speaker, will codify these recommendations and \nstatutorily require FEMA to take these actions.\n  I appreciate the improvements this bill will make toward reducing \noverall disaster costs and losses, but this is not enough. We must do \nmore to reduce these costs and losses, Mr. Speaker. There is no better \nway than to invest in predisaster mitigation.\n  I introduced H.R. 830 to reauthorize the predisaster hazard \nmitigation program. We consistently talk about the potential to reduce \ndisaster costs and save taxpayers money through predisaster mitigation.\n  In fact, our subcommittee has noted the reports by the Congressional \nBudget Office and the National Institute of Building Sciences \nMultihazard Mitigation Council, which found that predisaster mitigation \nsaves $3 to $4 for every dollar spent on mitigation activities.\n  But there is more. Predisaster mitigation activities save lives and \nreduce injuries. It is time to stop talking and do more. Let us, Mr. \nSpeaker, reauthorize the predisaster mitigation program at levels \nsufficient to significantly reduce disaster costs and save lives. Our \ncitizens deserve this.\n  I look forward to working with my good colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to make sure that these strides will come to fruition.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2109.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H824-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H824-H830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION REFORM AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                  2015\n\n  Mr. KATKO.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson \nColeman) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3584, the \nTransportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act.\n  This critical bipartisan piece of legislation ensures several \ncongressional oversight priorities for the Transportation Security \nAdministration are addressed, including the authorization of the \nPreCheck program, the advancement of risk-based security initiatives, \nthe enhancement of aviation worker vetting, and the improvement of \nairport screening technologies.\n  H.R. 3584 also takes numerous steps toward augmenting the \neffectiveness and efficiency of various TSA security programs within \nboth the surface and aviation transportation sectors, and it requires \nthe administrator to conduct an efficiency review of the entire agency.\n\n[[Page H829]]\n\n  Since assuming the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Transportation \nSecurity at the beginning of this Congress, I have worked tirelessly \nwith my colleagues to conduct rigorous oversight of this troubled \nagency. This bill is a direct result of our bipartisan efforts, and I \nam pleased to stand before you and have the House consider this \nimportant legislation.\n  If signed into law, this legislation will make a direct impact on the \nsafety and security of the traveling public and America's \ntransportation systems. In an era of pronounced and evolving threats to \nthe homeland, Congress must not wait to act in the best interests of \ntransportation security.\n  Further, the often misdirected nature of the TSA requires that we, as \nlegislators and overseers, fulfill our obligation to reform this \nfledgling agency into an intelligence-driven organization.\n  When I came to Congress, I pledged to my constituents that I would \nwork hard to deliver results. I am proud of all the work the Committee \non Homeland Security has done over the past year. I am honored to have \nthe privilege to sponsor so many pieces of legislation that are helping \nto keep our country safe.\n  I would like to thank Ranking Member Rice and Ranking Member Thompson \nfor their time and attention to this important piece of legislation. I \nwould also like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the \nchairman of the full committee, for his continued support of the \nsubcommittee's oversight efforts and for ensuring important pieces of \nlegislation, such as H.R. 3584, are considered on the House floor.\n  The Committee on Homeland Security's legislative results under the \nleadership of Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson are proof \nthat, by working together in a bipartisan fashion, not only can we \nimprove the security of our country, but we can demonstrate to the \nAmerican people that Congress can actually work together and deliver \nresults.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I rise in support of H.R. 3584, the Transportation \nSecurity Administration Reform and Improvement Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes language authored \nby Ranking Member Bennie Thompson to direct TSA to move away from how \nit identifies low-risk passengers for expedited airport screening.\n  In recent years, both the Department of Homeland Security's inspector \ngeneral and the comptroller general have been very critical about the \nsecurity risks of the so-called managed inclusion process. In response, \nRanking Member Thompson introduced the Securing Expedited Screening \nAct, which was included in this measure.\n  We all have an interest in TSA effectively managing airport \nscreening. Ensuring that a robust known-traveler program for low-risk \ntravelers is built into TSA's concept of screening operations just \nmakes sense.\n  That is why I support the expansion of the PreCheck program, under \nwhich expedited screening is provided to travelers who have been fully \nvetted prior to arriving at the airport.\n  I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes provisions to expand the \npublic's enrollment in the PreCheck program by, among other things, \ncoordinating with the private sector to deploy TSA-approved online and \nmobile enrollment centers.\n  Another key to the effective management of airport screening is the \nmaintenance of the security equipment. I am pleased that H.R. 3584 \nincludes language authored by Representative Rice, the ranking member \nof the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, to ensure that TSA puts \nin place systems to ensure that when it comes to security-related \ntechnologies at our Nation's airports, timely maintenance is done and \ndocumented.\n  According to the DHS inspector general, without proper maintenance \nand documentation thereof, the TSA could possibly have to resort to \nusing alternate screening methods, which could lead to the traveling \npublic being less safe.\n  H.R. 3584 also includes language adopted in the full committee to \nhelp businesses, particularly small businesses, to be able to create \ninnovative security technologies through public-private partnerships.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Over the years, we have seen the limitations of various security \ntechnologies in use at our airports. It is crucial that innovators \ncontinue to push the envelope in terms of detection and mitigation \ncapabilities.\n  Finally, as the Representative of a jurisdiction that relies heavily \non mass transit, I am pleased that the bill seeks to ensure that \nfrontline workers in our transportation sectors have the training \nneeded to react in worst-case scenarios. The thwarted terrorist attack \non a train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris last year underscores that \nmass transit continues to be a terrorist target.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are only a few of the examples of provisions \nwithin this bill that will help to improve TSA operations and bolster \nthe security of the American people. I urge support for this measure.\n  I want to close by noting the bipartisan work that went into this \nlegislation. There is still much to be done in the transportation \nsecurity space, but the legislation before us represents a step in the \nright direction to address issues within the surface and aviation \ntransportation sectors.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the issues addressed in H.R. 3584 are of vital concern \nto the safety of our Nation's security, and it is imperative that we \nsend this bill to the Senate today. Congress cannot afford to wait to \naddress critical issues that help advance and improve our security. I \nurge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 3584, the \nTransportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act, \nwhich would authorize, streamline, and identify efficiencies within the \nTransportation Security Administration.\n  As a Senior Member of the Homeland Security Committee, I served as \nchair of this subcommittee and continue to support its work to improve \ntransportation security.\n  I currently serve as the Ranking Member on the House Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations.\n  The work of the TSA is a front line Department of Homeland Security \nand it is not easy--it can in fact be very dangerous.\n  Like many of my Colleagues, I recall the shooting incident at LAX \nlast year that killed Gerardo Hernandez, who became the first TSA \nofficer killed in the line of duty; and the machete attack at the Louis \nArmstrong New Orleans International Airport earlier this year that \nresulted in injuries to Senior Transportation Security Officer Carol \nRichel.\n  Each day, TSA processes an average of 1.7 million passengers at more \nthan 450 airports across the nation.\n  In 2012, TSA screened 637,582,122 passengers.\n  The Bush Intercontinental and the William P. Hobby Airports are \nessential hubs for domestic and international air travel for Houston \nand the region:\n  Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through Bush Intercontinental \nAirport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P. \nHobby (HOU).\n  More than 650 daily departures occur at IAH.\n  IAH is the 11th busiest airport in the U.S. for total passenger \ntraffic.\n  IAH has 12 all-cargo airlines handling more than 419,205 metric tons \nof cargo in 2012.\n  I believe that Congress has not done all that it could to make \nemployees' work easier--Sequestration, a government shutdown, and a \ndelay in fully funding the Department of Homeland Security was not in \nthe security interest of the nation.\n  Reports issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and \nDepartment of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) have \nidentified shortcomings within the Agency, raising questions how \neffectively TSA is fulfilling its mission.\n  Allegations about mismanagement, wasteful procedures, retaliation \nagainst whistleblowers, low morale, and security gaps within the Agency \nare causes for concern.\n  Other issues related to inconsistent requirements between what is \nwritten and what employees are told is essential for them to \nsuccessfully meet the agency's standards for good performance needs \nwork.\n\n[[Page H830]]\n\n  The need for attention to TSA administrative procedures and due \nprocess within the agency to backstop decisions regarding reprimands or \nnegative actions toward employees can be an essential step in \naddressing some morale issues that are related to uncertainty regarding \nthe successful performance of duties.\n  In other words, the same conduct by persons holding the same level of \nresponsibility or positions within an airport results in the same \npositive or negative outcome.\n  TSA is charged with: The protection of America's transportation \nsystems; monitoring the movement of people and supplies during their \nuse of our transportation systems; and ensuring the effectiveness and \nintegrity of government agencies.\n  H.R. 3584, directs the TSA to: ensure that all screening of \npassengers and their accessible property will be done in a risk-based, \nintelligence-driven manner with consideration given to the privacy and \ncivil liberties of such passengers; and operate the ``TSA PreCheck'' \nprogram in a manner that provides expedited screening for low-risk \npassengers and their accessible property based on a comprehensive and \ncontinuous analysis of factors.\n  More needs to be done to support the men and women working on the \nfront lines of our nation's domestic security and that includes those \nwho work at the TSA.\n  I will continue to seek out opportunities to promote the mission of \nthe TSA and role that TSA professionals fill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3584, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H830-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H830-H831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL STRATEGY TO COMBAT TERRORIST TRAVEL ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. KATKO.

NATIONAL STRATEGY TO COMBAT TERRORIST TRAVEL.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it \n     should be the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) continue to regularly assess the evolving terrorist \n     threat to the United States;\n       (2) catalogue existing Federal Government efforts to \n     obstruct terrorist and foreign fighter travel into, out of, \n     and within the United States, as well as overseas;\n       (3) identify such efforts that may benefit from reform or \n     consolidation, or require elimination;\n       (4) identify potential security vulnerabilities in United \n     States defenses against terrorist travel; and\n       (5) prioritize resources to address in a risk-based manner \n     any such security vulnerabilities.\n       (b) National Strategy and Updates.--\n       (1) In general.--In accordance with paragraph (2), the \n     President shall transmit to the appropriate congressional \n     committees a national strategy (including, as appropriate, \n     updates to such strategy) to combat terrorist travel. The \n     strategy shall address efforts to intercept terrorists and \n     foreign fighters and constrain the domestic and international \n     travel of such persons.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson \nColeman) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a former Federal prosecutor, I have spent much of my \nlife focusing on keeping Americans safe; but when I assumed office, I \nwas taken aback by the lack of a coherent strategy to stop terrorists \nfrom infiltrating our country and to keep Americans from being lured to \nfight with jihadists overseas.\n  That is why I gladly accepted the opportunity to lead the bipartisan \nTask Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel. I worked \nclosely with my colleagues to identify our Nation's top vulnerabilities \nand to close them quickly.\n  Last September, we issued the Task Force's final report, marking the \nmost\n\n[[Page H831]]\n\nextensive public review since the 9/11 Commission of U.S. efforts to \nfight foreign terrorist travel. We made 32 key findings and more than \n50 recommendations in that report for enhancing our security. I am \nproud to say that, as of today, we have acted on almost half of those \nalready, including with several of the bills we are considering today.\n  H.R. 4408 would implement one of our top recommendations. It would \nrequire the President to send to Congress a National Strategy to Combat \nTerrorist Travel and an actionable plan to implement it.\n  It has been nearly 10 years since the White House produced such a \nstrategy, and since then, the threat has changed dramatically. Terror \nhas gone viral, and violent extremists are recruiting at the speed of a \nre-tweet.\n  The consequences for U.S. and international security have been \nenormous. We have seen terrorist groups balloon into terrorist \nmicrostates capable of fielding their own armies. In fact, today in \nSyria and Iraq, we are witnessing the largest convergence of Islamist \nterrorists in history.\n  Reports indicate nearly 40,000 individuals from more than 120 \ncountries have traveled there to join jihadist groups, including \nthousands from Western countries, like the United States. Many of these \nindividuals have easy access to our country and could potentially \nreturn undetected to launch attacks, just as we saw happen in Paris.\n  Yet, many of the counterterrorism programs we created after 9/11 are \nnot suited for this new era and have not kept pace with the evolving \nthreat. What is worse, there is no regular process in place in the \nexecutive branch for reviewing all of our defenses against terrorist \ntravel to find security gaps and develop a plan to close them.\n  Agencies are operating without clear, strategic guidance, and \nprograms to counter terrorist travel are often not fully coordinated \nacross the government spectrum. The result is that not only are we at \ngreater risk that terrorists will slip through the cracks, but we also \nare at greater risk of government waste, overlap, and duplication.\n  This bill would force the administration to assess all of the efforts \nin place to stop terrorists from crossing borders, streamline them, \nidentify security gaps, and prioritize taxpayer dollars where they are \nneeded most. It would also, for the first time ever, require the White \nHouse to produce a plan for intercepting foreign fighters.\n  After 9/11, we spent a lot of time focused on keeping terrorists from \ngetting into our country, but we did not spend enough time focused on \nstopping terrorists from recruiting our citizens to leave it and become \noverseas operatives. Once they travel to terrorist safe havens, these \nindividuals become a triple threat. They strengthen jihadist groups on \nthe ground, incite followers back home to conduct attacks, and can \nreturn battle-hardened and prepared to carry out their own acts of \nviolence on their homeland.\n  Make no mistake: we are at war. ISIS has already been linked to \nnearly 75 plots against the West, including more than 20 against the \nU.S. homeland. Our adversaries are clearly dead set on attacking this \ncountry. We need to show the American people that we are dead set on \ndefending it.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan work of the task force and grateful for \nthe close collaboration of Mr. Keating, Mr. Payne, and Ms. Loretta \nSanchez of California on the Democratic side. I would like to \nespecially thank Mr. Vela for his continued support and significant \ncontributions. I am, of course, indebted to my Republican colleagues on \nthe task force for their hard work as well. I also want to thank my \npersonal office assistant Tim Wang and committee staff Tyler Lowe and \nKaty Flynn for their excellent work on this as well.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4408, the National Strategy to \nCombat Terrorist Travel Act of 2016.\n  H.R. 4408 requires the development of a national strategy to combat \nterrorist travel by bolstering efforts to intercept terrorists and \nforeign fighters, while also constraining their domestic and \ninternational travel.\n  I applaud the work of the Committee on Homeland Security's Task Force \non Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel.\n  One of the many findings of the task force's final report was that it \nhas been a decade since the executive branch produced a government-wide \nplan to constrain terrorist travel. In the years since the issuance of \nthe last government-wide plan in 2006, many programs aimed at \nrestricting or preventing terrorist travel have changed or ended and \nnew programs have been created.\n  The task force found that hundreds of programs, projects, and \ninitiatives have sprouted up to combat terrorist travel since 9/11, but \nthere is no overarching strategy to coordinate them. Importantly, H.R. \n4408 requires that the strategy include an updated, full accounting and \ndescription of America's terror travel preventative and protective \nmeasures. This accounting should provide a valuable baseline for future \nefforts to prevent terrorist travel.\n  H.R. 4408 requires the President to submit to Congress a national \nstrategy focused on disrupting and intercepting terrorists and foreign \nfighters. The strategy is to include an accounting of all U.S. \nGovernment programs to constrain terrorist travel, identify gaps and \nhow they will be closed, and describe actions to eliminate waste, \noverlap, and duplication of efforts.\n\n  The evolving nature of the terrorist threat demands a whole-of-\ngovernment approach. A national strategy with implementation plans for \neach Federal agency involved, as H.R. 4408 requires, has the potential \nto deliver real security advances. As such, I support H.R. 4408, and I \nurge its passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this \nbipartisan bill, H.R. 4408.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4408, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H831-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H831-H833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DHS ACQUISITION DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. KATKO.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4398, the Department of \nHomeland Security Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act.\n  This legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to \nimprove management of its major purchases of systems to secure the \nborder, better screen travelers, protect our shores, and other vital \nmissions.\n  Too often DHS has failed to document what these programs will cost, \nwhen they will be complete, and what they will deliver. It is \nunacceptable to spend billions of taxpayer dollars and not document \nthis important information. H.R. 4398 will help our committee and \ncongressional watchdogs hold the Department accountable, and ensure \ntaxpayers dollars are being spent in an efficient and effective manner.\n  This bill uses language similar to H.R. 3572, the DHS Headquarters \nReform and Improvement Act, which also includes language that would \ncomprehensively reform DHS' acquisition process. H.R. 3572 passed the \nHouse unanimously in October of last year, but has yet to be acted upon \nin the Senate.\n  This important, bipartisan legislation will improve the oversight and \nmanagement of billions of taxpayer dollars. It would empower DHS \nleaders to hold programs accountable, increase transparency for \nCongress, and require DHS to articulate a roadmap for how it spends \nbillion of dollars to secure America.\n  Safeguarding Americans' hard-earned taxpayer dollars is why our \nconstituents sent us to Washington. I urge the Senate to act swiftly on \nthese bills to improve the management of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I commend Ranking Member Watson Coleman for her leadership on this \nissue, and I ask all Members to join me in support of this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4398, the DHS Acquisition \nDocumentation Integrity Act of 2016. I introduced this legislation to \nensure that, when it comes to managing acquisitions, the Department of \nHomeland Security gets the fundamentals right.\n  H.R. 4398 would require ``complete, accurate, timely, and valid'' \ndocumentation to be maintained for each of the Department's major \nacquisition programs. A major acquisition program is defined as one \nwith a life-cycle cost estimated at $300 million or more.\n  Later this week, the subcommittee on which I serve as ranking member \nwill be conducting an oversight hearing about an acquisition that is, \nto my mind, a textbook case of why my legislation is so critical.\n  After more than 12 years of effort at delivering a Department-wide \nhuman resource IT system and the expenditure of hundreds of millions of \ndollars, DHS has virtually nothing to show for it.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  That acquisition, the Human Resource Information Technology program, \nor HRIT, lacked basic acquisition documentation, including a valid cost \nestimate and schedule.\n  Under H.R. 4398, DHS would have to maintain current cost estimates \nand schedules for major acquisition programs. These sources of critical \ninformation for acquisition decisionmakers would have to conform to \nbest practices, as identified by the Government Accountability Office.\n  Additionally, each component head within DHS would be obligated to \nsubmit acquisition documentation to the Secretary for the production of \nan annual comprehensive report to Congress on the status of the \nacquisition. Under H.R. 4398, the Secretary could only waive these \nrequirements in very limited circumstances.\n  Mr. Speaker, for the reasons I have outlined here, I urge support for \nH.R. 4398.\n  Mr. Speaker, anything less than an up-to-date acquisition \ndocumentation increases the odds of cost and schedule overruns. It also \nrisks delayed delivery of critical capabilities and wastefully depletes \nresources that could be put to better use to protect the homeland.\n  The Homeland Security Committee favorably reported H.R. 4398 on \nFebruary 2 by a unanimous vote, and I thank my colleague for being a \npart of that.\n  The fact that this legislation is cosponsored by Representatives \nMcCaul and Thompson, the chairman and ranking member of our committee, \nreflects a strong commitment to bolstering the effectiveness of DHS \nacquisition programs.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 4398, a bill that will help ensure that DHS is \na good steward of taxpayer dollars and can provide DHS operators in the \nfield with the tools they need to protect the American people.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4398.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n4398, ``DHS Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act of 2016.''\n  I support this bill because it requires the DHS to produce cost \nestimates and schedules for all major acquisition programs and to \nmaintain complete and accurate documentation of these projects.\n  Specifically, for all programs expected to cost $300 million or more \nover its lifecycle, the department must maintain complete, accurate, \ntimely and valid acquisition documentation.\n  This bill will set a standard for all programs under DHS to follow \nand will save programs money and time.\n  Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed 22 major programs in \nDHS and out of 22 major programs:\n  1. GAO was unable to access six programs (including four in Customs \nand Border Protection).\n  2. The remaining 14 programs experienced schedule slips and cost \ngrowths.\n  On average, these program milestones slipped more than three and a \nhalf year, and their life-cycle cost estimates increased by $9.7 \nbillion, or 18 percent.\n\n[[Page H833]]\n\n  As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I believe this act \nwill maintain a standard across the board for programs to follow the \nGovernment Accountability Office's (GAO's) best practices.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is constantly changing to fit the \nneeds of our ever-changing world and there is a need of transparency \nbetween the DHS and GAO.\n  This bill further requires that cost estimates and schedules for \nmajor acquisition programs be consistent with best practices as \nidentified by GAO.\n  Finally this bill limits the Secretary's authority to waive \nacquisition documentation requirements for a report to Congress on the \nstatus of major acquisition programs.\n  This sets forth narrow conditions where waivers could be granted for \na fiscal year, and requiring the Secretary to report annually to the \nCongressional homeland-security committees on each use of waiver \nauthority during the preceding fiscal year.\n  This bill creates an accountability model for the DHS which creates \ntransparency between GAO and DHS and saves programs time and money, I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4398.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H833-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H833-H834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FOREIGN FIGHTER REVIEW ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. HURD of Texas.

Such review shall--\n       (1) include relevant unclassified and classified \n     information held by the United States Government related to \n     each instance;\n       (2) ascertain which factors, including operational issues, \n     security vulnerabilities, systemic challenges, or other \n     issues that may have undermined efforts to prevent the travel \n     of such persons to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria from the \n     United States, including the timely identification of \n     suspects, information sharing, intervention, and \n     interdiction; and\n       (3) identify lessons learned and areas for improvement to \n     prevent additional travel by such persons to a conflict zone \n     in Iraq or Syria, or other terrorist safe havens abroad, to \n     join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist \n     organization.\n       (b) Information Sharing.--If necessary, the President shall \n     direct the heads of relevant Federal agencies to provide the \n     appropriate information necessary for the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to complete the review required under \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Submission to Congress.--Not later than 120 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security shall, consistent with the protection of \n     classified information, submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees the results of the review required \n     under subsection (a), which may include information on travel \n     routes of greatest concern.\n       (d) Prohibition on Additional Funding.--No additional funds \n     are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) in the House of Representatives--\n       (i) the Committee on Homeland Security;\n       (ii) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence;\n       (iii) the Committee on the Judiciary;\n       (iv) the Committee on Armed Services;\n       (v) the Committee on Foreign Affairs;\n       (vi) the Committee on Financial Services; and\n       (vii) the Committee on Appropriations; and\n       (B) in the Senate--\n       (i) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs;\n       (ii) the Select Committee on Intelligence;\n       (iii) the Committee on the Judiciary;\n       (iv) the Committee on Armed Services;\n       (v) the Committee on Foreign Relations;\n       (vi) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; \n     and\n       (vii) the Committee on Appropriations.\n       (2) Material support or resources.--The term ``material \n     support or resources'' has the meaning given such term in \n     section 2339A of title 18, United States Code.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hurd) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson \nColeman) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, there have been over 250 cases of Americans attempting \nto travel to Syria and Iraq in order to support terrorist groups since \n2011. Overall, 85 percent of Westerners attempting to join groups like \nISIS are succeeding without being apprehended by law enforcement \nofficials.\n  The ability to make it to a war zone has grave consequences. Those \nwho have been radicalized gain firsthand knowledge and training, making \nthem an even greater threat.\n  There is a clear breakdown in our ability to identify and then \nprevent these individuals from leaving the country in the first place. \nThat is why I introduced the Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016.\n  The bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to study and \nidentify all known foreign fighter travel in an effort to highlight the \nspecific challenges and impediments that law enforcement faces in its \nattempts to stop individuals from joining terrorist groups in Iraq and \nSyria.\n  DHS should already be collecting this kind of data and conducting \nthis type of analysis. The findings from this type of study are crucial \nto informing Congress on additional steps we can take to improve the \nsecurity of our Nation. This was a key finding in the bipartisan Task \nForce on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, of which I was \na member.\n  It is imperative that we get the right information to the right \npeople at the right time to catch those who have been radicalized \nbefore they leave the country, not after they have gained combat \nexperience and returned to the homeland. The Foreign Fighter Review Act \nof 2016 is the first step towards getting our law enforcement agencies \nthe tools that they need to do just that.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4402, the Foreign Fighter \nReview Act of 2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4402 requires the President, through the Department \nof Homeland Security, to review information regarding persons who have \ntraveled or attempted to travel from the United States to Syria and \nIraq since 2011 to support terrorist organizations. This legislation \nreflects a recommendation issued by the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity's Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel \nin its final report.\n  The report found that a large number of U.S. persons have been able \nto travel to dangerous terrorist safe havens in Iraq and Syria and \nreturn to the United States without interdiction. I believe there is a \nlot to be learned from the instances where we failed to interdict \npersons who traveled to terrorist safe havens. These ``lessons \nlearned'' could reveal systematic weaknesses in our security programs \nand highlight areas for enhancements.\n  While many Federal agencies have completed individual reviews of \ncases within their purview, a coordinated and comprehensive interagency \nafter-action review has never been undertaken. H.R. 4402 would require \njust such a review.\n\n[[Page H834]]\n\n  H.R. 4402 has the potential to strengthen coordination across the \nFederal Government to help prevent U.S. persons from exploiting \nvulnerabilities in our security apparatus to travel under the radar to \nterrorist camps and safe havens in the future. As such, Mr. Speaker, I \nurge the passage of H.R. 4402.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).\n  Mr. KATKO. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, after having spent much of the last year heading a \nbipartisan task force with the author of this bill, Mr. Hurd, it became \nclear that we are not winning the fight to keep Americans from being \nrecruited by terrorist groups.\n  The majority of our citizens who have tried to go to join ISIS have \nsucceeded in doing so. They were not stopped by law enforcement. And \nwhile authorities have worked hard and have disrupted serious plots, we \nhave got to do more to shut down the foreign fighter pipeline.\n  On the House Homeland Security Committee, we are constantly briefed \nabout the new threat streams, the soaring number of terror \ninvestigations here at home, and the Americans being lured to fight in \nplaces like Syria alongside ISIS.\n  We cannot simply listen to this information and sit on our hands. We \nneed to act. I commend my colleague for this bill and for implementing \none of our important task force recommendations.\n  We need to conduct a top-to-bottom review of instances where \nAmericans were recruited to fight with jihadist groups abroad, and we \nneed to figure out where we could have done more to stop it. This is \nwhy I rise in strong support of H.R. 4402, the Foreign Fighter Review \nAct of 2016. This legislation will ensure that our government takes a \nhard look at how to better deter, detect, and disrupt terrorist travel, \nespecially when it involves our own citizens.\n  But this will not be some review that is ordered and then forgotten. \nThe administration is required to return to Congress with the ``lessons \nlearned'' from these recent cases so that we can fix the problem, \nrather than allow it to persist.\n\n  My colleague has a wealth of knowledge that proved to be invaluable \nduring the past year on the task force when we focused on these issues. \nI would like to conclude by thanking Mr. Hurd for his steadfast \nleadership, especially on national security issues.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I again urge passage of H.R. 4402, a bill that seeks to \nimprove the Federal Government's understanding of the circumstances \nsurrounding travel or attempted travel from the U.S. to terrorist safe \nhavens in Syria and Iraq.\n  Under this measure, the review is to be submitted to Congress within \n120 days of enactment. The findings of that review have the potential \nto inform policymakers as we work to strengthen our ability to prevent \ntravel to terrorist sanctuaries and terrorism at large.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4402. I \nwould like to thank both the gentleman from New York for his leadership \non the task force and my colleague from New Jersey for her work on the \nHomeland Security Committee.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4402 the \n``Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016,'' which requires the president, \nacting through the Homeland Security Secretary, to initiate a review of \nknown instances since 2011 in which a person has traveled or attempted \nto travel from the United States to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria to \njoin or provide material support or resources to a terrorist \norganization.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and \nthe Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security and Investigations, I take seriously threats to the \nsecurity of the homeland and our responsibility to put in place \nadequate measures to defeat them.\n  That is why in the first session of this Congress I introduced H.R. \n48 ``No Fly for Foreign Fighters Act,'' which reviews the completeness \nof the Terrorist Screening Database and the terrorist watch list \nutilized by the Transportation Security Administration.\n  I support H.R. 4402 because it would evaluate any flaws in existing \nprograms or procedures that aim to prevent such travel and identify \nways to improve their effectiveness.\n  Since 2011, more than 30,000 foreign fighters from over 100 different \ncountries have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIL.\n  In the last 18 months, the number of foreign fighters traveling to \nSyria and Iraq has more than doubled.\n  In the first six months of 2015, more than 7,000 foreign fighters \nhave arrived in Syria and Iraq.\n  According to a report issued last year by the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity's Foreign Fighter Task Force, U.S. officials apprehended less \nthan 20 percent (28/250) of Americans who sought to travel to the \nregion.\n  The report also found that while information sharing had improved, \nthere is currently no comprehensive global database of foreign \nfighters.\n  It is estimated that at 250 persons who have traveled to Syria or \nIraq to join ISIS hold American citizenship.\n  Since these persons who identify with the terrorist aims of ISIS can \nleave and enter the United States, it is critically important that \nAmerican customs and security officials have the most accurate and \neffective terrorist screening tools available.\n  H.R. 4402 helps address this problem by identifying areas for \nimprovement to prevent additional travel by ``Foreign Fighters'' to \nconflict zones in areas such as Iraq, Syria, or other terrorist safe \nhavens abroad, to join or provide material support or resources to a \nterrorist organization.\n  Specifically, H.R. 4402 directs the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security to conduct a review and report to the Congress on the \nfollowing:\n  1. Relevant unclassified and classified information held by the U.S. \ngovernment related to each instance:\n  2. The factors including operational issues, security vulnerabilities \nand systemic challenges that may have undermined efforts to prevent the \ntravel of such persons to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria, including \nthe timely identification of suspects, information sharing, \nintervention and interdiction.\n  3. The lessons learned and areas for improvement to prevent \nadditional travel by such persons to conflict zones or other terrorist \nsafe havens.\n  The bill also requires the President to direct the heads of relevant \nfederal agencies to provide to the Homeland Security Secretary the \ninformation needed to complete the review, which is due within 120 days \nof enactment.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging that progress has been made in \npreventing individuals inspired by the Islamic State and other Islamic \nextremist groups to either travel to Syria and Iraq or carry out \nattacks on U.S. soil, but we need to do more and remain ever vigilant \nto protect the security of our homeland.\n  H.R. 4402 is a positive step in the right direction and I urge all \nMembers to support this important legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 4402, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H834-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, Michigan has had some tough times lately--\nFlint and now Kalamazoo--which was rocked this past weekend by terrible \nrandom acts of violence that took six lives.\n  I rise today with my Michigan colleagues to offer support and \nencouragement for the victims' friends and families. We should continue \nto keep them in our hearts and in our minds.\n  I want to thank the countless folks on the front lines who helped \nprevent this tragedy from, yes, even being worse. The swift actions of \nthose on the ground deserve to be commended, particularly the Kalamazoo \nSheriff's Department, led by Sheriff Richard Fuller, Kalamazoo Public \nSafety Chief Jeff Hadley, and Mayor Bobby Hopewell.\n  I ask my colleagues and those who hear this message across the \ncountry to pray for the families of the six victims and the recovery of \nthe two injured, including 14-year-old Abigail Kopf of Battle Creek, \nwho is fighting for her life, and Tiana Carruthers of Richland \nTownship, who put herself in front of two children and was shot \nmultiple times.\n  It is heartbreaking, but we know that our Kalamazoo community can and \nwill recover from this tragedy. We will never forget what happened. We \nremember the lives of Mary Lou Nye of Baroda; Mary Jo Nye, Dorothy \nBrown, and Barbara Hawthorne of Battle Creek; and Tyler Smith and his \ndad, Richard Smith, of Mattawan.\n  This tragedy will not define us, it will not divide us, and it will \nnot defeat us. We are Kalamazoo.\n  I ask that the House pause for a moment of silence in honor of those \nimpacted by the tragic events in Kalamazoo.\n\n[[Page H836]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H836-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   FOREIGN FIGHTER REVIEW ACT OF 2016\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The \n3-2 victory marks the third State title for Eden Prairie in the last 11 \nyears. Eden Prairie was led by goals from Anna Gravelle and Rachel \nWerdin, along with a strong performance between the pipes by Alexa \nDobchuk.\n  Madam Speaker, it takes commitment, it takes hard work, and it takes \nteamwork and dedication to achieve a State championship. This is even \nmore especially impressive with the amount of time that these student \nathletes spend together in their studying, excelling in school, and \nparticipating in other extracurricular activities.\n  Congratulations to the players, to the coaches, to the families, and \nto the fans of the Eden Prairie Girls Hockey Team. Our community is \nvery proud of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H837-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, there is senseless gun violence.\n  Over the past weekend in our community, a young man who was 19 years \nold, who worked in a pizzeria, was gunned down. The story says that, \nduring this robbery, he attempted to respond to the killer's demands. \nIn spite of that, he was gunned down--murdered.\n  We have listened to the sad but eloquent comments of our colleagues \nfrom Michigan of vicious gun violence--of a person with 11 guns in his \nhome. Yes, as many say, people kill; guns don't--but they use guns to \nkill.\n  It is time for this Congress, as many police officers have said to \nme, to get its hands around the rampage of guns and gun violence, of \nsenseless killings, of bad guys--some good guys--killing people with \nguns. It is important to close the gun show loophole, to be able to use \nand to demand science and safety restraints.\n  I am appalled, but I am outraged. Enough is enough of innocent people \nbeing killed by gun violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H837-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE HOUSE WILL STOP THE CLOSURE OF GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, today, our administration announced that \nthey would go against the American people and shut down Guantanamo Bay \nCuba, GTMO.\n  The detainees being held at GTMO are there for one reason--our \nConstitution.\n  The administration wants to give the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, the same constitutional rights he took from \nnearly 3,000 innocent Americans whom he killed on September 11, 2001. \nAll of the detainees at GTMO were captured by our military on the \nbattleground, not by the police.

Mr. Speaker, today is our first \nopportunity to remember and honor the life and legacy of Supreme Court \nJustice Antonin Scalia, with a further tribute tonight by Congresswoman \nBarbara Comstock of Virginia.\n  I am grateful for Justice Scalia's lifetime of service to our country \nand his dedication to protecting and defending the Constitution. In the \nnearly three decades he served on the Supreme Court, he was renowned \nfor his brilliant opinion, sharp wit, and engaging debate with \nattorneys.\n  His dedication to a strict interpretation of the Constitution never \nwavered, and he was beloved by his colleagues on the Court. He promoted \nthe real constitutional intent, for judges to interpret the law, not \nlegislating undermining democracy.\n  Nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and confirmed \nunanimously by the Senate, Justice Scalia was the Court's voice for \nopinions that upheld conservative values, such as the District of \nColumbia v. Heller, defending the right to bear arms by the Second \nAmendment.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Maureen, their children, \nand grandchildren.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H838-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  (Mr. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. \nComstock) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority \nleader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and \nextend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the subject of \nthis Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this Special Order is meant to honor the \nlife and three decades of service of Associate Justice of the United \nStates Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.\n  Justice Scalia was a person of great joy, great intellect, great wit, \nand great faith. Our Nation suffered a tremendous loss on February 13 \nwith the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n  My husband Chip and I, my parents, and our children are deeply \nsaddened by the passing of our friend, our neighbor, and, of course, a \nlegal legend. He was a courageous advocate for the rule of law and the \nConstitution.\n  Justice Scalia and his wife, Maureen, raised an incredible family of \n9 children and 36 grandchildren, and we have been so privileged to know \nand love them.\n  Justice Scalia was both a larger-than-life Justice, who leaves a \nprofound legacy in the law, as well as a down-to-earth husband, father, \ngrandfather, and absolutely delightful friend who loved his Lord and \nGod, his wife and family, the law, the opera, his country, hunting, and \na good laugh.\n  We have all heard the stories of his friendship across the \nideological spectrum, none more famous than his friendship with Justice \nRuth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Scalia explained: ``If you can't disagree \nardently with your colleagues about some issues of law and yet \npersonally still be friends, get another job, for Pete's sake.''\n  Justice Ginsburg explained: ``As annoyed as you might be about his \nzinging dissent, he's so utterly charming, so amusing, so sometimes \noutrageous, you can't help but say `I'm glad that he's my friend or \nhe's my colleague.' ''\n  Justice Scalia was a shining example of fidelity, as he was ever-\nfaithful to his oath to the law, to his family, and to his God.\n  He was celebrated by so many in the legal community. He was a revered \nmentor to the dozens and dozens of clerks who lined the steps of the \nSupreme Court last Friday in his honor. And every one of them, no \ndoubt, had a story that had profound legal discussions in it but also \nended with a good laugh.\n  He simply will be irreplaceable and leaves a legacy that will be \nconsequential, discussed, and debated for the ages.\n  On the personal front, his life was also a great and consequential \nlife. Justice Scalia married his wife of over 55 years, Maureen, in \n1960. They were set up on a blind date. He told one author that Maureen \nwas ``the product of the best decision I ever made.''\n  His nine children--nine, how appropriate for a Supreme Court \nJustice--were split five and four, five boys, four girls. They became \nlawyers, a priest, a poet, an Army major, and parents themselves of \nthose wonderful 36 grandchildren.\n  Justice Scalia proudly gave the lion's share of the credit for \nraising this large brood to the resourceful, talented, and very smart \nlove of his life, Maureen, who, as her son Paul said in the homily, \nmatched him at every step. Justice Scalia said about his children ``and \nthere's not a dullard in the bunch.''\n  His son, Father Paul Scalia, was the celebrant for his father's \nbeautiful funeral mass with the assistance of dozens of priests at the \nBasilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception this past \nSaturday.\n  Father Paul began his moving homily saying: ``We are gathered here \nbecause of one man, a man known personally to many of us, known only by \nreputation to many more; a man loved by many, scorned by others; a man \nknown for great controversy and for great compassion. That man, of \ncourse, is Jesus of Nazareth.''\n\n[[Page H840]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Father Paul continued: ``In the past week, many have recounted what \nDad did for them. But here today we reflect what God did for Dad, how \nHe blessed him.''\n  Father Paul explained how his father understood that the deeper he \nwent into his Catholic faith, the better a citizen and public servant \nhe became. That faith now inspires his children and grandchildren and \ngenerations to come of the Scalia family and the so many lives he \ntouched and influenced.\n  Justice Scalia also had a rich tenor voice that intimidated many who \ncame before the Court in front of him, but as his son Christopher \nexplained, it was also perfect for reading stories to his \ngrandchildren. His rendition of ``The Night Before Christmas'' was an \nannual tradition. He also led many sing-alongs at parties, played the \npiano, and also that singing would go on and on for their long car \nrides.\n  Pictures with his children and grandchildren cover the walls and the \nend tables and the piano of the Scalia home, and in any picture with \none or more of those children or grandchildren or with his beloved \nMaureen, Justice Scalia would always be beaming whenever he was around \nhis family.\n  An only child himself, he loved that he gave his children the gift of \nmany brothers and sisters. No doubt that is a great solace to all of \nthem now, as well as a source of great strength and support for their \nmother.\n  May God bless Justice Antonin Scalia, a good and faithful son, and \nmay God bless his wife, Maureen, and their entire family, and the \nscores and scores of their friends and his colleagues and the millions \nmore of admirers, and may God bless the country that he so loved.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), \nthe distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I especially thank Congresswoman Comstock \nfor leading this tribute to Justice Scalia.\n  The Nation's legal lights faded recently with the loss of the great \nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but they will not be dimmed for \nlong, for Justice Scalia left a legacy of illumination that will \ncontinue far beyond his mortal years.\n  Although Justice Scalia is no longer with us on Earth, his cogent, \nwitty, and plain-spoken writings will continue to educate law students \nand good citizens everywhere for centuries to come.\n  Justice Scalia was no mere legal technician. He was a deep thinker \nwho had an uncommon knack for crystallizing powerful ideas into \ntrenchant, lasting prose. The journey on which he led his readers was \nalways a joy, always compelling, because Justice Scalia always made \nclear where the path started.\n  He once said: ``More important than your obligation to follow your \nconscience, or at least prior to it, is your obligation to form your \nconscience correctly.'' And for Justice Scalia, as with morality, so it \nwas with the law. Justice Scalia always made sure he built his argument \non a solid foundation: the Constitution, the supreme law of the land.\n  As a strong defender of the rule of law, he was a gentle legal giant. \nLike all great educators, Justice Scalia was respectful of others, \nregardless of their differing views. ``I attack ideas,'' he once said. \n``I don't attack people. And some very good people have some very bad \nideas. And if you can't separate the two, you gotta get another day \njob.'' That is a life lesson for all of us who engage in any debates \nand the ideas that undergird them.\n  In that spirit, Justice Scalia often said: ``My best buddy on the \nCourt is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has always been,'' and Justice Ginsburg's \nmoving tribute to her own best buddy should reduce every bitter \npartisan to tears.\n  Throughout his life, Justice Scalia correctly inveighed against the \nnotion of a living Constitution, the misguided idea that the \nConstitution's text and original meaning somehow shifted this way and \nthat with changes in popular attitudes.\n  Justice Scalia said:\n\n       That's the argument of constitutional flexibility and it \n     goes something like this: The Constitution is over 200 years \n     old, and societies change. It has to change with society, \n     like a living organism, or it will become brittle and break. \n     But . . . the Constitution is not a living organism; it is a \n     legal document. It says some things and doesn't say other \n     things.\n\n  As a lifetime-appointed Supreme Court Justice, Justice Scalia, like \nall other lifetime-appointed judges, had the opportunity to effectively \nalter the meaning of the Constitution if he wanted and could garner the \nsupport of four of his colleagues. But like George Washington refusing \nthe crown offered him, Justice Scalia rejected the notion the Supreme \nCourt should impose its own preferred policies on the country through \nstrained constitutional interpretations.\n  Instead, Justice Scalia was an ardent defender of democracy, \nrepresentative democracy. As he said: ``If you think aficionados of a \nliving Constitution want to bring you flexibility, think again. You \nthink the death penalty is a good idea? Persuade your fellow citizens \nto adopt it. You want a right to abortion? Persuade your fellow \ncitizens and enact it. That's flexibility.''\n  Justice Scalia's respect for article I of the Constitution, the \narticle that begins with these words, ``All legislative powers herein \ngranted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall \nconsist of a Senate and House of Representatives,'' that article, which \nclearly sets forth the powers of the Congress to legislate, not the \nexecutive branch and not the courts, is one of Justice Scalia's \ngreatest legacies.\n  As much as Justice Scalia will be remembered as an able critic of the \nnotion of a living Constitution, he will be remembered for his own \nliving dissents, and many majority opinions, which will live forever in \nthe hearts and minds of lovers of the law in America and around the \nworld.\n  Thank you, Justice Scalia.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his remarks.\n  I yield to my friend, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and colleague, the \ngentlewoman from Virginia, Barbara Comstock, for organizing this \nSpecial Order and for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, Father Paul Scalia said in his beautiful eulogy of his \nfather, Justice Antonin Scalia, on Saturday: ``We give thanks that \nJesus brought him to new life in baptism, nourished him with the \nEucharist, and healed him in the confessional. God blessed Dad with a \ndeep Catholic faith, the conviction that Christ's presence and power \ncontinue in the world today through His body, the Church.''\n  Mr. Speaker, last week our country lost one of its most outspoken and \ndedicated defenders of faith and liberty. For nearly 30 years, Supreme \nCourt Justice Antonin Scalia stood as a monument to a faith-based \nviewpoint on the Constitution that will be sorely missed.\n  There is no one in the history of our country who better protected \nthe original intent of our Constitution and upheld the God-given rights \nof all Americans than Justice Scalia.\n  Shown by his fierce dedication to defending our Constitution, from \nprotecting Americans from government intrusion to protecting the rights \nof the unborn, Justice Scalia was a man of conviction, a man of \npassion, and a man of integrity.\n  His honor and vigilance toward the original meaning of the \nConstitution and his historic dissents will ring throughout history. \nEvery single ounce of Justice Scalia's heart and soul was devoted to \nour country, his faith, and his family. His wit, his candor, and his \ncharacter will be missed on our Nation's highest Court. The legacy of \nJustice Scalia must never be forgotten.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand committed today to ensure we continue to \nprioritize faith and freedom in this country, protecting our natural-\nborn rights as citizens of the United States of America. It is simply \nthe right thing to do.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  When I was informed of the Justice's death, it came across my \nelectronic devices. I texted my wife back home, and I said: I just want \nto cry.\n  I had the extraordinary privilege of getting to know the Justice on a \nmore personal basis. In western Nebraska there is a large outcropping. \nIt is called\n\n[[Page H841]]\n\nChimney Rock. Chimney Rock was the place that marks the halfway point \nacross America. When the settlers crossed the great country, when they \ngot to Chimney Rock, they knew that they were halfway along their \njourney.\n  In the shadow of that rock, just this last December, I was in a duck \nblind with Justice Scalia who, as we all know, had that as an \navocation. When you spend a couple of days in a duck blind with \nsomebody, it is a bonding experience. You get to know them more \npersonally.\n  In my own reflections about what Chimney Rock meant to the country, a \nbridge between the past and the future, I thought it appropriately \ncaptured the character, the nature, the wisdom of the great Justice.\n  He was a great student of American history, our legal system, a great \nprotector of the Constitution and precedents. He understood how \nimportant it was to act in a consistent manner with principle while \nlooking forward and applying that principle in ever-changing \ncircumstances of American life. Because he did so with continuity and \nwith consistency, he was a man of great integrity. His inner voice \nmatched his outer voice.\n  When we saw this beautiful outpouring of support at his funeral from \npeople all across the political aisle, I think the common narrative \nthere was a deep respect for this great man.\n  Mr. Speaker, when he died, I felt like America lost her grandfather. \nHe was a soaring intellect, had an incisive wit, and had in a certain \nsense a humble personality. He loved to share a joke. For me to have \nthe privilege of spending some time in a personal intimate setting with \nhim I count as an extraordinary privilege of my time in public service.\n  May God rest his soul. May God grant him peace. May God continue to \nbless the United States of America and give us all the strength to \ncontinue to think through how we are going to elevate and form the next \ngeneration of Americans who can apply themselves in such an \nextraordinary, sacrificial way as Justice Scalia did.\n  I remember one other comment I wanted to leave with you. I remember \nwhen the Justice asked me: How many children do you have? You \nbeautifully talked about how he was so devoted to his family and faith. \nHe asked me, knowing that I knew he had nine, he asked me how many \nchildren. I said: I have five.\n  He paused. He said: Respectable.\n  That was it.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for her beautiful remarks and \nfor giving me this moment to honor this great American.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his lovely remarks. Five is \na good start, right, getting to that nine.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King).\n  Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding. I especially thank her for arranging this Special Order \ntonight in memory of Justice Scalia, who was truly a legal giant. He \nwas a man who surpassed all of the intellects that I have been aware of \nin my lifetime. Certainly no one in the legal profession has \ndemonstrated more of a love for the law, more respect for the law, and \nmore respect for the original intent of the Constitution.\n  Now, I have nowhere near the personal contact with Justice Scalia \nthat the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) did or the gentleman \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry). I did meet him on a number of \noccasions. I had the opportunity to speak with him. Usually our \nconversations consisted of talking about the fact that we lived in \nworking class neighborhoods in Queens. We grew up about a mile apart \nfrom each other. We both attended Jesuit high schools. That is about \nwhere the comparison ended as far as the Jesuit high schools, because \nhe was valedictorian and I was far from it. He was a person who had the \nstrength of somebody from the neighborhood, but he had the scholar's \nintellect.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  He had an intellect that went beyond tremendous intelligence. It was \nan intellect that was shaped and framed by his deep religious faith and \na belief in undiminished, lasting, and immutable principles. That is \nwhat reflected throughout his opinions. Yet he never let his own \nfeelings or prejudices influence his thinking.\n  That was certainly proven in the flag burning case. If there is \nanyone who loved his country and would oppose the concept of the act of \nflag burning, it was Justice Scalia. Yet he upheld the act as an \nexpression of free speech, as much as it pained him.\n  Something that many of us in politics and government have a hard time \ndoing is following the letter of the law, following the intent of the \nlaw, and following the meaning of the law. Somehow, we like to put in \nour own feelings and beliefs. The fact is Justice Scalia told us that \nthere is a higher principle than that.\n  Also he had such a respect for language. There were no easy words \nthrown about. There were no escape clauses or phrases. There was an \nintent and purpose and meaning to everything that he did. To read his \nopinions, whether in the majority--and knowing that he was in the \nmajority made us feel much better--or in his dissents, you realized, \nagain, how determined he was, how forceful he was, and how committed he \nwas to arriving at the correct decision--one which, again, followed the \noriginal intent of the Constitution.\n  There were several references by Barbara Comstock to his funeral \nservice on Saturday. Again, it was an expression by so many people of \ntheir love and respect for such an outstanding human being, a person \nwhom I doubt we will ever see the likes of again--certainly, in our \nlifetimes.\n  He was a giant of the law. He was a giant of his faith. He was a \ngiant of his country. I am proud to join with all of my colleagues \ntonight--especially Barbara Comstock, who arranged this Special Order--\nin honoring the memory of Justice Scalia and hoping that that memory \nlives forward to carry out his unmatched love for the law, love for his \ncountry, and love for his family and his religion.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman from New York for his kind words \nand for bringing a New York flavor here to such a wonderful man.\n  I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker).\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for \ntaking the initiative to honor such a great man.\n  In 1986, Antonin Scalia was nominated. I was a junior in high school. \nI am not sure it really resonated to me at the time what the next 30 \nyears would entail. I believe it is safe to say that not only is he one \nof the strongest conservative voices of our day, but he could be of all \ntime.\n  I think of his life and I think of the example that he left for all \nof us, whether in politics or not. It is one thing to be conservative; \nit is another thing to effective. He showed with his life that he did \nnot have to compromise his principles or his values to be effective.\n  When I look at his peers around him, Justice Ginsburg many times \ntalked about the friendship and the relationship she had with him. It \nwas genuine. He took Justice Kagan hunting. He taught her how to hunt. \nShe killed her first big deer with Justice Scalia at her side. What \ndoes that tell me? It tells me something that we need to remember: you \ncan connect with people, you can hold your values, but you can have a \ngenuine love for your fellow man.\n  There is much to be said about Antonin Scalia's faith. Obviously, he \nlived it, but he lived it in a way that set an example for all of us. \nYes, we get frustrated. It is okay to be angry--sometimes vertically, \nbut never horizontally--with our coworkers, our friends, our neighbors, \nand our family.\n  He set the mark. He set it high. He was someone that could work in, \narguably, the toughest environment in the world, yet still gain the \nrespect of his political archrivals. For that, I thank him. Tonight, I \nhonor him for showing us how to be both conservative and effective.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his remarks.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam).\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Comstock for \norganizing this tonight.\n  I just have a quick personal story, Mr. Speaker.\n  Justice Scalia's daughter, Ann, lives in my neighborhood. I served in \nthe State legislature, and I learned that this woman whose last name, \nobviously, was no longer Scalia, was the\n\n[[Page H842]]\n\ndaughter of Justice Scalia. So I called her up, and I said: If your dad \nis ever in town, I would love to meet him.\n  I was that guy, Mr. Speaker, who made that call, and she was very \ngracious.\n  Sometime later, she called me up and said: Peter, my dad is coming \nin. Why don't you and your family stop by.\n  So the Roskams ran around the corner. My wife, Elizabeth, myself, and \nmy four children, who were young at the time, went over and spent a few \nminutes on a Sunday afternoon with Justice Scalia. He was very \nmagnanimous and very gracious in his blue jeans and sweatshirt, getting \nup off the couch, but extending himself to us.\n  A couple of years later, I won a seat in the U.S. House. I thought: \nWell, I have got a little bit of a connection. I will reach out and \ncall him and try to make a courtesy call.\n  I made some contact with his chambers and his staff and they said: \nWell, would you like to come over and listen to an argument?\n  As a new Member of Congress, I said: I would love to go over.\n  So, over I go and listen to an argument in the Supreme Court. It is \nvery dramatic, as you know. I was walking out feeling a little bit let \ndown because I actually wanted to say hello to Justice Scalia. But not \nto be disappointed, his staff said: Come on with us.\n  So I went up to his office, and there in his chambers he set out a \nlunch. The two of us had lunch together.\n  Now, who I was having lunch with was not lost on me. The magnitude, \nthe scale, the capacity of this man and his ability to influence things \non a grand scale was not lost on me. Yet he was really willing to spend \nsome time with me that day.\n  I have got to tell you one other quick story.\n  A few years ago, I invited him to dinner. I said: Justice Scalia, I \nhave got a number of my colleagues that would love to have dinner with \nyou. Would you be willing to come out?\n  Of course, he did.\n  I told my wife afterward: This guy is so interesting and so charming, \nif he had a radio show, you would listen to it. You would set your \ntimer so that you could listen to him.\n  He was so interesting, so cleaver, and so quick and willing to take \nall kinds of questions and all kinds of debate and so forth.\n  I just want to close by saying this. There are many, many times when \nwe feel overwhelmed by events that are before us in our public life. \nThere are many times when our constituents feel overwhelmed and they \nget this sense of: Is there anybody out there that has got some level \nof judgment and wisdom and capacity here? Are there any examples and \nrole models?\n  The answer is: Justice Scalia. He is an example. He is an example \nthat we are all the beneficiaries of: his clear mind; his capacity to \ndisagree without being disagreeable; his capacity to build people up; \nhis capacity to articulate a world view; his capacity to be a faithful \nand vocal follower of his savior, Jesus, and not be defensive about it; \nand to basically invite people along to celebrate and to participate in \nthis great gift, which is our democracy.\n  Even in these short interactions that I had with him, you always got \nthe sense--or, I did--that he got the joke. In other words, there was a \ntwinkle in his eye.\n  This is a democracy and we have got roles to play. His role on the \nCourt was to do his thing. Our role, Mr. Speaker, is to legislate with \nthat same sense of commitment and character and tenacity and clarity \nthat Justice Scalia brought to his role on the judiciary.\n  So, I want to honor Justice Scalia. I want to honor his wife, Mrs. \nScalia. I want to honor his children and grandchildren. I thank them, \nbecause it is a sacrifice for them to have someone of that caliber and \nthat capacity in that role for our country. It is not a burden that is \neasy, but they have been willing to bear that burden. Our country is \nbetter off for it.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for those lovely memories.\n  In the outpouring that we saw in his passing, one of the pictures \nthat I saw from a neighbor was a picture of Justice Scalia, who was \nprobably coming home for a long day at work, and some children on our \nstreet had a lemonade stand. He had stopped and gotten out there to \nsupport those little entrepreneurs. The mom came out and took a picture \nof them. He was there beaming with those kids, in his suit, all dressed \nup, and these little kids are there with their lemonade stand and so \nproud.\n  He really did take the time that my friend, Mr. Roskam, spoke about \nand really just engaged and loved life so much.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. I thank my colleague from Virginia for organizing this \nfitting tribute to somebody who really, really did make a difference.\n  Very few people who serve not only in the judiciary, but really at \nany level of government, leave the lasting mark that Antonin Scalia \ndid. He will join the likes of John Marshall, Joseph Story, and Robert \nJackson as one of the all-time greats in American law.\n  I think of all the great things you can say about him. He was sharp, \nhe was witty, and he wrote brilliantly. I think the reason why he is a \ntitan of modern American law is because he insisted on discharging the \njudicial duty in a way that strengthened our overall constitutional \norder.\n  He insisted on textualism when you are interpreting statutes. He had \nan originalist outlook when you are talking about the constitutional \ninterpretation. Those frames of reference really vindicated the \nseparation of powers.\n  The judicial power under Article III is to decide cases and \ncontroversy. So you have cases before you that you have got to decide. \nIt is not to go out and be a roving superlegislature. It is not to \nimpose your philosophy on society. You decide cases.\n  So, once judges free their decisionmaking from the objective meaning \nof the law in the Constitution, they are taking away power belonging to \nthe American people that should be exercised through their \nRepresentatives. Justice Scalia always understood that. He was always \ninsistent that judges have an objective standard when they are \ndischarging their duty.\n  When you talk about textualism, you read the statute for what it \nsays. You don't correct the statute. You don't amend the statute. You \ndon't find subjective views of some random legislature who happened to \nsay something in a committee hearing. You actually apply the words as \nwritten. That is the judicial task.\n  When you do that, you are basically vindicating the power of the \nCongress and of the people's elected Representatives, because they are \nthe ones that wrote the law. If the courts depart from that, then they \nare departing from what the elected Representatives did.\n  I am sure he saw countless statutes that were asinine as a matter of \npolicy, but he said: That is not my job to correct that. So he is \nabsolutely vindicating the separation of powers in the constitutional \norder.\n  The same thing with constitutional interpretation. Before Justice \nScalia took the bench, this was a freewheeling thing. Judges would say: \nSociety matures and it is up to us to, effectively, update the meaning \nof the Constitution.\n  That means you have five lawyers--unelected, unaccountable--that \nserve as an effective roving constitutional convention that can change \nthe Constitution based on one case that happens to come in front of \nthem.\n  That was something that Justice Scalia thought was totally outside \nthe bounds of the proper judicial role. He says the Constitution has a \nfixed, enduring meaning, and it is our job as judges to ascertain that \nmeaning and apply it to the cases and controversies before us.\n  So, if you look at a figure that has had more impact on how we think \nabout the law and the Constitution over the last 50 years, you are not \ngoing to find one that surpasses Justice Antonin Scalia. He was a great \nAmerican in every respect. He fought the good fight. He finished the \nrace. He kept the faith. What a good guy. What a life.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nRothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from Virginia, for \norganizing this Special Order on behalf of this remarkable, remarkable \nAmerican.\n  On February 13 of this year, our country lost a giant. His legacy \nwill\n\n[[Page H843]]\n\nnever fade. Justice Scalia influenced countless jurists, attorneys, law \nstudents, and everyday Americans. My thoughts and prayers have been \nwith his wife, Maureen, Father Paul, and the entire Scalia family since \nthe passing of this outstanding American statesman.\n  Regardless of whether one agreed with his opinions on the Supreme \nCourt, this man's consistent integrity and admirable character cannot \nbe denied. In both word and action, he was a man of the strongest \ncharacter and deepest virtue.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  This was evident in the commencement address he gave to the \ngraduating class of the College of William and Mary in 1996, when he \nsaid: ``Bear in mind that brains and learning, like muscle and physical \nskill, are articles of commerce. They are bought and sold. You can hire \nthem by the year or by the hour. The only thing in the world that is \nnot for sale is character.''\n  The way he lived out the virtues of integrity and humility did not go \nunnoticed.\n  Several weeks ago, we here in Washington had the opportunity to go to \nthe National Prayer Breakfast, which attracted Members of Congress, the \nPresident, Senators, Ambassadors, people from all over the world, and \nwe were treated with an appearance by famed tenor Andrea Bocelli.\n  I think that Justice Scalia would have enjoyed his appearance and his \nappreciation for opera.\n  In addition to his wonderful renditions of ``Panis Angelicus,'' \nwhich, again would have been another treat for Justice Scalia, and \n``Amazing Grace,'' Mr. Bocelli lamented the dark shadow that war casts \non the world and expressed concern for its victims, identifying war as \na major problem in our world today.\n  But then it was interesting. Mr. Bocelli stated: ``There is that \nsmall, hateful word, `hubris,' already known in antiquity.'' The \nancient Greeks used it to define pride and the arrogance it entails.\n  Bocelli's use of the word ``hubris'' was compelling in that he spoke \nit in the center of power here in the United States.\n  That word conjures a theme that we have seen in Justice Scalia's \nwork. Justice Scalia went about his task of considering significant \nconstitutional and legal issues of the day with a profound and seldom \nseen humility about the role of courts in our country.\n  They are not there to impose their own beliefs on the people, but to \nadjudicate competing claims in the context of a Constitution that has \nenduring meaning.\n  To interpret the law in any other way otherwise aggrandizes power to \na select few, a power that was never intended by the Founders. This \nhumility of position that Justice Scalia had I believe will be a \nlasting legacy.\n  Regardless of whether one agrees with Justice Scalia from a policy \nperspective, his writings reflect a profound respect for an \nunderstanding of our system of government and an unparalleled respect \nfor an interpretation of the Constitution grounded in text and in \nhistory. For this our Nation should be forever grateful.\n  May he rest in peace.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman, and I thank all of my \ncolleagues for their comments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate this opportunity for all of our \ncolleagues to join us in celebrating the life of this great man, \nJustice Scalia, who so many of us were privileged to know and count as \na friend.\n  For anyone who would like to view the beautiful mass of Christian \nburial for Justice Scalia that was presided over by his son, Father \nPaul Scalia, who gave a beautiful homily, that can be found on C-SPAN. \nI appreciate that that was covered.\n  I also, again, appreciate this opportunity to celebrate this \nbeautiful life, this family.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H843-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H843-H847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WATER QUALITY AND SUPPLY ISSUES IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nGaramendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority \nleader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the earlier discussion about \none of America's most longstanding and most noted Justices. His passing \nis mourned by all of us.\n  I do, however, today want to move to a different subject. I want to \ntalk about, I think, one of the two most essential things that a human \nbeing needs to live. That is water and air. But today we are going to \ntake the former of those two subjects and really talk about water.\n  Two weeks ago I put this up for all to see. This is tap water from \nFlint, Michigan. There has been a lot of discussion over the last \nmonth, month and a half, almost 3 months now, about Flint, Michigan, \nabout the water supply in Flint, Michigan, lead in the pipes, lead \npipes, about the public health emergency that exists there, and about \nwhat we could and should do about dealing with Flint, Michigan.\n  However, Flint, Michigan is not unique. This is how they get water in \nEast Porterville. In the Central Valley of California, the San Joaquin \nValley, just south of Fresno, California, the water supplies in the \nEast Porterville area ran dry, in part, because of the drought, in \npart, because of inadequate water systems.\n  So the residents of East Porterville were required to get water from \na cattle water trough, pretty much like I have on my ranch, although, \nhopefully, this water is a whole lot cleaner. Porterville, California.\n  Now we have two examples, one from the Midwest, another one from the \nFar West.\n  Any other problems about water supply? Well, yes. There are other \nproblems about water supply.\n  This is a list of problems that we know exist in the United States--\nor most recently existed:\n  Flint, Michigan, we just saw that picture.\n  Toledo, Ohio, you remember, had to shut down the water system because \nof problems from algae blooms.\n  Sebring, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; Brick Township, New Jersey; \nWashington, D.C., lead release.\n  Wayne County, North Carolina; Greenville, North Carolina; Lakehurst \nAcres, Maine; Chicago, Illinois.\n  I decided not to put them all up there because it would take the rest \nof the evening to list all the communities in America that have water \nissues. And certainly we do in California.\n  I could put up another--well, maybe I will. Let me just put up a map \nof California. This is the largest population in the United States, \napproaching 40 million people.\n  And far north, the Pacific Coast, San Francisco Bay, Los Angeles, \ndown here, Santa Barbara, and way down here, San Diego, and somewhere \nover here, Arizona and Nevada, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the coastal \nrange, and the great Central Valley of California, where a whole lot of \nAmerica's food and food exports come from.\n  Down here in the Tulare Lake Basin, there are well over 100 \ncommunities who have contaminated water from nitrates and other harmful \nsubstances.\n  So the issue of clean water, you know, shortage of water down here, \nand contaminated wells up and down--oh. The Salinas Valley. Monterey \nBay and the great Salinas Valley, many, many of the wells in that area \nare also contaminated.\n  So we have got a water quality problem really throughout the United \nStates, and we certainly have one in California.\n  We have another problem in California. Let me put this up, a little \ndifferent map. The previous map, that one, nice and green. That is not \nCalifornia today.\n  We may be and probably are in the fifth year of the great California \ndrought. This is a picture of the California drought situation. The \nyellow is a little less than normal. The red, far less than normal. \nThis brown is really the way California will be as soon as this summer \ncomes on. And that is called exceptional drought.\n  So the great Central Valley of California, the coastal range down \ninto Los Angeles, even over to the east side of the Sierras, an \nexceptional drought. So the green California is really not so green.\n  Today we are about halfway through the rainy season in California, \nand the\n\n[[Page H844]]\n\ncurrent rain for the entire State is about 75 percent of normal. That \nis why you see this extreme drought occurring even as of February 18, \n2016.\n  The Sierra snowpack is less than normal but is still a whole lot \nbetter than last year, when it was zero, as in no snow.\n  So what are we going to do? Well, we need to do something. Otherwise, \nwe are going to have a whole lot more pain in California.\n  So what Senator Feinstein and I have been doing over the last several \nmonths is trying to develop a solution for the immediate drought, to \nmake the most of the water that is available, while still protecting \nthe endangered species, the great salmon runs of the Central Valley of \nCalifornia, and the coastal rivers, as well as the species that live in \nthe delta of California.\n  So we have been working, trying to put together a piece of \nlegislation that would provide as much flexibility as possible, while \nstill protecting the fish species and the flora and fauna of the State.\n  We think we have done it. We think we do have a piece of legislation \nthat will do that. We call that the operational portion of the \nlegislation. Senator Feinstein has already introduced that legislation.\n  I intend to do so in the very near future here in the House of \nRepresentatives so that we can have a statement from the House of \nRepresentatives about how we can solve the drought problem--well, not \nsolve it--do the very best we can in an extreme circumstance to deliver \nas much water as possible to the farms and the cities of all of \nCalifornia, while also protecting the endangered species.\n  Let me just put this up. This is the essence of the legislation. I am \ngoing to start here at the bottom and work towards the top. This is the \nshort-term provision of the bill. I will go into this in more detail in \na few moments.\n\n  The bill also has what we call long-term infrastructure needs. Those \nlong-term infrastructure needs are storage reservoirs, aquifers beneath \nthe surface of the earth, where we have groundwater--or we used to have \ngroundwater, surface storage.\n  There are several new and expanded reservoir opportunities available \nin the State, some of them on the streams and rivers--and, of course, \nthose will be controversial--and one or two that are off-stream, in the \nvalleys and the mountains where there are no active rivers, those being \nsomewhat less controversial.\n  So there is surface storage. There is underground aquifer storage. \nThat is this one right here. Authorized $600 million for water storage \nprojects, both aquifer as well as surface storage.\n  We also have this thing called conservation. Conservation is where \nyou can get the most water. For every gallon of water that you \nconserve, that is a gallon of water that would be available for other \npurposes or to extend what little you have available. So conservation \nplays a major role.\n  In this legislation, there is money for conservation. There is also \nmoney for this recycling. Now, much of the Midwest recycles water. In \nfact, the entire Mississippi River system is recycled water, water that \nis used upstream by some city, cleaned, put back in the river, reused \nagain as it flows down the Mississippi River and its tributaries. \nCalifornia doesn't do much recycling.\n  I don't have a map here of the--no, I don't.\n  But if one were to take a look at the whole Pacific Coast of \nCalifornia and the United States and Alaska and Central America and \nSouth America--so from Alaska all the way south to Chile on the West \nCoast, the Pacific Coast, of the Western Hemisphere--you would find \nthat the fifth biggest river in all of that vast stretch--the great \nrivers of Alaska and Canada, the Columbia River, the Sacramento River, \nthe Colorado River down here, and the rivers of Central and South \nAmerica--the fifth biggest happens to be right here, here, here, and \nhere.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  The fifth biggest rivers are the sanitation plants of California that \ntake water from up and down the entire area and from the Colorado all \nthe way from the Rockies, use it, clean it to a higher standard than \nthe day it arrives in the great cities of California, clean it to a \nhigher standard, and then they dump it in the ocean. This is utter \nfoolishness.\n  So in the Garamendi-Feinstein legislation, we have $200 million for \nwater recycling so that we can recycle that water, reuse it, and make \nuse of water that is already available.\n  We know, for example, that in Los Angeles there are approximately 1 \nmillion acre-feet of water that is not now being used. In fact, it is \nbeing dumped into the ocean. With this recycling program, 1 million \nacre-feet of new water can be available in southern California.\n  And, by the way, for those of you who are not familiar with \nCalifornia, we are talking about the Los Angeles basin here.\n  So the recycling in this basin can deliver 1 million acre-feet of \nwater over the next decade or so, and that water can be put back into \nthe great aquifers of southern California and even down into the San \nDiego area. These aquifers are now largely contaminated with various \ncontaminants, but they can be cleaned and the water recycled, put back \nin the aquifers, taken out, cleaned, and round and round it goes.\n  One million acre-feet: What does that mean to northern California, to \nColorado, our friends in Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada? It means that \nthat is a million acre-feet that Los Angeles, the great basin down \nhere, does not need to take from the Sacramento River in northern \nCalifornia or from the Colorado River, taking pressure off those \nrivers. And as you saw from the drought map, those rivers are in severe \ntrouble. So that is kind of a strategy that we put in place.\n  Now, we are not geniuses--well, maybe--no. We are not geniuses. But \nwhat we do know is that the State of California has already figured \nthis out.\n  So what our legislation does is to tie directly to, mirror, augment, \nand push forward what California did in the 2014 election, which is to \npass proposition 1, an almost $7 billion proposition for the \ndevelopment of water supplies for California.\n  So, look at this: Water conservation, storm water recapturing, \nincrease local and regional supplies, $810 million. Our legislation \nwould fit right in there with conservation and these other programs.\n  Safe drinking water. Remember talking about Porterville and water \ntroughs for cattle from which the kids were taking water? Here you have \nthe Safe Drinking Water Program. And guess what. It is in the \nFeinstein-Garamendi legislation.\n  Yes. There it is, money to help small communities through the Bureau \nof Reclamation expanding their WaterSMART and other programs so that we \ncan mirror, augment, supplement, and advance what California already \nwants to do when proposition 1 goes into effect.\n  Let's see. Water recycling. Didn't I just talk about that? Yes, I \ndid. So in the legislation that Senator Feinstein has already \nintroduced and what I will soon introduce here, we will be once again \nworking with the water recycling. Not as much money, but still a major \nFederal effort to work with the State to maximize the water recycling.\n  This is also not on this list, but also desalinization, which happens \nto work for some parts of California as well as other parts of the \nUnited States.\n  I talked about groundwater. Yes. Our legislation mirrors the \ngroundwater program that is in proposition 1, adds some additional \nmoney, and directs the Federal Government to work directly with the \nState on advancing the groundwater issues.\n  Now, for those of you that have been following the drought in \nCalifornia over the last several years--actually, the last several \ndecades--California has been excessively using its groundwater so much \nso that, in parts of the great Central Valley of California--maybe I \nwill put that map back up here--in the great Central Valley of \nCalifornia, particularly in this part of the Central Valley and the \nFresno area and south, we have seen a significant fall in the surface \nof the Earth.\n  It is literally sinking as a result of the groundwater being pumped \nout. In many places, you can go down through this area and you will see \nwells that are way, way above the ground and the ground is down here \nmaybe 10, 20 feet. You have seen subsidence in the area.\n  So the over-drafting in this area and some in the Sacramento Valley \nas well as in the Salinas Valley is a serious problem.\n  Part of what we want to do, mirroring what the State has already \ndecided to do with proposition 1, is to\n\n[[Page H845]]\n\nhave the Federal Government work with the State on addressing the \naquifers in this region to find ways to recharge the aquifers. There \nare many different ways that that can be done.\n  Some of it is simply pumping the water back into the ground rather \nthan pumping it out. In other areas, the geology in various parts, \nparticularly along the coastal mountains as well as along the Sierra \nNevada mountains, there are gravel channels, old river channels that \nhave historically recharged the groundwater basins in parts--actually, \nalong most of the Central Valley.\n  So it has to be done. This is what we are trying to do with this \nlegislation: Desalination research, which I discussed earlier, $100 \nmillion; water storage, $600 million; water recycling, $200 million; \nand $55 million for specific protections for the fish and wildlife \nspecies.\n  There is a whole series of projects that would fit into that. Once \nagain, all of this infrastructure work is designed to coordinate \nspecifically with what the State of California is doing with their \nmultibillion-dollar proposition 1.\n  This isn't in effect yet, but this money is now working its way \nthrough the various environmental studies and various levels of \ngovernment so that very soon these projects will be underway.\n  If we are able to pass the legislation that we want to introduce, we \nare going to see the Federal Government working very, very closely with \nthe State government in addressing the California problem.\n\n  Now, who cares about California? If you care about food, your fresh \nveggies, you had better care about California. Over here in the Salinas \nValley where lettuce comes from? Drought problems.\n  In the Central Valley, let's see. You name the crop, everything from \nrice to walnuts--oh, wine grapes are very, very important if you like \nyour wine. In the central coast down here, the same thing.\n  So what we are trying to do with the legislation is to provide a \nlong-term fix to California so that we can increase the supply of \nwater, increase the storage during the wet years, put the storage in \nreservoirs and in the aquifers so that, when the dry years come, then \nwe will do it.\n  There was a fellow by the name of Steinbeck. He wrote a book, ``East \nof Eden.'' In that book, he talked about the California droughts.\n  This is not a new situation, although 5 years and 4 years is \ndefinitely new. Usually, the droughts would be 1 or 2 years. But now we \nare looking at quite possibly a 5-year drought.\n  Steinbeck said this. It is not the exact quote, although I wish I had \nit. It was like this:\n\n       In the dry years, they worried about where their water \n     would come from. Then the wet years would come and they \n     forgot about the dry years.\n\n  That has been the story of California for too many--too many--\ndecades. Certainly Steinbeck saw that in the early part of the 20th \ncentury.\n  We are now in the 21st century and we cannot--we cannot--relive that \nold adage that Steinbeck wrote about.\n  So we need to build for the future. We need to be able to address \nthis in the immediate as best we can and put in place the water \nsystems.\n  I am going to describe those water systems to you just very briefly. \nHere in the north we have the great Shasta Reservoir up here on the \nUpper Sacramento River.\n  It could be raised. It could be increased. There are some \nenvironmental and certainly some cost issues associated with raising \nShasta. That is one of the proposals of possibilities in our \nlegislation.\n  The other one sits right about in here off stream. The Sacramento \nRiver flows down through the middle of the valley here, but off-stream \nover here in my district actually is a potential reservoir that has \nbeen talked about for maybe 50 years now called Sites Reservoir.\n  It stores about 1.8 million acre-feet of water. It could deliver \nannually 500,000 acre-feet of water. That is a lot of water. That is 1 \nfoot of water across 5,000 acres. Did I say 5,000? It is 500,000 acres. \nSo that is the Sites Reservoir over here.\n  That reservoir also does something really unique. Since it is off-\nriver, it will take the water flowing down the Sacramento River during \nthe heavy storms, put that water into the reservoir, and then, when \nsummer comes or the drought comes, that water can be released back into \nthe Sacramento River, providing water quality issues here in the Delta \nof California--and I will come to that in just a few moments--creating \nflexibility on the great reservoirs--Shasta, the Yuba system, the \nFolsom Reservoir here in Sacramento, and the big California reservoir \nin Oroville--allowing the operations of those reservoirs to be modified \nin such a way that they are able to store water rather than releasing \nit down the river for fish and wildlife.\n  It would then be able to release water from Sites Reservoir and keep \nthat water back in these reservoirs. A major problem in Sacramento is \nthat the Folsom Reservoir is at low tide. I will have tomorrow \nrepresentatives from the east Sacramento area in my office, all of them \nsaying: Oh, my goodness. We don't have enough water in Folsom Reservoir \nfor our cities of Rancho Cordova, Roseville, and the like, east of \nSacramento.\n  So Sites Reservoir could provide more water in the Sacramento region \nby keeping that water in the Folsom Reservoir.\n  Let's talk a little bit about the delta. I guess I had better finish \nthe other reservoirs. Down here in the Fresno area on the San Joaquin \nRiver we have the big Friant Reservoir on the San Joaquin.\n  There is a bit of a problem with Friant. It managed to dry up the San \nJoaquin River, creating a big, big problem for the salmon. They don't \ndo very well in dry rivers.\n  So there is an effort underway to try to restore some of the salmon \non the rivers in the San Joaquin Valley, the Stanislaus, the Merced, \nand the other rivers as you move down towards the San Joaquin.\n  There would be a new reservoir that is proposed here at Temperance \nFlat. Is it possible? Yes. Is it environmentally controversial? Oh, \nyeah. No doubt about that. And it is expensive.\n\n  But, nonetheless, our legislation would authorize a continuation of \nthe studies to see if it is worth doing. So that would be the \nTemperance Flat.\n  Over here on the hills to the east of Oakland there is another \nstorage reservoir off-stream, and that one is called Los Vaqueros. Los \nVaqueros is a reservoir that is controlled by the Contra Costa Water \nDistrict.\n  They now have agreements with other water districts in the bay area \nto increase the size of that reservoir to store more water at that \narea. Again, that is off-stream.\n  It would take the high winter flows and put that water in storage \noff-stream as with Sites Reservoir to the north of it, all very, very \nimportant.\n  So these are the essential projects that would be long term for \nCalifornia. Again, they would be the surface storage reservoirs, two \noff-stream and three potentially on-stream.\n  They would be recharging the aquifers and the various infrastructure \nneeded to do that, recycling in the great cities of Los Angeles, San \nDiego, and in the bay area to recycle water and, also, dealing with the \ncontamination that occurs in many of the cities in the Central Valley, \nthe San Joaquin Valley particularly, a little bit up here in the \nSacramento Valley, and a lot of problems in the Salinas Valley in this \narea.\n  So those are the essential elements of the long term--I forgot \nconservation and desalination. So those are the long-term projects that \nare both in proposition 1 of the California water bond of 2014 and, \nalso, in our legislation.\n  The second piece of the legislation deals with the operation of the \ntwo great water projects. These are the largest water projects in the \nworld, although China is building one that might actually be bigger.\n  But, as of today, the largest water projects in the world are in \nCalifornia. What they basically do--maybe I will back up here a bit. It \nwould be great if my colleagues here really had a sense of what is \nhappening.\n  The basic water projects of California take the water from the \nSacramento Valley, the Sacramento River, Mount Shasta up here, and the \nTrinity River, bring that water in through the Shasta Reservoir, hold \nthe water there, and then send the water down the Sacramento River to \nthe delta.\n\n[[Page H846]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  From the delta, that water is picked up in canals--two of them, one \noperated by the Federal Government, the other one operated by the State \nof California--and brings that water--the Federal Government--down into \nthe San Joaquin Valley, where it provides hundreds of thousands of \nacres of irrigated agricultural production.\n  The other part of that project is here on the San Joaquin. That takes \nwater down the east side of the valley, all the way to Kern County, \ndown here in the Bakersfield area, and north up into the Madera County \narea here. That is called the Friant-Kern system. That is the Federal \nwater project.\n  The State water project, like the Federal, takes the water out of the \ndelta here and brings it down in the canal, all the way down here, \nproviding water to Kern County, and then pumps that water 2,000 feet \nover the Tehachapi Mountains through tunnels and canals into southern \nCalifornia. It flows down through the western part of the Mohave Desert \ndown here, and then flows into the Los Angeles area, and also into the \nPalm Springs area all the way over here. That is the California water \nproject.\n  Some of that water flowing into the Metropolitan Water District is \nthen available for the cities and water districts of southern \nCalifornia, all the way down to San Diego and into the Coachella Valley \nover here in the Palm Springs area. It is one huge water project, all \nof it dependent on the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western \nHemisphere. There is no other estuary anywhere from Chile to Alaska as \nlarge and as important to the aquatic species and birds as the great \ndelta of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system.\n  Unlike many deltas, this is an inland delta. This is the beginning of \nSan Francisco Bay here. It goes on out. The Golden Gate Bridge and San \nFrancisco are just further to the west.\n  Once again, the water flows southward down the Sacramento River, past \nthe city of Sacramento, and flows down through the delta, picked up by \nthe great pumps here at Tracy into the canals, and down the canals to \nthe San Joaquin Valley and on to southern California.\n  Here is the problem: the pumping has significantly altered the \necology of the delta and, when coupled with the drought, has created a \nsituation that has led to a very serious potential of the extinction of \nspecies in the delta, particularly the delta smelt. Because of the \nalteration of the Sacramento River system's normal flow, the salmon, \nwhich would normally migrate up the Sacramento River all the way to \nMount Shasta and beyond or down the San Joaquin River system to Fresno, \nthat migration pattern has been seriously altered.\n  In normal years, the management of the river is such that the salmon \nare able to get along, not as well as they once did when it was said \nyou could walk across the river on the back of salmon--you can't do \nthat today for sure--but, nonetheless, in a normal year these river \nsystems, excluding the Lower San Joaquin, are able to produce a \nsignificant salmon run.\n  In the delta, the delta smelt have been under great pressure since \nthe pumps were put in. The smelt is a little, tiny fish, but it happens \nto be like the foundation fish--all the bigger fish eat it. And it is \nalso what we call the canary in the coal mine. If you remember what \nthat is all about, you use canaries in a coal mine. When the canary \nkeels over, you have got a serious problem because you are the next to \nkeel over--bad air.\n  Well, here these delta smelt are considered to be the canary in the \nwater. When they are in deep trouble--and they are today--the question \narises: Is the entire ecosystem of the delta going to collapse? We \nthink not. But California is severely stressed. California is still in \ndrought. Today, the rainfall in California is 75 percent of normal. \nThat is for the entire State. For the Sacramento region, February is 22 \npercent of normal, and I think we are rapidly approaching the end of \nFebruary.\n  What that means for the delta is extraordinary stress--extraordinary \nstress--and a monumental California water fight. My great-grandfather \ncame to California in the 1860s to mine for gold. During that time, \nthere was a fellow out there by the name of Mark Twain, who was writing \nabout the gold rush and other things that were going on in California.\n  He said a couple of things that are really interesting. About San \nFrancisco, he said that the coldest winter he ever spent was summer in \nSan Francisco. I think he was referring to the fog. He also said that \nin California in the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s, he said: ``Whiskey is for \ndrinking; water is for fighting over.''\n  So it has been. During the Gold Rush period, it was all about water. \nYou couldn't mine for gold unless you had water, and people fought over \nwater. They built incredible systems to get their hands on the water \nthat came out of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\n  Today, it is the same. We still fight about water. What Senator \nFeinstein and I are trying to do is to reduce the friction, reduce the \nfighting that has been going on for the last decade, or last 5 years, \nabout water as it flows through the delta.\n  My San Joaquin Valley colleagues, Democrat and Republican, have put \nforth two pieces of legislation that they believe would solve the water \nproblem for them. What they have managed to do with that legislation is \nto basically wipe out the environmental protection for the species--\nsalmon, smelt, and other species in the delta--and simply say: Turn the \npumps on. We need the water. We have got the votes. We are going to get \nthe water.\n  Those two pieces of legislation have not become law, and they never \nshould become law, because if they did, the largest estuary on the West \nCoast of the Western Hemisphere would be in serious jeopardy.\n  What we propose is to work within the environmental laws and the \nbiological opinions that have been put forth by the Federal and State \nfish and wildlife agencies and the National Marine Fisheries Service--\nthe National Marine Fisheries Service concerned about the salmon; the \nfish and wildlife agencies concerned about the endemic species of the \ndelta--to work within those biological opinions which are designed to \nprotect those species and say the flexibility that is allowed under the \nEndangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the biological \nopinions are sufficient to allow for the maximum amount of pumping to \nthe south from the delta consistent with the protection of the species.\n\n  In order to accomplish that, we need to use science. The biological \nopinions are based on about 13- to 15-year-old science. What we are \nsaying in our legislation is ramp up the science.\n  Senator Feinstein was able to deliver $100 million to California fish \nagencies to put in place realtime monitoring. She was not able to write \nhow that could occur, so in the legislation we would direct the \nagencies to conduct real-time monitoring, daily monitoring. As the \nwinter flows--and there have been winter flows thus far this year, not \nenough, but they are there. As those winter flows enter the delta from \nthe north and the south, the fish agencies study where are the smelt, \nwhere are the salmon coming down the Sacramento River, and also from \nthe San Joaquin River.\n  If they are near the delta pumps, reduce the pumping, or don't pump \nat all, depending where those fish are. If they are not, if they have \nmoved away from the pumps and there is water in the system, then turn \nthe pumps on. Pretty simple: if the fish are endangered, reduce the \npumping; if the fish are not endangered, then increase the pumping.\n  That is essentially what our legislation would accomplish. There are \nother elements to it, for example, putting in fish screens at the Delta \nCross Channel on the Georgiana Slough, and also to improve the levee \nsystem within the delta.\n  We will see. We will see what happens here. We have a choice as \nMembers of Congress and men and women that are supposed to solve \nproblems. We can go the way of my San Joaquin Valley colleagues and \nsimply push aside, negate, the environmental laws that provide for the \nprotection of the salmon, the great fishing industry of California, the \nsalmon runs up and down the coast.\n  By the way, the salmon that come out of the Sacramento River provide \nsalmon all the way to the Columbia River in Oregon. So it is not just \nabout San Francisco Bay. It is about the salmon and the fishing \nindustry for much of the West Coast, also south through Monterey Bay.\n\n[[Page H847]]\n\n  Can we wipe out the environmental laws and simply turn the pumps on? \nYes, if that legislation were to pass that has been offered by my \ncolleagues from the San Joaquin Valley. Or we can work within the \nenvironmental laws, achieving maximum flexibility, understanding the \nscience: Where are the salmon or the salmonoids? Those are the salmon \nthat have hatched and are coming back down the river, little, tiny \nsalmon. Where are they? Are they coming down the river and getting \nsucked to the pumps, or are they coming down the river and heading out \nto the bay? We don't know today. We are not doing real-time monitoring.\n  If we did real-time monitoring, we would know where they are. We \nwould know where the delta smelt are and other species, and we could \nadjust the pumping to protect the species and to take advantage of the \nhigh flows that occur during the normal winters and also this year, \neven though it is well below normal.\n  I have confidence. I have confidence in the wisdom of the \nCalifornians who decided that they would pass a water bond to put in \nplace long-range solutions for California--recycling, conservation, \nstorage systems, underground aquifers--and to develop safe drinking \nwater. I have confidence in the wisdom of California because they voted \nby over 60 percent for this project.\n  I have confidence in the Congress. I have confidence in the Senate. \nSenator Feinstein has come up with a good bill. I had the honor to work \nwith her on that bill, and I will soon introduce that bill here in the \nHouse.\n  I have confidence that we have the wisdom and we have the \nunderstanding of the systems of California water to maximize over time \nthe water potential of California. And in the near term, in the near \nterm when California, this great State that we would like to see as \ngreen, when California is faced with this, I have got confidence that \nwe are wise enough and we are smart enough politically to maneuver \nourselves into a situation where we can address the current drought to \nthe maximum extent possible, delivering water to the San Joaquin Valley \nand on into southern California without harming the fish, without \ndestroying the salmon of California and the fishing, the multibillion-\ndollar fishing industry that goes with it, and without jeopardizing the \nlargest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere.\n  That is our challenge. This is what we are going to try to \naccomplish. Senator Feinstein's bill has been introduced. That version \nwill be introduced over here in the next several days as we develop a \nbetter understanding among my colleagues of what we are trying to \naccomplish here.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  I have confidence that the representatives of the southern California \narea will see the wisdom of putting aside what Mark Twain said we \nalways do in California: Fighting over water and getting about drinking \nmore whiskey. Probably a pretty good idea.\n  I think we are going to get southern California support for this. I \nthink the San Joaquin Valley folks will look at this and say: Well, we \ncan continue fighting as we have for the last 5 years with no progress, \nnone, nada, zero.\n  Let's see if we can figure out how to do this in a way that protects \nthe species, the salmon, the other fish, that protects the largest \nestuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere, and that provides \nthe maximum amount of water that is available to California, which, by \nthe way, has an economy that is ranked seventh in the world. So water \nis really important.\n  I know we can do better. I know that this Nation doesn't have to have \nthis kind of water in Flint, Michigan. I know that this Nation doesn't \nhave to have children in the Central Valley of California getting their \nwater out of a cattle water trough.\n  I know that this Nation doesn't have to destroy the largest estuary \nand all of the fish, all of the salmon, and all of the industry that \ngoes with that in its quest for water and that what little is available \ncan be shared and maximized.\n  That is what we are going to try to do with the Feinstein-Garamendi \nlegislation. I know we can do it. I know we have to do it. I know, at \nthe end of the day, we are not going to destroy. We are going to build, \nwe are going to create, and we are going to solve the problem.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H847-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H847-H850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN TRIBUTE TO UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA, A \n                            PREEMINENT MIND\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in tribute to one of the \ngreatest jurists in this Nation's history. Justice Antonin Scalia had a \npreeminent mind following an excellent education. He has a beautiful \nfamily and has already been very sorely missed.\n  I thought it might be helpful, Mr. Speaker, to get a sense of the man \nand how profoundly concerned he was with the place in which this \ncountry finds itself after world wars, after depressions, after all \nkinds of threats: a massive civil war in the 1860s, all kinds of things \nthat have threatened this Nation, even the War of 1812 during which \nthis Capitol was set on fire.\n  There were all of these threats; yet, at this time in which we live, \nhe could see and he tried to sound the warning alarms for what the \nmajority of the Supreme Court was doing to this country.\n  It seemed to be encapsulated rather well back in the June 12, 2008, \ndecision in the case of Boumediene vs. George W. Bush, President of the \nUnited States, combined with another case.\n  The decision of the majority of the Court, as Justice Scalia pointed \nout, was so totally inconsistent with the majority's own majority \nopinion in a prior case regarding people who were captured on the \nbattlefield and who were clearly at war with the United States.\n  Throughout the history of warfare at least among civilized nations \nduring the period of warfare, the civilized thing to do was to hold \nthose who were at war with you until such time as the groups they \nrepresent, they come from, declare they are no longer at war with you.\n  Then they can be released unless they have committed some heinous \ncrime for which they should account beyond that of being part of the \nwar against the Nation.\n  The Supreme Court majority had previously said basically that, of \ncourse, the Constitution gives the Congress the power to create \ntribunals, to create courts.\n  As my former constitutional law professor said, there is only one \nCourt in the whole country's Federal system that owes its creation to \nthe U.S. Constitution, and that is the U.S. Supreme Court. All other \nFederal courts, tribunals, owe their existences and their jurisdictions \nto the United States Congress.\n  So the majority Court had previously said, in effect, that Congress \ncould, in cases where enemy combatants are seized on the battlefield, \nhold them without right of writ of habeas corpus, because that has \nbasically been the history of civilized warfare.\n  Obviously, in uncivilized warfare, people were taken, abused, \ntortured, made slaves. That has happened throughout the history of \nmankind. But for nations that were civilized, you simply held them, \nhopefully, in humanitarian conditions.\n  In the Boumediene case, Justice Scalia starts his dissent by writing:\n  ``I shall devote most of what will be a lengthy opinion to the legal \nerrors contained in the opinion of the Court. Contrary to my usual \npractice, however, I think it appropriate to begin with a description \nof the disastrous consequences of what the Court has done today.''\n  Justice Scalia goes on:\n  ``America is at war with radical Islamists. The enemy began by \nkilling Americans and American allies abroad: 241 at the Marine \nbarracks in Lebanon, 19 at the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, 224 at our \nembassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, and 17 on the USS Cole in \nYemen.\n  ``On September 11, 2001, the enemy brought the battle to American \nsoil, killing 2,749 at the Twin Towers in New York City, 184 at the \nPentagon in Washington, D.C., and 40 in Pennsylvania.\n  ``It has threatened further attacks against our homeland; one need \nonly\n\n[[Page H848]]\n\nwalk about buttressed and barricaded Washington or board a plane \nanywhere in the country to know that the threat is a serious one. Our \nArmed Forces are now in the field against the enemy, in Afghanistan and \nIraq. Last week, 13 of our countrymen in arms were killed.\n  ``The game of bait-and-switch that today's opinion plays upon the \nNation's Commander in Chief will make the war harder on us.''\n  What comes next is, perhaps, one of the most profound statements that \nany Justice on the Supreme Court ever put in writing, but he was right. \nAnd being right in his discernment of the Supreme Court's decision, he \nknew he needed to put this next sentence in print.\n  So, in talking about the majority opinion, Justice Scalia wrote this:\n  ``It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.''\n  He wrote:\n  ``That consequence would be tolerable if necessary to preserve a \ntime-honored legal principle vital to our constitutional Republic. But \nit is this Court's blatant abandonment of such a principle that \nproduces the decision today. The President relied on our settled \nprecedent in Johnson vs. Eisentrager''--this was back in 1950--``when \nhe established the prison at Guantanamo Bay for enemy aliens. Citing \nthat case, the President's Office of Legal Counsel advised him `that \nthe great weight of legal authority indicates that a federal district \ncourt could not properly exercise habeas jurisdiction over an alien \ndetained at Guantanamo Bay.'''\n  Further down, the Justice writes:\n  ``In the short term, however, the decision is devastating. At least \n30 of those prisoners hitherto released from Guantanamo Bay have \nreturned to the battlefield.\n  ``But others have succeeded in carrying on their atrocities against \ninnocent civilians. In one case, a detainee released from Guantanamo \nBay masterminded the kidnapping of two Chinese dam workers, one of whom \nwas later shot to death when used as a human shield against Pakistani \ncommandos.\n  ``Another former detainee promptly resumed his post as a senior \nTaliban commander and murdered a United Nations engineer and three \nAfghan soldiers. Still another murdered an Afghan judge. It was \nreported only last month that a released detainee carried out a suicide \nbombing against Iraqi soldiers in Mosul, Iraq.\n  ``Their return to the kill illustrates the incredible difficulty of \nassessing who is and who is not an enemy combatant in a foreign theater \nof operations where the environment does not lend itself to rigorous \nevidence collection.''\n  Justice Scalia goes on:\n  ``During the 1995 prosecution of Omar Abdel Rahman, federal \nprosecutors gave the names of 200 unindicted coconspirators to the \n`Blind Sheikh's' defense lawyers; that information was in the hands of \nOsama Bin Laden within two weeks.''\n  Justice Scalia went on to write page after page, explaining the \nperils that the overzealous and underthinking majority of the Court had \nimposed on the United States, on our military.\n  Justice Scalia made clear, when it comes to war, the decision that \nthe majority made was to basically tell our military: Instead of \nprotecting yourselves and protecting your brothers and sisters in arms, \nwe are going to require you to go out there, gather up DNA evidence, \nget blood evidence, maybe just drive a forensic wagon out there onto \nthe field of battle. Start gathering evidence because some moronic \nperson in a palace in Washington--``palace'' being what some of the \nJustices who first went through the new Supreme Court building said \nabout it back in 1935, that palace in which they reside--has said that, \nin a time of war, we have lost our mind in America, and we are going to \nnow start putting our military at risk of their very lives so they can \ngo gather up evidence to satisfy some bloated judge in a palace in \nWashington.\n  That is why he made the profound statement that he did in this \ndissent.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  His words will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed. \nThat is extraordinary.\n  Dear Justice Scalia finished the dissenting opinion by saying: \n``Today the Court warps our Constitution in a way that goes beyond the \nnarrow issue of the reach of the Suspension Clause, invoking judicially \nbrainstormed separation-of-powers principles to establish a manipulable \n`functional' test for the extra territorial reach of habeas corpus \n(and, no doubt, for the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional \nprotections as well). It blatantly misdescribes important precedents, \nmost conspicuously Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court in Johnson \nv. Eisentrager. It breaks a chain of precedent as old as the common law \nthat prohibits judicial inquiry into the detention of aliens abroad \nabsent statutory authorization. And, most tragically, it sets our \nmilitary commanders the impossible task of proving to a civilian court, \nunder whatever standards this Court devises in the future, that \nevidence supports the confinement of each and every enemy prisoner.\n  ``The Nation will live to regret what the Court has done today. I \ndissent.''\n  What a magnificent man. What a brilliant man with extraordinary \ncommon sense.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, my staff helped me. We have all been picking out \nfavorite quotes that Justice Scalia has provided, both in written \nopinion and in speeches.\n  One of Justice Scalia's statements was: ``Never compromise your \nprinciples, unless, of course, your principles are Adolph Hitler's, in \nwhich case you would be well-advised to compromise them as much as you \ncan.''\n  Another statement by Justice Scalia was: ``More important than your \nobligation to follow your conscience, or at least prior to it, is your \nobligation to form your conscience correctly.''\n  Justice Scalia said: ``You think there ought to be a right to \nabortion? No problem. The Constitution says nothing about it. Create it \nthe way most rights are created in a democratic society. Pass a law. \nAnd that law, unlike a constitutional right to abortion created by a \ncourt can compromise.''\n  Justice Scalia said: ``A Constitution is not meant to facilitate \nchange. It is meant to impede change, to make it difficult to change.''\n  Brilliant statement.\n  Some think the Constitution is a living, breathing document. I have \ndiscussed this over at the Supreme Court palace with him, and I have \ndiscussed it with him at lunches, breakfasts.\n  There are a handful of special privileges that I count myself blessed \nto have been able to enjoy, and one of those handful has been time \nspent with Justice Scalia. He had an incredible sense of humor. He \ncould crack me up. Most of the time, he meant to. Sometimes his sarcasm \nwas just too humorous not to laugh. And he attacked himself with self-\neffacing humor.\n  He said this: ``I attack ideas. I don't attack people. And some very \ngood people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't separate the \ntwo, you've gotta get another day job.''\n  He was a funny man, but a brilliant man. God blessed that man with \nwisdom.\n  Justice Scalia said: ``I love to argue. I've always loved to argue. \nAnd I love to point out the weaknesses of the opposing arguments. It \nmay well be that I'm something of a shin kicker. It may well be that \nI'm something of a contrarian.''\n  He said: ``Well, we didn't set out to have nine children''--talking \nabout his beautiful family. He said: ``We're just old-fashioned \nCatholics, you know.''\n  Justice Scalia said: ``I think Thomas Jefferson would have said the \nmore speech, the better. That's what the First Amendment is all \nabout.''\n  Today I see around our college campuses conservatives like me are \noften shunned. I am grateful to have been invited to speak at Oxford in \nEngland and at Cambridge. But it is amazing that places like my \nconservative Texas A, there are students there--much fewer there, but \nall over the country at what are supposed to be enlightened \nuniversities--that don't want to hear any view different from \nthemselves.\n  When I was at A, I mean, I helped host Ralph Nader. I didn't agree \nwith him on much, but I loved the exchange with him, the thoughts that \nwent back and forth. He was a very intriguing man. We weren't afraid of \ndiscussions with liberals.\n  It is one of the things I loved about Justice Scalia. He was so \nbrilliant, so\n\n[[Page H849]]\n\ngrounded. His faith was so strongly standing on God's Word, the Bible. \nHe knew who he was. He knew whose he was, and he knew whose was his, \nand he loved his family dearly.\n  Justice Scalia said: ``Undoubtedly, some think that the Second \nAmendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride \nof our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal \nsecurity, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps \ndebatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this \nCourt to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.''\n  It was absolutely a great dissent. Pointing out the hypocrisy, the \nflawed thinking, the incredible poor quality of the writing in the \nmajority opinion in the ObamaCare decision, Justice Scalia said: ``This \nCourt, however, concludes that this limitation would prevent the rest \nof the act from working as well as hoped. So it rewrites the law to \nmake tax credits available everywhere. We should start calling this law \nSCOTUSCare instead of ObamaCare.''\n  The Supreme Court of the U.S. care, how about that?\n  He went on to say: ``Under all the usual rules of interpretation, in \nshort, the government should lose this case. But normal rules of \ninterpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of this \nCourt: The Affordable Care Act must be saved.''\n  He goes on. It says: ``If a bill is about to pass that really comes \ndown hard on some minority and they think it's terribly unfair, it \ndoesn't take much to throw a monkey wrench into this complex system. \nAmericans should appreciate that; they should learn to love the \ngridlock. It's there so the legislation that does get out is good \nlegislation.''\n\n  Mr. Speaker, it brings to mind a discussion I heard him have with \nsome people from my district, some senior citizens that were coming to \nWashington, 50 or 60. They had asked me: They say you are friends with \nJustice Scalia. Do you think we could meet him?\n  I felt comfortable enough to call him. He said: Sure. Bring them.\n  So we worked it out, brought them through the side entrance, came \ninto a meeting room. They were all seated there when Justice Scalia \ncame walking in. He leans up against the table in front of them, and \nthey were kind of in awe because they knew how brilliant Justice Scalia \nwas.\n  He said: Well, you wanted to meet me. Here I am. What questions have \nyou got?\n  It kind of took the group aback, so people were struggling to try to \ncome up with a question. Finally, one of them said: Well, Justice \nScalia, wouldn't you say that we are the freest Nation in the history \nof the world because we have the best Bill of Rights?\n  In typical Scalia style, he said: Oh, gosh, no. The Soviet Union had \na much better bill of rights than we have got. It guaranteed a lot more \nfreedoms than we have.\n  And I've forgotten, but in college I made an A on a paper that \ndiscussed the Soviet constitution and the bill of rights. He was right. \nThat old Soviet bill of rights guaranteed all kinds of rights, but it \ndidn't protect them.\n  He went on to say--and I am not quoting exactly--but the gist of what \nhe had to say is, now, the reason America is the most free Nation in \nthe history of the world is because the Founders didn't trust the \ngovernment, so they made it as difficult as they could to pass a law. \nIt wasn't enough to have one House; they wanted two Houses, and not \nlike England where one of them doesn't have all that much authority. \nThey wanted two Houses where either one of them could stop a law from \nbeing passed. So even if one House were successful in finally getting a \nmajority of people to agree on a law, then the other House would have \nto agree, and they could stop it completely in its tracks.\n  That wasn't good enough. They wanted another check and balance, \nanother way to stop law. They wanted to create gridlock. So they said: \nYou know what? We don't want a parliamentarian system where the \nlegislators elect a prime minister. No. We want an executive elected \ntotally different from the legislature. So we will have him elected in \na whole different way, and then he can stop any law they may try to \npass. And that is not good enough. Let's create another branch, the \njudiciary branch, and then they can nix anything that is passed.\n  No, we are the most free Nation in history because the Founders \ndidn't trust government and they made it as hard as possible to pass \nlaws.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Justice Scalia says in one of his dissents: ``I have \nexceeded the speed limit on occasion.''\n  He said: ``A man who has no enemies is probably not a very good \nman.''\n  He said: ``If you read the rest of the section, you would say, to \nfind a way to find a meaning that the language will bear that will \nuphold the constitutionality. You don't interpret a penalty to be a \npig. It can't be a pig.''\n  He did know how to bring things back to tangible terms.\n  He said: ``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have \nto resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the \nconclusions you reach. If you like them all the time, you're probably \ndoing something wrong.''\n  I've experienced that myself. There were times I disagreed with the \nlaw, but it was constitutionally made and passed, and I followed the \nlaw as a judge and chief justice. That is exactly what he did.\n  In a dissent in 1996, Justice Scalia said: ``The Court must be living \nin an another world. Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a \nConstitution for a country I do not recognize.''\n  Ten years later, in 2006, he says: ``So the question comes up, is \nthere a constitutional right to have homosexual conduct? Not a hard \nquestion for me. It's absolutely clear that nobody ever thought when \nthe Bill of Rights was adopted that it gave a right to homosexual \nconduct. Homosexual conduct was criminal for 200 years in every State. \nEasy question.''\n  He made those statements in remarks at the University of Fribourg, \nSwitzerland, back in 2006.\n  In 2009, he said: ``The Court today continues its quixotic quest to \nright all wrongs and repair all imperfections through the Constitution. \nAlas, the quest cannot succeed.''\n  He also said: ``This case, involving legal requirements of the \ncontent and labeling of meat products such as frankfurters affords a \nrare opportunity to explore simultaneously both parts of Bismarck's \naphorism that `no man should see how laws or sausages are made.'''\n  He said: ``God has been very good to us. One of the reasons God has \nbeen good to us is that we have done him honor.''\n  Certainly, Justice Scalia did God honor.\n  A lot of people don't realize what a tenderhearted man he was as \nwell. After the horrendous murder of Justice Michael Luttig's father \nand the assault and attempted murder of his mother in their own garage, \ntwo streets over from my house, the family did not want to call Michael \nand describe the horrors that had been inflicted on his father and \nmother.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  Middle of the night, Justice Scalia is in bed. Justice Scalia gets \ncalled, would he go out to Michael Luttig, Judge Luttig's house, and \nlet him know in the wee hours of the morning that his father had been \nkilled. Justice Scalia, for whom Judge Luttig had clerked, he knew \nMichael Luttig loved him. He put on his warmup suit and went out in the \nmiddle of the night many miles away because he cared.\n  As I conclude, Mr. Speaker, I thought about the words of John Quincy \nAdams in the Amistad case. He didn't think he had won the case. He was \nfinishing. He was afraid he had not done an adequate job defending \nthese Africans who should be free and should be free to go where they \nwanted without chains, without bondage.\n  So he finished his argument by saying, and this is John Quincy Adams, \n1841, in the Supreme Court:\n  ``As I cast my eyes along those seats of honor and public trust, now \noccupied by you, they seek in vain for one of those honored and \nhonorable persons whose indulgence listened then to my voice. Marshall, \nCushing, Chase, Washington, Johnson, Livingston, Todd--where are they? \nWhere is that eloquent\n\n[[Page H850]]\n\nstatesman and learned lawyer who was my associate counsel in the \nmanagement of that cause, Robert Goodloe Harper? Where is that \nbrilliant luminary, so long the pride of Maryland and of the American \nBar, then my opposing counsel, Luther Martin? Where is the excellent \nclerk of that day, whose name has been inscribed on the shores of \nAfrica, as a monument of his abhorrence of the African slave trade \nElias B. Caldwell? Where is the marshal? Where are the criers of the \nCourt? Alas, where is one of the very judges of the Court, arbiters of \nlife and death, before whom I commenced the anxious argument, even now \nprematurely closed? Where are they all? Gone. Gone. All gone. Gone from \nthe services which, in their day and generation, they faithfully \nrendered to their country. I humbly hope, and fondly trust, that they \nhave gone to receive the rewards of blessedness on high.''\n  In taking, then, his final leave of the bar there at the Supreme \nCourt, John Quincy Adams said he hoped that every member of the Supreme \nCourt may go to his final account with as little of earthly frailty to \nanswer for as those illustrious dead.\n  And he said: ``That you may, every one, after the close of a long and \nvirtuous career in this world, be received at the portals of the next \nwith the approving sentence: `Well done, good and faithful servant, \nenter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' ''\n  Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt whatsoever that Justice Antonin Scalia, \nmy friend, our friend, the luminary of the Supreme Court, heard those \nwords days ago: ``Well done, good and faithful servant.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H850-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Perry (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \nattending a funeral.\n  Mr. Hastings (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today through \nFebruary 26.\n  Mrs. Napolitano (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and the \nbalance of the week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/house-section/article/H850-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 2451.
