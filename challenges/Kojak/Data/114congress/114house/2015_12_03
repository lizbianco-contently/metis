Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember \njournalist and community leader Tom Coffey.\n  Last week, Tom Coffey died at the age of 92. He was one of the old-\ntime newspaper guys. He never missed a chance to speak and listen to \npeople he encountered.\n  Mr. Coffey entered the news business as a copyboy when he graduated \nfrom Savannah High School in 1940. With the exception of a short time \naway to serve his country in World War II, where he was wounded in the \nPhilippines, and a brief stint from 1969 to 1974, when he served as \nacting city manager of Savannah twice, he was a journalist until he \nretired as editor of the Savannah Morning News.\n  More than 20 years ago, when Mr. Coffey retired in 1989, \nRepresentative Lindsay Thomas, my predecessor, referred to Tom as one \nof the most respected journalists in Georgia.\n  During his life, Tom wrote about national news, including civil \nrights and desegregation, but he also wrote about the thrill of playing \nstickball in the backyards of Savannah and the local bootlegger who \nbribed local law enforcement.\n  Tom's extraordinary career as a journalist and his work over the \nyears has made life better for many people. He will truly be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H8973-7", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to state my \nopposition to the $800 billion of unpaid tax extenders now being \ndiscussed in Congress.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that Republicans and Democrats would \nentertain adding $800 billion to the $19 trillion debt that we already \nhave, a debt that our children and grandchildren will end up having to \npay.\n  Just as every well-meaning program should be paid for in these tough \ntimes, so should every tax incentive. This is especially true when \nthose incentives are being expanded beyond their original purpose and \nmade permanent.\n  What we really need, colleagues, is having a more comprehensive \ndiscussion on tax policy and entitlement reform. We probably have too \nmany tax breaks. We should broaden the tax base, frankly, and reduce \nour tax load.\n  We must deal seriously with the long-term debt and deficits. Adding \nthis additional burden to the out-of-control debt we already have is \nabsolutely destructive to our country's future.\n  As one of the former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, the \ngreatest threat to our Nation is not from abroad, but our national \ndebt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H8973-8", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8973-H8974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUPPORT FOR THE CRADLE ACT\n\n  (Mr. POLIQUIN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n\n[[Page H8974]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, sadly, every year in America, more than \n20,000 babies are born addicted to drugs. Last year alone, nearly 1,000 \nof those babies were born in Maine. We can help these babies by passing \nH.R. 3865, the Cradle Act, of which I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor.\n  Eighty percent of addicted infants are covered by Medicaid and \ntreated at local hospitals; however, our hospitals are overwhelmed. \nThey are not equipped to provide the specialized care that these babies \ndesperately need to recover from the drugs in their tiny bodies.\n  Residential pediatric recovery centers are designed and \nprofessionally staffed to provide this critically important early \nclinical care. These centers depend on Medicaid dollars to stay open, \nbut need clear certification guidelines in order to receive those \nfunds. The Cradle Act does that.\n  Every baby born into this world deserves our compassion and care. \nThis is an opportunity to help the most vulnerable among us. This bill \noffers real hope for a healthy, safe, and loving start for thousands of \nAmerican babies born addicted to drugs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H8974-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MASS SHOOTINGS\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, another mass shooting, another \nmoment of silence. Actually, we will have to do two in a day or back-\nto-back because of the shooting in Savannah, Georgia. That did not get \nthe attention because 1 person died and 3 people were injured, not like \nin California, where 14 died and 17 were injured.\n  You stood already this week for Colorado. I say ``you'' because I \ndon't do it any more. I can't be hypocritical. You stand up, you sit \ndown, you do nothing.\n  There have been 355 mass shootings so far this year, not to mention \nthe many who have died alone and get no attention or no moment of \nsilence.\n  When are we really going to stand up and do something? Just who has \nto die--your mother? your wife? your son? Or how many?

Mr. Speaker, next February, more than \n700 students from Penn State University will come together for the \nuniversity's annual dance marathon, otherwise known as THON. This event \nis the culmination of a huge fundraising effort for the Four Diamonds \nFund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, which is dedicated to \nfighting pediatric cancer. THON is the largest student-run philanthropy \nin the world.\n  Even though much of Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District falls \nsolidly within the territory of Pittsburgh's sports teams, I want to \ncommend the Philadelphia Flyers and the New Jersey Devils hockey teams. \nThe proceeds from tickets purchased for either the Devils game on \nDecember 19 or the Flyers game on January 5 will go to benefit THON. \nBoth games fall within Penn State's winter break, allowing students to \nsupport this effort even when they are away from the university.\n  I wish all the students involved in THON the best of luck as they \ncontinue in this tremendous effort. They should be deeply proud of the \nrole they are playing in striking a blow to pediatric cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H8974-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NO HARMFUL OMNIBUS POLICY RIDERS\n\n  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL.

Again, I hope that \nthis violence wakes up the Congress to begin a really serious \ndiscussion about violence in America, by Americans, against Americans.\n  In 8 days, we are going to find ourselves staring at a deadline to \nkeep the Federal Government open. As negotiations are finalized, we \nneed a clean spending bill, not one that is peppered with toxic policy \nriders.\n  We do not need more attacks on environmental protections, Planned \nParenthood, the Affordable Care Act, and financial regulations.

Mr. Speaker, today I want to pay tribute to a true \npillar of our community, Pastor Joe E. Edwards.\n  For the past quarter century, Joe Edwards has served as pastor of the \nChurch of God in Cartersville, Georgia; however, this Sunday, Joe \nEdwards will deliver his final sermon as senior pastor at The Church At \nLiberty Square, as he is retiring.\n  Joe Edwards has been more than just a pastor. He has been a leader \nwho has sought not only to preach the gospel of Christ inside the \nchurch, but put his faith into action throughout the community.\n  While he has made numerous contributions to our community, his vision \nof unifying local churches to pray for local, State, and national \nleaders is fundamentally transforming the culture in our entire county. \nWhile he will be missed in the pulpit each Sunday, his legacy will live \non through the thousands of lives he has touched.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Georgia's 11th Congressional \nDistrict and the United States House of Representatives, I commend \nPastor Joe E. Edwards for a life of service to God, community, and \ncountry, and congratulate him as he moves on to a new chapter in his \nlife.\n  Godspeed, Pastor Joe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H8974-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank my colleagues for working \nacross the aisle to prepare to pass the first long-term highway bill in \nmore than a decade.\n  For too long, Washington has governed from one manufactured crisis to \nanother. This has hurt our economy by creating an environment of \nuncertainty for great manufacturers like Caterpillar, John Deere, UTC, \nand Woodward.\n  American families shouldn't have to worry when they cross a decrepit \nbridge on their way to the grocery store or take their kids to school. \nThe men and women of labor who build our roads and bridges deserve this \nlong-overdue, job-creating highway bill.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 546 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 546\n\n       Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be \n     in order to consider the conference report to accompany the \n     bill (H.R. 22) to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways, \n     highway safety programs, and transit programs, and for other \n     purposes.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I confess to you, I usually use the time \nthat the Reading Clerk is reading the rule to collect my thoughts and \nthink about what the bill is before us today and how I am going to try \nto persuade my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' But we only got about 15 \nseconds of the Reading Clerk this morning because this rule is so \nstraightforward and so simple.\n  I am thinking, why is it--because I sit on the Rules Committee. I \nthink we do good work up there. Good work is sometimes complicated \nwork. Why is it that the rule is so short today? And the answer is \nbecause we are in conference report season, Mr. Speaker. We are in \nconference report season.\n  We have already done the hard work in committee. We have already done \nthe hard work on the floor. The Rules Committee has already done the \nhard work of sorting through dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of \namendments. The Senate has done the same hard work.\n  And we are now here on the conclusion of that work, on the first \nlong-term transportation bill in more than a decade.\n  Mr. Speaker, Democratic administrations, Democratic Presidents, \nDemocratic Houses, Democratic Senates have failed to do what we are \ndoing today. Republican administrations, Republican Presidents, \nRepublican Houses, Republican Senates have failed to do what we are \ndoing today.\n  In divided government today, Mr. Speaker, I dare say my friend from \nColorado didn't get everything he wanted in this bill, I certainly \ndidn't get everything I wanted in this bill, but we are taking the \nfirst big step forward toward certainty for the American people on \ntransportation that we have seen in more than a decade under both \nadministrations.\n  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 546 is a standard rule for \nconsideration of a conference report to accompany H.R. 22, the FAST \nAct, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act.\n  I want to thank Chairman Bill Shuster for the way that he conducted \nthis entire process. Mr. Speaker, I have the great pleasure of serving \non his committee, and between his leadership, the ranking member's \nleadership, Mr. DeFazio, we have crafted a bipartisan, bicameral bill.\n  I was privileged to serve on the conference committee, Mr. Speaker, \nthat completed this work, and it worked the way conference committees \nare supposed to work, I guess, because, Mr. Speaker, it is the first \nconference committee I have been on.\n  I have been here 4\\1/2\\ years. We don't see things get to conference \nthat often. I was a staffer around here, chief of staff, for a decade, \nnever saw a conference committee from that perspective.\n  Mr. Speaker, these things don't happen that often. They should happen \nmore. We considered a conference committee report on education \nyesterday. We are doing transportation today. I think we might be on to \nsomething. I think we might be on to something. It is called doing the \nlong, hard work, Mr. Speaker.\n  I don't know how many sound bites you have read about the \ntransportation bill. I don't know how much press is being paid to this \nbill. It has taken not days, not weeks, not even months, but years to \nbring folks together around this solution, and folks have worked \nincredibly hard to make that happen.\n  It is regular order, Mr. Speaker. It is regular order. This is the \nway it is supposed to happen. We are not supposed to have a bill \nairdropped into the House of Representatives, into the Senate under a \ntake-it-or-leave-it circumstance.\n  What you are supposed to have are those days, those weeks, those \nmonths, and, yes, even years of discussion and debate and moving people \ntogether, finding that common ground, finding those solutions, moving \nit to a conference report at the end. And that is exactly what we have \ndone here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a report that contains views from across this \nconference--Members from rural districts, Members from urban districts, \nMembers from districts that focus on mass transportation, Members from \ndistricts that have incredible road needs.\n  It covers folks from the West in single-Member States, single-\ndistrict States, and folks from the East, with some of the highest \npopulation densities in the country. It is an amazing accomplishment to \nbring all of those folks together.\n  I would tell you, Mr. Speaker, historically, that has been the way \ntransportation has been. Transportation is not one of those issues that \ndivides us as Republicans and Democrats or even from the East and West. \nIt is one of those issues that brings people together.\n  It is one of those issues--and there aren't many--but it is one of \nthose issues that we actually have a constitutional responsibility to \nperform. The Constitution does not ask much of this United States \nCongress when it comes to developing policy and practice domestically \nhere in this country, but transportation is one of those issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I mentioned it was the first long-term bill in more than \na decade. That is absolutely true. Length is important all by itself; \ncertainty in transportation, important all by itself.\n  We passed a 2-year transportation extension, Mr. Speaker. We put in \nthe requirement to streamline some of the regulatory process. Here we \nare, more than 2 years later, and those regulations haven't even come \nout yet.\n  Building is a long-term process. Rulemaking, so that people can \nbuild, is a long-term process.\n  Having long-term certainty is valuable in and of itself, but that is \nnot just what this bill does. It focuses on the national highway \nfreight network, Mr. Speaker.\n  Between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, for example, there are three \nmajor Federal arteries. We have the Baltimore-Washington Parkway \nrunning those 35 miles north. We have U.S. Route 1 running that \ndistance. We have U.S. Interstate 95 running that distance. Those roads \nare never separated by more than about 4 miles.\n  Now, whether or not we need three major Federal arteries running \nbetween two cities over a course of 35 miles, that is a debate that we \ncan have. What the scope of Federal transportation funding should be is \na debate\n\n[[Page H8976]]\n\nthat we can have, And, in this bill, we did have it, Mr. Speaker.\n  We are focusing on moving goods to market. This is a bill about \ngetting to your child's soccer game on time. This is a bill about \nfreeing up congestion on America's roads and improving America's mass \ntransit in a way that you don't miss the first pitch. But this is also \na bill about moving freight to market. It is a bill about making \nAmerica's economy work.\n\n  In a 21st century world, we cannot have a 20th century transportation \nsystem. We focus on those issues that have been left on the sidelines \nfor far too long. We focus on bridges, Mr. Speaker. Bridges. It seems \nso simple. It is a transportation bill; there ought to be more that \ngoes on than just roads and just buses.\n  Bridges, Mr. Speaker, turn out to be that chokepoint that so many of \nus have in our district. It turns out it is expensive to build a \nbridge. It is environmentally difficult to get the permits. It is an \nengineering marvel to put together some of the bridges that we have \nhere today.\n  As dollars have gotten tight, many of our communities have not \nfocused on the safety of existing infrastructure in ways that we all \nknow our constituents demand. We make that investment in safety and \nsecurity today.\n  Mr. Speaker, we streamline a lot of Federal regulation in this bill. \nThere is not a man or woman on this floor who doesn't believe that we \nhave an obligation to protect this great Earth. There is not a man or \nwoman on this floor who doesn't believe that constructing in an \nenvironmentally sensitive manner is a priority for us all.\n  But there is also not a man or woman on this floor who believes it \nought to take 10 years to get a yes-or-no answer. There is not a man or \nwoman on this floor that thinks it ought to take 8 years to get a yes-\nor-no answer. If the answer is no, the answer is no. But we deserve, \nour constituents deserve some certainty in that construction process.\n  We eliminate duplication. We speed up delivery. We allow States, \nthrough a pilot program, Mr. Speaker, to begin to enforce some of these \nFederal mandates. In many cases, it is not the mandate itself that is \nthe problem. It is the Federal bureaucracy that is overburdened and \ncan't come through on permitting.\n  We allow States, under this bill, as long as they abide by the \nFederal standards, to go ahead and implement those standards on their \nown so that they can prioritize the projects that are most important to \nthem.\n  Mr. Speaker, an issue that I know is important to all of our \ncolleagues: We take some steps to get veterans back to work. This isn't \nthe first bill that has done that, of course. We have done bill after \nbill after bill after bill on this floor, Hire More Heroes most \nrecently, to say, if the only thing standing between you and putting \nour veterans back to work is Federal regulation, we want to get Federal \nregulation out of the way. We build on that again in this bill, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  I don't know if you have any truck-driving schools in your district, \nbut I can't find a truck-driving school in my district that doesn't \nhave job offers waiting today for folks who sign up today. The demand \nis so great, Mr. Speaker, for folks to move goods to market.\n  But we have limitations on who is eligible to drive trucks, and for \ngood reasons. For good safety concern reasons, we don't want folks 19, \n20 years of age to be driving these heavy trucks.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, we have, returning from Afghanistan, returning from \nIraq, folks who have been trained by the finest training facility in \nall the world, the United States military, folks who have been trained \nin the skills required, the safety skills required, to move heavy \nequipment from one place to another.\n  Those men and women are returning from serving us and are looking for \nwork. If they were talented enough to serve us overseas, are they not \ntalented enough to serve us here domestically? Of course they are. We \ntake steps to recognize that here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am still waiting on that opportunity when I can come \nto the floor and tell you I got absolutely everything I wanted in \nabsolutely every line of the bill. It has only been 4\\1/2\\ years for \nme; I haven't had that opportunity yet. I am still hoping that \nopportunity comes.\n  But what I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, is that I came here to make a \ndifference. I came here to move the ball forward. I came here to do the \nhard things, not the easy things. The easy things have already been \ndone.\n  There is a reason we haven't passed a long-term bill in more than a \ndecade. It is because it is hard to do. And I take great pleasure and \ngreat pride, as a member of the Rules Committee, the Transportation \nCommittee, and the conference committee, in bringing this rule to the \nfloor today.\n  If we pass this rule, Mr. Speaker, we can move to that conference \nreport, and we can deliver for America what has been undeliverable for \nmore than a decade.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the \ncustomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I commend my colleagues on the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee, who we will be hearing from shortly, for \ntheir diligence in developing a thoughtful, long-term, sustainably \nfunded surface transportation compromise that really has many of the \npriorities that Republicans and Democrats brought to the table.\n  As the gentleman from Georgia said, this is an example of what we \ncall regular order of a conference committee.\n  I want to inquire of the gentleman from Georgia, what was the vote on \nthe conference committee on this final transportation bill?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. WOODALL. I thank my friend for yielding. It was a unanimous \napproval of this provision.\n  Mr. POLIS. Reclaiming my time, you did even better than the education \nconference committee. We were 39-1. There was actually one person on \nthat conference committee who didn't support it. What a great job that \nyou and your colleagues did.\n  The education conference committee was the first chance in 7\\1/2\\ \nyears that I had to serve on a conference committee; my friend from \nGeorgia, his first chance during his time in Congress to do it.\n  And that is a procedural matter. When the American people hear, oh, \nconference committee, that sounds procedural. Yet another committee; \nwhat does that mean? But the product of these committees are \nsubstantial bills.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Part of the problem here in this institution is that it is a \nbicameral legislature, and the House and the Senate don't talk to each \nother enough. The formal way they talk to one another is through a \nconference committee. What that means is there are Senators and \nRepresentatives on the same committee working on the same bill, rather \nthan what happens too often around here where the House passes one bill \nand the Senate, if they pass a bill at all, passes a very different \nbill, and never the twain shall meet. Mr. Speaker, thanks to this \nprocedural conference committee, the differences between the House and \nthe Senate have been worked out.\n  So we were on the education bill yesterday. The Senate will likely \nconsider that exact same bill next week, which means it will likely go \nto President Obama's desk before Christmas. This transportation bill \nthe House considers today, I don't know the Senate's schedule, but \nhopefully in the next week or two they will consider this exact same \nbill, and hopefully it will go to President Obama's desk.\n  So we had a very quick meeting of the Rules Committee yesterday. My \ngoodness, usually when the Rules Committee meets, those are contentious \nmeetings. We have a lot of amendments from Democrats and Republicans \nthat want to have their voice heard. But on a final conference report, \nit went pretty quickly, and members of our committee on both sides of \nthe aisle had a lot of praise for the chair and the ranking member of \nthe committee that had worked tirelessly to put this deal together.\n  The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act--they came up with a \nclever acronym, FAST. That works well, right? Transportation, fast, we \nall want to go fast, not too fast. The act commits $305 billion over a \n5-year period towards improving our Nation's\n\n[[Page H8977]]\n\nroads, bridges, transit systems, and railways. This is something that \nRepublicans and Democrats both agree is the job of government. \nTransportation, infrastructure, and making sure people can get from one \nplace to another is one of the most critical roles that our government \nplays.\n  In the first year, FAST increases spending on highways by $2.1 \nbillion. By the final year, the funding levels will reach $6.1 billion \nin addition to current investment. It also raises transit funding from \n$8.6 billion to almost $10.6 billion by 2020.\n  It establishes a Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects \nprogram that helps focus our attention on projects that increase the \ncompetitiveness of American goods and services by expanding and \nimproving upon heavily trafficked freight routes. Two that affect us in \nColorado--very near and dear to my district--are highway 25, from \nDenver to Wyoming, and highway 70, from Denver to Salt Lake City, which \nwe were able to successfully include an amendment in the House version, \nwhich I am proud to say is also reflected in this conference report.\n  Mr. Speaker, these Nationally Significant Freight and Highway \nProjects open the door to economic development, improve the flow of \ngoods across our great country, increase the quality of life for \nresidents, ease congestion and safety concerns, and, along our \nparticular corridors, are to the benefit of tourism and the tourism \nindustry as well.\n  This bill helps leverage private investment in our surface \ntransportation program by promoting the use of public-private \npartnerships which simply have become a reality for many infrastructure \nprojects today like those used to expand highway 36 from Denver to \nBoulder, which I drive on most days that I am back home in Colorado.\n  The FAST Act encourages installation of vehicle-to-vehicle and \nvehicle-to-infrastructure equipment--which the Colorado Department of \nTransportation has been at the cutting edge of designing and \nimplementing--to improve congestion, ensure passenger safety, and \nreally help create a 21st century infrastructure. This bill helps \nincrease dedicated bus funding by 89 percent over the life of the bill, \na change that was direly needed after the last highway authorization.\n  The FAST Act maintains local flexibility for STP Metro funding, \nallows governments to dictate what is best for our communities, and \nleaves the door open for complex transportation infrastructure projects \nlike the northeast line of the Denver Regional Transportation \nDistrict's FasTrack system, which our voters approved a decade ago.\n  The bill requires a feasibility study to determine an impairment \nstandard for drivers under the influence of marijuana, something that I \nintroduced a bill on and have been working hard on to increase the \nsafety of driving in States where marijuana is legalized, like my home \nState of Colorado.\n  This bill increases funding for highway railway grade crossings and \nrequires operators to report the movements of hazardous materials along \nrailroads, many of which, again, traverse my district. In Fort Collins, \nin Loveland, and in Longmont, where trains run through the downtown \nevery day, these types of commonsense safety measures are desperately \nneeded and welcomed.\n  The bill includes reforms to the Railroad Rehabilitation and \nImprovement Financing loan program--a loan that can be used to divert \ncumbersome traffic out of the middle of our downtown areas like in Fort \nCollins--to ensure speedy approval.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is a good bill. The policy changes are \nthoughtful and progressive. The funding levels authorized are an \nimprovement upon those of the past. The financing sources we tap, while \nnot ideal, are workable.\n  Now, it is always fair to say in any compromise that we could have \ndone better. There are a few things I am disappointed that this bill \ndoesn't contain.\n  We were on the edge of cutting a deal that would have included \ninternational tax reform that would have brought American wealth home, \nused the taxes gained to fund transportation and infrastructure \nrestoration projects nationwide, and prevented the offshoring of \ncorporations, which we continue to see.\n  Earlier this Congress, Mr. Speaker, I introduced a bill with my \nfriend, Representative Delaney, that would have deemed repatriation at \n8.75 percent to fund both a 6-year highway bill at increased funding \nlevels and create a new, national infrastructure bank. Combining \ninternational tax reform--desperately needed in its own right--with \nbold and robust infrastructure investment is a forward-thinking, \nproblem-solving solution and exactly the type of move that I wish--and \nthe American people wish--that Congress could have made.\n\n  Our failure to come to a deal on the repatriation of overseas wealth \nhas, unfortunately, robbed the American people of hundreds of billions \nof dollars in public investment and continues to abandon the $2 \ntrillion in overseas earnings that could have been brought home.\n  In addition, we fail to address the tax incentive that American \ncompanies have to merge with overseas corporations or relocate their \nown headquarters overseas to avoid paying American taxes. We came \nclose--we came close--to addressing this in this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress to address international tax reform as \nsoon possible to prevent the continuing offshoring of companies and the \nmoving of jobs overseas, as well as to ensure that over $2 trillion in \noverseas earnings can be invested here in America rather than face an \nenormous tax penalty if it is brought back, thereby preventing it from \nbeing brought back and providing an incentive for companies to invest \nin overseas growth and infrastructure rather than investing in \ninfrastructure and growth here at home.\n  Mr. Speaker, the failure to contain corporate tax reform is not my \nonly challenge in supporting this bill. There were certainly other \nprograms that I believe we could have invested in, like improving even \nmore the TIFIA investment which funds important projects like those \nneeded along highways 70 and 25 in my district. I would have liked to \nhave seen a direct funding stream tied to improvement and maintenance \nprojects along designated high-priority corridors.\n  Finally, I would have liked to have seen the plight of communities \nwith rail running through their downtowns addressed in the bill, an \nissue very near and dear to the cities in my district, cities like Fort \nCollins, Loveland, and Longmont, which are changed entirely by constant \ndisruption of train horns and road blockages through our busy downtown \nareas.\n  The economic loss that we face in our communities, on top of the \ndisturbance to residents' quality of life, isn't something that we can \ncontinue to sit by and do nothing about. We are going to work with \nevery bit of flexibility in the bill. We continue to work with the \ndepartment on less expensive implementation of quiet zones and of \ntrying to reopen the rulemaking around train horns, which we expect to \nhappen shortly, but there is no specific statutory fix to that issue in \nthis bill itself.\n  So while I support this bill and commend the effort and the regular \norder that led to us getting here, we still need to look at what we can \ndo. We see this bill as a floor, not a ceiling. There is even more we \ncan do to bring our transportation infrastructure into the 21st \ncentury, to ensure its funding source is reliable and sustained, to \nrepatriate overseas earnings and invest them here at home, and to \neliminate an incentive for American companies to move overseas.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues agree that passage of this bill \ndoesn't mean that we retire from presenting new, thoughtful ideas to \nimprove our Federal highway system. I hope that Republicans and \nDemocrats will continue to partner to address and solve some of these \nissues that I have raised that are not included in this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to tell my friend \nhow much I appreciate what he had to say about international tax reform \nand what our opportunities are to grow America rather than grow our \ncompetitors abroad and to say there are a lot of different provisions \nin this bill. The Transportation Committee was unanimous in its support \nof this bill, as were\n\n[[Page H8978]]\n\nseveral of the other committees who were involved in the conference, \nbut there were a few stragglers out there on some of the extraneous \nprovisions that were placed in here.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Ribble), a member of the freshman class of 2010 and a \nmember of the Transportation Committee.\n  Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, once again, the Congress has offered Members the classic \nSophie's choice. Either vote ``no'' on the transportation bill and \nguarantee no reforms to road and bridge building happen, or vote \n``yes'' and get reforms necessary to save money and streamline \nconstruction, but do it without actually paying for it and keep racking \nup the national debt.\n  While many of my colleagues are sure to rush to the floor in the next \nfew hours to pat themselves on the back for accomplishing this \nmarvelous, transformational highway bill, we should not be popping \nchampagne. There is no backslapping deserved.\n  While I am encouraged by the fact that in many ways the policy \nrelated to surface transportation takes a significant step forward, I \nam deeply discouraged by the phony pay-fors.\n  Mr. Speaker, during the upcoming debate on this legislation, you and \nthe American people are going to hear repeatedly that this bill is \nfully offset and fully paid for, essentially that new revenue and \nsavings will keep the cost of this bill from adding to our national \ndebt. This is, plain and simple, not the case. Most of the offsets are \nfrom general fund transfers.\n  Now, it would take a magician of miraculous skill to transfer money \nout of a fund that has a negative balance of $400 billion. If, in fact, \nthere is money to transfer from an empty fund, I might suggest that we \ninstead try to make the fund a bit less empty instead of transferring \nit to more spending.\n  But I digress. Let's take a look at the pay-fors.\n  One of a long series of phony offsets is selling off oil that is \ncurrently owned by the American people in the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. While you are stewarding the American people's money, you are \nsupposed to buy low and sell high, not the other way around. Not only \nare we selling off a public asset at near record low prices, we are \nalso counting on getting over double the current market price in order \nto make all the math work. If you can find a buyer to pay $94 per \nbarrel for oil, like the authors claim, while the market price is $41, \nI have got a bridge to nowhere to sell you.\n  Another phony offset is hiring aggressive private contractors to go \nafter people who are delinquent on their Federal taxes. Now, listen, I \nam all for collecting all outstanding taxes. But what does that have to \ndo with road building? If, in fact, we can collect an additional $2.5 \nbillion by doing this, shouldn't that money be put against the $400-\nbillion deficit we are facing already?\n  Why is it an offset that generates its revenue amount over 10 years \nwhen the highway bill is only for 5 years? What is going to happen in \nyear 6? Will all the road building the country needs be completed by \nthen? Are there not any other roads going to need to be built in year \n6? Are we not, then, just going to have to borrow even more money?\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill does make a very reasonable point that taxes \nmust be indexed to inflation to keep from losing value every year. I \nfound this quite ironic. That makes total sense. So it is applied to \nthe gas tax; right? Wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, here is my favorite phony pay-for. The bill's authors \ndidn't have the political courage to deal with user fees for drivers, \nbut instead are indexing taxes collected by the U.S. Customs Service. \nNow, that is really ironic, but that tax is easy to hide from \nconstituents. Now Americans returning from overseas will pay more for \nthem in taxes to pave our roads while people who use the roads simply \nlook on and smile.\n  Yet, Mr. Speaker, there is more. There are modifications to royalty \npayments. Wow, that has got everything to do with roads. Or how about \ndenying passports to those who have unpaid taxes? This is allegedly \ngoing to raise $350 million. Of course, that has nothing to do with \nroads, and, in fact, may not even be possible without all kinds of \ncourt trials and cases.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know you can sense my frustration. At the end of the \nday, this bill will pass, the President will sign it, and while \neveryone is patting themselves on the back for passing a long-term \nsolution, we are going to continue to pile debt on our grandchildren.\n  We are so close, though, to getting this right. We streamlined the \nprocess to get roads built faster saving taxpayer dollars. We have \nreturned more decisionmaking back to the States, and we have reduced \nthe bureaucracy and red tape around transportation construction.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Colorado and the gentleman from \nGeorgia have eloquently explained some of the benefits of the piece of \nlegislation. These are valuable and not insignificant reforms. It is \nbecause of these reforms that I am going to reluctantly support this \nbill in spite of these phony, god-awful pay-fors. Here is why: I \nrealize that if this bill does not pass, what we will get instead is \nanother extension of current policy and more borrowing, because that is \nwhat the Congress has done since I have been here.\n  So this goes back to the classic Sophie's choice I mentioned at the \nbeginning of my conversation here. To get the good, I must accept the \nbad; to reject the bad, I must reject the good. If only this body, this \nCongress, had the political courage to tell the American people a \nsimple truth: if something is worth buying, it is worth paying for. \nTaxing tomorrow should not replace living within our means today. It \nhurts future generations, and I am profoundly disappointed. We can and \nshould do better for the people who sent us here to speak for them.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds before I further \nyield.\n  I agree with many of the critiques from the gentleman from Wisconsin. \nI think, when you pick apart a lot of the ways that this bill is paid \nfor, you will find that they either won't generate the amount of \nrevenue we think they will or you are borrowing from the outyears, \nmeaning years 5 through 10, to effectively fund years 1 through 5. I \nknow a lot of Members on both sides of the aisle will weigh that in \ntheir vote. I wish that the committee could have done better in finding \npay-fors.\n  I would like to briefly address the national petroleum reserve. I \nthink it is great that Democrats and Republicans are coming together \naround selling assets the Federal Government has that are nonproductive \nassets, like the petroleum reserve that was set up for a time when \nAmerica relied on foreign oil. We are now net producers of crude oil.\n  I introduced an amendment that was not allowed for the energy bill \nyesterday to sell down the entire strategic petroleum reserve, which I \nthink we should. However, the accounting for it in this bill shows us \nmagically receiving twice the value per barrel for the price of oil \nthan the futures market actually indicates that we would get. That is \nsimply fictitious accounting in terms of how this bill is paid for.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I am inclined to yield 5 more minutes to \nmy friend from Wisconsin because I strongly, strongly agree with the \nframework that he advanced.\n  I have come to this floor repeatedly with a simple suggestion that we \nindex the gas tax and move forward with paying for our future. It is, I \nthink, an interesting question if we had followed regular order dealing \nwith transportation funding, if we would have had a hearing that would \nhave had the President of the AFL-CIO, had the President of the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, truckers, AAA, legislators from seven red \nRepublican States that have raised the gas tax and the sky didn't fall \ncome forward and talk to Congress about what would make a difference.\n  Because they have all agreed that we shouldn't be borrowing from the \nfuture, that we should right-size this, not playing budget games, and \nbe able to have the most effective way to create millions of family \nwage jobs and show that we can do our job the same way that was led by \nPresident Eisenhower and President Reagan.\n\n[[Page H8979]]\n\n  That said, I think this bill does represent an important step forward \nbecause there was some regular order followed by the committee. I take \nmy hat off to Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio, who worked \ntheir way through a variety of contentious issues and brought forward a \npiece of legislation that provides modest, but important, increases in \nour funding programs.\n  It retains the basic structure. It has some improvements streamlining \nthe process. It protects transit, safety, pedestrian, cycling programs, \nand a higher speed passenger rail. It speaks to a multiplicity of \ninterests that Americans care deeply about.\n  It has embedded in it areas of innovation to encourage us to use \ntechnology to be able to improve the transportation system. I think \nthere is no question that this is a new frontier, that 10 years from \nnow we will not recognize much of what happens in the transportation \nspace.\n  We will be able to coax more value out of our transportation system. \nWe will be able to stretch dollars and unleash a great deal of \ninnovation and activity. This legislation encourages that.\n  Part of the innovation is that, while I think we should index and \nraise the gas tax to actually adequately fund a robust bill, I think it \nis important for us to get rid of the gas tax and replace it with \nsomething that is sustainable over time.\n  And, again, this legislation has some provisions that will enable \nStates to experiment with pilot projects like we have had in Oregon for \nthe last 10 years for a fee that is based on road use, that would be \nsustainable, that would be fair, that actually could be adjusted in \nways to help rural and small-town America and be able to give greater \naccess to transportation in a more efficient fashion.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that we will use the 5 years of stability, \nending the saga of 35 short-term extensions because we wouldn't face \nthe funding question.\n  I am hopeful that we will use these 5 years to be able to refine some \nof the improvements that are in it and to be able to directly face the \nquestion of whether or not we are going to pay for our transportation \nfuture, that we won't use gimmicks, that we will use the tried-and-true \nuser fee and replace the gas tax with something that is better and more \nsustainable.\n  It is time to start building that foundation now. It is not just more \nmoney, but it is transforming how the transportation systems work. I \nthink this bill gives us leverage to move forward on that. Rebuilding \nand renewing America is a nonpartisan issue. It is an issue that can \nactually bring us together while we make our communities more livable, \nour families safer, healthier, and more economically secure.\n  We can put millions of Americans to work at family wage jobs that \nwill improve the quality of life for communities from coast to coast. \nThis bill is a step in that direction. But it is only going to work if \nwe accept our responsibilities to properly fund it, to face the future, \nand accept responsibility to do our job right. I hope we will.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto not just celebrate the successes that we are having today, but to \nassociate myself with my colleagues who say the next round of hard work \nbegins tomorrow.\n  There is a reason that we have the funding pay-fors that we have in \nthis bill. It is not a lack of political courage. I have colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle who have courage to spare. It is a lack of \ntrust.\n  When my constituents back home send me a dollar's worth of taxes and \nget 50 cents worth of road out of it, they say: Rob, what is the deal?\n  The streamlining that goes on in this bill grows that trust. The \nelimination of duplication, the focus on national priorities instead of \npet projects, on and on and on, builds that trust.\n  The time to build that trust is before the next highway bill, not at \nthe end of a highway bill cycle. There is a lot of work for each and \nevery one of us to do in a bipartisan way to go out and build that \ntrust.\n  I think about what my friend from Oregon said: We are going to \nsqueeze a lot of efficiency out of our transportation system.\n  The innovation title in this bill is absolutely going to allow us to \ndo more with less, which is precisely why constituents are worried \nabout an indexed gas tax that puts transportation spending on \nautopilot, because all of our experience is, if you raise it, someone \nwill spend it.\n  Balancing efficiency with productivity is a challenge that we all \nface that begins with trust generated back home, Mr. Speaker. My great \nhope is that the reforms in this bill, combined with the reforms in \nMAP-21, combined by the leadership that States and localities are \ntaking with their own revenue bases, are going to create that trust for \na generation to come.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNevada (Ms. Titus).\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Like the others you have heard from this morning, I commend those who \nhave worked so hard on this bill. But, like them, I, too, have \nreservations about the final product.\n  It continues to underfund our Nation's infrastructure and it relies \non unsustainable revenue sources and budgetary musical chairs; yet, it \ndoes include some policy provisions that I believe will result in \nbetter project development and delivery.\n  I represent the heart of the Las Vegas Valley, a region that is home \nto over 2 million people. We receive and enjoy the visits of over 43 \nmillion people from around the world annually. Having a transportation \nsystem to safely and efficiently move these people and products around \nis vital to our economic success.\n  That is why I am thankful that this final report includes a number of \nprovisions that I advocated for, including language to ensure our \nStates and MPOs consider the needs of the traveling public when \ndeveloping their long-term transportation plans.\n  The bill will also create a national travel and tourism advisory \ncommittee comprised of stakeholders from across the industry to develop \na plan to identify and invest in infrastructure and operational \nimprovements along the most important travel corridors.\n  In addition, the final bill includes language I submitted that will \nextend the authorization for the development of Interstate 11, a major \nregional project in the Southwest.\n  Lastly, the conference report includes provisions I advocated for in \nthe committee to make our roadways safer for all users, not just cars \nand trucks, but pedestrians and cyclists who have seen increased \naccidents and fatalities in recent years.\n  For these reasons that affect my district and the rest of the country \nand for others that have been mentioned, I think the bill deserves \nsupport. While it is not perfect, it is a step in the right direction.\n  For that reason, I will vote for it. I urge others to do so as well.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto say I think my friend from Nevada missed one of those great \nsuccesses that she had--I will call it the Rodney Davis-Dina Titus \namendment--to make sure that localities have even more control over \ntheir spending decisions.\n  It is one of those episodes, Mr. Speaker, where folks didn't get \neverything they wanted, but because folks were in there advocating for \ntheir constituents throughout the entire process, we ended up further \ndown the road today than we would have been yesterday but for the \nDavis-Titus team pushing forward on that language.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is what this bill is, and that is what regular \norder gets us. It is so frustrating. I feel like I am in a room full of \nracehorses here trying to wait for the doors to open. The gates have \njust come open, and we all want to get to the finish line.\n  Our new Speaker has made some commitments about bringing more \ninvolvement and individual Member participation in the process. That is \nnew to this institution in many ways, Mr. Speaker, but it is not new to \nthe Transportation Committee. It is not new to the work that you and I \nhave been doing on the committee for these past many months. That is \nwhy this bill is worthy of the support of so many of our colleagues.\n  I can go through a similar list as my friend from Nevada of ideas \nthat came\n\n[[Page H8980]]\n\nfrom the folks who lead back home. Folks who are in the tourism \nindustry know more about tourism than those of us who are not, as do \nfolks who are in the visitor industry, folks who are in the \nconstruction industry, folks who are in the concrete industry, on and \non and on.\n  Mr. Speaker, when you open the process up, you end up with fewer \nfolks with political agendas at the table. You end up with more folks \nwith practical agendas at the table. When you open the process up, you \ndon't end up with politicians looking for their own piece of the pie. \nYou end up with the public sharing their expertise and their \nexperience. That is how you end up with a bill like the FAST Act today.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been a great pleasure for me to serve on the \nTransportation Committee with folks like the gentlewoman from Nevada, \nlike the gentleman from Illinois, to be able to have a common goal--\nvery different approaches on how you want to achieve that goal, very \ndifferent constituencies pushing you towards that goal--but to know \nthat, if you put in the time and if you put in the hours, you will get \na result.\n  So often in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, it seems like we are tilting \nat windmills. When I joined the Transportation Committee, I knew that \nwe were not going to be tilting at windmills. We were going to be \nslaying a dragon. This bill slays that dragon today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMaryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I am pleased to be here as a conferee to the conference that worked \nto resolve the difference between the House and Senate versions on the \nsurface transportation reauthorization.\n  A huge thank you goes to Chairmen Shuster and Graves and Ranking \nMembers DeFazio and Norton and their committees and personal staff for \nall the work that was put in to get us to this 5-year authorization.\n  The fact is that America is literally falling apart. I am glad that \nwe are going to be sending the President a long-term authorization this \nweek. Making our infrastructure work and work for us smarter is really \ncritical.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  The bill does a lot to support research, development, and the \ndeployment of transportation technology.\n  I am pleased with the overall research title, including specific \ninvestments in hazardous materials, R, and traffic congestion \nmitigation, but I do have a couple of concerns with oversight.\n  The Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office was moved \nout of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and \nTechnology and into the Federal Highway Administration. We have to be \nvigilant that this move doesn't undermine the multimodal coordination \nof ITS research and development.\n  A new deployment program was funded through a large tax on existing \nR programs. While I support the deployment program, we shouldn't lose \nsight of the fact that today's R investments enable tomorrow's new \ndeployment opportunities. So we shouldn't be shortsighted.\n  Nonetheless, I support the FAST Act. It is a bipartisan, bicameral, \nlong-term authorization to fund highway transit, highway safety, motor \ncarrier safety, hazardous material safety, and even passenger rail \nprograms and projects.\n  Let me be clear. It is not the bill I would have written, and it is \ndefinitely not perfect, including some of the problematic pay-fors that \nhave been discussed today. But it will provide certainty, invest in \nAmerica's infrastructure, and create good-paying American jobs.\n  The bill is funded at the higher Senate-approved level, which is \nimportant.\n  I am happy to have worked in a bipartisan fashion with my colleagues \non the floor and in committee to make a difference in people's lives.\n  In our region, our Senators, Representatives Norton and Comstock, and \nI have provided new and direct Federal oversight of the Washington \nMetropolitan Area Transit Authority.\n  We have also worked to include transit-oriented development \neligibility in TIFIA. Yes, this would mean that many of the transit-\noriented projects across the Nation, in the metropolitan Washington \nregion, and in my county, Prince George's County, along the Green Line, \nwill now be able to qualify for Federal financing because most transit-\noriented development infrastructure projects are less than the $50 \nmillion threshold that TIFIA currently requires.\n  In working with several Members, we were able to restore funding for \nthe High Density States program that will allow transit systems in \nthese States to maintain jobs, service, and service frequency and \ncontinue to help those who rely on public transportation.\n  Though I oppose today's rule, we have to enact a bill that will \nconstruct and rebuild our road, bridge, transit, and rail \ninfrastructure that creates jobs here at home and enables the United \nStates to compete internationally in the 21st century.\n  This is a good first step. Let's not stop here. Let's continue to \nwork in this fashion to rebuild America's infrastructure.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters), the distinguished ranking member of the \nCommittee on Financial Services.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I thank Congressman Polis for the \ntime he has granted me.\n  Mr. Speaker, after more than 2 years of obstruction by a vocal, \nideologically driven minority that led to a 5-month shutdown of the \nExport-Import Bank, I could not be more pleased to rise and speak in \nstrong support of the provision in the conference report that would \nfinally put the Ex-Im Bank back in the business of supporting U.S. \njobs.\n  After having spoken with and having listened to the stories of \ncountless users of the Ex-Im Bank, both in my district and across the \ncountry, I can tell you without a doubt that the 4-year reauthorization \nof the Bank in this conference report is absolutely necessary and \nessential to ensure that U.S. businesses, both large and small, can \noperate and survive in the global marketplace.\n  From the loss of satellite contracts in California, to the many \npotential job losses across this country, to offers from our foreign \ncompetitors that have urged American exporters to take their operations \nto Canada or overseas to Europe and China, there is no question that \nthe shutdown of the Ex-Im Bank has done great damage.\n  In joining with Whip Hoyer, Leader Pelosi, Representatives Heck and \nMoore, as well as with Representatives Fincher and Lucas, we showed \nthat a determined majority of Democrats and Republicans who work \ntogether will ultimately prevail.\n  It is time to put an end to this wholly destructive and entirely \nunnecessary period that has caused us so much pain and fear and \nhopelessness for so many businesses and workers across this country \nwhose livelihoods rely on the Ex-Im Bank.\n  I urge the passage of the conference report.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Today, I recognize the patriotism and volunteer service of Major \nFredric Arnold, a World War II P-38 fighter pilot in the Army Air \nCorps.\n  Mr. Arnold flew and survived 50 combat missions and was promoted to \nthe rank of major at the age of 23. He received numerous medals, \nincluding the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal with nine oak \nleaf clusters.\n  While assigned to the Office of Flying Safety, he wrote and \nillustrated the first ever flight training manuals for the P-38, P-47, \nP-51, and P-80 fighter aircraft, and he created educational air combat \nsituation drawings for the P-38 Lightning, which saved the lives of \ninexperienced American pilots.\n  Today, at age 93, Mr. Arnold lives in Boulder, Colorado, where he is \ncreating a monumental bronze sculpture, funded by The Radiance \nFoundation, which depicts 12 life-sized fighter pilots who are engaged \nin a World War II flight briefing, in order to honor the 88,000 airmen \nwho lost their lives during the war and to ensure future generations \nremember the sacrifices that were made to protect our freedom.\n  This sculpture is entitled, ``Lest We Forget: The Mission,'' and it \nwill be exhibited at the World War II Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n[[Page H8981]]\n\n  I am proud to recognize Major Fredric Arnold for his service as a \nfighter pilot and for his personal commitment to honor and help us all \nremember the aviators who served this Nation during World War II.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would ask my friend from Colorado if he \nhas any other speakers remaining.\n  Mr. POLIS. We are prepared to close if the gentleman is prepared to \nclose.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the \nrule to bring up bipartisan legislation that would close the loophole \nthat allows suspected terrorists to legally buy guns. This bill would \nbar the sale of firearms and explosives to those on the terrorist watch \nlist.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, a third of our Nation's major roads are rated \nas poor or mediocre, and one in four bridges is in need of significant \nrepair or expansion, many of them dangerous, while 45 percent of \nAmericans don't have access to public transit.\n  Congestion on our roadways has gotten so bad that Americans are \nwasting an average of 8.4 billion hours--that is 8.4 billion hours less \nin productivity--and 4.5 billion gallons of gas over a decade while \nbeing stuck in traffic.\n  The average commuters are wasting nearly $800 of their own money and \n5 full days of their lives each year in traffic. In my district alone, \npopulation and congestion has far outpaced our ability to maintain our \ncritical thoroughfares.\n  If you have ever been to Colorado, you will know that there is one \nway up to our world-class ski resorts and ski areas and unparalleled \n14,000-foot peaks from the Denver metro area. It is called highway 70. \nIf you have ever taken it on a Friday evening or on a Sunday evening, \nyou have probably sat in your car at a dead stop, waiting at times \nperhaps even for hours.\n  If you have ever been to the largest city in my district, Fort \nCollins, home to one of our greatest universities, Colorado State \nUniversity, you have probably found similar circumstances along highway \n25 during rush hour.\n  The expansion of highway 25 and the high-speed rail along highway 70 \nhave been given completion dates of 60 years from now. That isn't good \nenough. Fort Collins, Loveland, Boulder, Vail, Frisco, Breckenridge--\nnone of these tourism- and recreation-driven communities can survive \nwithout making improvements for 60 years.\n  The future of these projects lies with a long-term, robustly funded \nsurface transportation reauthorization. Our future depends upon our \nStates' and municipalities' ability to rely on what level of Federal \nsupport they can expect to receive and what their Federal partnerships \nwill look like year in and year out.\n  By providing consistency in funding levels and a several-year \ncommitment to critical infrastructure projects, as we do today in this \nconference report, we open up a future for major highway improvements \nlike those needed with highways 25 and 70 in my district and with \nhighways and roads across the entire Nation.\n  While I have outlined the issues and misgivings I have with this \nbill--and I certainly agree with Mr. Ribble about the lack of courage \nthis Congress has to actually pay for a bill and to instead devise \nclever gimmicks that only partially pay for the bill, including \nassuming that we are going to get twice the money per barrel for oil \nthat the Federal Government owns and the actual market price would \nbear--I think that this bill, nevertheless, is a step forward over \ncontinued short-term reauthorizations, which I have been voting against \nthe last several times they have come before us and which, I should \npoint out, also generally include gimmicky ways of paying for it.\n  So if this Congress, which it seems to have done, has chosen not to \naddress the real issue of how to pay for something and has chosen to \ninstead use gimmicks, it is still better to do that in a predictable \nmanner rather than to come up with a new gimmick every 60 days--a \ngimmick of the month, if you will--which is what this Congress has been \ndoing throughout this year.\n  I thank my colleagues for the inclusion of my amendments in this \nbill, particularly an amendment to designate Highway 70 from Denver to \nSalt Lake City as a High Priority Corridor. That provision will open up \nfunding sources and opportunities for a highway that has been a \nnightmare for residents, for tourists, and for freight truck drivers \nfor decades, particularly during its busiest times.\n  I appreciate the committee's desire to be transparent and receptive \nto ideas brought by Members who don't serve on the committee.\n  I am hopeful that what happened here this week, as my colleague from \nGeorgia started out by saying, not only with the surface transportation \nreauthorization but also with the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, is only a beginning--a beginning of big things, of good things, of \nhard compromises, of the success of regular order, of discussions \nbetween the House and the Senate that will hopefully bode well for \nfuture developments.\n  I am hopeful that we can get back to work after a long hiatus of \ngridlock and grandstanding. I hope this is the first of many.\n  I congratulate my colleagues for coming together on such a pivotal \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We have talked about how much work has gone into this bill--not days, \nnot weeks, not months, but even years in trying to get here.\n  I want to say what I said when I began, which is, when Democrats \ncontrolled every single lever of government, they could not get a bill \nlike this done. When Republicans controlled every single lever of \ngovernment, we failed to get a bill like this done. Today, with the \nleadership of Bill Shuster and Mr. DeFazio, we are getting that done.\n  But it is not just at the Member level. And I want to associate all \nof the hard staff work that goes into making something like this \nhappen, Mr. Speaker. Chris Bertram, our staff director over on the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee; Matt Sturges, our deputy \nstaff director over on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee; \nCollin, Geoff, Murphie on my own staff, Alex Poirot--folks who have put \nin hour after hour after hour, right through the Thanksgiving holiday, \nmaking sure that America's priorities get done.\n  Folks back home don't care how much hard work it takes; they care \nthat we put in the hard work. And this is an example of that success \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, so often, I hear my colleagues say, ``If I had written \nthis bill myself, it would have been different.'' Generally, when I \nhear my colleagues on the other side of aisle say, ``If I had written \nthis bill it would be different,'' I think, ``Thank goodness you didn't \nwrite this bill.'' I have no doubt that they think the same thing when \nI say that.\n  We rarely get everything that we want, but we rarely have an \nopportunity to come together and be as successful as we are today.\n  The only roadblock between us and a long-term transportation bill for \nthe first time in more than a decade is my yielding back the balance of \nmy time.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 546 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney \n     General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of \n     firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected \n     dangerous terrorist. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority\n\n[[Page H8982]]\n\n     member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1076.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule. . . . because the majority \n     Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of adoption.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there

The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n[[Page H8986]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I am opposed to it in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Cartwright moves to recommit the bill H.R. 8 to the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce, with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendment:\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n                        TITLE __--CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n     SEC. ____. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL.\n\n       In response to the overwhelming scientific consensus that \n     climate change is real, United States energy policy should \n     seek to remove market barriers that inhibit the development \n     of renewable energy infrastructure.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, this motion represents an opportunity \nfor Members of this House to acknowledge that climate damage is a \nthreat, and that we have a moral obligation to fight it, an opportunity \nfor Members to bring themselves into line with the overwhelming weight \nof scientific research and authority, bring themselves into line with a \nhuge and growing mass of American corporations that have acknowledged \nclimate damage, and have taken green energy pledges.\n  It is an opportunity for Members to bring themselves into line with \nover 200 other nations that are gathering, even as we speak, in France, \npeople who are baffled that responsible adults in elected positions in \nour Nation continue to deny what is reality.\n  And it is an opportunity for Members to avoid a danger, a danger that \ntheir pollsters and their party leaders and their political advisers \nhave failed to warn them about, and that is the danger of the judgment \nof history.\n  Make no mistake, future generations are watching. In fact, they are \nalready judging our actions. Our young people in this Nation understand \nthat they are the ones who will pay dearly for the politics that has \ntaken over this issue, the politics that lead this Congress to \ninaction, despite the outcry from the scientific and worldwide \ncommunity that we must act before it is too late.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am not here to condemn Members for initial hesitation \non climate damage. Who am I to judge? After all, as humans, when we \ndiscover a threat, at first it is reasonable and natural for us to \nquestion or attempt to deny that the threat is real, especially when it \nis the kind of threat that, to meet it, requires strong, immediate, and \ndecisive action.\n  In fact, denial is such a common reaction that aircraft pilots call \nit ``normalcy bias,'' the initial refusal to believe that things are \nnot normal, the desire to not believe the warning signals when they say \nsomething is gravely wrong. They teach pilots about normalcy bias \nbecause, when the warning lights go on, wishing those lights were off \nor hoping that they are wrong is not a valid course of action. Instead, \nit is the very most dangerous way of handling the situation.\n  Mr. Speaker, the warning lights are on. So what we need to do is get \npast our denial phase, get past our normalcy bias, and take strong, \nimmediate, and decisive action. And I say to you, that is the American \nway of handling a threat to our people.\n  What we do here in America, the best of us, we examine it closely, a \nthreat. We put our best minds on the problem, and we tackle the problem \nand take immediate, strong, and decisive action.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  That is how the bravest and the best of us in America have always \nbehaved in the face of threat, and that is how the Greatest Generation \ndid it. Sticking our heads in the sand, pretending a serious problem \nwill go away on its own, and doing nothing in the face of a grave \nthreat is not the American way, and it never was.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I am not here to condemn anyone for his or her \ninitial hesitation on climate damage. Instead, I offer this opportunity \nto my colleagues across the aisle because I refuse to believe that they \ntruly do not understand the climate crisis we face.\n  I present this motion to recommit as a chance for this Congress to \navoid the harsh light and the implacable judgment of the historians, \nwho will not hesitate to include us on their lists of the greatest \nignoramuses of all time, to lump us in without fear of contradiction, \nwith the worst, lantern-jawed simpletons of history, historians who \nwill unmercifully tell our grandchildren and their grandchildren just \nhow dumb we were if we do not take action to prevent damage to our \nclimate.\n  So I invite my fellow Members, all of you, vote ``yes'' on this \nmotion, acknowledging that climate change is real. The warning lights \nare on, they are brighter than ever, and the rest of the world is \ntaking them seriously. Let's show the world and all of history that \nAmerica is ready to take the lead in tackling this threat.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion \nto recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, the world does face many challenges and \nrisks, and when it comes to climate change, we on this side believe \nthat we have to take an economically realistic and pragmatic approach.\n  To address climate as well as other risks, we support policies that \nwill promote access to affordable and reliable energy that allows our \ncommunities to grow economically, to adapt to changes, and to be \nresilient both now and in the future. We also support technological \ninnovation and the development of resilient, efficient infrastructure \nboth to reduce emissions and to withstand climate-related events \nregardless of their causes.\n  The underlying bill that we are about ready to pass promotes access \nto affordable and reliable energy, diversity, efficiency, and \nmodernization of all of our energy infrastructures. Passage of this \nbill would help ensure that we have critical energy infrastructure in \nplace to withstand new threats, whether they be from climate or other \nrisks such as terrorism and cyber attacks.\n  I would note, Mr. Speaker, that here in the United States, thanks to \ninnovation--as we have expanded access to our abundant energy supplies \nas we have over the last couple of decades--energy-related carbon \ndioxide emissions have actually significantly declined, and they are \nprojected to remain below 2005 levels through 2040 and will continue to \ndecline as a share of worldwide emissions, particularly when compared \nto other nations like India and China.\n  So for those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on the motion to recommit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 546, I call up \nthe conference report on the bill (H.R. 22) to authorize funds for \nFederal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, \nand for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the conference report to accompany H.R. \n22.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am very pleased that today the House is considering the conference \nreport to H.R. 22, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation, or the \nFAST Act.\n  I believe this bill will be one of the most important things this \nCongress can accomplish for our country. This conference report is \nappropriately named the FAST Act for a few reasons.\n  It will certainly help fix America's surface transportation \ninfrastructure. The process has been fast. In fact, from the day of \nintroduction until today is 44 days that we have moved this bill \nforward; so, it happened fast.\n  I think some of our staff, who worked very hard in this process to \nhelp get this bill done, actually had to fast over the Thanksgiving \nholiday. So my thanks go out to staff on both sides of the aisle for \nworking through the holiday as they did to get this bill put together \nand brought to the floor.\n  Ranking Member DeFazio and I worked diligently with our House and \nSenate conferees to put together this conference report. I want to \nthank Mr. DeFazio for all his efforts.\n  Before I describe the transportation provisions in the conference \nreport, I do want to note that the conference report includes numerous \nother provisions that were in either the House- or the Senate-passed \nversions of the bill. These provisions are in the jurisdiction of the \nCommittees on Ways and Means, Financial Services, Energy and Commerce, \nNatural Resources, and Judiciary.\n  Mr. Speaker, since I became chairman, one of my top priorities has \nbeen to pass a long-term surface transportation reauthorization bill. \nFor the last year and more, I have traveled across the country to talk \nto transportation and business leaders about the need for a \nreauthorization bill. What I have heard is that all States and \ncommunities have significant infrastructure needs and they all need \nlong-term certainty to address them.\n  The FAST Act represents a bipartisan and bicameral agreement to \nprovide that certainty. This is the first time we have come together in \na long-term bill in 10 years. It is fully paid for and reauthorizes \nFederal surface transportation programs for 5 years.\n  It improves our Nation's infrastructure, including our roads, public \ntransportation, and rail systems; reforms our Federal transportation \nprograms; refocuses these programs on national priorities, including \nthe flow of freight and commerce; provides greater flexibility for \nStates and local governments to address our needs; streamlines the \nFederal bureaucracy and accelerates project delivery; promotes \ninnovation to make our surface transportation system and programs work \nbetter; and maintains a strong commitment to highway, rail, and hazmat \nsafety.\n  This bill also includes robust reforms of Amtrak, which the House \nalready passed overwhelmingly this year. It cuts waste, holds Amtrak \naccountable, and increases transparency. It enhances opportunities for \ncompetition on routes and increases private sector participation in \nstation development and right-of-way leveraging. It gives States more \npower and control over their Amtrak routes.\n  This legislation has wide support from throughout the stakeholder \ncommunity.\n  The FAST Act invests in America, continues the essential Federal role \nin transportation, and helps keep our country economically competitive.\n  I strongly urge all my colleagues to support this conference report.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  I want to thank the chairman and the chairman of the subcommittee for \ntheir tremendous cooperation and hard work.\n  I certainly want to thank the staff, who spent the whole Thanksgiving \nbreak pulling this together and negotiating with the Senate, and I want \nto thank our colleagues in the Senate.\n  We have something that is very rare in Washington, D.C., these days \nhere on the floor of the House: a truly bipartisan approach to very \nreal problems confronting our Nation.\n  I have been to the floor many dozens of times to talk about our \ncountry falling apart, and I won't reiterate all those statistics again \ntoday. They are in the Record.\n  But this is now 10 years and 3 months since Congress last passed a \nlong-term bill. This 5-year bill will give States and local \njurisdictions, cities, and counties the capability of dealing with \nbigger problems that confront our system of transportation.\n  The series of short-term fixes we have had over the last 5 years and \n3\n\n[[Page H8989]]\n\nmonths, or the MAP-21 bill, did not give them the long-term certainty \nthey needed.\n  There is predictability in this bill. They know how much money they \nwill be receiving, and the levels are higher than current expenditures.\n  Sure, I think we should invest more, but the bill also contains a \nprovision I championed that says, should a future Congress allocate \nmore funds to Transportation and Infrastructure, that money will flow \nthrough the policies and the formulas in this bill with no further \naction required and no tampering by this or future Congress; i.e., it \nwould be expedited and it would go right into the investments we need \nto put more people back to work.\n  This will be the biggest jobs bill passed by this Congress. There is \nno way we can do more for the American economy than making these long-\nterm investments, putting hundreds of thousands of people to work \nrebuilding our critical infrastructure. It also doesn't just go to \nconstruction, design, engineering, and small business, as do highway \ncontracts. It also has a major investment in transit.\n  We increase the Buy America percent for transit vehicles to 70 \npercent. So that will create more American jobs. There are many other \ncritical things.\n  We create for the first time--amazingly, for the first time, given \nthe importance of our country--a major Federal freight program, an \nintermodal Federal freight program, that will help us be more \ncompetitive in the world economy and make major investments in more \nefficiently moving goods into our country and out of our country in \naccessing ports.\n  It invests in workers with reforms of the workforce retraining \nprogram. It promotes local control. We are increasing the share that \nflows through to local jurisdictions. The chairman already addressed \nthat. It invests in all modes. It preserves the existing split between \ntransit and highways and includes alternate modes.\n  It includes a new safety grant program to prevent bicycle and \npedestrian deaths, which would go to local or State jurisdictions that \nput forward comprehensive plans that deal with that growing problem.\n  It provides grants to States that come up with innovative future ways \nto fund transportation for them to experiment, laboratories around the \ncountry experimenting with vehicle miles traveled or other programs \nthat could pave the way for future bills in terms of spending and \ninvesting in our infrastructure.\n  It improves hazmat safety very significantly in this bill. It also \ninvests in rail--Amtrak--and will help local communities who are \ndealing with passenger commuter rail implement positive train control.\n  This is a true bipartisan product. I recommend a ``yes'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Graves), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and \nTransit.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in enthusiastic \nsupport for this conference report, which reauthorizes the surface \ntransportation program for 5 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would argue that few investments made by the Federal \nGovernment are more important than the ones we are discussing here \ntoday. We depend on a very well-run transportation network for just \nabout everything we do in this country. Improving that system becomes \nmore critical as we become more mobile as a society.\n  In the immediate future, this conference report is going to allow \nStates to plan and execute some much-needed infrastructure repair. In \nMissouri alone, long-term surface transportation reauthorization \ntranslates into improvements for 35,000 miles of highway and 10,000 \nbridges.\n  Specifically, this conference report reforms the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration and increases transparency within its \ncompliance, safety, and accountability program. These reforms will \nfundamentally change the way the agency analyzes and develops rules for \nthe trucking industry.\n  This is an industry that we all rely on as Americans, but Federal \nregulations continue to make it harder and harder for small and \nindependent truckers to do business.\n  The FAST Act also increases efficiency within high-cost construction \nprograms. It uses existing funding to develop a new formula for highway \nfreight projects and creates a competitive grant program for projects \nof national or regional importance.\n  While this 5-year reauthorization is fully paid for, it doesn't \naddress the long-term funding issues staring down the highway trust \nfund. That is why we directed research into more sustainable long-term \nfunding sources, including a user-funded model that does more than just \nrely on the existing gas tax.\n  But, looking ahead, this bill sets the stage for us to continue \nreshaping and rethinking America's transportation network. It will \nallow us to modernize roads and transit systems using innovations from \nthe private sector. It is going to help us employ advances in \ntechnology and interconnectivity to improve safety on America's \nhighways.\n  Ultimately, this report guarantees that local governments are going \nto no longer be forced to operate off of one short-term extension after \nanother. This gives the States the certainty and the funding they need \nto improve their roads, rebuild their bridges, and invest in their \ninfrastructure.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan work that the House and the Senate have \ndone to finalize this long-term Federal reauthorization. I would like \nto echo the words of the ranking member.\n  This was a very bipartisan bill. Thanks to Ranking Member DeFazio, \nChairman Shuster, and Ranking Member Norton, I think we did a fantastic \njob when it comes to putting the bill together. I look forward to \nseeing the President sign it.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nthe District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), the ranking member on the \nsubcommittee.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, the reputation of our committee is that we \nare the most bipartisan committee in the Congress, and I think we have \nshown it with this bill.\n  I can't thank my partners enough--Mr. Graves you just heard from; \nChairman Shuster; Mr. DeFazio, who is the ranking member; both good \nfriends and, of course, the staff--for their countless hours, including \nmissing Thanksgiving. I particularly thank the conference committee \nMembers because this bill needed compromises on both sides if we were \ngoing to get it done this year, and that is what we have done.\n  This bill was improved in conference in many ways. If you are in the \nStates, you will probably say the most important way is that you are \ngetting more funding than anticipated. There was a tradeoff, of course, \nbecause it is now a 5-year rather than a 6-year bill, and we needed the \nlongest term bill we could get; but it does mean almost $13 billion \nmore annually in funding for the States, and they were so starved for \nfunds that, I believe, this 5-year tradeoff was most important for us \nand for them.\n  The reason I have come to the floor with this chart is not to show \nyou something about my own district, but because this chart is \nemblematic of what this bill will do for your district and for \ndistricts all over the United States. I chose it because one of my \nmajor projects is the H Street Bridge. I didn't just choose a bridge; I \nchose a bridge with intermodality at its vortex. This is the bridge \nthat runs over Union Station. All you have to do is look at it, and you \nwill see the trains; and there is freight beneath this bridge, and \nmajor freight is in this bill. You will see Amtrak. Across the H Street \nbridge itself runs inner-city buses, local buses, and streetcars.\n  You see how transit is the key to development itself. So, if you \ndon't get the transit done, if you don't get the infrastructure done \nfor our bill, then other infrastructure which depends on it will not \noccur.\n  We are trying to expand Union Station here. This bridge has to be \ndone if they are to accomplish this. They are going to expand the Union \nStation concourse. This bill will allow the improvements in the \nNortheast corridor, which is so important to so many Members. In a real \nsense, this bridge and this poster tell the story of this bill.\n  There were so many of my major priorities in this bill that I would \njust\n\n[[Page H8990]]\n\nlike to say something about a couple of them.\n  One is the way we are now trying to get a hold of the highway trust \nfund which is a trust fund in name only--the $15 million to $20 \nmillion--that will allow for the States to experiment with new ideas. \nStates are the only ones that are doing it, which is going to be \nabsolutely necessary before the next long-term bill. We didn't have \nanything of the kind in MAP-21.\n  Look what we had to do instead. We took money to pay for this bill, \nfor example, from the Federal Reserve and from the strategic oil \nreserves, for the first time in history--that is the cutest one--\nbecause oil is worth less than when it was used as an offset. We had to \nface down this highway trust fund, and that is why my major priority \nwas new trust fund ideas.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. NORTON. Finally, I want to say that I am very pleased that we \nworked together to get the Disadvantaged Business Enterprises provision \ndone, and there is funding in this bill for a very important issue in \nour country for grants to address racial profiling.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Denham), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Railroads, \nPipelines, and Hazardous Materials. The gentleman did a lot of work on \nthe Amtrak bill, which made it into this final bill.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I appreciate the opportunity \nto have been a conferee on this important piece of legislation.\n  This piece of legislation was a bipartisan effort between not only \nRepublicans and Democrats in the House, but as a conferee who has been \nworking between the House and the Senate, we have now culminated a \nnumber of different issues that, for years, we have had hearings on. \nSpecifically, in the subcommittee that I chair--Railroads, Pipelines, \nand Hazardous Materials--we are dealing with passenger rail in this \nbill, with rail safety, and with hazardous material.\n  Under the hazmat title of this bill, it contains many important \nprovisions on crude-by-rail safety:\n  First, we require all new tank cars carrying flammable liquids to \nactually have a thermal blanket and top fittings protection, which is \nsomething that the DOT failed to include in its rule;\n  We also ensure that railroads provide States and local emergency \nresponders with information on crude-by-rail shipments within their \nStates. In my community, this is a huge issue for our first responders, \nwho want to know exactly what is traveling through our community;\n  We also include a provision that fixes a loophole that would have \nallowed more than 35,000 legacy DOT-111--these old tank cars--to \nactually remain in service.\n  The rail title follows closely the PRRIA bill of 2015--the passenger \nrail reauthorization--which we passed out of this House in March of \nthis year:\n  In the bill, we reform Amtrak to actually run more like a business, \nensuring that Northeast corridor profits get reinvested into the \ncorridor and make Amtrak more accountable to the States;\n  In the wake of the Philadelphia crash, we make a number of safety \nimprovements, including having cameras in the locomotives. I will \nremind you that the purpose of this video footage is to assist crash \ninvestigators, which is something that would be important in \nPhiladelphia. Let's make sure that this does not punish or retaliate \nagainst the employees.\n  Separately, this bill includes reforms that I have long championed \nand have based on legislation that I have authored in committee, the \nNEPA Reciprocity Act. We need to eliminate the duplicative \nenvironmental reviews. It will save us millions of dollars and years in \nproject delivery time while still ensuring that appropriate steps are \ntaken to mitigate the environmental impact. In California, we have the \nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act. We want to make sure that we have \na strong environmental policy. Let's just not waste years in \nduplication to get these projects done. Let's do them quickly. Let's do \nthem efficiently. Let's save millions of dollars in the process.\n  The bill also provides a much-needed boost in funding to fix our \ncrumbling bridges in our communities. In my community, I continuously \ntalk about the Seventh Street Bridge in Modesto. It is ridiculous that \nwe have any bridges that are below satisfactory, but in this case, this \nbridge is rated 2 out of 100.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DENHAM. It is so bad that we don't allow school buses on this. We \nhave passenger cars as well as trucks--trucks that carry goods through \nModesto and through our community--yet it is unsafe for school buses \nand our kids. This much-needed bridge funding will help us to fix many \nof these threats around our State and around the country.\n  Finally, this legislation will codify pets on trains. For years now, \npet owners have been able to take their pets on airplanes. I can go \nfrom California to D.C. with my dog; yet I can't take my small dog onto \nAmtrak. This now changes that. I know that it is a big deal for those \nwho travel on trains frequently to be able to take their pets with \nthem.\n  In conclusion, this is a great bipartisan, long-term highway bill, \nand I am excited that we are going to finally give certainty to our \nStates.\n  Again, I thank the chairman, Mr. DeFazio, and Mr. Capuano--all who \nworked hard to make this a great bipartisan effort.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Napolitano).\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the \nconference report on H.R. 22, the FAST Act. I do associate myself with \nthe remarks of Chairman Shuster, of Ranking Member DeFazio, and, of \ncourse, of their extraordinary staffs, including mine, who have been \nvery effective in working on this very bipartisan and very thorough \nbill.\n  I have been honored to serve on the conference committee, thanks to \nLeader Pelosi's appointment. I especially thank our transportation \nstakeholders in my district--California, of course--for their input on \nthe policies included in this bill, which will benefit not only \nCalifornia but many of our Nation's constituencies by improving their \ncommutes, by enhancing the transportation of goods to market, and by \nincreasing transportation safety and air quality.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Those entities that really sent good, solid \ninformation to this committee were the San Gabriel Valley Council of \nGovernments, the San Gabriel Valley Economic Partnership, the Alameda \nCorridor-East Construction Authority, the Foothill Transit, the Gold \nLine Foothill Transit Project, the Gateway Council of Governments, the \nAccess Services of Los Angeles, the LA Metro, the Southern California \nAssociation of Governments, Caltrans, the California Department of \nNatural Resources, and the California Department of Labor.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support, and I ask for an ``aye'' vote \nfrom all of us. This is a great bill thanks to their bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a list of the items that were \nable to be included in the bill.\n\n\n                         Overall Funding Levels\n\n       The bill authorizes Highway, Transit and Railroad programs \n     at $305 billion over 5 years. $281 billion is directly funded \n     from revenues in the bill (aka ``contract authority \n     programs'') which is for highway programs and most transit \n     programs. This is $12.8 billion higher than the House passed \n     bill. This higher funding level was requested by California \n     transportation agencies including Caltrans, the Metropolitan \n     Planning Organizations (MPOs) and the California Councils of \n     Governments (COGs).\n       $24 billion is authorized to be appropriated annually. The \n     programs needing appropriations are New Starts Transit \n     construction grants (which the larger California Transit \n     Agencies strongly support) and Amtrak passenger rail \n     investments (California has 3 of the top 5 Amtrak rail \n     corridors).\n\n\n Local Control--Increased Local Suballocation of Transportation Funding\n\n       The bill increasie's the percentage of funds that flow \n     directly to local regions (instead of the State) within the \n     Surface Transportation Program (STP) from the current 50% to \n     55%\n\n[[Page H8991]]\n\n     (1% per year). This issue was supported by CAL COG and local \n     CA Transportation agencies.\n\n\n                       Transit Funding Increases\n\n       The bill provides $13 billion over 5 years for the state of \n     good repair transit formula program. These funds are \n     distributed to state and local governments for repairs and \n     upgrading of rail and bus rapid transit systems. This is a \n     20% increase over current funding. The bill provides $3.7 \n     billion over 5 years for bus and bus facilities and sets \n     aside $1.5 billion for a competitive bus grant program. This \n     is a 75% increase over current funding. California Transit \n     agencies strongly supported increased transit funding.\n\n\n                            Freight Programs\n\n       The bill creates two funded freight programs. The first is \n     a Formula Freight program funded at $6.3 billion over 5 years \n     which is allocated to the states. The second is a Nationally \n     Significant Freight and Highway Projects Competitive grant \n     program funded at $4.5 billion over 5 years that state and \n     local governments can apply for.\n       Creating these funded freight programs was a big priority \n     of California Transportation agencies including Caltrans, \n     California Association of Councils of Governments, League of \n     CA Cities, Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the SF \n     Bay Area, Southern California Association of Governments, San \n     Diego Area Association of Governments, L.A. Metro, and \n     Sacramento Area Council of Governments.\n       In addition, language was included that many CA \n     Transportation agencies care about to make local \n     transportation agencies (such as JPA's) eligible recipients \n     of grant funds and to address local environmental impacts of \n     freight movement.\n\n\n Transportation Alternatives--bicycle, pedestrian, trails, safe routes \n                           to school projects\n\n       The bill funds transportation alternatives at $835 million \n     per year in 2016 and 2017 and $850 million per year in 2018, \n     2019 and 2020, which is more than the House bill level of \n     $819 million per year. The bill gives Metropolitan Planning \n     Organization's (MPO) new flexibility to use up to 50% of this \n     funding for other Surface Transportation Eligible projects. \n     California transportation agencies, environmental \n     organizations, bike associations, and safe route to school \n     advocates strongly support this program.\n\n\n                           TIFIA Loan Program\n\n       The TIFIA loan program is funded at $275 million/year in \n     FY16 & 17 and $300 million/year in FY18, 19, 20. This is more \n     than the $200M/yr in the House bill. TIFIA is strongly \n     supported by many California transportation agencies \n     (especially those with local transportation funding sources \n     such as sales tax measures) because they can use the \n     government backed loans to expedite their projects and save \n     money in the long run.\n       Language was included to allow unused TIFIA funds to go \n     back into TIFIA and to provide eligibility to Transit \n     Oriented Development projects. This language was also a \n     priority of CA transportation agencies.\n\n\n                 Railway Highway Grade Crossing Program\n\n       The bill maintains the current railway-highway grade \n     crossing program and increases funding by $5 million/year to \n     $245 million in FY20. California Transportation agencies, \n     including the Alameda Corridor East Construction Authority in \n     my district strongly support this program because safety \n     issues around highway rail grade crossings are a big concern \n     in our state.\n\n\n                     Positive Train Control Grants\n\n       The bill provides $199 million for positive train control \n     grants that commuter railroads can apply for. This was a big \n     priority of Metrolink as they are currently developing and \n     implementing positive train control safety systems.\n\n\n            New Starts Transit Construction Project Changes\n\n       The bill allows local transportation agencies to use \n     Surface Transportation Program funding as the local match for \n     New Starts. This was a priority of CA MPOs and CALTRANs \n     because the original House bill prohibited this flexibility \n     in funding.\n\n\n                  Transit Workforce Training Programs\n\n       The bill focuses transit workforce training programs on the \n     front line workforce (bus drivers, rail operators, mechanics, \n     etc.). The bill also focuses on career opportunities for \n     underepresented populations, including minorities, women, \n     veterans, low-income, and the disabled. This was a priority \n     of LA Metro and California Transit Unions.\n\n\n                        Transit Operator Safety\n\n       The bill requires DOT to perform a rulemaking on transit \n     operator safety to address the growing concern of violence \n     against transit workers. This was a priority of California \n     Transit Unions.\n\n\n   Allowing Paratransit Coordinated Fare Structures to Continue--Los \n                          Angeles County Issue\n\n       The bill allows Access Services paratransit provider of Los \n     Angeles County to continue using a tiered, distance-based \n     coordinated paratransit fare system. For over 20 years, \n     Access Services has had a DOT approved tiered fare structure \n     that averages all the fares of 44 transit agencies into 2 \n     fares. For riders traveling under 20 miles the fare is $2.75 \n     and for riders traveling over 20 miles the fare is $3.50 \n     (these paratransit fares are dramatically lower than the rest \n     of the country). DOT was going to require Access Services to \n     change their fare structure by Jan. 1, 2016 based on \n     confusing formulas for each individualized trip a disabled \n     customer takes. 95% of the public comments from the ADA \n     community strongly opposed this change. This provision will \n     allow Access to continue operating with their current tiered \n     fare structure.\n\n\n                              Buy America\n\n       The bill increases the domestic content requirement for \n     buses and transit rail cars from 60% to 70%.\n\n\n             Innovative Funding Alternatives Grant Program\n\n       The bill creates a $15-$20 million/year grant program to \n     allow states to experiment with alternative transportation \n     user fees such as vehicle miles traveled taxes. California \n     would benefit from this program because we are implementing \n     one of the only alternative transportation user fee pilot \n     programs in the country.\n\n\n     National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau\n\n       The bill creates a new Bureau within the office of the \n     Secretary to streamline the administration of the TIFIA and \n     RRIF loan programs, private activity bonds, and the new \n     freight program. California and Los Angeles County in \n     particular has been a large recipient of TIFIA and RRIF loans \n     but many agencies have complained at how long, burdensome, \n     and bureaucratic the process is. This Bureau will address \n     these concerns.\n\n\n  Funding for Locally owned Bridges on the Federal-Aid Highway System\n\n       The bill fixes a major concern Los Angeles County had with \n     the last transportation bill (MAP-21) which only allowed \n     bridges on the National Highway System to be funded by the \n     National Highway Performance Program. A lot of locally owned \n     bridges in California are on the federal-aid highway system \n     and previously received direct bridge funding but no longer \n     do because they are not on the National Highway System. This \n     bill allows all locally owned bridges on the federal-aid \n     highway system to be eligible for funding in the National \n     Highway Performance Program.\n\n\n                      Park and Ride Relinquishment\n\n       The bill allows states to relinquish ownership of park-and-\n     ride lots to local governments if they wish. This was a big \n     priority for CALTRANs and local CA MPOs like LA Metro because \n     some local agencies would like to take ownership of state \n     park-and-rides in order to invest in them and improve their \n     performance within regional, multimodal transportation \n     systems.\n\n\n             HOV Degradation Standards Impact on California\n\n       The bill allows for California or a local transportation \n     agency to apply for a waiver from the current HOV degradation \n     standard. It also requires the state or local agency to have \n     a plan to improve their HOV operations. Fixing problems with \n     how the current HOV degradation standard works in California \n     was a major priority of CALTRANs and local MPOs.\n       The current HOV degradation standard requires HOV lanes to \n     maintain an average speed above 45 mph 90 percent of the time \n     during peak hours. This standard does not take into account \n     the specific transportation concerns of each state. The most \n     recent data indicates that 60 percent of California's HOV \n     network is degraded under the current federal standard, but \n     it also indicates that ``recurrent congestion'' is not a \n     primary source of degradation in California. Other variables \n     such as inclement weather, traffic incidents, or \n     unforeseeable nonrecurring congestion have a greater impact \n     on HOV lane performance in California. The point of the \n     federal standard is to address manageable traffic policy \n     which is recurrent congestion. Since degraded facilities must \n     be brought back into compliance under this federal law, the \n     high levels of degradation in our state will require scarce \n     resources to correct a problem that, in the majority of \n     cases, is relatively infrequent and unpredictable. This bill \n     allows the state to request a waiver from this unreasonable \n     standard.\n\n\n   Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program \n               Funding for local Transportation Projects\n\n       The Conference Report continues to allow local California \n     Transportation agencies to fund transit, congestion \n     management, and bicycle/pedestrian projects with Congestion \n     Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program funds. The original \n     House and Senate bills contained provisions that local CA \n     transportation agencies strongly opposed that would have \n     restricted their ability to use CMAQ funds for actual \n     transportation projects.\n\n\n       No Preemption of CA Meal and Rest Break Laws for Truckers\n\n       The conference report does not include a provision from the \n     House bill that would have preempted state meal and rest \n     break laws as they apply to the trucking industry. The \n     original provision in the House bill was a direct attack on a \n     recent court decision in California that ruled that \n     California truck drivers were entitled to meal and rest \n     breaks under California labor law.\n       The California Department of Labor and the California \n     Teamsters strongly opposed the original House bill provision.\n\n\n No Comprehensive Oil Spill Response Plan Section that was opposed by \n                               California\n\n       The bill does not include Section 7011 of the original \n     House bill that required federal\n\n[[Page H8992]]\n\n     oil spill response plans for railroads. This section was \n     strongly opposed by the California Department of Natural \n     Resources because it would preempt state law and California's \n     ability to impose their own rail oil spill response plans.\n\n\n                        Privatizing Engineering\n\n       The bill does not include language requiring or \n     incentivizing states to outsource public engineering work. We \n     must continue to support states that hire public engineers in \n     order to protect the public interest.\n\n\n        Nation-wide Truck Size and Weight Issues not in the bill\n\n       The bill does not increase truck sizes with double 33s or \n     weights to 91,000lbs. (l.c. ``el''). There were attempts to \n     increase truck size and weights but they were strongly \n     opposed by CA Sheriffs Association, CA Peace Officers Assoc. \n     (PORAC), and CA highway safety groups.\n\n\n                Port Performance included was a concern\n\n       I am concerned that the bill includes a provision to \n     require the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to collect \n     data on port performance freight statistics at the nation's \n     top 25 ports. I am glad this provision was amended in \n     Conference to create a working group which includes labor \n     representatives and port representatives that will determine \n     how the port performance statistics program will be \n     implemented.\n\n\n                           WIFIA FIX Included\n\n       The Conference Report fixes a problem with the Water \n     Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan \n     program from WRRDA 14 that prohibited local water agencies \n     from combining tax exempt debt (i.e. municipal bonds) with \n     WIFIA loans. This Conference Report changes that and allows \n     water agencies to use municipal bonds (which are a major \n     source of their revenue) as the local match to federal \n     financing provided by the WIFIA. This fix to WIFIA was \n     strongly supported by CA water agencies including ACWA and \n     CASA.\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Gibbs), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources \nand Environment.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 22, Fixing \nAmerica's Surface Transportation Act.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, Chairman \nGraves, Ranking Member Norton, and my colleagues on the committee for \ncoming together to craft bipartisan legislation that provides States \nwith the certainty they need with this 5-year bill, which will provide \nlong-term infrastructure planning.\n  The FAST Act builds on the reforms that we did in MAP-21 to ensure \nthat projects are completed in a timely manner. I was pleased to see \nthat a number of priorities that are important to my district have been \nincluded in this legislation, including that of reforming the broken \nCompliance, Safety, Accountability program, which ensures that motor \ncarrier safety ratings are fair and accurate.\n  As the subcommittee chairman on Water Resources and Environment, we \nworked to get a provision into WRRDA called WIFIA. In this bill, we put \nin a provision to allow WIFIA loans to be used in conjunction with tax-\nexempt bonds to leverage private capital. This will help our \ninfrastructure needs and clean water projects. This is an important \nloan guarantee program that is similar to TIFIA, which provides \nmunicipalities with additional funding for water infrastructure \nprojects. This will complement programs like the Clean Water SRF \nProject.\n  I urge the support of this bipartisan legislation, which provides \ncertainty and makes a good investment to provide transportation in \norder to move commerce and people in the future.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Nadler).\n  Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the FAST Act, which authorizes $305 \nbillion over 5 years for highways, transit, and rail, including Amtrak. \nAlthough many of us would have preferred much higher funding levels, \nthe conference agreement provides an increase in funding of $12.8 \nbillion above the House bill and $26.8 billion in guaranteed funding \nabove fiscal year 2015 levels. The funding increase allows us to \npreserve core highway and transit programs and to still invest in new \nkey areas.\n  New York State will get an additional $1.5 billion above current \nlevels in highway and transit formula funding over the life of the \nbill, of which an estimated $500 million will go to projects in New \nYork City.\n  The bill provides $4.5 billion for the new freight program, \noriginally created in the House bill for large-scale, multimodal \nprojects that are critical to our regional and national economy. This \nwas a key recommendation of the freight panel on which I was the \nranking member, along with Mr. Duncan as chairman, and I am very proud \nthat it is included in the final conference report.\n  The bill increases funding for transit, including the major programs \nthat benefit New York, such as section 5340--High-Density States \nprogram, the State of Good Repair program, and capital investment \ngrants, and it preserves the ability to flex other transportation \nfunding toward major transit projects.\n  I am mostly pleased that the conference report authorizes $10.2 \nbillion over 5 years for intercity passenger rail, including $8 billion \nfor Amtrak; dedicates resources for Northeast corridor improvements; \nand provides $200 million to help commuter railroads implement positive \ntrain control. It also increases the liability limit on rail passenger \naccidents to $295 million, retroactively, to help cover claims for \nthose killed or injured in the Amtrak derailment outside of \nPennsylvania last May.\n  I commend Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, and my fellow \nconferees for all of their hard work in finally bringing a long-term \ntransportation bill to fruition. It has been too long. I am glad we \nfinally did it. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this conference \nreport.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Transportation Conference \nReport, now called the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) \nAct of 2015. I want to thank Chairman Shuster, and Ranking Member \nDeFazio, for developing a bipartisan bill that we can all be proud to \nsupport.\n  The Conference Report authorizes $305 billion over five years for \nhighways, transit and rail, including Amtrak. Although many of us would \nhave preferred higher funding levels closer to the Administration's \nGROW America Act, the conference agreement provides an increase in \nfunding of $12.8 billion above the House bill and $26.8 billion in \nguaranteed funding above FY15. Every state will get an increase in \ntransportation funding. New York State will get an additional $1.5 \nbillion above current levels in highway and transit formula funding \nover the life of the bill, of which an estimated additional $500 \nmillion will go to projects in New York City. The funding increase \nallows us to preserve these core programs, and still invest in new key \nareas.\n  The bill provides $4.5 billion for the new freight program, \noriginally created in the House bill, for large scale multimodal \nprojects critical to our regional and national economy. This was a key \nrecommendation of the Freight Panel that I co-chaired with Mr. Duncan, \nand I am very proud that it is included in the final Conference Report.\n  For over a decade, we have made various attempts to address major \nfreight projects that are too big or complex for states to address on \ntheir own. The PNRS program that we created in SAFETEA-LU was meant to \naddress such projects, but was divvied up into many, relatively small, \nearmarks. In MAP-21, the PNRS program was reauthorized, but subject to \nappropriations, and never received any funding. This bill finally gets \nit right, and provides guaranteed, dedicated funding to address goods \nmovement throughout the country.\n  In addition to the grant program for large multimodal projects, the \nbill includes a new freight formula program to the States passed as \npart of the Senate bill, and it requires strategic planning at the \nstate and federal level. All of these programs together will bring \nabout unprecedented resources to fund freight projects that are long \noverdue and critical to our economy. It is a ground breaking \nachievement, and one of the things that sets this bill apart from its \npredecessors.\n  The bill increases funding for transit, including all the major \nprograms that benefit New York. The Conference Report not only \nrestores, but increases, funding for the High Density State program \nunder Section 5340 that provides approximately $100 million for transit \nprojects all across New York State. The bill includes a 20% increase in \nfunding for the State of Good Repair program, and it increases funding \nfor Capital Investment Grants.\n  The conference report does not include language restricting the \nability of transit agencies to use other transportation programs, such \nas CMAQ and TIFIA, to fill the gap in federal funding for transit New \nStarts, which Mr. Lipinski and I fought against in the House bill. The \nbill maintains the historic 80/20 split between highway and transit \nfunding, and it provides enough finding to create a robust Bus & Bus \nFacilities grant program that will benefit all fifty states while \ndedicating resources to the programs upon which our urban centers rely.\n\n[[Page H8993]]\n\n  I am also pleased that the Conference Report authorizes $10.2 billion \nover five years for intercity passenger rail, including $8 billion for \nAmtrak, and dedicates resources for improvements along the Northeast \nCorridor. The bill includes language to help the Gateway project \ncompete for future funding, and it authorizes a new consolidated grant \nprogram to help railroads make safety and reliability improvements. \nAdditionally, the bill dedicates $200 million to help commuter \nrailroads implement Positive Train Control, and it increases the \nliability limit on rail passenger accidents to $295 million \nretroactively to help cover claims for those killed or injured in the \nAmtrak derailment outside of Philadelphia in May of this year.\n  Overall, this is a balanced bill that will provide certainty and \nreliability for transportation agencies over the next five years. It \nwould have been my preference to provide significantly more funding to \naddress the major backlog of investment needs on our roads, bridges, \ntransit and rail, but given the political reality this Conference \nReport is something we can all be proud to support. It increases \nfunding for core programs, addresses new critical areas, and although \nit includes a few objectionable provisions, it is generally free of \nmajor poison pills.\n  I commend Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, and my fellow \nconferees, for all their hard work in finally bringing a long term \ntransportation bill to fruition. I urge all my colleagues to vote for \nthis Conference Report.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Franks).\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to express concerns regarding a particular \nprovision in the bill before us today. The provision in question \nretroactively increases a Federal statutory cap on liability to cover \none railway accident that occurred earlier this year.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Mr. Speaker, retroactive legislation is not always unconstitutional, \nbut it is clearly disfavored. The Supreme Court outlined in a case \ncalled Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, and I quote:\n  ``Retroactivity is generally disfavored in the law, in accordance \nwith the `fundamental notions of justice' that have been recognized \nthroughout history. In his `Commentaries on the Constitution,' Justice \nStory reasoned: `Retrospective laws are indeed generally unjust; and, \nas has been forcibly said, neither accord with sound legislation nor \nwith the fundamental principles of the social compact.' ''\n  Mr. Speaker, while recognizing that retroactive legislation is \nconstitutional in some instances--limited instances, I might add--none \nof those instances would clearly appear to apply to the provision in \nquestion.\n  The Supreme Court further stated, ``Our decisions .  .  . have left \nopen the possibility that legislation might be unconstitutional if it \nimposes severe retroactive liability on a limited class of parties that \ncould not have anticipated the liability, and the extent of that \nliability is substantially disproportionate to the parties' \nexperience.''\n  In the case of the provision in question in the bill before us today, \nthe retroactivity imposes severe increases in liability--almost a 50-\npercent increase, in this case--on a limited class of parties who could \nnot have anticipated that liability.\n  While I support reasonable compensation for those who have been done \nlegal injury, I am concerned that this particular provision may not \npass constitutional muster. For that reason, I would register my \nconcern.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nLipinski).\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the FAST Act, which \nwill create jobs, boost the economy, ease congestion on our roads and \nrails, and improve our quality of life.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for \nproducing this bill and thank them for working with me in committee, on \nthe House floor, and on the conference committee to make this bill \nbetter.\n  Recommendations made by our Freight Panel, led by Chairman Duncan and \nRanking Member Nadler last Congress, led to new provisions that will \nimprove the efficiency of freight movement and ease congestion on our \nroads and rails. This is critical for our Nation's freight hub in \nnortheastern Illinois as we continue the CREATE rail program and other \nlarge freight projects.\n  The bill includes revisions I authored to create Buy America content, \ndeploy zero-emission buses, and improve tank car safety standards, \nwhich will produce more American jobs, protect the environment, and \nimprove community safety.\n  The FAST Act will also improve public transit and active \ntransportation infrastructure and safety. Commuter rail safety will be \nincreased through PTC grants, and this bill prepares us for the future \nby including research provisions from my FUTURE TRIP Act.\n  I would like to thank Science, Space, and Technology Committee \nChairman Smith for working with me on this. Thanks, finally, to my \nstaff--Andrew Davis, Jason Day, Eric Lausten, and Shawn Kimmel--and all \nthe committee staff for their work on this bill.\n  We have more work to do. This bill will not solve all of our \ntransportation problems, but this bill is a big step forward for jobs \nand for surface transportation in our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this conference report.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNevada (Mr. Hardy), a hardworking member of the committee.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking member for \nall their hard work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the long-term nature of this \nhighway bill.\n  After 35-plus extensions, the upper and lower Chambers of Congress \nare sending the President a 5-year highway bill. I want you to think \nabout that. We haven't had legislation this long that provided \ncertainty and confidence to our States in over 10 years.\n  Before coming to Congress, I was a general engineering contractor. I \nbuilt those highways, roads, bridges, and dams. I also previously \nserved on the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada, \nand I know what it takes to invest in infrastructure.\n  I will be honest. These short-term patches would have been a \ndisservice to our States and our districts. They need long-term \ncertainty to build a master plan for the future.\n  Many may not understand the aspects of what it takes to actually \nbuild infrastructure in our Nation. It is not all about just going out \nand investing a dollar and going and building a highway, a railroad, or \nother infrastructure. It takes a lot to go through the NEPA process and \nthe engineering processes before you can even get to the point where \nyou can turn a shovel of dirt.\n  So we need to make sure that we find other funding mechanisms for the \nfuture. We need to start today and recognize that we need to plan for \nthe future and invest in this country so it has quality infrastructure \nfor our safety and the needs of this country.\n  While the funding mechanisms are not perfect, we are moving in the \nright direction and putting our Nation back on the path to prosperity. \nThat is why I proudly stand here today as a conferee to support this \nlong-term funding bill.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. \nBrown).\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this certainly is a great day for \nthe people in this country, and I want to thank the leadership on this \ncommittee.\n  I believe wholeheartedly that this surface transportation bill will \ngive the economy just the type of boost it needs. A long-term \ntransportation bill will strengthen our infrastructure, provide quality \njobs, and serve as a tool to put America back to work long-term.\n  This important legislation includes a critical freight grant program, \nadditional funding for transit systems and pedestrian safety program, \nincludes funds to speed the implementation of positive train control, \nimproves the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loan \nprogram, and creates a disadvantaged business enterprise program at the \nFederal Railroad Administration.\n  It also includes additional funds for Amtrak, moves us closer to \nrestoring passenger rail for the Gulf States, and protects our ports \nfrom unnecessary paperwork.\n\n[[Page H8994]]\n\n  Transportation and infrastructure funding is absolutely critical to \nthis Nation. If properly funded, it serves as a tremendous economic \nboost. For every billion dollars we spend in transportation, it \ngenerates 44,000 permanent jobs. When we pass this legislation, we will \nput millions of hardworking Americans back to work to fix our Nation's \ncrumbling infrastructure and prepare our country for the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no better present for the people in this \ncountry than to pass this transportation bill.\n  Merry Christmas, and God bless America.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), a hardworking member of the committee.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, article I, section 8 of \nthe U.S. Constitution grants this body the power to regulate commerce \nwith foreign nations and among the several States as well as the power \nto establish post offices and post roads.\n  Maintaining and improving our Nation's infrastructure is an important \nconstitutional responsibility that we, as Members of this body, have, \nwhich is exactly why I told voters what I wanted to do when I came to \nWashington was to work together in a bipartisan fashion to address \nissues just like this transportation bill is going to address.\n  What does this bill mean to the voters in central Illinois who sent \nme here? It means about 80 percent of all of the road projects that are \nfunded in my State of Illinois are funded by Federal dollars.\n  The vision that has been laid out in this bill--and we could argue \nabout the pay-fors, whether they are not perfect. But we can also show \nthe American people that we can work together to rebuild our Nation's \ncrumbling infrastructure.\n  I am confident that as soon as this bill passes overwhelmingly today, \nunder the leadership of Chairman Shuster, he will begin debating how we \nmove into the future in our next transportation bill. That is what is \ngreat about service on this committee.\n  I want to commend Chairman Shuster, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member \nDeFazio, and all the hardworking members of this committee who put a \ngreat bill together.\n  Everybody has stood up and said it is not perfect, but no bill that \ncomes out of this institution is perfect. We don't always get \neverything we want, Mr. Speaker. But what we get is a long-term plan \nthat is allowing our States to continue to plan and rebuild our roads \nand bridges.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Shuster because he helped new leaders \non our committee become leaders in transportation. I want to talk about \nCresent Hardy, who just spoke a few minutes ago. He was able to show \nhis constituents that he is able to lead on transportation issues and \nwork together to get things done.\n  John Katko, Garret Graves--these are new members of the committee \nthat are able to go back to their constituents and show governing and \nbipartisan success.\n  This is what we came here to address, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer), the minority whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I want to congratulate both Mr. Shuster and Mr. DeFazio \nfor their work on this bill. I want to thank the Senate, as well, for \ntheir work and their leadership.\n  This is a good week, in many respects. We passed yesterday, on an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote, a bill to make sure that our education \nsystem works better. Today, we will pass, by an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan vote, a bill to give more stability and investment to our \ninfrastructure in America. Those are good things.\n  I lament the fact that, although the previous speaker talked about a \nsound, long-term fiscal path for infrastructure investment, my own view \nis we don't do that. We do better than what is but not what we ought to \ndo.\n  My own view is that we need to dedicate the user fee we call the \ngasoline tax at a level which has not been raised since 1993 to a level \nthat will in fact put us on a path to fiscal stability and certainty \nfor our infrastructure package.\n  But this is a good package, and I want to thank my friend Bill \nShuster for his leadership. Very frankly, that was critical to getting \nus to this point, not only on his side on the aisle but on our side of \nthe aisle as well. And I want to thank Mr. DeFazio.\n  As has been said, this is not a perfect reauthorization. We ought to \nstop saying that because nothing we pass is perfect. What we hope for \nis the good, and this is good. It is a compromise. All these efforts \nare critical to creating the kind of environment that encourage \nprivate-sector development and job growth.\n  At the same time, I am very pleased that a wide majority of Members, \nnearly every Democrat and most Republicans, worked together to ensure \nthat this conference report includes a multiyear reauthorization of the \nExport-Import Bank, supported by a majority of Republicans and all but \none Democrat.\n  It is unfortunate that Congress, through inaction by the Congress, \nallowed the Ex-Im Bank to shut down in July. Now, it didn't actually \nshut down, but it had no authority to guarantee loans, which cost us \njobs.\n  We are changing that policy in this bill. Today, we are coming \ntogether to reopen it so that it can help American businesses and \nworkers compete on a level playing field in overseas markets.\n  During the time the Bank was shut down, businesses began shifting \njobs overseas and others refrained from investing here because of the \nuncertainty over whether it would reopen. Today, that certainty will be \nrestored.\n  To that extent, the Export-Import Bank is in the same position that \nGovernors and mayors and county executives all over this country will \nbe put in by this bill, giving them some degree of certainty that there \nwill be a cash flow for infrastructure projects, bridges, roads, and \nother transportation items.\n  I want to thank again Ranking Member Maxine Waters for her work on \nthe Export-Import Bank and Denny Heck and Gwen Moore for their work \nthat led to this provision in the transportation bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. HOYER. I also want to thank, who showed great courage and great \nleadership, Stephen Fincher of Tennessee and Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, \nmy Republican colleagues, without whom this Export-Import Bank \nprovision would not be in this bill. I congratulate them for their \ncourage and their leadership.\n  I thank again Peter DeFazio and Bill Shuster.\n  This is a good day for our country. This is a bipartisan day for this \nCongress. And I urge my colleagues to support this product.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Mimi Walters), one of the newest members of our \ncommittee.\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support \nof the conference report for the FAST Act.\n  As a member of the House Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, I am pleased this bill reflects the committee's hard \nwork. This legislation makes a fundamental investment in our Nation's \nroads, bridges, and infrastructure, providing long-term certainty for \nlocal governments and ensuring the efficient movement of consumer \ngoods.\n  Importantly, it also streamlines the environmental review and \npermitting processes to ensure transportation projects stay on time and \non budget.\n  I was pleased that three provisions of significance to my district \nwere included in the final bill. One directs Department of \nTransportation to study the effects of marijuana-impaired driving. The \nsecond would incentivize the use of innovative pavement material. The \nthird would help address congestion in HOV lanes.\n  This 5-year bill is fully paid for and will put a stop to short-term \nextensions that are costly to taxpayers and create significant \nuncertainty for local and State governments.\n  I am pleased to support this historic bill coming before the House \nfloor today, and I thank Chairman Shuster for his hard work in making \nthis bill a reality.\n\n[[Page H8995]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Frankel).\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the FAST \nAct, our first long-term surface transportation bill in nearly 10 \nyears.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for their \nbipartisan leadership. It has truly been an honor to work on a \ncommittee where we can show the American people that we know how to \nwork together.\n  Mr. Speaker, transportation moves our economy. Passing the FAST Act \nwill shift America's infrastructure into higher gear. This legislation \nbrings American families tens of thousands of new good-paying jobs \nwhile promoting safer, more efficient travel on our transportation \ninfrastructure. It sends more dollars to our local communities, who \nknow their needs best.\n  I will associate myself with the remarks of my colleague \nRepresentative Brown when I say that this is a wonderful gift to the \nAmerican people for this holiday season.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Marino).\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking \nMember DeFazio for their work and express my appreciation for the \nopportunity to serve as a conferee.\n  There are several significant items in this bill that fall within the \njurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Chairman Goodlatte and I were also deeply involved in another part of \nthis important bill: efforts to enact meaningful and effective permit \nstreamlining reforms. Enacting legislation to streamline the Federal \npermitting process has been among my primary goals.\n  The RAPID Act, my bill to improve and review permitting timelines, \nhas passed this House on three occasions on a bipartisan basis. Our \ngoal has been to fix the flaws in our Federal permitting process that \ntoo often doom projects, leaving millions of jobs and hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in economic activity on a bureaucrat's desk.\n  This year, we worked with our colleagues Senators Portman and \nMcCaskill on this important project. The amendment we offered on the \nfloor during House consideration of this measure represented a \ncarefully crafted compromise that further achieves these goals. It was \nthe product of a bipartisan cooperation, and I am proud that these \nprovisions were included in the conference report we are considering \ntoday.\n  This conference report is an example of the many ways that we can \nreach across the aisle to find solutions to problems facing us. Our \npriorities will make lasting reforms that are sure to improve our \ninfrastructure and strengthen our economy. I am glad they will be made \nlaw through the enactment of this conference report.\n  This 5-year bill establishes certainty, stability, confidence, and, \nmost importantly, trust. I am a States' rights guy, and the less \nFederal Government in my life, the better. Congress has removed \nobstacles for the States, who know best what is needed for their \ninfrastructure. We must continue to remove impediments for our States \nto move into the 21st century without job-crushing regulations.\n  Please support this bill. This bill will improve the quality of life \nfor all Americans.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on \nboth sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 10\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Nolan), a member of the committee.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by getting the \nattention of our chairman over there and thanking him for the terrific \njob that he did, as well as our ranking member, Mr. DeFazio. It was a \nreal treat. It was, for me, a take-back to an earlier time when regular \norder prevailed around this place.\n  Quite frankly, that is how you fix things and get things done. It is \nnot always just a matter of attitude; it can be a matter of process. \nWhen you have a chair and a ranking member that welcome all members to \nbring their ideas before the committee, to have an opportunity to have \nthem discussed, examined, argued, and debated, that is how you bring \npeople together. That is how you fix things. That is how you get things \ndone.\n  I would also be remiss if I didn't thank the staff, both the \nRepublican and Democratic staff. You all worked so hard and late into \nthe night and long hours, day after day, getting us to this point. I \nthank my own staff assistant, Eddie Wytkind, in particular, for the \nwork that he has done on this.\n\n  With regard to the bill itself, you know, finally, after kicking this \ncan down the road some 34, 35 times, we finally have the kind of long-\nterm surface transportation legislation that people in this country \nhave been crying for and begging for so that we could begin fixing the \nroads and the bridges that are falling down and the trains that have \nbeen coming off the tracks.\n  It is a good, nonpartisan piece of legislation that will allow our \nStates, our counties, and our cities to plan accordingly. Of course, \nthat brings with it greater efficiency.\n  It will put a lot of people back to work. Everyone has told us that \ninfrastructure, transportation is fundamental to our ability to grow \njobs, to grow our economy, and to strengthen business opportunities.\n  I am particularly grateful for our Duluth amendment that solves a \nparticular little problem, but an important one, that we have there \nwith regard to logging trucks on our Main Street.\n  Last but not least, I want to commend the leadership for including \nthe reauthorization of Ex-Im Bank with this. As we all know, it is a \ngreat banking institution that helps us reduce the deficit and creates \njobs throughout the country, including the Eighth District of \nMinnesota.\n  Thank you to all who were a part of moving this important legislation \nforward.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Graves).\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to \nbe here today.\n  This is a historic event. For 10 years now, we have been doing \npatches and temporarily providing funding for our roadways. It costs \ntaxpayers money to do that, to do these temporary extensions, to \ncompartmentalize the funding. You have to take projects, and you have \nto separate them into smaller pieces. You have to pay for contractors \nto come out and to leave and to come back again. I will say it again: \nIt costs taxpayers money to continue to do these patches and these \ntemporary extensions.\n  This is historic because it provides 5 years of funding. It provides \nfunding certainty.\n  Having run a large-scale infrastructure program for a number of \nyears, I am well aware of the difficulty caused by doing these \ntemporary patches and the increased cost. I will tell you, I think it \nresults in less safe roads. It absolutely doesn't deliver what \ntaxpayers deserve.\n  The other great thing about this bill and a reason that it is \nhistoric is that it is bipartisan, something that has been lacking for \nsome time now, to see that Members on both sides come together on \nsomething as important as infrastructure funding.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster, I want to thank Ranking Member \nDeFazio, respective staff directors Chris and Kathy, and everyone who \nworked on this bill on the conference staff. I know you put in a lot of \ntime and you gave up your Thanksgiving. I want to thank you very much \nfor all the work that has been done.\n  This bill also increases funding for transportation. It results in \nnearly a 10-percent increase in investment in infrastructure. In the \ncase of Louisiana, we will see a $100 million increase in the fifth \nyear of this bill--a $100 million increase just in that one year as \ncompared to current funding levels. We need these funds.\n  Something else important in this bill is the grant program that was \nestablished in the House bill for nationally significant corridors, for \nfreight corridors, $800 million to $1 billion a year to address these \nlarge-scale infrastructure needs that have not been addressed.\n\n[[Page H8996]]\n\n  In the case of my home State of Louisiana, we are in dire need of a \nnew crossing on the Mississippi River. Getting across that \nextraordinary bottleneck, where the interstate drops down to one lane--\nthe only place in the United States--is a great need that we have. It \ncauses incredible traffic problems.\n  Addressing roads that need to be upgraded, like LA 1, Highway 30, \nconnecting Walker to Gonzales, addressing a Pecue Lane exit, upgrading \nHighway 90 to interstate standards--projects that are in dire need and \ncause national implications because of their inability to efficiently \nmove commerce across this country, Louisiana being one of the top \nexport States in the United States.\n  This bill also ensures that the roads are safer, ensures that we \naddress at-grade rail crossings, ensures that we have the right safety \nmechanisms in place to ensure that we are not going to have fatalities \nassociated with driving and traffic accidents.\n  Importantly, this bill addresses technology. Mr. Speaker, we are \nstill using traffic light technology from the 1920s. It is 2015. We can \nactually do on our telephones what took mainframe computers decades \nago.\n  This bill establishes a framework to ensure that innovation, to \nensure that competition is actually integrated into our traffic \nmanagement systems so we are not sitting around at traffic lights when \nno other cars are there, to ensure that our cars can communicate with \none another, our phones can communicate with traffic lights, where we \ncan really take intelligent transportation systems to the next level.\n  It expedites the NEPA and environmental review process to ensure that \nwe are getting dirt turned and getting roads in place as soon as \npossible while still respecting the environment.\n  It, importantly, includes something that we were pushing very hard, \nthe Sport Fish Restoration and the Boating Safety Act, ensuring that \nboat safety, ensuring that sport fish and restoration, ensuring that \nthe CWPPRA program continues to move forward and we have those \nimportant restoration activities.\n  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I just want to say I appreciated very much the \nopportunity to be a conferee. This is a historic bill. And I want to \nurge: Increased funding, safer roads--this is the right direction for \nthis country. Support this conference report.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Oregon for \nyielding.\n  The bipartisan highway conference compromise before us is just that, \na compromise. But, despite its faults, I will support it.\n  While this bill adequately funds our Nation's long-term highway \ninfrastructure needs, which our communities desperately need, it does \nfall short of making the robust long-term investments our crumbling \ninfrastructure truly needs.\n  I am pleased the bill does take an important step to protect \nconsumers by prohibiting companies from renting or loaning out \ndangerously recalled vehicles for the first time. I have spearheaded \nthis effort for years in honor of Raechel and Jacqueline Houck, two \nyoung sisters who were killed by their rented vehicle that was under \nrecall.\n  To be clear, this is an important step for consumer safety. But I am \ndisappointed that, during conference, companies with fewer than 35 \nrental or loaner vehicles were exempted. Unfortunately, by our bowing \nto special interests, some consumers will still be at risk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. However, we will continue to build on the important step \nof holding large rental companies and auto dealers accountable until, \none day, all Americans can be confident that the cars that they drive \nare safe. This is our goal: that all rental cars be safe for their \ndrivers to engage in as they rent them.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have already thanked the committee staff. They did do \na fabulous job.\n  I also want to recognize others who were involved: the Senate staff \nof the Committee on Environment and Public Works; the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation; and the Committee on Finance.\n  Over here, we are a little more consolidated when we deal with these \nissues. The Senate is a little more spread out, but that is the Senate. \nThey were all involved and all a critical part of this product.\n  I also want to thank some others, beyond committee staff. The House \nLegislative Counsel, led by Curt Haensel, has provided a tremendous \nassistance in the drafting of this very extensive legislation, as well \nas the staff of the U.S. Department of Transportation, particularly the \nFederal Highway Administration.\n  Curt Haensel and Carolyn Edwards of FHWA have been involved in every \nsurface transportation bill since the nineties, and their expertise was \ninvaluable. We come up with policy ideas, but they have to figure out a \nway to lay down the legislative language so that we accomplish those \ngoals. So they did great work.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is, as many have said, historic for this Congress \nand recent Congresses in terms of the bipartisan nature of it and the \nfact that we are putting in place long-term assurances for major \ninvestments that our country needs for our transportation \ninfrastructure. But it is a starting point. This is not the end.\n  It provides certainty and modest funding increases for the next 5 \nyears, but it does not even rise to the level of assuring that our \ntransportation infrastructure 5 years from today will be in a better \nstate of repair than it is now.\n  There are tremendous unmet needs out there. This will help, but it is \nnot the overall solution. Numerous times we have moved money from the \ngeneral fund into the highway trust fund. We are again engaging in that \nactivity here. The total, at this point, is $145 billion.\n  I don't resent moving general fund money, but I think there are \nbetter ways and more certain ways and more robust ways to finance the \nfuture of our investments in infrastructure.\n  So we can say today we are celebrating, as we should, but there is \nmore work to do. Next week, we should begin anew and recognize that we \nhave to work together--Democrats and Republicans, truckers, transit \nagency, builders, and shippers--to find a way to restore the user fee \nmechanism to finance these investments.\n  President Eisenhower is often credited with establishing the \nInterstate Highway System, which now bears his name. Actually, Congress \ndesignated the system in the forties, but it was not until 1956 that \nCongress, with then-President Eisenhower, developed a user fee system \nto actually construct our incredible interstate system.\n  So we need to work together to renew the mandate and find a path \nforward for long-term, sustainable funding for these critical \ninvestments. Celebrate today, but it is back to work tomorrow.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In my closing, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my \nHouse colleagues on both sides of the aisle, members of the committee, \nand the conferees.\n  There was broad, bipartisan support of this bill. There are over 250 \nMembers of this House that contributed to the bill. Working together on \nthis important piece of legislation I think proves to the American \npeople that we can get big things done.\n  I would also like to thank Mr. DeFazio. He has been a real partner in \nthis. We certainly had our moments of disagreement, but we were able to \nwork through it and get a bill which he and I say is a good, solid \npiece of legislation. And, through that effort, we were able to achieve \nthat.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Norton for \ntheir hard work and support in this effort.\n  I want to thank the vice chair of the full committee, Mr. Duncan, who\n\n[[Page H8997]]\n\nchaired two important panels last Congress, one on freight movement and \none on public-private partnerships. From that work with a cross-section \nof the committee and across jurisdictional lines of the subcommittees, \nthey were able to produce recommendations that became critical parts of \nthis bill. So I thank Congressman Duncan from Tennessee for his work.\n  Finally, I thank the Speaker of the House. In becoming Speaker, he \ntold the Conference and our House he was going to make sure we did \nregular order. This bill is a product of regular order. He had an open \nprocess on the House floor. We dealt with over 103 amendments specific \nto the transportation portion of the bill but then another 20 or so \nthat dealt with provisions in this bill.\n  So it was an open process, and, again, I want to thank Speaker Ryan \nfor keeping his word to the Members of this body to have regular order \nand an open process.\n  I also want to thank my Senate colleagues and their conferees for \ntheir efforts in putting together this bill.\n  I want to thank the House and Senate Legislative Counsel, who don't \noften get a whole lot of credit, but I thank Curt Haensel, Tom Dillon, \nRosemary Gallagher, Karen Anderson, and Tim Brown, for their efforts in \nwriting up this bill and helping us throughout this process.\n  Finally, I want to thank the staffs of both the majority and minority \nof the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. As I said in the \nopening remarks, they worked through the Thanksgiving holiday, a lot of \nlong hours, and they are dedicated to the work of this committee. We \nwouldn't be here today without their efforts. I thank them from the \nbottom of my heart for their efforts.\n  I will include in the Record the names of those committee staff \npeople because it is a long list and I don't want to screw anybody's \nname up. I just want to say thanks again for their long hours in \ngetting this bill put together and brought to the floor.\n\n           Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Staff\n\n\n                          Republican T Staff\n\n       Chris Bertram, Matt Sturges, Jennifer Hall, Murphie \n     Barrett, Geoff Gosselin, Mary Phillips, Alex Etchen, Caryn \n     Moore Lund, Nicole Christus, Kristin Alcalde, Jim Billimoria, \n     Clare Doherty, Keith Hall, Justin Harclerode, Holly Woodruff \n     Lyons, Hannah Matesic, Collin McCune, Tracy Mosebey, Anna \n     Oak, Max Rosen.\n       Beth Spivey, David Connolly, Arielle Giordano, Fred Miller, \n     George Riccardo, Adam Twardzik, Kevin Rieg, Isabelle Beegle-\n     Levin.\n\n\n                           Democrat T Staff\n\n       Liz Cooney, Kathy Dedrick, Jen Gilbreath, Ashley Guill, \n     Russ Kelley, Ward McCarragher, Ben Lockshin, Auke Mahar-\n     Piersma, Andrew Okuyiga, Luke Strimer, Helena Zyblikewycz, \n     Ryan Sieger, Jennifer Homendy, Alexa Old Crow.\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. The FAST Act is absolutely critical to America and our \neconomy. I think everybody speaking here today laid out the many \nprovisions. It is important to America.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to all support this bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement. And I believe it will have strong support today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge everybody to vote for this bill. It is good for \nAmerica.\n\n  Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee on Conference H.R. 22, \n              Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act\n\n       Title XLIII of the Joint Explanatory Statement provides a \n     summary of section 43001 concerning requirements in agency \n     rulemakings pursuant to this Act. Section 43001 of the House \n     amendments to H.R. 22 was not agreed to in conference and \n     does not appear in the conference report to accompany H.R. \n     22. The summary of section 43001 in the Joint Explanatory \n     statement therefore appears in error. Accordingly, title \n     XLIII of the Joint Explanatory Statement has no effect.\n\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we were able to come \ntogether to find a longer-term solution for our nation's \ninfrastructure. We cannot keep operating on short-term fixes. \nInvestments in our country's infrastructure need certainty. Though I \nwould have preferred to see greater funding levels across the board, I \nam pleased to see provisions such as the High Density States Program \nare protected and funded for the next five years. While I will vote for \nthis bill because it puts Americans back to work and allows our state \nand transit authorities to do long-term planning for our crumbling \ninfrastructure, I must highlight some of the reasons this bill falls \nshort.\n  The most substantial decreases in injuries and deaths on our roads \nand highways occurred as a result of major safety advancements, such as \nrequiring seatbelts and airbags in all new cars. Today, we have a \nvehicle title that does not include such a safety advancement and does \nlittle to improve safety. This was a missed opportunity. This bill \ncould have included meaningful safety improvements, such as imminent \nhazard authority to allow NHTSA to expedite a recall order when \nnecessary, a requirement that ensured recalled used cars are repaired \nbefore they are sold, safety standards for rear seat crashworthiness, \nand the elimination of regional-only recalls that no longer make sense \nfor our increasingly mobile world. And civil penalties should have been \nhigher so that sacrificing safety will not be treated as a ``slap on \nthe wrist'' or just another cost of doing business.\n  Instead, this vehicle title includes provisions that take a step \nbackwards on safety and that could actually lead to more injuries and \ndeaths on our roads. For example, it includes a provision that exempts \nan unlimited number of replica cars--that is, new cars made to resemble \nold cars--from vehicle safety laws, clean air requirements, and state \nemissions testing. It also includes a whistleblower provision that will \nnot encourage, and may effectively discourage, whistleblowers from \nreporting serious safety problems to the government. And even the \npromising rental car provision section, which requires rental car \ncompanies and auto dealers to repair recalled cars before renting or \nloaning them to customers, was weakened by excluding those that have a \nfleet of fewer than 35 vehicles.\n  I am disappointed that the bicameral, bipartisan process failed to \ncraft a vehicle title that actually enhances safety.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan \ntransportation authorization, the Fixing America's Surface \nTransportation Act, also known as the FAST Act.\n  I thank the Chairman for his leadership on this bipartisan \ntransportation reauthorization.\n  This is a 5-year bill that provides both budgetary certainty and \nproject flexibility for our states and localities so that they may \ninvest in and upgrade our transportation system and do so with more \ninnovative technologies and approaches.\n  The certainty provided by this long-term bill also saves money by \nstopping the short term patches that complicate planning and yield cost \noverruns.\n  As a representative in Northern Virginia, I know too well the traffic \ncongestion issues we face and appreciate that this bill provides much-\nneeded assistance in this area.\n  I am pleased to have served on the Conference Committee for this \nbill, and pleased that numerous provisions from one of my bills on \ncongestion relief and research were included.\n  This measure will help promote the development of transportation \ntechnologies and tools for congestion relief.\n  The bill also includes some of my provisions related to Metro safety \nand accountability that I worked on with my DC and Maryland \ncounterparts, Ms. Holmes Norton and Ms. Edwards.\n  Again, I thank everyone involved in this process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the FAST Act.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, now that the House has approved the \nconference report I would like to recognize and commend my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle for supporting the inclusion of bill \nlanguage in H.R. 22 (Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act of \n2015) that will help protect consumers from the longstanding problem of \npredatory towing.\n  For some time now, egregious vehicle towing and storage practices \nperformed by some unscrupulous companies have been a serious concern in \nmany parts of the country. While the vast majority of towing and \nstorage firms are honest and well-intentioned, some have been engaged \nin predatory business tactics designed to delay access to vehicles and \nincrease costs for consumers. Because these companies have possession \nof vehicles, they are in a position to take advantage of consumers and \ncharge excessive towing and storage fees.\n  For reasons that are not entirely clear, current Federal law allows \nstates to regulate some, but not all aspects of tow truck operations, \nlimiting their ability to protect consumers from predatory towing \ntactics. The language included in the amendment introduced by myself \nand Rep. Van Hollen broadens the authority of states and localities to \nregulate tow truck operations, which is limited by current motor \ncarrier law. This additional authority will now allow states and \nlocalities to regulate all aspects of tows conducted without the prior\n\n[[Page H8998]]\n\nconsent or authorization of the owner or operator of a vehicle. The \nlanguage is also intended to apply to accident scene and breakdown \ntowing, to allow states to protect consumers who are often unable to \nmake an informed choice and give meaningful consent or acknowledgment \non towing in those situations.\n  I want to thank the conference chair and vice chair for their support \nof this important provision. I would also like to thank my predecessor, \nJim Moran, who was a champion on this issue for so long and first \nintroduced this language during the 109th Congress.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day, as we are voting \nfor a five year surface transportation reauthorization bill that \nprovides critical investment to our roads and bridges. This will help \nkeep America competitive and provide certainty to states and \ncommunities planning infrastructure projects.\n  However, it is irresponsible that neither the House nor the Senate \nhas worked on serious reforms. We have not adjusted the user fee for \nour infrastructure in 20 years or considered new, sustainable revenue \nstreams. Instead, we have spent valuable time searching for short term \ngimmicks. Make no mistake; I am disappointed with the offsets in this \nbill. We should not be robbing the banks or Customs to pay for our \nroads and bridges.\n  This is fiscally irresponsible. At some point, we have to say enough \nis enough. That time has come. We need a long-term, robustly funded \nbill. We missed an opportunity with this legislation, but we in \nCongress must work together to continue finding common ground on \ninnovative ideas to ensure the Highway Trust Fund has a sustainable \nrevenue source. We cannot allow our children and grandchildren to pay \nfor the investments we should be making now.\n  As a Conferee, I was happy to work with Chairman Shuster, Ranking \nMember DeFazio, and my Senate Colleagues on important roadway safety \nissues, such as preventing heavier trucks from driving on our local \nroads.\n  This bill fully funds the Highway Safety Improvement Program, which \ninvests in infrastructure like guardrails, rumble strips, and \nretroreflective signs. While you will never read the headline, ``Rumble \nstrip saves family of four,'' this program saves lives every day and \nfor that reason alone, I urge my colleagues to support this bill today.\n  Additionally, I was pleased to see common-sense provisions that I \nchampioned included in the final agreement. For example, I introduced \nthe Local Farm Vehicle Flexibility Act to make sure farm vehicles are \nnot regulated like long haul trucks. Today, this highway bill includes \nlanguage to prevent farmers from getting tickets for driving from field \nto field without covering their load.\n  It makes crude oil being transported by freight rail safer and gives \nfirst responders more time to react in the unlikely event of a \nderailment by including top fitting protections for the pressure relief \nvalves. It also includes language that I strongly support to reduce \npaperwork burdens on concrete truck drivers.\n  I worked with my fellow conferees to encourage the use of U.S. iron \nand steel in rolling stock frames and car shells. This provision will \nincrease use of U.S. iron and steel in the fabrication of rolling stock \nframe and car shell components and subcomponents.\n  Finally, many of the policy ideas that I introduced in the Safer \nTrucks and Buses Act were incorporated in this final version. We must \nwork to make sure we fix the important safety score program so that \ngood decisions can be made on scores that actually represent truck and \nbus safety records.\n  Investing in infrastructure is good for the economy and good for \nAmerica. I am happy to vote for this long term bill and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on policy ideas that could be included in a \ncomprehensive tax reform bill to ensure the Highway Trust Fund has a \nsustainable funding source.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Conference \nReport to H.R. 22, the ``Surface Transportation Reauthorization and \nReform Act of 2015,'' a bill to authorize Federal Funding for highways, \nhighway safety programs, and transit programs.\n  I thank Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Shuster, Ranking \nMember DeFazio and the House and Senate Conferees for their work in \nbringing the Conference Report for the Surface Transportation \nReauthorization and Reform Act to the floor for a vote.\n  It is good to see the spirit of bipartisanship return to the process \nof funding our nation's transportation needs.\n  As the former Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security \nSubcommittee on Transportation Security, I am well aware of the \nimportance of our nation's transportation system.\n  A well-functioning transportation system is critical to the nation's \nprosperity.\n  Whether it is by road, transit, aviation, rail, or waterway, we rely \non our transportation system to move people and goods safely, \nfacilitate commerce, attract and retain businesses, and support jobs.\n  Houston is the fourth most populous city in the country; but unlike \nother large cities, we have struggled to have an effective mass transit \nsystem.\n  Over many decades Houston's mass transit policy was to build more \nhighways with more lanes to carry more drivers to and from work.\n  The city of Houston has changed course and is now pursuing mass \ntransit options that include light rail.\n  This decision to invest in light rail is strongly supported by the \nincreased use by Houstonians in the light rail service provided by \nprevious transportation appropriations bills.\n  The April 2014, Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority report on \nweekly ridership states that 44,267 used Houston's light rail Service--\nrepresenting a 6,096 or 16% change in ridership in April of last year.\n  This increase in light rail usage outpaced ridership of other forms \nof mass transit in the city of Houston: metro bus had a 2.3% increase \nover April 2013; metro bus-local had a 1.3% increase over April 2013; \nand Metro Bus-Park and Ride had an 8.0% increase over April 2013.\n  On February 5, 2013, the Houston Chronicle reported on the congestion \nHouston drivers face during their daily commute to and from work.\n  The article reported that Houston commuters continue to experience \nsome of the worst traffic delays in the country, according to the 2012 \nurban mobility report. Houston area drivers wasted more than two days a \nyear, on average, in traffic congestion, costing them each $1,090 in \nlost time and fuel.\n  Funds made available by the legislation will be available for the \nconstruction of the University rail line and support of local \ngovernment decisions by the Houston Metropolitan transit Authority and \nthe city of Houston to expand rail service.\n  More needs to be done to address the transportation needs of our \nnation from rural communities to major metropolitan areas.\n  I appreciate that two Jackson Lee Amendments are included in the \nunderlying bill.\n  The first Jackson Lee Amendment ensures that the goals of improving \ntransportation efficiency and safety take into consideration the topic \nof public safety, a rest stop, and public parking that is funded by \nthis bill.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment requires the Transportation Secretary to \nreport to Congress on the security of locations that are intended to \nencourage public use of alternative transportation, as well as personal \ntransportation parking areas.\n  An essential part of the success of public transportation usage is \nthe ability of automobile drivers to park their vehicles in safety.\n  More than 1 in 10 property crimes occur in parking lots or garages.\n  The report will provide an opportunity for Congress to do more to \nenhance the safety of parking areas that are used by students, women, \nseniors, disabled, and other vulnerable members of the public.\n  The Bureau of Justice Statistics provides a detailed report on the \nplace of occurrence for violent and property crimes from 2004 through \n2008.\n  For example, purse snatchings and pocket pickings typically occur \naway from home.\n  According to Bureau of Justice Statistics 28.2% of purses snatched \noccur in open areas such as the street or on public transportation.\n  The inclusion of this Jackson Lee Amendment will lead to enhanced \nsafety of car pool parking lots, mass transit parking; local, state, \nand regional rail station parking; college or university parking; bike \npaths, walking trails, and other locations the Secretary deems \nappropriate.\n  The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that victimization and \nproperty crimes occurring between 2004 and 2008 in parking lots and \ngarages include: 213,540 victimization crimes that occurred in \nnoncommercial parking lots and garages; and 864,190 property crimes.\n  The Bureau's report on victimization crimes that occur at public \ntransportation or in stations was 49,910 and property crimes was \n132,190.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment will make surface transportation travel \nsafer.\n  More importantly, it will increase safety of the traveling public, \nespecially women, seniors, students, disabled persons, and children.\n  The second Jackson Lee Amendment included in the Conference Report \nprovides a report to Congress from the Secretary of the Department of \nTransportation on the ``Internet of Things'' (IoT) and its potential to \nimprove transportation services to the elderly and persons with \ndisabilities as well as assist local, state and federal transportation \nplanners in achieving better efficiencies and cost effectiveness, while \nprotecting privacy and security of persons who use IoT technology.\n  The IoT refers to the wireless environment that will support \nnetworking of physical objects or ``things'' embedded with wireless \nelectronic components, software, sensors, and network connectivity \ntechnology, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data on \npeople, places and things.\n\n[[Page H8999]]\n\n  The IoT will introduce the functionality of computing into physical \nspace as computing technology is integrated into devices and systems.\n  It will also challenge the privacy and security of users of the \ntechnology if precautions are not taken to ensure that information on \nthese devices is not protected.\n  This Jackson Lee Amendment will allow Congress to take into \nconsideration how IoT technologies can be used to make public \ntransportation, safer, more convenient to the elderly and disabled, and \nhow it may improve mass and personal transportation efficiency.\n  The ability to include wireless technology into physical things or \nsupport communication among digital devices that may be nearby or at \ndistances will offer many benefits to consumers.\n  IoT products are already being deployed for personal, recreational, \ncity planning, public safety, energy consumption management, \nhealthcare, and many other applications.\n  Today, local governments are working to incorporate IoT services into \ntransportation; garbage pickup, as well as the provision of wireless \nconnectivity for their residents.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment will help ensure that we harness the \nbenefits of the ``Internet of Things'' for the travelling public and \nminimize the threats to privacy and cybersecurity presented by this new \nand exciting technology.\n  This is a good bill and I encourage my colleagues to support its \npassage.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer comment on the FAST \nAct.\n  I will support the bill. This is a strong, multi-year reauthorization \nwhich includes desperately needed funding for infrastructure repair and \ninvestment. I commend Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for \ntheir work in producing a bipartisan bill\n  I will also take this opportunity to remind my colleagues of a \npriority of mine to promote storm-resilient construction projects \nwithin the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).\n  The concrete products industries in my district in southern New \nJersey has much to offer in helping the country build its \ntransportation infrastructure. I know that many of my colleagues have \nsimilar constituent companies and workers, and I urge them to take note \nof my comments.\n  I was pleased to support language in MAP-21 that was designed to help \nincorporate permeable pavements into the FHWA mission. Many of us on \nthe eastern seaboard learned the utility of permeable pavements on \nSuperstorm Sandy, and what flooding can do to our districts without \nwarning if we are not prepared. I am happy to report that that language \nin MAP-21 dealing with permeable pavements is making good progress \ntoward technological innovation that will Improve storm water \nmitigation, water quality, and more while providing aesthetically \nappealing paving surfaces.\n  I will remind my constituents in New Jersey that, while the FAST Act \noverlooked an opportunity to take that technology further, I am still \nlooking for ways to move permeable pavement technologies into the \nmainstream where they can benefit our constituents and save taxpayer \nmoney as well.\n  In accordance with that goal, I submit the following material on \npassage of the FAST Act, and I hope that staff at FHWA and that the \nHouse and Senate will take note as well.\n  MAP-21 authorized the Secretary to conduct technology transfer and \nadoption of permeable infiltration paving materials, practices, and \nsystems that are designed to minimize environmental impacts, stormwater \nrunoff, and flooding. Prior to MAP-21 and since, extreme rain events \nlike Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and Superstorm Sandy, have \nunderscored the need for stormwater mitigation. We encourage the \nSecretary to accelerate work on permeable pavements in anticipation of \nfuture events like Katrina, Rita, and Sandy. The Secretary is \nencouraged to conduct research on full scale load testing in permeable \npavements for street, highway, and road shoulders to decrease \nenvironmental impacts and enhance sustainability. The Secretary is \nencouraged to conduct permeable pavement projects that demonstrate \nflood control and stormwater pollutant and volume reductions, including \nmitigation of impacts from superstorms and hurricanes, and life cycle \ncost analysis compared to conventional impervious pavements. Projects \nmay include re-use and integration of permeable pavements with other \ncost-effective water conservation practices designed to treat, reduce, \nor remove pollutants by allowing stormwater runoff to retain \ninfiltration capability similar to predevelopment hydrologic \nconditions, and for stormwater harvesting.\n  We hope that FHWA will act upon language in Sec. 1428 of the FAST Act \nand previously existing authority to improve infrastructure integrity \nby adding innovative segmental wall technology for soil bank \nstabilization and roadway sound attenuation, and articulated technology \nfor hydraulic sheer-resistant erosion control--areas in which emerging \ntechnologies could improve deliver marked benefits in surface \ntransportation. Examples of emerging technologies that could meet the \ngoals of this Act include cost effective segmental retaining walls that \ncan make use of native soils and reduce construction costs, durable \ngeosynthetic soil stabilization and anchoring, more durable articulated \nsegmental unit slope protection and erosion control that are more \nresistant to hydraulic sheer and overtopping than riprap, and segmental \nroadway sound attenuation barriers that can give planners more options \nand help reduce procurement costs. We hope the Secretary will place \nprimary emphasis on activities designed to assist state and local \ntransportation agencies in reducing initial cost of construction of \nretaining walls, slope protection and erosion control, and sound \nattenuation barriers using high-quality transportation-grade materials, \ndesigns and engineering techniques. Specific activities might include \nvalidation of technology materials, soils requirements, design \nmethodologies and engineering data; research to develop current, \naccurate scientific data on the performance of geosynthetic \nreinforcement for structural characteristics; a cost-sensitivity \nanalysis to assist state and local authorities in projecting initial \nconstruction cost savings to life cycle requirements while providing \ncompetitive reliability; calibrating design methodologies based on \ntests of instrumented, full-scale testing of walls and barriers, slope \nstability, and segmental sound attenuation assemblies.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nsupport of H.R. 22, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) \nAct. This long-term authorization of surface transportation programs \nwill provide the certainty that states and municipalities need to plan \nand build out critical transportation infrastructure projects.\n  This 5-year, $305 billion measure represents a bi-partisan compromise \nto help repair our crumbling infrastructure and secure our economic \nfuture while creating thousands of good paying jobs. As both a conferee \nto the transportation bill and the senior Texan on the House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee, I can say with strong \nconfidence that this legislation is a good-faith effort to make the \nimportant investments in our transportation infrastructure that our \nnation so desperately needs. While there are some shortcomings in the \nbill and some of us would like to have higher levels of investments be \nincluded, this bill will still help to further new and existing \nprojects for the long-term.\n  I am pleased to see that this bill supports research and development, \nincluding expanding university transportation center outreach to women \nand underrepresented populations. In going forward, I hope that we can \ndo more to elevate our nation as a leader in multimodal transportation \ninnovation.\n  Mr. Speaker, Americans demand more investment in infrastructure and \nit is the responsibility of this Congress to make that investment. I \napplaud Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio and other members \nfrom the various committees of jurisdiction for their hard work on this \nbill.

Mr. Speaker, on rollcall 672 on final passage of H.R. \n8, the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015, I \nwould have voted ``aye,'' which is consistent with my position on this \nlegislation.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, on December 3, 2015, \nI was unable to vote on the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 22, the \nSurface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2015 (rollcall \nNo. 673). Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes.''\n\n\n                          Personal Explanation\n\n  Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I was not able to vote today for \nmedical reasons.\n  Had I been present on rollcall vote 666, I would have voted ``no.''\n  Had I been present on rollcall vote 667, I would have voted ``yes.''\n   Had I been present on rollcall vote 668, I would have voted ``yes.''\n   Had I been present on rollcall vote 669, I would have voted ``no.''\n   Had I been present on rollcall vote 670, I would have voted ``yes.''\n   Had I been present on rollcall vote 671, I would have voted ``yes.''\n   Had I been present on rollcall vote 672, I would have voted ``no.''\n   Had I been present on rollcall vote 673, I would have voted ``yes.''\n\n\n                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, December 3rd, I am not \nrecorded on any votes because I was absent due to family reasons. If I \nhad been present, I would have voted: ``nay,'' on rollcall 666, on \nordering the Previous Question providing for further consideration of \nH.R. 22; ``yea,'' on rollcall 667, on H. Res. 546, providing for \nconsideration of the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 22; ``yea,'' \non rollcall 668, on the Cramer Amendment to H.R. 8; ``nay,'' on \nrollcall 669, on the Rouzer Amendment to H.R. 8; ``nay,'' on rollcall \n670, on the Pallone Amendment to H.R. 8; ``yea,'' on rollcall 671, on \nthe motion to recommit H.R. 8; ``yea,'' on rollcall 672, on passage of \nH.R. 8; ``yea,'' on rollcall 673, on passage of the Conference Report \nto Accompany H.R. 22.\n\n\n                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, December 3, I was absent from \nthe House due to illness. Due to my absence, I am not recorded on any \nlegislative measures for the day. I would like the record to reflect \nhow I would have voted had I been present for legislative business.\n  Had I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall 666, the \nprevious question providing for consideration of the Conference Report \nto Accompany H.R. 22.\n  I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall 667, the rule providing for \nconsideration of the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 22.\n  I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall 668, the Cramer Amendment to \nthe North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015.\n  I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall 669, the Rouzer Amendment to \nthe North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015.\n  I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall 670, the Pallone Amendment to \nthe North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015.\n  I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall 671, the Democratic Motion to \nRecommit H.R. 8.\n  I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall 672, final passage of the North \nAmerican Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015.\n  I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall 673, Agreeing to the \nConference Report to Accompany H.R. 22.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9000-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to correct the Record regarding my \nvote on H.R. 8, the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure \nAct.\n  On final passage, I voted ``yes'' and I actually intended to vote \n``no.''\n  H.R. 8 contains a number of provisions that would negatively impact \nthe environment and undermine our Nation's ability to move away from \nfossil fuel.\n  This legislation would undermine previously enacted initiatives to \nmodernize America's energy infrastructure and increase our energy \nefficiency and capacity and would provide unnecessary handouts to the \nfossil fuel industry at a time when we should be focusing on expanding \nour Nation's clean, renewable energy portfolio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9000-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9000-H9002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy) for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the \nschedule of the week to come.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour \nand\n\n[[Page H9001]]\n\n2 p.m. for legislative business. No votes are expected in the House in \norder to accommodate Members going to the White House event.\n  On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon \nfor legislative business. Members are advised that the first votes of \nthe week are expected mid-afternoon on Tuesday.\n  On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and \nnoon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 \na.m. for legislative business.\n  Last votes of the week are still to be determined, but Members are \nencouraged to keep their schedules flexible as we approach the end of \nthe year.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntomorrow. Included will be a bill to make urgent and necessary changes \nto the Visa Waiver Program.\n  H.R. 158, sponsored by Representative Candice Miller, will close \nloopholes in the visa waiver system to prevent terrorists from \nexploiting the system to come to America to wreak havoc.\n  The House has identified a host of recommendations to improve the \nvisa waiver system in a bipartisan way. I do want to thank the \ngentleman for his work and cooperation on this critical bill.\n  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 2130, the Red River Private \nProperty Protection Act, sponsored by Representative Mac Thornberry, \nwhich will provide legal certainty to property owners in Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House may also consider the conference report to \nH.R. 644, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, as \nwell as a bill to extend certain provisions of the Tax Code.\n  Additionally, it is possible that the House will consider an omnibus \nappropriations act.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House may also consider budget \nreconciliation, if the Senate acts on that measure.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that information.\n  I want to also thank him for the work that he has done on the Visa \nWaiver Program. His staff and my staff and the staff on Homeland \nSecurity on both sides of the aisle and the staff on the Judiciary \nCommittee on both sides of the aisle, including the leaders on both \nsides, have worked very hard.\n  I think we have come up with a bipartisan effort to keep America \nsafer while at the same time providing for access to people who do not \npose a threat to America or to Americans.\n  I thank him for his leadership on that. I am pleased to have had the \nopportunity to work with him, and I look forward to the bill's passing \nwith big majorities next week. So I thank him for that.\n  Mr. Leader, there is indication that the appropriation bills, or the \nomnibus, as we are now calling it, will come to the floor. Can the \nleader tell me whether or not we are making any progress on riders?\n  Obviously, as I understand it, essentially, we have agreement on the \nallocation of the dollars, which of course is the responsibility of the \nAppropriations Committee, and that is what they do.\n  Clearly, we seem to be having difficulty with the so-called riders--\nthat is, additions to the appropriations bill--which accomplish \nlegislative objectives either through a ``none of the funds'' provision \nor a legislative provision which would require a waiver.\n  Does the gentleman know whether or not we are making progress on \neliminating riders that are controversial so that we can move the bill \nin a bipartisan fashion next week?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As the gentleman knows, negotiations are ongoing. The appropriators \nare working hard in trying to wrap up the bill, and I will advise the \nMembers as soon as action is scheduled in the House.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that.\n  Can I ask the gentleman again in terms of the timing of the omnibus. \nThe existing CR, which is funding the government at the present time, \nexpires as of midnight on the 11th. Does the gentleman have any insight \nas to the scheduling of the omnibus?\n  Presumably, we will have to pass it and give enough time for the \nSenate to consider it and then for the President to sign it.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As the gentleman knows, wrapping up legislative business in December \nis always unpredictable. In knowing that the omni is a larger bill, we \nwant to allow plenty of time for Members to be able to see it and read \nit, but it is our intention to get it done by the deadline.\n  If we have to move it a few days later, we shall. We are scheduled to \nbe here until the 18th, but we will get our business done.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  I understand that we are here until the 18th. Does the gentleman \ncontemplate the possibility of a short-term CR from the 11th to the \n18th at any point in time?\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Only if necessary. I would rather get it done by the 11th.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman, and I certainly share his view on \nthat. It will be better for the country and better for the House if we \ndo that.\n  The gentleman also referenced tax extenders. Obviously, we have tax \nextenders that expired in December of 2014, which have not been \nextended. Does the gentleman have any knowledge as to whether or not we \nhave reached an agreement on a tax extender bill and, if so, the \nsubstance of that and when it might be scheduled?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As the gentleman knows, this side of the aisle did not want to wait \non tax extenders, and many times we have passed the bills here to make \nthem permanent.\n  There are ongoing negotiations. There is good movement, and I hope to \nsee that done very soon. When it is, I will advise the Members of the \naction to be taking place.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  Let me just observe to the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, that I have \ngreat reservations. I want to let the gentleman know that, on this side \nof the aisle, I think we have great reservations about doing in this \nshort time that we have left any kind of comprehensive tax extender \nbill, which will adversely impact the possibility of tax reform, which \nall of us have said we want.\n  But if we make a major effort on taxes now, particularly making many, \nmany items permanent, some of which I support making permanent, it will \nhave an adverse effect on the ability to do a big tax reform bill, \nbring corporate rates down, look at preference items, and try to make \nsure that we have a fiscally responsible piece of legislation.\n  So I would hope that there is an alternative, obviously, and that is \na short-term bill that the Senate has passed and that that would be \npart of the discussions as a fallback.\n  I don't know that I am for a larger bill that I have heard about, but \nI would hope, certainly, that the alternative that the Senate has \npassed would be an alternative if, in fact, we cannot get agreement on \na bigger package so that we will have, at least for last year and the \nyear to come, some certainty with respect to tax consequences of \ncertain actions that private businesses may be taking.\n  I yield to my friend if he has any comment.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman.\n  As the gentleman knows, at times, we have philosophical differences. \nI think the greater certainty we can give to the American public, the \nmore they can keep in their pockets and the stronger the economy is.

She knew Sam would come home.\n  Sam came home broken and battered. He worried, how would his family \nreact to the new Sam? As you can see, Sam had nothing to worry about. \nLed by Shirley, he was swarmed with love back home in Texas.\n  Shirley is now among the heavens, and those Texas skies tonight will \nbe as bright and big as ever.\n  God bless Shirley Johnson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9002-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NEW MEXICO'S EDUCATION SYSTEM\n\n  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given \npermission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise to draw \nattention to the concerns and frustrations among parents, educators, \nbusiness leaders, and so many others in my home State of New Mexico.\n  Today, I voted in favor of the Every Student Succeeds Act because I \nbelieve this legislation is better, quite frankly, than the status quo, \nand it will work to improve our education system.\n  However, we cannot forget that many of New Mexico's schools are in \ntrouble. These troubled schools stem from a lack of leadership at both \nthe Federal and State levels.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. Department of Education has not held New \nMexico's leadership accountable for this failure. In fact, the Federal \nGovernment has enabled our States, including New Mexico, to put special \ninterests ahead of student success.\n  That is why Education Week ranked New Mexico as 49th out of 51, with \na D-plus in preparing kids for college and a D-minus in K-12 \nachievement.\n  This lack of accountability at the State and Federal levels is \nharming a generation of New Mexico students. New Mexicans deserve far \nbetter. It is time we had leaders who take responsibility for improving \nour schools and that hold each other accountable when their actions are \nfailing students.\n  While the ESEA moves beyond the status quo, more needs to be done to \nhelp our students. I hope we will work together to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9002-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     JAMES ZADROGA 9/11 HEALTH AND COMPENSATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  (Mr. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the House to \nbring the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization \nAct to a vote before the end of the year.\n  On September 11, 2001, my wife and I were stationed at Fort Hood, \nTexas, celebrating the birth of our first son, Tommy. We watched in \nhorror the attacks on the World Trade Center and on the Pentagon. Like \nmany of you, we will never forget the brave efforts of the men and \nwomen who served as first responders on that tragic morning.\n  Today, Tommy is 14 years old, and my children have grown up in a \npost-9/11 America. They will never know what America was like before \nthose attacks, but they have been taught to look with pride at the \nheroes who risked their lives to help others.\n  With that same pride, I rise today to ask my colleagues to support a \nbill that protects the benefits of those first responders.\n  How often do we as politicians show up at 9/11 memorials to honor the \nfirst responders? How often do we talk about the heroes who rushed into \nthose falling buildings when everybody else was running out?\n  Now is our chance to do our part and give the men and women we call \nheroes the benefits they deserve. I encourage all of you to support the \nJames Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act and \nbring it to a vote before the end of the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9002-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  GUNS\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS.

Nothing.\n  Yesterday, there were deadly shootings in Houston, Savannah, and, in \nSan Bernardino, 14 people were killed at a social services center.\n  Today, here we stand in the only building in the Nation that could do \nsomething to curb this awful violence, and we cannot even get the \nSpeaker of this House to let Congress vote to let us act on one of the \nseveral proposed laws that many of my colleagues and I support.\n  Thoughts and prayers are not enough.

Mr. Speaker, the mass production of cheap, reliable \nenergy has powered the greatest expansion of wealth and opportunity in \nhuman history. It has resulted in higher living standards and improved \nhealth in the United States and around the globe.\n  Notwithstanding this too often ignored reality, the President wants \nto commit the United States to even more stringent, anti-energy \nregulations than those currently in place. The President's Clean Power \nPlan alone is expected to increase our energy prices by nearly $300 \nbillion over the next 15 years and reduce annual job creation by over \n200,000.\n  According to the EPA's only models, the impact of all of these rules \non global temperature increases will be near zero.\n  The United States cannot effect change alone. China, the world's \nlargest polluter, and other top emitters of global CO2 \nemissions need to come to the table too.\n  That is why, today, I introduced the Fighting Against Imbalanced \nRegulatory Burdens Act, or H.R. 4169. This bill will prevent the EPA \nfrom imposing any restrictions on CO2 emissions from power \nplants unless countries responsible for 80 percent of non-U.S. \nemissions have enacted similarly stringent policies.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support me in this effort.\n\n[[Page H9003]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9003-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1345\n                     REMEMBERING MRS.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of longtime \nTarrant County Democratic leader, Ms. Betty Fischer.\n  In 1950, Ms. Fischer and her husband moved to Arlington, Texas, with \ntheir three children. Eight years later, she completely dedicated \nherself to Tarrant County Democratic politics. She served as a party \nvolunteer. She was also the first woman chair of the party in 1982. She \nhelped get one of our former Congressmen, Martin Frost, elected to \noffice back during that time period. She was just a great person.\n  I can tell you that, in addition to her work for the Tarrant County \nDemocratic Party and all her Democratic efforts, that she and her \nhusband were also involved in the labor movement. She strongly believed \nthat every man and woman in Tarrant County deserved the right to be \nable to take care of their family and make a decent living for them.\n  In short, Ms. Betty Fischer did it all. There are very few left like \nher today. We were blessed to have her in Tarrant County. I am glad \nthat our time on this Earth overlapped with each other, and I just wish \nher family all the best during this time period as they cope with their \nrecent loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9003-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ACCESS TO GUNS\n\n  (Mr. RICE of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Darrell Allen of \nGarland, Texas, who passed away on November 10, 2015, as a result of \nwounds received while he was serving his community.\n  Darrell Allen was chief of police for the city of Marlin. He \nselflessly served his community, and he will be greatly missed.\n  Darrell was born January 17, 1972, in Galveston, Texas. He graduated \nfrom Texas City High School and went on to obtain an associate's degree \nin criminal justice from McLennan Community College in Waco, Texas. In \nhis pursuit to better serve his community, Darrell returned to school \nand received his bachelor in criminal justice in May of this year.\n  Since he was a child, Darrell dreamed of becoming a police officer. \nHe began his career in law enforcement in 1994 with the Galveston \nCounty Sheriff's Department. Darrell's distinguished career also \nincluded service with the Alvin Independent School District, the \nHitchcock Police Department, the Danbury Police Department, the Arcola \nPolice Department, the Harris County Precinct 6 Constable's Office, and \nchief of police at the Lott Police Department.\n  In 2005, Darrell joined the City of Marlin Police Department, where \nhe proceeded to climb through the department ranks. He was promoted to \nassistant chief of police in 2006 and elevated to chief of police in \n2009.\n  As Marlin's chief of police, Darrell focused his efforts on building \npolice community relations and increasing juvenile safety. He \nconsistently drove down the community's crime rate. Today Marlin is one \nof the safest communities in America. His efforts garnered recognition \nfor the Marlin Police Department from the Texas Police Chief \nAssociation's Foundation for Law Enforcement Agency Best Practices \nPrograms.\n  Darrell worked tirelessly to better our central Texas community. He \nloved his city, and he left an enduring impression on those he served. \nThis is evident from the scores of residents who gathered together \nrecently in memory of their fallen chief. He will forever be remembered \nfor his devotion to public service, as a father to his children, and as \na friend to countless Marlin citizens.\n  My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to \nthe Allen family.

Garland\n\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Diana R. Garland of \nWaco, Texas, who passed away on September 21, 2015.\n  Diana Garland was a teacher, dean, and a valued leader in the Baylor \nUniversity community. She led a full life and will be greatly missed in \nour community.\n  Diana was born on August 18, 1950, in Oklahoma City. She earned her \nundergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees from the University of \nLouisville. After completing her degree, she went on to serve as \nprofessor of Christian family ministry and social work at the Southern \nBaptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.\n  In 1997, Diana and her husband, David, moved to Waco and joined the \nfaculty at Baylor University. One year later, Diana was named the \ndirector of the university's Center and Community Ministries. Under her \nleadership, Baylor University expanded its social work program. Later \nwhen the university created the School of Social Work, she was \nappointed its founding dean.\n  During the following decade, Diana oversaw the school's rise to \nnational recognition. Under her guidance, the School of Social Work \ngrew to 20 full-time faculty members and 240 graduate and undergraduate \nstudents. During her tenure, she helped raise more than $7 million for \nresearch and established an endowment of $14.5 million.\n  In 2010, Diana administered the school's move to downtown Waco. This \nmove allowed the school to triple its teaching and lab space. To \ncommemorate her achievements as the school's dean, the Board of Regents \nrecently voted to name the university's School of Social Work in her \nhonor.\n  In addition to her teaching duties, Diana was the author, coauthor, \nand editor of 21 books and more than 100\n\n[[Page H9004]]\n\nacademic articles. Her literary works included: ``Flawed Families of \nthe Bible: How God's Grace Works Through Imperfect Relationships''; \n``Inside Out Families: Living the Faith Together''; and ``Why I Am a \nSocial Worker: 25 Christians Tell Their Life Stories.''\n  Diana was also the first lady of Baylor University while her husband, \nDavid Garland, served as the interim president from 2008 to 2010.\n  Diana stepped down as dean on June 1 of this year due to her battle \nwith cancer. She enjoyed the last few months of her life taking in \nGod's beauty in Colorado.\n  Mr. Speaker, Diana Garland left a strong legacy at Baylor University \nand touched the lives of many. She will be forever remembered as a \ncherished mentor, a loving wife, and a visionary servant leader.\n  My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to \nthe Garland family. We also lift up the family and friends of Diana \nGarland in our prayers.\n  As I close, I ask that all Americans continue to pray for our country \nduring these difficult times, for our military men and women who \nprotect us abroad, and for our first responders who protect us here at \nhome.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9004-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9004-H9005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE BY POLICE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address this esteemed House of \nRepresentatives on an issue that is facing the American people, an \nissue that is facing our great Nation from coast to coast. This is the \nissue of wanton, senseless murders of unarmed young Black men and women \nthroughout this Nation.\n  This past year, Mr. Speaker, we have all seen on the many news \nplatforms all across this Nation--the morning news, the noon news, the \nevening news--all have been punctuated with videotapes of unarmed Black \nmen mostly, Hispanic men, men and women, boys and girls, teenagers, \nbeing shot down in cold blood by just a few--I want to emphasize ``a \nfew''--rogue cops that hunt our Nation's cities, that hide behind a \nbadge and a gun. These rogue police officers operate not to serve and \nprotect, but to commit murder and mayhem and use their badge, their \nofficial status to get away with it.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  This popular television show, ``How to Get Away With Murder,'' could \nuse many departments all across this Nation as a formula, indeed as the \nplot of ``How to Get Away With Murder.''\n  I bear witness that this has been going on, these murders--wanton, \nsenseless, lawless murders--have been going on in this Nation for far \ntoo long.\n  Last year, Mr. Speaker, at this same time I stood before the Members \nof this body sharing with the Members of Congress the life and the \nmurder of my best friends in Chicago, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. They \nwere both members of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party.\n  They were young men full of leadership abilities, young men who were \ncommitted to serving their neighbor, young men who were committed to \ntry to uplift the African American community and similarly situated \ncommunities all across this Nation.\n  At this very time last year, I talked about December 4, 1969, the day \nthat Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were killed by the Chicago Police \nDepartment and the State's Attorney's police department in my city of \nChicago. They were shot.\n  Our pathologists indicated that, at the time that the police raided \ntheir apartment, Fred Hampton lay sleeping in his bed, that he had been \ndrugged with a drug called Seconal, and that Fred had in his body at \nthe time of his murder enough Seconal to immobilize an elephant. That \nis what the science and our pathologists indicated to us.\n  On December 4, 1969, at 4 o'clock in the morning, members of the \nChicago Police Department sneaked into the streets on the west side of \nthe city of Chicago in utility trucks, trucks that had been decorated \nwith the signage of the local gas company, and came in with murder in \ntheir hearts. They knocked on the door of the apartment.\n  Mark Clark answered: ``Who is it?''\n  The police at the front door said: ``Tommy.''\n  Mark said: ``Tommy who?''\n  The police at the front answered: ``Tommy Gun, Tommy Gun.''\n  At that time, after kicking the door down, they came in shooting with \na machine gun and other automatic weapons, aiming to kill everybody in \nthat apartment.\n  After the first shot was fired in the front door, then that was a \nsignal to those who were gathered in the rear, and they came bursting \nin, firing. Ninety-nine shots all total went into that apartment.\n  A Federal grand jury indicated after the investigations were \nconcluded that possibly only one shot exited that apartment. One shot \nfired out and 99 fired in. Cold-blooded murder 46 years ago.\n  Fast-forward to today. All across this Nation cops are killing \ncitizens, cold blooded, without any justification, and getting away \nwith it. It is not only in Chicago, but all across this Nation, all \nacross America.\n  Dontre Hamilton was a 31-year-old African American male killed by the \nMilwaukee Police Department in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on April 30, 2014, \njust a little over a year ago.\n  Eric Garner, an unarmed 43-year-old father, was killed by the New \nYork City Police Department on July 17, 2014, a little over a year ago.\n  On August 9, 2014, Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed teenager, \nwas killed by the Ferguson, Missouri, police department, a little over \na year ago.\n  A little over a year ago, Mr. Speaker, Ezell Ford, an unarmed 25-\nyear-old mentally ill man, was killed by the Los Angeles Police \nDepartment, Los Angeles, California, August 11, 2014, a little over a \nyear ago.\n  Mr. Speaker, Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old teenager, was killed by a \nmember of the Chicago Police Department on October 20, 2014, a little \nover a year ago.\n  A little over a year ago, Mr. Speaker, in Cleveland, Ohio, Tamir \nRice, a 12-year-old boy, was killed by the Cleveland Police Department \non November 22, 2014.\n  In the State of my birth, in DeKalb County, Georgia, Anthony Hill, a \n27-year-old unarmed Air Force veteran, was killed by the DeKalb County \nPolice Department on March 6, 2015, less than a year ago.\n  Less than a year ago, Nicholas Thomas, a 23-year-old unarmed Black \nman, again in my birth State of Georgia, in Smyrna, Georgia, was killed \nby the Smyrna Police Department on March 24, 2015, less than a year \nago.\n  Less than a year ago, Mr. Speaker, Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black \nman, while in custody of the Baltimore Police Department in Baltimore, \nMaryland, was killed on April 12, 2015, less than a year ago.\n  We all remember Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old woman who was found \nhanging in a jail cell in Waller County, Texas, on July 13, 2015, less \nthan a year ago.\n  The list goes on, Mr. Speaker.\n  November 16, 2015, Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old unarmed Black man, was \nkilled by a member of the Minneapolis Police Department, less than a \nmonth ago.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are many, many others. In my city, a few years \nback, about 3 years ago, Rekia Boyd was killed by a police officer who \nwas out of uniform, firing over his shoulder and striking Rekia Boyd in \nher head, killing her.\n  The now-terminated ex-police superintendent of the Chicago Police \nDepartment, Garry McCarthy, at the time of Rekia Boyd's murder had the \nunmitigated gall to stand before the citizens of Chicago and say that \nthis unarmed, young Black woman who was killed was the target, that the \npolice officer aimed at the person who he killed.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  This statement has been repudiated so many, many times. He fired over \nhis shoulder into a crowd of people.\n  There is a conspiracy in our police departments, a cancer in our \npolice departments, all across our very Nation. State by State, urban \narea by urban\n\n[[Page H9005]]\n\narea, large cities and small cities, young Black men and young Black \nwomen are targets, fair game, for some who are wearing a badge and a \ngun and hiding behind a uniform and a vow that they don't believe in \nand that doesn't govern their lives and their official and unofficial \nduty.\n  They don't believe in serving and protecting. They believe in: How \ncan we commit murder and get away with it? How can we murder those who \ndon't look like us, murder those who we stereotypically view as \ncriminals and thugs? We have a right because we wear a badge. We have a \ngun and we have a uniform to hide behind. We have an unmitigated right \nto shoot them down at will.\n  There are laws in this Nation that protect even wild animals from \nbeing killed.\n  In Chicago, Illinois, my city, there are only about 30 officers who \nhave in excess of 10 citizen complaints against them. This police \nofficer who was just indicted for the first time in the history of our \ncity--only one police officer indicted for the murder of an unarmed \nBlack man in Chicago--had 18 citizen complaints against him--18--mostly \nfor excessive use of force.\n  Why was he even on the street? Why was he wearing a uniform? Why were \nour tax dollars being used to pay for his livelihood when he had no \nappreciation for the lives and the rights of American citizens 18 \ntimes?\n  He shot Laquan McDonald while Laquan was walking away from him. That \nis what the video showed. Laquan McDonald wasn't even within 20 feet of \nthis police officer, now ex-police officer.\n  But he shot him 16 times, 15 times when Laquan McDonald was on the \nground. He couldn't have threatened him at all. He fired 16 rounds, 15 \nof them while Laquan McDonald was on the ground. He fired 16 rounds in \n15 seconds.\n  Forty-six years later we have these kinds of police atrocities \noccurring throughout the Nation. It is up to this body, Mr. Speaker, \nthis Congress, to finally stand up and protect all of the people of \nthis great Nation from these rogue cops who are roaming to and fro in \nour communities mercilessly, wantonly murdering our citizens, mostly \nBlack and Latino young men and young women.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will be introducing in a matter of days a resolution \nto establish a permanent select committee on the excessive use of force \nby America's police departments, a permanent and select committee on \nexcessive use of force by America's--yours and mine, the Members of \nthis body--police departments.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we can have a select committee on Planned Parenthood \nand women's health, we can have a select committee on excessive use of \nforce by America's police departments.\n  This select committee will be authorized and directed to conduct a \nfull and complete investigation and study and to issue a report and \nrecommendations of its findings to the House of Representatives \nregarding each of the following:\n  Number one, a uniform definition of excessive use of force;\n  Number two, create national guidelines on excessive use of force;\n  Number three, collect accurate and reliable data on police shootings \nand use of excessive force, both lethal and nonlethal;\n  Number four, implement and create a national database to make \navailable public data of citizen complaints filed against police \nofficers and departments;\n  Number five, include demographic data on police officers involved in \nshootings in the Uniform Crime Reporting Program;\n  Number six, require mandatory FBI reporting of police departments on \nthe number of justifiable homicides committed by those departments;\n  Number seven, create effective training methods and mental counseling \nof police officers to increase their understanding of the word \n``threat'' and weed out any indication of racial animus and hostility;\n  Number eight, create adequate training for police officers dealing \nwith mentally ill persons.\n  Yes, we have mentally ill patients and police do not know how to deal \nwith them. Under this resolution, this select committee will require \ntraining for our Nation's police to deal with mentally ill patients.\n  Number nine, require transparency of internal police discipline and \npolice accountability;\n  Number ten, report to this Congress on the rising cost of lawsuits \nand settlements that are indicative of problematic policing and civil \nrights violations and civil rights abuses.\n  This is the resolution that I will be introducing over the next few \ndays, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to conclude by repeating something that I \nsaid last year, and I intend to repeat this throughout the remaining \ndays of my life.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  The murders, the political assassinations, the cold-blooded murders \nof Fred Hampton and Mark Clark on December 4, 1969, will not be in \nvain.\n  The murders of American citizens, particularly young, unarmed African \nAmerican boys and girls, Hispanic American boys and girls, other \nminorities, unarmed mentally ill Americans, unarmed White Americans, \nthese murders by America's police agencies must come to a screeching \nhalt. Justice demands it. This Congress ought to promote it.\n  This Congress, this esteemed body, ought to protect all of our \ncitizens. We have to show and demonstrate, beyond a shadow of a doubt, \nthat just because you have a badge, you wear a badge, just because you \nare dressed in a uniform, just because you have a gun, with a license \nto arrest and detain, just because you have those assets, those powers, \nyou do not have a right, the authority, the power to commit cold-\nblooded murder. And don't believe, not for 1 millisecond, that you will \ncontinue to get away with it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9005-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9005-H9006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUST ANOTHER DAY IN AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) is \nrecognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the \nminority leader.\n  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I \nhave.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 25 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, today, like so many \nAmericans, we are in utter disbelief that our country is once again \nleft reeling after yet another horrific massacre of innocent Americans. \nThere is grave concern that this has become the norm.\n  In fact, this is how the BBC characterized the shootings in \nCalifornia yesterday:\n\n       Just another day in the United States of America--another \n     day of gunfire, panic, and fear. This time in California.\n\n  But it could have been, as it was last week, in Colorado, or in \nArizona, or Oregon, or South Carolina, or Nevada, or Wisconsin, or \nD.C., or in Georgia, where it also transpired.\n  In the capital city of Connecticut, in Hartford alone, there have \nbeen 28 deaths this year as a result of gun violence.\n  In 11 days, we will be passing and observing the third anniversary of \nthe mass murder of schoolchildren and their teachers at Sandy Hook \nElementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\n  In the 3 years since that tragic day in 2012, when many thought, \n``Well now, finally now, this innocence, this slaughter of innocent \nchildren, surely there will be change. Surely the United States \nCongress will take a vote. Surely Congress will respond. They will take \na vote. They will take action,'' but as we did then, we will do next \nweek. We will stand in silence, a respectful and heartfelt silence, for \nvictims of what happened in California and Georgia just yesterday. It \nis something this Congress repeats in such a way that the BBC \ncharacterizes it as just another day in America.\n  In the 3 years since that tragic day in December, in fact, there have \nbeen an additional--additional--1,000 mass shootings in the United \nStates of America. One thousand mass shootings in the United States of \nAmerica--that averages almost a mass shooting per day--and yet not a \nsingle vote, not a vote. Irrespective of where you stand on the issue, \nin the great Chamber\n\n[[Page H9006]]\n\nwhere the country looks to for leadership, not a single vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to put up this chart that I think graphically \ndisplays what has been going on in this country to illustrate a point--\na sad point, no matter how you view this chart.\n  Between 2001 and 2013, guns killed more people in the United States \nof America than AIDS, illegal drug overdoses, wars, and terrorism \ncombined. Gun violence has taken more individuals than all these other \ntragedies and calamities combined.\n  Far more Americans have faced and, as the families of victims, they \nhear the remorse, they hear the platitudes, they observe the moments of \nsilence and the laying of wreaths, but there is no action that comes \nfrom the United States Congress. These statistics should stagger anyone \nwho reads them and compel Congress to take action, any action, to \naddress this epidemic of gun violence.\n  Now, I say ``any action.'' Whether you believe, as I do, that we \nshould have commonsense, universal background checks so that we keep \nguns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and terrorists on \na watch list, this is common sense. This is what I believe the Nation \nshould be doing, and I believe, frankly, so do a majority of people in \nthis Chamber and throughout this country, but we have yet to take a \nvote. We have yet, though there are bills on the floor, though they are \nbipartisan. At least the Senate, in a bill sponsored by Senator Joe \nManchin, Senator Pat Toomey, put forward a reasonable proposition.\n  Whether you believe that it is a panacea or not or that it will \nsomehow help, or maybe not, aren't the citizens of this country, aren't \nthe families of the victims entitled to a vote? What do we owe our \nconstituents if not a vote?\n  If the United States Congress continues to remain silent, as it has, \nI submit, we are complicit in these deaths every time we remain silent \nand every time we take no action.\n  It doesn't take a lot of courage, frankly, to vote. We are protected \nin this building by police. We are surrounded by armed guards. There is \nnothing that threatens any Member of Congress from doing his \nconstitutional responsibility to vote.\n  What takes courage is what Officer Garrett Swasey did just last week, \ngiving his life in the line of duty, defending and protecting people \nunder siege.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. Speaker, do you want to talk about terrorist threats? There is \nreal terrorism happening in America every day: more than 1,000 mass \nshootings since Sandy Hook, deaths on our streets due to gun violence.\n  We could rush in a matter of days to this floor when an outrage \noccurred in Paris, rush to this floor in days with legislation to deal \nwith refugees, and yet, in our own country, in our own cities across \nthis Nation and throughout our States, can we not have a vote in \nCongress?\n  I recognize and respect the fact that people will disagree and \nperhaps think that background checks are not necessary or won't solve \nthe problem. Maybe that is true. I don't believe so. But aren't we \nentitled to a vote? Aren't those victims of those families entitled to \na vote? Do their voices mean anything?\n  If the vote fails, the body will have spoken, and if the vote \nsucceeds, this body will have spoken also and will have an opportunity \nto see its results and observe it.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is how this great body works. To be denied the \nopportunity to vote only, in my mind, makes us further complicit to the \ntragedies that are happening all across this country.\n  Another day in America, another day of gunfire, panic, and fear. How \nabout a day where Congress actually votes, where Members actually stand \nup and are accountable for what they say they believe in so no matter \nhow you feel on this issue--and I truly respect people who disagree \nwith me.\n  But I would like to have the opportunity to vote the conscience of my \nconstituency and the beliefs that I deeply hold. It would seem to me \nthat, in this day and age, in this body, we ought to be able to do \nthat.\n  I recognize that there are probably not many people listening to my \nremarks right now, and I realize that Americans are incredibly \nfrustrated with the United States Congress in general because of its \ninaction on so many levels.\n  But I urge anyone who is listening across America, whether you are \nopposed to universal background checks or you are in favor of them, to \ncall their Representatives and demand of them before they go home to \nenjoy the Christmas holidays, before we adjourn, that we take a vote on \nthis issue. Demand that we show you where we stand on commonsense \nbackground checks.\n  If you really believe in your position, what is there to hide from? \nWe need to take a vote. Americans need to know where we stand. This \nisn't a profile in courage; this is our responsibility.\n  This issue has been looked at, it has been studied, and it has \nsupporters on both sides. There is a discharge petition on the floor, \nbut, frankly, this bill ought to be brought to the floor and voted on.\n  It should be voted on in the Senate Chamber. It is my understanding \nthat Harry Reid will include it as an amendment. The Senate then will \nhave voted twice, and the House remains silent. We need to vote.\n  In this body, in this great Chamber, I would much rather be known by \nthe votes I have taken than the speeches I have made, the press \nreleases that have gone out, and the 30-second sound bites that will \nfollow. I would like to be known, as I believe all Members of this body \nwould, for the votes I have taken standing up on behalf of my \nconstituents.\n  Above the podium of the Speaker, there is a famous quote from Daniel \nWebster, and I paraphrase that quote. Webster asked aloud of all \nMembers of this body whether, in our day and generation, we will \nperform something for which we will be remembered. I ask this body for \na vote for which we will be remembered.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their \nremarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9006-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9006-H9009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SELF-DEFENSE ISSUES OF THE DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it was 2 years ago this week that a \nprecious life was cut short tragically. Kari Renee Hunt, a resident of \nMarshall, Texas, was murdered by her estranged husband in a hotel.\n  They were in the hotel room. While the estranged husband was \nassaulting Kari, her 9-year-old daughter, while witnessing the murder, \ndid what most parents teach their kids to do in an emergency. She \ndialed 911--and got nothing.\n  Because what this precious 9-year-old--and the family hasn't used her \nname publicly, so I will not either--what the precious girl didn't know \nis what a lot of folks dialing 911 in that situation wouldn't know, \nthat you have to dial 9 before you can dial 911. In order to dial the \n911, you need to dial the 9 prefix in order to get an outside line.\n  Mr. Speaker, she didn't know that. She was desperately trying to get \nhelp to save her mother before the assault turned into murder. She \nnever got help, not in time.\n  Kari's father, Hank Hunt, has worked tirelessly to try to get \nsomething done. The State legislature in Texas has enacted a law, but \nfrom the Federal Government end, we can make it universal across the \ncountry.\n  I do thank my friend Kevin Eltife for his work in the State \nlegislature.\n  Mr. Speaker, our bill is a little different. I was surprised to find \nout that, actually, most of the time, there is no cost whatsoever to \nrequiring that a phone be furnished to a business or a home or anywhere \nwhere there might be a need to punch 9 to get an outside line--there is \nno cost to having a default that you can dial 911 without the prefix, \nand it will go straight to the emergency help.\n  Once I learned that, it became clear there was no reason not to have \na law that just tells providers, provide the phone so that the default \nwhen you dial 911 is to get emergency help, that\n\n[[Page H9007]]\n\nyou don't need a prefix to get an outside line.\n  So, today, after a lot of help--again, I am thankful to Hank Hunt for \nhis tireless work--a number of groups have made this easier to come \ntogether on language that was acceptable to most. There were a couple \nof objections, but this is the final language.\n  So I want to thank Mark Fletcher with AH, the American Hotel & \nLodging Association; FCC Commissioner Pai; and the 911 Association.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill we filed today is H.R. 4167, and, as it says in \nthe bill, the purpose is to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to \nrequire multiline telephone systems to have a default configuration \nthat permits users to directly initiate a call to 911 without dialing \nan additional digit, code, prefix, or postfix. That is the purpose.\n  It is a short bill of three pages. If it had been the law 2 years \nago, help would likely have gotten there before Kari's murder was \nfinal. So, while this legislation will not reverse the heartbreaking \nloss of Kari, Kari's law should prevent it from happening again. And \nwhen it doesn't cost anything, why not?\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank all of those who have helped, and, actually, I \nwant to thank the news media in east Texas for being so helpful in \nbringing attention to this issue and helping us get to the point where \nwe are.\n  Now we have to get through committee and get it to the floor. We have \nSenators, one in particular, looking at it to bring to the Senate floor \nso we can get this done and make it law.\n  There has been no veto threat on this bill, so I would doubt the \nPresident would refuse to sign it if we would just pass it.\n  Since the shootings in San Bernardino, I guess it shouldn't have been \nsurprising that so many people would immediately call out for gun \ncontrol even before they knew how Farouk--the defendants, the shooters, \nthe evil shooters, acquired their guns.\n  It is interesting that I believe there were 13 bombs already made, a \nnumber of bombs already made. So if guns were completely outlawed in \nthe United States, it wouldn't change the evil in the hearts of radical \nIslamists who are bent on terrorizing and killing people.\n  Mr. Speaker, it gets tiresome hearing people feel like they always \nhave to say, ``All Muslims we know don't feel this way,'' yet they have \nno conviction and no compulsion, when they condemn Christians as being \nguilty of crusades, of saying, ``But we know all Christians don't feel \nthis way.''\n  I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that the fact is I don't know whether \nthat shooter in Colorado Springs was self-described as a Christian or \nnot. He obviously was confused about his gender.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Maybe the next thing we will hear is that--since he apparently \nchecked off--or it is reported that he had filed a registration where \nhe indicated he was an unaffiliated female, perhaps the next we will be \ntold is that maybe, if he had been allowed to go into the little girl's \nrestroom in elementary school, he wouldn't have later snapped and did \nthose merciless killings.\n  It has also been interesting--and, as a former prosecutor, a judge, \nalso--I don't know if there is anybody else in this body of 435 \nrepresentatives or anybody in the Senate--I don't know--who has ever \nbeen court-appointed to appeal a death penalty conviction as I was.\n  Even though I begged the judge not to appoint me, he did. And I do \nbelieve in our adversarial system to the point like John Adams said \nafter the Boston Massacre, for our system to work, it requires \nadversaries on both sides doing the best they can legally and \nethically.\n  When I got into it, it appeared clear he had not gotten a fair trial. \nI later convinced the highest court in Texas to reverse his capital \nmurder conviction, which it did. I don't know how many others in this \nbody or the Senate have appealed and reversed a capital murder \nconviction. People always think I am such a heartless guy, but I do \nbelieve in the rule of law and I do believe it should be followed.\n  I don't believe it helps the lawlessness that is breaking out across \nour land to have an administration that picks and chooses the laws that \nit likes to enforce and have an IRS that abuses their positions in the \nlaw, that has Homeland Security that deletes thousands of documents \nthat would help us identify terrorists and then go after the guy that \npreserved them on his own classified IronKey.\n  He is a real hero, but he has now been forced out of Homeland \nSecurity. He resigned. But after they empanelled a grand jury to \ninvestigate him, became terrorists in the way that the government \ntreated them, not with guns, but with the power of this administration.\n  I mean, with somebody as law-abiding as some of our whistleblowers \nhave been only to find that this administration will come after you if \nyou try to stand up for truth and integrity, can we not expect \nlawlessness to break out? John Adams wrote: This government was \nintended for the governing of a moral and religious people. It is not \nfit to govern any others.\n  I know the President and others keep saying there is nowhere in the \nworld that has the frequency of shootings like this or mass murders \nlike we do in the United States. But, as I have mentioned before, there \nwas an article by Kyle Becker 4 months ago. He has a chart and says, if \nyou don't compare apples and oranges, if you actually compare the \nnumber of rampage shooting fatalities to the number of people in the \ncountry, then Norway is first, 15.3 per million; 1.85 per million in \nFinland; 1.47 per million in Slovakia; 1.38 in Israel; .75 in \nSwitzerland; and .72 per million in the United States.\n  The trouble is the loss of even one life is unnecessary, and \nappropriate steps should be taken to prevent them.\n  My friend John Lott has an article out today in National Review. He \nsays--this is John Lott:\n  ``On Sunday, Hillary Clinton slammed Republicans for not being \nserious about protecting Americans from terrorism. `How many more \nAmericans need to die before we take action?' Clinton asked in response \nto Friday's shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado \nSprings. She believes that stopping such attacks involves `common-sense \nsteps like comprehensive background checks, closing the loopholes that \nlet guns fall into the wrong hands.' Within minutes of the attack in \nSan Bernardino, California, yesterday, Clinton pushed again for more \nregulations.\n  ``Clinton also wants to crack down on terrorism by prohibiting people \non the no-fly list from buying guns. `If you are too dangerous to fly \nin America, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.' ''\n  And I will insert parenthetically that I have got one of the most \npatriotic friends I know who is a highly decorated general in the \nUnited States Army who lived just outside Marshall, Texas.\n  We have had a number of times tried to help the general, this \npatriotic freedom-loving American, who has put his life on the line \nrepeatedly. We have had to repeatedly work to get his name off the no-\nfly list because, apparently, there is someone with a similar name. And \nwhoever that person is, this patriot's name is on the list.\n  Well, John Lott goes on:\n  ``Are Republicans really putting Americans in danger by opposing new \ngun-control laws?\n  ``After every mass shooting, Clinton and President Obama have called \nfor `comprehensive' or `universal' background checks, which would apply \nnot only to the purchase of guns from a dealer, but also to private \ntransfers of guns. However, it wouldn't have stopped any of the mass \nshootings during Obama's tenure. Last weekend, Clinton, Obama, and \nother Democrats issued their calls for new legislation before anyone \neven knew how the Colorado shooter had obtained his rifle.\n  ``Colorado already had expanded background checks two years ago. So \nhad Oregon before the Umpqua Community College shooting in October. \nFrance also has a background-check system. So too does California, \nwhich experienced yesterday's attack. Yet, while the existing laws \ndidn't stop shootings of the very kind Clinton claims that they will \nstop, she uses these failures to justify imposing similar laws on the \nrest of the country.\n  ``The American background-check system is supposed to prevent the \npurchase of a gun by anyone who has been convicted of a felony or \ncertain misdemeanors. The Feinstein amendment would also ban the sale \nof guns to anyone who is on the terrorist watch list.\n\n[[Page H9008]]\n\nNow, being on the watch list sure sounds bad, but it doesn't mean that \na person has been convicted of anything. In fact, it is pretty easy to \nget on the watch list; you can be on it simply because the FBI wants to \ninterview you about someone you might know. According to the \nTechDirt website, about 40 percent of the people on the watch list are \nconsidered to be under `reasonable suspicion' even though they have \nabsolutely `no affiliation with known terrorist groups.'\n\n  ``The number of people on the list has grown dramatically during the \nObama administration; by 2013, there were about 700,000 people on the \nlist. As of 2014, about 50,000 people were on the no-fly list. This is \na ten-fold increase since Obama became president.\n  ``Between February 2004 and December 2014, over 2,000 people on the \nwatch list bought one or more guns. The government has not identified a \nsingle one of these people as using a gun in a crime.\n  ``Should the government be able to deny you the right to protect \nyourself simply because it wants to ask you about someone you might \nknow? And that isn't the only problem posed by the proposed expanded \nbackground checks. In New York, today's background checks add about $80 \nto the cost of transferring a gun. In Washington State, they add about \n$60. In Washington, D.C., they add $200. In effect, these laws put a \ntax on guns and can prevent less affluent Americans from purchasing \nthem. This disproportionately affects poor minorities who live in high-\ncrime urban areas.\n  ``While some people on `no-fly' lists are there because they are \nsuspected of terrorist activity, you can also get added because you are \na suspect in a criminal case, made controversial statements or tweets \nunrelated to terrorism, are the victim of a clerical error, or refused \nto become a government informant.''\n  And I might add, last November, as I was leaving London, I had a \nsecurity person tell me they realized I was a U.S. Congressman and, \n``We are very sorry,'' but that our Homeland Security Department here \nin the United States said I was to be thoroughly personally searched \nalong with my bags.\n  I don't know. Maybe they didn't like my questioning of the Secretary \nof Homeland Security and were threatened by my questions trying to get \ntruth out of them.\n  ``Between February 2004 and December 2014, over 2,000 people on the \nwatch list bought one or more guns.'' It is pretty amazing there. But \nnot one of them--not a single one of those people have been accused of \nusing a gun in a crime.\n  So even if these people wanted this law to be changed, it would not \nhave changed the outcome in Oregon, Colorado, or California. It seems \nas if my well-meaning friends proposing tougher and tougher laws to \ntake away our Second Amendment rights mean well, but they are proposing \nthings without even knowing whether they would save a single life. \nCertainly they will take away rights of law-abiding Americans, but they \ncertainly would not have changed the outcome in Colorado or California.\n  ``The error rate for identifying potential terror threats is probably \nsimilar to the error rate for background checks on gun purchases. Over \n94 percent of `initial denials' for gun purchases are dropped after \njust a preliminary review. These cases were dropped either because the \nwrong person had been stopped or because the covered offenses were \ndecades old and the government decided not to prosecute. The total \nerror rate comes to about 99 percent.\n  ``Putting people on a list and prohibiting them from legally \npurchasing guns doesn't really stop them from getting weapons. The fact \nthat people are prohibited from buying certain drugs doesn't mean \npeople can't get them. It's the same with guns. And, incidentally, drug \ngangs supply both illegal drugs and illegal guns.\n  ``Indeed, since Clinton wants to make a comparison to last week's \nParis attacks, we should point out that France's strict weapon bans \ndidn't stop the terrorists from getting the AK-47s and explosive belts \nthey used in the attacks.\n  Strangely, the Oregon, Colorado, California, and Paris shootings are \nbeing used to push for additional gun-control laws of the sort that \nfailed to prevent those attacks.''\n  That is John R. Lott, Jr., today writing.\n  When I proposed and filed Kari's Law today, I had to be sure that it \nwould make a difference and that the added burden would not cause any \nextra effort, cost money, hardly ever, just something that needed to be \ndone.\n  Kari's Law would be a great law for our country, whereas, the laws \nbeing hailed as something we must pass wouldn't have saved a single one \nof the lives that we will pause in silence and for whom most of us will \npray.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I know that Christians are being reviled. Certainly, in \nthe Middle East, they are being beheaded. Here, in the United States, \nafter leaders talked about praying for the victims' families, there \nhave been belittling comments made.\n  But I look at the quote that Thomas Jefferson provided. It is \ninscribed in his memorial:\n  ``God who gave us life gave us liberty. And can the liberties of a \nnation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a \nconviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the \ngift of God? that they are not to be violated but with His wrath? \nIndeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that \nHis justice cannot sleep forever.''\n  Jefferson, on March 4, 1805, in his second inaugural, said:\n  ``. . . I shall, need to the favor of that Being in whose hands we \nare, who led our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their native land \nand planted them in a country flowing with all the necessities and \ncomforts of life.''\n  James Madison made many declarations and statements.\n  On July 23, 1813, in the National Day of Public Humiliation and \nPrayer Proclamation, James Madison, who is given credit for being the \nmost prolific author in the Constitution, said:\n  ``If the public homage of a people can ever be worthy of the \nfavorable regard of the Holy and Omniscient Being to whom it is \naddressed, it must be that in which those who join in it are guided \nonly by their free choice, by the impulse of their hearts, and the \ndictates of their consciences; and such a spectacle must be interesting \nto all Christian nations as proving that religion, that gift of Heaven \nfor the good of man, freed from all coercive edicts, from that \nunhallowed connection with the powers of this world which corrupts \nreligion . . . and making no appeal but to reason, to the heart, and to \nthe conscience, can spread its benign influence everywhere and can \nattract to the divine altar those freewill offerings of humble \nsupplication, thanksgiving, and praise, which alone can be acceptable \nto Him . . . ''\n  We have observed a time now in our country's history where we have \ngone from, not nine Supreme Court Justices--most of the time, it is \njust five--who have said, even though the Founders have been requiring \nevery day to start with prayer since the beginning of the new \nConstitution, we don't think you should have prayer in public places.\n  That was a shocker. It would have been a shocker to the Founders \nsince they started with prayer in the very beginning and have continued \nthrough to this day.\n  The Supreme Court goes on to say that they don't think you should \ntalk about Jesus. You can talk about Mohammed, and you can talk all \nabout Islam, but you can't talk about Jesus Christ. We have even had \nFederal judges say you can't mention the name ``God'' in your \ngraduation ceremony. Our judicial system has a small group of judges \nwho has run amuck, who has lost its way, and it has taken the country \nwith them.\n  Abraham Lincoln said:\n  ``It is the duty of nations as well as of men, to own their \ndependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess their sins and \ntransgressions, in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine \nrepentance will lead to mercy and pardon; and to recognize the sublime \ntruth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that \nthose nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord.''\n  It is remarkable that this is 2 years and 40-something days before \nhis assassination.\n  Abraham Lincoln, with people dying all over the country, put this in \nprint\n\n[[Page H9009]]\n\nin his National Day of Humiliation, Fasting and Prayer Proclamation.\n  Abraham Lincoln said:\n  ``We have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which \npreserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; \nand we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that \nall these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of \nour own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-\nsufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too \nproud to pray to the God that made us.\n  ``It behooves us then to humble ourselves before the offended Power, \nto confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and \nforgiveness.''\n  I will just share one more, Mr. Speaker.\n  William Howard Taft is the only man in U.S. history to have been \nPresident and Chief Justice--or any Justice--on the Supreme Court.\n  In 1908, William Howard Taft said:\n  ``No man can study the movement of modern civilization from an \nimpartial standpoint and not realize that Christianity and the spread \nof Christianity are the only basis for the hope of modern civilization \nand the growth of popular self-government. The spirit of Christianity \nis pure democracy. It is the equality of man before God, the equality \nof man before the law, which is, as I understand it, the most godlike \nmanifestation that man has been able to make.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9009-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of a \nmedical appointment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/03/house-section/article/H9009-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.
