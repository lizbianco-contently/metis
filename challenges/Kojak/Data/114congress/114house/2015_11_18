The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend \nof mine and an outstanding Member of this House who passed away on \nNovember 3.\n  Howard Coble served this House with honor, always concerned first and \nforemost with how the policies it enacted would affect those he served \nin North Carolina's Sixth Congressional District.\n  Howard Coble was a son of Greensboro, a Coast Guard veteran of the \nKorean war, a prosecutor, and a dedicated public servant. Howard \nbelieved strongly in this House and its role in our democracy.\n  In the 30 years we served together, we stood on opposite sides of \ndebate far more than we were on the same side, but we had a close \nfriendship that transcended politics or policy. Howard Coble was one of \nthe kindest and most warm-hearted individuals I have encountered in my \nyears of service in this Capitol.\n  Howard was incredibly proud of his North Carolina roots. He tried his \nbest to make it to every parade and event in his district that he \ncould. He was a champion of our Nation's first responders.\n  We served together in the Congressional Fire Services Caucus. Howard \nwas steadfast in advocating for firefighter safety and for our Nation \nto meet its responsibility to those who fell in service to their \ncommunities.\n  On many occasions we participated together in ceremonies to honor the \nfamilies of the fallen, and we met with those families as well. \nHoward's compassion and his devotion to these families were \nunparalleled.\n  He was also chair of the Congressional Trademark Caucus. We worked \ntogether on intellectual property issues over the years, an area \ncritical to our economic competitiveness.\n  Mr. Speaker, like so many of our colleagues, I will miss Howard Coble \nvery much.\n  There was a great incident that happened here on the floor of this \nHouse. In 1994 or 1993, Howard Coble came over to me. His chief of \nstaff was a University of Maryland graduate. Howard Coble came over to \nme. Howard Coble was sort of a curmudgeon soul with a wonderful \ngravelly voice. He came over to me and said: Steny, you need to hire \nDebbie Yow at the University of Maryland as your athletic director.\n  Mr. Speaker, frankly, I didn't know what to think of this gravelly \nvoiced, hard-nosed North Carolinian because he was not necessarily a \nMaryland fan himself, of course, there being four extraordinary teams \nin North Carolina.\n  I looked at Howard Coble. I didn't know Debbie Yow, but she was from \nNorth Carolina. As a matter of fact, her sister was the great coach at \nNorth Carolina State of the women's basketball team.\n  When I got back to my office, I called up Brit Kirwan, Mr. Speaker, \nwho was the president of the University of Maryland at College Park at \nthat point in time. I said: Brit, I don't know Debbie Yow, but Howard \nCoble believes she would be a good athletic director. If she can \nconvince Howard Coble that one of the few women to head up an NCAA \nDivision I athletic program would be a good athletic director, she must \nbe really something.\n  We hired her just a few weeks later, and Howard Coble was right. She \nwas extraordinary. She is now back in North Carolina.\n  But it was that kind of relationship I had with Howard Coble, as did \nso many Members on this floor. He loved the House and served it with \ndistinction and humor. He believed that working together across party \nlines was in the best interest of America.\n  Those of us who were privileged to serve with Howard will always \nremember his geniality, his intellect, his abiding love of country, \nand, of course, his State of North Carolina. He left a lasting imprint \non his community, his State, his country, and this House.\n  Mr. Speaker, we thank him for his lifetime of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8283-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8283-H8284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   JONNY WADE'S FIGHT AGAINST CANCER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H8284]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nmy friend, Jonny Wade, an 8-year-old from Jerseyville, Illinois, who is \nbattling a rare form of brain and spinal cancer.\n  After being diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Day of 2014, Jonny has \nundergone several surgeries as well as multiple rounds of radiation and \nchemotherapy. Despite the diagnosis, Jonny continues to think of \nothers, and his rallying cry remains, ``I don't want any other kid to \nhave cancer.''\n  While he was unable to travel to Washington, as I invited him to do \njust a few short months ago, to come here to advocate for cancer \nresearch, I want to take this time, Mr. Speaker, to speak out on his \nbehalf.\n  Cancer is the second leading cause of death for children, yet only 4 \npercent of cancer research funds go to children. Jonny and his twin \nbrother Jacky have a special place in my heart because I am the parent \nof twin boys, too. While Jonny and Jacky may not be here with me today, \nthey brought their cause to the Capitol.\n  Pediatric cancer is a relentless disease, and we cannot waver in our \nefforts to eradicate it. For Jonny and the thousands of children who \nare diagnosed with cancer each year, we must all work together to fully \nfund pediatric cancer research.\n  The favorite sport of Jonny and Jacky is baseball. These two guys \nright here like to go to baseball games and football games. \nUnfortunately for both of them, they are St. Louis Cardinals fans. \nBeing an Atlanta Braves fan, I like to joke with them about their \nchoice in teams.\n  But I have got a baseball right here, Mr. Speaker, and I want to \nthank all the colleagues who signed this baseball for me. I wanted \neverybody to sign, but as you can see, there is no room left.\n  This baseball is for you, Jonny. I want to thank you for being the \nfighter that you are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8284-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE CULTURE OF OPPOSITION NEEDS TO CHANGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, Chuck Rosenberg, the acting \nadministrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, recently called \nthe notion of smoking medical marijuana a joke.\n  What is a joke is the job Rosenberg is doing as acting DEA \nadministrator. He is an example of an inept, misinformed zealot who has \nmismanaged America's failed policy of marijuana prohibition.\n  Americans recognize it is time for a change in direction to legalize, \nregulate, and tax marijuana. Fifty-eight percent now support \nlegalization, continuing an upward trend in public opinion polls and at \nthe ballot box.\n  Over 75 percent of the American public supports medical marijuana, as \ndo a majority of American physicians. Rosenberg claims medical \nmarijuana is a joke, but the proven therapeutic value of cannabis has \nprompted 23 States, Guam, and the District of Columbia to approve its \nmedical application and an additional 17 States have authorized its \nmore limited use.\n  Rosenberg's claim that more research is necessary is true, but it \nreeks of hypocrisy because the DEA, under his leadership, has made \nbadly needed cannabis research difficult, and often impossible. If \nRosenberg was doing his job, he would have visited with some of the \nhundreds of thousands who have found medical marijuana has had a \nprofound effect on their lives and that of their families.\n  President Obama is the first sitting President to tell the truth \nabout cannabis. His administration has not acted to shut down the adult \nor medical marijuana reforms sweeping the country. Sadly, it isn't just \nhis DEA administrator who is undercutting his policy.\n  Earlier this year the Department of Justice took an outrageously \nflawed position on the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment that passed with \nstrong bipartisan support, which clearly specified that the Federal \nGovernment should not interfere with State legal medical marijuana \noperations.\n  The Department of Justice and the DEA contend that it only prevents \naction against States, not individuals. This is a ridiculous \ninterpretation of the law and caused a Federal court in California to \nrule this interpretation ``defies language and logic'' in deciding \nagainst them.\n  More recently, the Senate passed the MILCON-VA appropriations bill, \nwhich included an amendment offered by my colleague in Oregon, Senator \nMerkley, mirroring my legislation to allow VA doctors to recommend \nmedical marijuana to their patients in accordance with State law.\n  Yet, on November 13, the Department of Veterans Affairs indicated \nthey won't allow doctors and patients to participate in State legal \nmarijuana laws, even if this bill becomes law.\n  Sadly, these actions by administration officials are indicative of a \nthrowback ideology rooted in the failed war on drugs, which needs to \nstop.\n  They do not reflect the overwhelming body of evidence about the \neffects of medical marijuana, the reforms happening at the State level \nand in Congress, or the opinion of the American people.\n  They don't reflect the statements by the President himself and the \nofficial policy promulgated by former Deputy Attorney General Cole \noutlining the administration's commitment to stay out of the way of \nState marijuana laws.\n  There is overwhelming evidence that marijuana offers relief when \nnothing else has helped, including as a more effective pain management \ntool than highly addictive narcotics. Opioid overdoses are \nskyrocketing, and we have an epidemic of heroin abuse and overdose.\n  Sadly, the culture of opposition in the Federal Government continues. \nOn one level, we have this amazing progress at the State and local \nlevel. We have made significant progress here in Congress with the \nintroduction of over 20 bills in both Chambers dealing with the Federal \ntreatment of cannabis and hemp, and the successful votes on three \namendments in the House and three in Senate committees in this \nCongress.\n  This culture needs to change. Leadership needs to change. Rosenberg \nis clearly not the right fit for the DEA in this administration.\n  I would hope that the President directs the heads of all relevant \nagencies to adjust their policies, clarify regulations that deal with \nmarijuana laws, establish policies that reflect changing State laws, \nand, most importantly, reflect the President's own position.\n  He has said that he has bigger fish to fry than interfere with State \nlegalization efforts. It is time that the rest of his administration \ngets on board, and it should start with a new head of the Drug \nEnforcement Administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8284-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8284-H8285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, last week's gruesome terrorist \nattacks in Paris were a disturbing reminder that the war on terror is \nongoing and that radical Islamic extremism represents a clear and \npresent danger to all freedom-loving civilized people.\n  The time from September 11, 2001, up until today has been difficult \nfor our Nation. We have seen our young men and women engaged in endless \nwars. We have lost thousands of American lives and spent a significant \nportion of our national treasure fighting in the Middle East. Costly \nmistakes were made in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. We are \nunderstandably a war-weary people.\n  However, last Friday we were reminded that the consequences of \ninaction or of weak actions are far greater than any risks associated \nwith making a serious and unwavering commitment to confronting and \ndefeating radical terrorists.\n  ISIS is not a problem to be managed or contained. This ambitious \nterrorist organization is a dangerous enemy of the United States and \nour allies that must be eradicated. If we refuse to fight ISIS on their \nhome turf, we will have to fight them in the streets of Paris and maybe \nin our own communities.\n  Just as the previous administration recognized that its Iraq strategy \nwas failing and needed a jolt, it is now time for President Obama and \nhis national security team to show that they are serious about \ndestroying this dangerous threat to the stability of the world and to \nour own very lives.\n\n[[Page H8285]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I have cosponsored a resolution authorizing the use of \nmilitary force introduced by the gentleman from Illinois, my friend \nAdam Kinzinger. It would guarantee the President and our military every \ntool necessary to defeat ISIS. This resolution deserves a vote so that \nwe can fight to win a war that we cannot afford to lose.\n\n\n                              Cuban Crisis\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, since the announcement of the \nPresident's engagement policy with the Cuban dictatorship in December \nof last year, we have witnessed a 78 percent spike in the number of \nCubans arriving into our country. An untold number have been lost to \nthe sea.\n  But they aren't only coming by sea. Thousands of Cubans are illegally \nentering Central American nations, making the long trek north through \nMexico and entering via our southern border. Too many are at the mercy \nof reprehensible human trafficking rings.\n  Costa Rican authorities report that the number of Cubans entering \ntheir country illegally has grown from 5,400 last year to 12,166 so far \nthis year. This problem has become so severe that the Costa Rican \nGovernment had to temporarily close its borders this past weekend.\n  These trends show no signs of letting up, and I am concerned about \nanother migrant crisis overwhelming our Nation, particularly south \nFlorida. This is a matter of our national security and requires the \nPresident's immediate attention.\n  Cubans on the island seem to be reacting to the administration's new \npolicy with desperation and fear, risking their lives and their safety \nto escape the prison that is Castro's Cuba.\n\n\n                 White House Accreditation Alternative\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the \nadministration's proposal to provide an alternative to accreditation \nfor providers who develop partnerships with accredited institutions. \nThe introduction of a regulator to judge programs like computer coding \nboot camps can help challenge traditional accreditors to put more focus \non the success of students after graduation.\n  This could be the groundwork for a true alternative to accreditation \nthat would not replace the traditional system. Rather, it would enhance \nand allow other successful models to access funding resources to \nreplicate and extend their reach.\n  Accreditors maintain an important role within higher education; \nhowever, alternative models can help deal with segments that \ntraditional accreditors may not be able to address effectively. As a \nlarge number of students enroll in noninstitutional programs, we should \nencourage the growth of successful models that are providing students \nwith a path to successful and rewarding careers.\n  Emphasizing outputs is an important step forward in helping the \nsystem of higher education in the United States evolve. As we continue \nour work toward reauthorizing the Higher Education Act here in the \nHouse, I look forward to collaborating with my colleagues to ensure \nthat we are helping prepare students for success.\n  In education, one size does not fit all. This step by the \nadministration is one in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8285-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO A FRIEND, REGINALD ``HATS'' ADAMS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to \nMr. Reginald ``Hats'' Adams, a dear friend whom I have known and worked \nwith since the late 1960s.\n  In 1986, Hats was hired as the chief youth worker at the Mile Square \nHealth Center. He had previously worked with the Boys and Girls Clubs \nof Chicago. After having the titles of community liaison and employee \nrelations coordinator, he was named director of community affairs at \nRush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in 1974 and held that \nposition which he defined and redefined several times to coincide with \nwhat he was doing.\n  Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center is a large, complex, and \ndiverse corporate entity which trains thousands of doctors, nurses, and \nother medical personnel and has an excellent record of patient care.\n  Much of Mr. Adams' work involved outreach to the broad community on \nthe medical center's behalf. Over the years, he has worked with \nmunicipal, county, and State entities, while at the same time \ndeveloping and maintaining close ties to grassroots organizations, \nsocial service agencies, and faith institutions.\n  Mr. Adams has always been seriously interested in and involved with \nyoung people. His youth development work is legendary. He has paid \nspecial attention to the educational concerns of minority students. As \na result, Rush sponsors summer work study programs for minority college \nstudents, summer internships for high school students, and math and \nscience enrichment programs for students at more than 60 elementary and \nhigh schools.\n  Through Mr. Adams' efforts, the Science and Math Excellence Network \nwas launched in 1991. The network is a coalition of public and private \norganizations working directly with the local schools to improve \nscience and math education for elementary students.\n  Rush and its corporate partners sponsor after-school science clubs, \nprovide judging at local science fairs, offer summer training programs \nfor teachers, and sponsor a mobile science lab that visits schools \nwithout laboratory facilities.\n  Each year, the network hosts an awards dinner to recognize the top \nscience and math students at participating schools. Since 1991, the \nnetwork also has coordinated the construction of 10 science \nlaboratories in local schools, including several specially designed \nfacilities for preschool-age children. Mr. Adams served as president of \nthe network.\n  Notwithstanding his outstanding professional work and civic \ninvolvement, Mr. Adams has always been endeared to his personal family, \nchurch, and friends. He was passionate about his family, and at times \nwas known to have his own seat staked out at church.\n  Mr. Adams was also actively involved in the affirmative action \nactivities of the medical center and helped assure that minority \nvendors, contractors, and business interests had access to business \nopportunities at the medical center.\n  Hats was a man of great wisdom, courage, and determination, always \nprotecting the interests of the medical center but never forgetting the \ncommunity from which he came and was a part of.\n  The poet Kipling may have had Hats in mind when he wrote:\n\n       If you can walk with Kings and Queens and not lose the \n     common touch; if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt \n     you; if all men matter with you, but none too much; and \n     finally, if you can give the unforgiven moment with 60 \n     seconds' worth of distance run; yours will be the Earth and \n     all that is in it; and what is more, you will be a man, my \n     son.\n\n  Reginald ``Hats'' Adams, what a man. His life is gone, but his legacy \nlives on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8285-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8285-H8286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SYRIAN REFUGEES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the issue of the \nSyrian refugees and the Islamic State terrorists who are coming across \nour southern border and, in relation to this, the Office of Refugee \nResettlement loophole that exists there.\n  Also, Mr. Speaker, as I begin my remarks, I commend the House and our \nSpeaker for speaking out and taking an action to condemn the Paris \nattacks.\n  This administration has announced its intention to resettle 10,000 \nSyrian refugees within the United States in fiscal year 2016. Now, I \nwant you to think about that number, 10,000 in the year 2016. They will \ngo to resettlement communities all across the country, if the \nadministration has its way.\n  It is important to note that the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or \nthe ORR as it is called, does not simply resettle refugees from \noverseas. In fact, the ORR has been resettling thousands of illegal \naliens that are coming across our southern border.\n  I want to read to you from their 2013 report to Congress:\n  ``Other Categories Eligible for Assistance and Services.\n\n[[Page H8286]]\n\n  ``Certain other persons admitted to the U.S. or granted status under \nother immigration categories also are eligible for refugee benefits.''\n  In addition, certain persons deemed to be victims of a severe form of \ntrafficking, though not legally admitted as refugees, are eligible for \nORR benefits to the same extent as refugees.\n  That is correct; the ORR resettles illegal aliens not classified as \nrefugees, providing another potential gateway for the Islamic State \nterrorists.\n  Frankly, we would know more about the ORR activities if they filed \ntheir annual reports, as required in section 413(a) of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, and did it in a timely fashion. The last report we \nhave from them is 2013. It is not transparent, it is not accountable, \nand it cannot be trusted.\n  I know this firsthand, Mr. Speaker. I wrote Secretary Burwell twice \nlast year about resettlement activities at the ORR and have been \ninvestigating them since July 2014, when Congressman Bridenstine and I \ntraveled to a UAC facility at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record those letters to Secretary \nBurwell.\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 21, 2014.\n     Hon. Sylvia M. Burwell,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Burwell: It has come to my attention that \n     you have failed to submit an annual report to Congress \n     regarding the activities of the Office of Refugee \n     Resettlement (ORR) since Fiscal Year 2012. The Secretary is \n     required by law to submit an annual report pursuant to \n     Section 413(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ``no \n     later than the January 31 following the end of each fiscal \n     year, . . .'' Reports had been filed annually since 1980 \n     before abruptly stopping after the FY2012 submission.\n       It is important that ORR operate transparently given its \n     role in re-settling thousands of illegal aliens who crossed \n     our Southern border last summer. ORR has released more than \n     45,000 Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) into our country to \n     adult sponsors through September 30th of this year. My home \n     state of Tennessee has had over 1,000 UACs released within \n     its borders alone. I expect a thorough update on these \n     activities.\n       I would also note that ORR's budget appears to have grown \n     exponentially. ORR received over $750,000,000 million in \n     funding in FY2012. However, HHS requested almost $1.5 billion \n     for ORR in its FY2015 ``Justification of Estimates for \n     Appropriations Committees''. Without annual reports being \n     provided to Congress as part of the oversight process, it \n     becomes increasingly difficult to approve requested funding.\n       I look forward to your immediate submission of ORR's FY2013 \n     report to Congress. Also, I expect ORR's FY2014 report no \n     later than January 31, 2015, as required by law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Marsha Blackburn,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 17, 2014.\n     Hon. Sylvia M. Burwell,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Burwell: An article titled ``Crossing alone: \n     Children fleeing to U.S. land in shadowy system'' was \n     published in the Houston Chronicle on May 24th, 2014. The \n     Chronicle's investigation revealed that over one-hundred \n     ``significant incident reports'' were obtained from the \n     Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through a \n     Freedom of Information Act Request (FOIA) and detailed \n     instances where children were abused by Office of Refugee \n     Resettlement (ORR) staff members between March 2011 and March \n     2013. The article contains several troubling statements:\n       1) ``No shelter worker has been prosecuted under a 2008 \n     federal provision that makes sexual contact with a detainee \n     in ORR's care a felony.''\n       2) ``Youths in ORR custody in Texas were molested as they \n     slept, sexually harassed and seduced by staff members during \n     the past decade, records from state childcare licensing \n     investigators and law enforcement show. They were shoved, \n     kicked, punched and threatened with deportation if they \n     reported abuses, investigators found.''\n       3) ``The Office of Refugee Resettlement relies on state \n     childcare licensing and local police to investigate abuses of \n     the children in its care, instead of notifying the FBI of \n     serious allegations. In the hands of local police and \n     prosecutors, criminal cases have crumbled because of sloppy \n     detective work, communication gaps with officials and \n     jurisdiction confusion.''\n       On May 17, 2012 the President issued a memorandum regarding \n     implementation of the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 \n     (PREA). The memo stated that ``Each agency is responsible \n     for, and must be accountable for, the operations of its own \n     confinement facilities, and each agency has extensive \n     expertise regarding its own facilities, particularly those \n     housing unique populations.''\n       On March 7, 2013 the President signed the Violence Against \n     Women Act (VAWA) into law. Section 1101 of VAWA amended PREA \n     as follows: ``Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act \n     of 2013, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     publish a final rule adopting national standards for the \n     detection, prevention, reduction and punishment of rape and \n     sexual assault in facilities that maintain custody of \n     unaccompanied alien children.''\n       According to the Chronicle's investigation and a letter you \n     received from fifty-nine House Democrats this week, your \n     department has still not published a final rule. This delay \n     directly violates Section 1101 of VAWA. Your failure to act \n     timely is unacceptable given the seriousness of these issues. \n     As a result, please provide responses and document \n     production, as requested, relating to the following \n     inquiries:\n       1) Has HHS published a final rule adopting final standards \n     for the detection, prevention, reduction and punishment of \n     rape and sexual assault in facilities that maintain custody \n     of unaccompanied children? If so, when did this occur?\n       2) Please explain why HHS delayed, or continues to delay, \n     publishing a final rule, as required by law.\n       3) In FY2014, ORR released 53,518 unaccompanied alien \n     children to sponsors within the United States. Please produce \n     any significant incident reports filed by, or on behalf of, \n     unaccompanied alien children against ORR employees in FY2014, \n     regardless of the format in which they are stored. If you \n     redact information, or are unable to produce said reports, \n     outline any legal privileges or exemptions the department is \n     relying upon.\n       4) Please disclose the number of ORR employees currently \n     being investigated by law enforcement for sexual misconduct \n     or abuse involving unaccompanied alien children.\n       5) Please disclose the number of ORR employees disciplined \n     or investigated by HHS for sexual misconduct or abuse of \n     unaccompanied alien children in FY2014.\n       6) What efforts has ORR undertaken to work with federal law \n     enforcement to prosecute employees accused of child abuse \n     within its facilities since 2011?\n       7) What initiatives has ORR undertaken on its own to \n     protect children from abuse within its facilities since 2011? \n     Please include any internal rules or memorandums that were \n     drafted to address this issue.\n       ORR's failure to timely comply with the law is unacceptable \n     and not in keeping with the Administration's pledges of \n     transparency. Please provide responses to the above \n     inquiries, along with requested documentation, within fifteen \n     days of receipt of this correspondence.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Marsha Blackburn,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. We know that there are more than Mexicans and Central \nAmericans coming across that southern border, and we know that once \nthey are here, the ORR has no way of tracking them and keeping up with \nthem.\n  In April, a Judicial Watch report cited a Mexican army officer and \npolice inspector who advised that ISIS was operating training bases in \nclose proximity to the U.S. southern border. Another report from August \n2014 advised that social media traffic indicated ISIS was planning to \ninfiltrate the southern border in order to carry out a terrorist \nattack.\n  Due to these findings, all of our resettlement services must be \ntemporarily suspended. I am currently working on a solution with \nseveral of my colleagues to address the loophole that allows \nnonrefugees to be resettled.\n  In the past 3 weeks, Islamic State terrorists have bombed a Russian \njetliner, committed suicide bombings in Beirut, and massacred French \ncitizens in Paris. They are now exporting their terror. There is simply \nno method that will allow us to determine with 100 percent accuracy \nwhether Syrians or illegal aliens that we resettle into the U.S. are \nreally ISIS jihadists.\n  Mr. Speaker, is the ISIS threat contained? No.\n  Can we guarantee that Syrian refugees who are resettled into the U.S. \nwill not commit acts of terror against Americans? No.\n  Do we know who these people are? No.\n  Are they properly vetted? No.\n  Would it be responsible to bring Syrian refugees into this country \nafter the attacks in Paris? No.\n  Do Americans across this country want the administration to resettle \nSyrian refugees into the U.S.? No.\n  Is the administration dangerously naive on this policy? Absolutely.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look closely at the issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8286-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8286-H8287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SYRIAN REFUGEES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Rangel) for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H8287]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to join with the millions of \nAmericans that feel heart-based sympathy for the loss of our friends in \nEurope and France, particularly Paris, and, of course, to give sympathy \nto those people that are absolutely hysterical on this issue as relates \nto refugees, even though there is no evidence at all that it was \nrefugees that were responsible for the attacks.\n  These types of unprovoked attacks do cause fear and, many times, \nirresponsible behavior on behalf of people, as they attempt to instill \nfear in all people to such an extent that it shatters the principles \nwhich this country was built on.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Nevertheless, there is enough for us to be concerned about. There is \nenough for us to be fearful about, and there has to be concern as to \nwhat are we going to do about it.\n  Those that read in the media and listen to it--and even Members of \nCongress--will find that we have people that are now saying that we \ncan't win this war against ISIS unless we have more of our military on \nthe ground fighting against the Assad government.\n  We talk about sending troops overseas to put their lives in harm's \nway as though it is just another foreign policy decision that Members \nof Congress can make without any regard at all to the constitutional \nresponsibility we have to ourselves and to be an example for the world.\n  Whenever this great Nation is threatened, whenever our national \nsecurity is threatened, the President should be coming to this House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate and sharing with us what are the threats \nto our national security. And when it becomes abundantly clear that we \nhave to call upon our military in any way, we should have a declaration \nof war for the reasons that the President has given to us.\n  Our responsibility to our constituents is to share as much \ninformation as we can to tell them that war means sacrifice, loss of \nlife.\n  Yet, today, we haven't had a declaration of war since Franklin \nRoosevelt. Tens of thousands of Americans have died.\n  In this recent crisis, less than 1 percent of eligible Americans have \nactually put themselves in harm's way because of executive mandate and \nthe allowance of the Congress to allow this to happen. And we have \nlost, just in Afghanistan and Iraq, 7,000 American lives that some of \nus have to go to the funerals and explain the best that we can that, \neven though we are not at war, there would be American lives lost in \nforeign countries.\n  I submit to you that if we believe that our national security is \nthreatened, we should have a declaration of war, we should have a \ndraft, and we should have a way to pay for these wars, so that we would \nknow that it is not easy sending your loved ones abroad and not even \nknow the reasons that they are there.\n  It would seem to me that, as everyone heard, the President of France \nsays they are at war against ISIS, that if we are at war against ISIS, \nwhatever country they are representing, it should be brought to the \nAmerican people. It should be brought to the Congress, and the \nPresident should ask us to declare war.\n  But it is just totally not fair for people in the House of \nRepresentatives to come here and to say that Americans should be sent \noverseas to fight an unknown enemy, to put their lives in jeopardy and, \nperhaps, their families in jeopardy, without being able to say that \nthey are fighting a war to preserve democracy in this country.\n  It just seems to me that whether you call them no feet on the ground, \nbut boots on the ground, that if someone's coming back here with a \nflag-draped coffin, that we should be able to say they fought for \nAmerica, they died for America, and that we are fighting for peace and \nto end a war that has yet to be declared.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8287-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8287-H8288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SHOWING OUR SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Barr) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of our allies, \nthe people of France, and in strong condemnation of the terrorist \nattacks in Paris, France, carried out by the Islamic State this past \nFriday.\n  The people of France have been our allies since the American \nRevolution, and having traveled to Normandy and seeing the American \nflag over Omaha Beach, it underscores the important alliance that we \nhave had with the people of France throughout our history.\n  Ever since the founding of our country, we have been united with the \npeople of France by our shared values of freedom and civil society and \ndemocracy. The attack on Friday was an attack on these values by \nbarbaric terrorists who want to impose their brutal and twisted version \nof Islam and authoritarian rule across the world.\n  We grieve for the massive loss of life, not just for the French \npeople, but also for the victims and their families around the globe, \nincluding Nohemi Gonzalez, an American student from El Monte, \nCalifornia.\n  We join the voices from around the world to condemn these attacks, \nbut condemnation is not enough.\n  As I saw firsthand while visiting Iraq and Afghanistan last month, \nthe President's strategy of withdrawal and containment is clearly not \nworking.\n  By underestimating the threat, referring to ISIL as the JV team, \ndeclaring that ISIL has been contained just hours before the brutal \nattacks in Paris, President Obama has allowed this radical Islamic \ncancer on humanity to fester and grow.\n  Indeed, the key lesson of my trip to the Middle East is that American \nretreat has made the world a much less stable and a much more dangerous \nplace. The weakness of the President's foreign policy and U.S. \nwithdrawal from the Middle East has allowed our adversaries, ISIL, \nRussia, Iran, the Taliban, al Qaeda, Jabhat Al-Nusra, to fill the \nvacuum, to grow stronger and become a much greater threat to our \nhomeland and our interests.\n  In contrast, our allies, Israel, the Jordanians, the government of \nIraq, the Kurdish regional government, the unity government in \nAfghanistan, they have all become more threatened and more vulnerable.\n  There is not a single place in the world which is safer or more \nstable today or where our adversaries are weaker or where our allies \nare stronger than on the day President Obama took office.\n  The President has, in recent days, lectured his critics to come up \nwith their own plan and regurgitated his tired old attacks on his \npredecessor's successful national security policy.\n  But if there is any lesson to be learned from the Obama policy in \nIraq, as contrasted with U.S. policy after World War II in Japan and \nGermany, it is that once you win a war, do not leave. A residual \nsecurity force and continued diplomatic engagement to prevent sectarian \ndivisions would have reassured moderate Sunnis and prevented the rise \nof ISIL.\n  The President implies that his critics would lead us into another \nunpopular ground war in the Middle East, but we do not need to fight \nthe Iraq war again. We have already won that war.\n  But we do need to do more to combat ISIL. What about authorizing use \nof military force that doesn't constrain the Commander in Chief, which \nis what the President sent us?\n  Why don't we do what our ally, Prime Minister al-Abadi, in Baghdad, \nwants and has asked us for, which is more U.S. air power, more U.S. \nspecial operators on the ground for better coordination of the air \ncampaign, more funding for the Iraqi train and equip fund?\n  We must do more to help the moderate forces, the indigenous forces on \nthe ground, such as the Kurdish Peshmerga, to take back territory \ncontrolled by ISIL.\n  We must address the surge of refugees pouring out of Syria and other \nwar-torn countries across the Middle East. These people are in \ndesperate need of help, but the answer is not to resettle them halfway \naround the world here in the United States.\n  An open-ended resettlement program is, in fact, an admission of \ndefeat, that their homes will never be safe for them to return to, so \nwe had better assimilate them to new lands with new languages and new \ncultures.\n  That is not the best solution for these refugees. And because we know \nthat at least one of these terrorists involved in the Paris attacks \nentered Europe by blending in with those trying\n\n[[Page H8288]]\n\nto flee ISIL, it could pose a national security risk to the United \nStates.\n  We shouldn't take the indigenous fighters away from the anti-ISIL \ncampaign through an open-ended refugee program. Instead, let's actively \nprotect them in their home country by helping them defeat ISIL and win \nthe war.\n  The best thing we can do for these people is to defeat the enemy and \nto end their reign of terror, rape and oppression. We need a new \nstrategy, not to contain ISIL, but to eliminate them.\n  The refugee issue is a simple matter of common sense, but the problem \nis larger than the refugees. As we were reminded so tragically on \nFriday in Paris, failure to confront terrorists and radical ideologies \nabroad gives them an opportunity to grow and spread and attack us here \nat home.\n  So let's grieve and pray for the people of France, but let's do more. \nLet's rise up with them, with new resolve, to defend our shared \ncommitment to liberty, security, and freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8288-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PIONEERING SPIRIT OF 3M\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the 3M \nCompany, a great Minnesota business, for recently being named one of \nthe top 100 innovative organizations for the fifth consecutive year by \nThomson Reuters in their fifth annual list of Top 100 Global \nInnovators.\n  Originally known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, 3M \nstarted out as a small-scale mining company in northern Minnesota. \nHowever, mining turned out to be an unsuccessful venture, causing the \ncompany to suffer. Instead of accepting defeat, the company embraced a \npioneering spirit and began to invent and produce other products.\n  More than a century later, 3M has evolved into a multinational \ncompany that produces more than 65,000 products which are used all over \nthe world. Among the many products created, the Post-it Note and Scotch \nTape remain among the most well-known.\n  As of today, one-third of 3M's sales come from products that were \ninvented within the past 5 years, making it clear that this company \ndefines American creativity and innovation.\n  Congratulations, 3M, and here is to another century of \naccomplishment.\n\n\n               Dr. Bittman--Improving Future Generations\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of \nMinnesota's finest educators, Dr. Daniel Bittman. Dr. Bittman has been \nthe superintendent of Sauk Rapids-Rice Public Schools since 2010 and \nthis year has been named Superintendent of the Year by the Minnesota \nAssociation of School Administrators.\n  Dr. Bittman earned both a master's and doctorate of education from \nthe University of Nevada, and has been working in education in \nMinnesota for more than 20 years.\n  As a result of his continued efforts and leadership, the students of \nSauk Rapids-Rice schools are now performing at a higher level than ever \nbefore and thriving within a more engaged and supportive community.\n  Our children are the future of this country, and Dr. Bittman's \ndedication to his students shows that our future is bright.\n  Dr. Bittman, thank you for all you have done for our children and our \ncommunities and for all you will do in the future. Congratulations on \nbeing named Superintendent of the Year. You deserve it.\n\n\n                        National Diabetes Month\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, in honor of National Diabetes \nMonth, I rise today to voice my concern for this disease that is \nplaguing our Nation.\n  Statistics show that nearly 30 million children and adults in the \nUnited States are currently living with diabetes. In my home State of \nMinnesota, more than 8 percent of adults have been diagnosed with this \ndifficult and dangerous disease.\n  As if these harrowing statistics are not concerning enough, studies \nshow that type 2 diabetes will continue to grow at widespread rates and \nthat the future cost of diabetes will increase. In other words, our \ndiabetes problem and the associated costs are going to get worse.\n  This disease can often be prevented. While genetics play a role in \ndeveloping diabetes, diet and exercise play a role in the development \nas well. If we eat better and exercise--in short, if we live healthy \nlifestyles--many of us can prevent the onset of diabetes.\n  So I urge my colleagues here in Congress to join me in raising \nawareness for diabetes. If we all put in the effort, I believe that our \ncountry can overcome this epidemic.\n\n\n                      Alzheimer's Awareness Month\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Alzheimer's \nAwareness Month, I would like to bring attention to a disease that is \nall too prevalent in our country.\n  Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, and today, \napproximately 5.3 million Americans are living with this disease. To \nput it in perspective, that is the same as the population of the State \nof Minnesota.\n  Alzheimer's is a cruel disease that knows no limits. From the 30-\nyear-old mother of three young ones who is suffering from early onset \nAlzheimer's to the elderly grandfather who fails to recognize his loved \nones, this is a disease that is devastating families across our \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, statistics show that Alzheimer's rates are rapidly \nincreasing. In fact, by 2050, the number of people age 65 years or \nolder with Alzheimer's is estimated to triple.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Mr. Speaker, at this point in time, Alzheimer's cannot be prevented \nor cured, which is why we must work harder to ensure that one day life \nwithout the risk of Alzheimer's can become a reality.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize November as \nAlzheimer's Disease Awareness Month.\n  Mr. Speaker, approximately 5.3 million Americans are currently \nsuffering from Alzheimer's. This disease is the sixth leading killer in \nthe United States, yet there is currently no treatment or cure for this \nhorrible disease.\n  This devastating disease will cost Medicare and Medicaid \napproximately $150 billion in 2015 alone. It also places an incredible \nburden on caregivers. Oftentimes these caregivers are family members \nwho sacrifice their own well-being to care for their loved ones.\n  We must work toward a cure, Mr. Speaker. This is one of the reasons \nwhy I was proud to be a cosponsor of the 21st Century Cures Act earlier \nthis summer. The bill would provide an additional $8.75 billion in \nadditional funding for the National Institutes of Health. Think about \nthat for a second, Mr. Speaker. An opportunity for us to be able to \ninvest in research so that we can actually have a breakthrough in some \nof the diseases that are the biggest drivers of our healthcare costs. \nFor instance, we spend $330 billion each and every year treating \ndiabetes; Alzheimer's and Parkinson's again will significantly eclipse \nthat as we go forward.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I believe that the best way to honor those who are \nimpacted by Alzheimer's disease is by dedicating time and resources to \nfinding that very cure. I will continue to do just that, and I urge my \ncolleagues here in the Chamber, across the aisle, and over in the \nSenate to be able to join me so that we can, once and for all, find a \ncure for this horrible disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8288-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8288-H8289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SYRIAN REFUGEES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, America has a long tradition of opening \nits arms to oppressed people from around the globe. While the human \nrights of those fleeing terror and destruction must be respected, it is \nvital that we work to ensure that our Nation's safety is in place in \nthis time of turmoil and unrest.\n  The United States cannot indefinitely close itself to the stark \nrealities of the world, nor should we hastily accept tens of thousands \nof people without proper screening. That is why I\n\n[[Page H8289]]\n\nhave called on Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf to suspend efforts to \nbring Syrian refugees to Pennsylvania until there are verifiable and \nrobust mechanisms in place to properly screen all participants for \npotential security risks.\n  To facilitate the thorough screening needed, I am supporting \nlegislation prompting the Department of Homeland Security, in \ncoordination with the Director of National Intelligence and the FBI, to \nprovide new security assurances before admitting refugees into the \ncountry and for the Government Accountability Office to conduct a \nsweeping review of security gaps in the current refugee review process. \nThis measure addresses both shortcomings in our existing programs and \nensures a role for congressional oversight.\n  Mr. Speaker, the refugee crisis the world faces is a symptom of a \nlarger problem: militant Islam and the efforts of groups like ISIS to \ndestabilize and destroy others. We need a long-term solution to this \nproblem, and that includes defeating ISIS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8289-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, the world stands with the people \nof France this week.\n  The events in Paris were horrifying. All of us were shaken by them. \nYet we know that whenever terror like this strikes, the world community \nwill rally together. Terror will not prevail. But these events should \nserve as a reminder: there is still evil out there. We cannot ignore \nit. We cannot contain it. We must defeat it. And we must protect our \npeople.\n  The country is uneasy and unsettled, and they have every right to \nbe--not because of what they are hearing from politicians, but what \nthey have seen with their own eyes. All of us here, Republicans and \nDemocrats, are hearing these concerns in our offices.\n  People understand the plight of those fleeing the Middle East, but \nthey also want basic assurances for the safety of this country.\n  We are a compassionate nation. We always have been, and we always \nwill be. But we also must remember that our first priority is to \nprotect the American people. We can be compassionate, and we can also \nbe safe.\n  That is what the bill that we are bringing up tomorrow is all about. \nIt calls for a new standard of verification for refugees from Syria and \nIraq. It would mean a pause in the program until we can be certain \nbeyond any doubt that those coming here are not a threat. It is that \nsimple. I don't think it is too much to ask.\n  I also want to point out that we will not have a religious test, only \na security one. If the intelligence and law enforcement community \ncannot certify a person presents no threat, then they should not be \nallowed in. This is common sense, and it is our obligation.\n  Let me also say to Members and to the country that we cannot lose \nsight of the bigger threat in Syria. The refugee crisis is just a \nconsequence of a failed policy in that region. The ultimate solution is \na plan to defeat ISIS.\n  That is why we are sending to the President a bill this week that \nrequires him to finally propose an overarching strategy to deal with \nSyria and the terrorist threat in that region. This threat is not going \naway until we acknowledge and confront the real danger that exists.\n  There is a long road ahead, but today, for this moment, I urge all of \nmy colleagues to support the legislation tomorrow and to help keep \nAmerica safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8289-9", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8289-H8290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Dr. Robert Heaney \non the occasion of his 87th birthday. It is an honor to share a \nbirthday, November 10, with such a distinguished member of our \ncommunity.\n  Dr. Heaney is a world-renowned researcher in vitamin D deficiency. He \nis one of the most published researchers in the United States. He has \npublished\n\n[[Page H8290]]\n\nover 400 original papers, chapters, and reviews on science and \neducation. His accomplishments speak to his perseverance and commitment \nto innovation in his field.\n  From 1971 to 1984, Dr. Heaney served as Professor Emeritus and Vice-\nPresident of Health Sciences for my law school alma mater, Creighton \nUniversity, in Omaha.\n  In addition to his own achievements in his own field, he is no \nstranger to nutrition policy. Dr. Heaney helped redefine nutritional \nrequirements by providing the link between malnutrition and long-term \nhealth problems. Most recently, he served as research director of \nGrassroots Health, a nonprofit organization committed to solving global \nvitamin D deficiency.\n  I wish Dr. Heaney a very happy 87th birthday, and here's to many \nmore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8290-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRESIDENT SHOULD CHANGE COURSE\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful this morning \nthat General John Keane testified before a joint hearing of the Foreign \nAffairs and Homeland Security Committees. General Keane provided an \noverview:\n  ``ISIS is part of the multigenerational struggle against radical \nIslam that will likely dominate the first half of the 21st century \nsimilar to the fight against communism, which dominated the second half \nof the 20th century. Fourteen years after 9/11, the U.S. has no \ncomprehensive strategy or a global alliance to defeat radical Islam.''\n  He explained further:\n  ``What ISIS has accomplished in the last few weeks is unprecedented. \nWhile conducting a conventional war in Iraq and Syria, ISIS has staged \nterrorist attacks on a global scale against the people from countries \nwho are fighting ISIS. The result is almost 900 casualties in 12 days, \nboth killed and wounded, who are Russian, Lebanese, and mostly French \nin Paris.''\n  The President should change course and accept the positive counsel of \nGeneral Keane to defeat ISIS. Actions should be taken to prevent \nfurther attacks, since in the last 48 hours ISIS has threatened to \nattack Washington and Rome.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8290-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE LIFE OF NOHEMI GONZALEZ\n\n  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Nohemi Gonzalez, a \n23-year-old Cal State Long Beach student whose life was cut short \nFriday night in the terrorist attacks in Paris.\n  Nohemi was a shining star of the Cal State Long Beach design \ndepartment. She was in Paris for the semester, studying at the Strate \nSchool of Design and traveling Europe. It was her first time abroad. \nNohemi has been described as a cheerful soul and a self-driven young \nwoman who had everything at her feet.\n  My heart goes out to her mother, Beatriz; her longtime boyfriend, \nTim; and all of her family and friends. I cannot imagine the pain they \nare feeling.\n  This tragedy has brought home the devastation of terrorism, which \noften seems isolated and worlds away. Her murder has stunned all \nAmericans, but it is particularly painful for the southern California \ndelegation in Congress and the Long Beach and El Monte communities that \nlost one of their own.\n  As we grieve for our own loss, we stand in solidarity with Paris and \nwith the families of 129 victims killed in Friday's attacks. As French \nauthorities continue raids to bring the perpetrators of this ungodly \nviolence to justice, our hearts are with the people of France, our \nloyal friend and our earliest ally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8290-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING SHERIFF DENNY NAU ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of \nthe contributions of Centre County, Pennsylvania, Sheriff Denny Nau, \nwho will retire at the end of this year.\n  Denny has served in that office for more than two decades after being \nelected in 1991. Before being elected sheriff, he served as a \nPennsylvania State Police trooper. Sheriff Nau is also a marine, \njoining after graduating high school.\n  Over his 24 years as Centre County Sheriff, Denny has influenced \ncountless law enforcement officers. In fact, more than 40 of his former \ndeputies are police officers in areas ranging from Altoona to \nPittsburgh or are serving as State troopers.\n  Nau has overseen great growth by the Centre County Sheriff's Office \nalong with transitions to new technology, from typewriters to the use \nof state-of-the-art software to track cases, to a videoconference \nsystem to conduct hearings.\n  Mr. Speaker, Sheriff Denny Nau has provided a wonderful example of \npublic service as a marine, a Pennsylvania State trooper, and high \nsheriff of Centre County.

We invade Iraq because we are angry at what comes out of the \nMiddle East.\n  Mr. Speaker, on May 13, 1939, the transatlantic liner, the St. Louis, \nsailed from Germany with almost 1,000 souls aboard, all Jews seeking to \nflee the murderous wrath of Adolf Hitler.

We cannot allow ISIS \nor any terrorist group to exploit the refugee resettlement program to \nsneak terrorists into our country by having lax background standards.\n  This is a real threat.

No matter what has happened in the past, Living Vine \nteaches women that they are valuable as a human being, they are \nvaluable as a woman, and they are something to be treasured.\n  The Living Vine Christian Maternity Home fulfills their purpose \nsolely through private donations and through its new thrift store \ncalled Blessingdales.\n  I am honored to have this organization located in the First \nCongressional District of Georgia. I salute them for 20 years of \nsuccess and wish them continued success for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8291-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE LIFE OF MRS. DOROTHY ``DOT'' HELMS\n\n  (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I pay tribute today to the extraordinary \nlife of one of America's finest women who recently passed on to be with \nour Creator. Mrs. Dorothy Helms, also known to many of us as ``Dot,'' \nwas the long-time best friend and wife of the late U.S. Senator Jesse \nHelms.\n  As a member of the Helms Senate family, I grew to know both of them \nvery well.\n  Senator Helms asked me one day, he said: ``David, do you know where I \nget all my good ideas?'' Without giving me a second to respond, he \nsaid, ``Dot, you know.''\n  For those of us who knew the two well, Dot was, in fact, the \nconservative of the family, and a strident and forceful communicator of \nher opinion on all matters.\n  Dot Helms was a trailblazer in her own right. She was one of the \nfirst women to graduate from the University of North Carolina with a \ndegree in journalism and later went on to work for the News & Observer \nas a society page editor.\n  Meanwhile, Jesse Helms was there working as a sports reporter. The \nrest, of course, is history, and the two of them helped change history.\n  As much as Dot Helms will be missed by all of us, something tells me \nthe tall, lanky fellow from Monroe, North Carolina, is delighted to \nhave her back at his side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8291-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ISIS IS NOT CONTAINED\n\n  (Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, ISIS is not contained. It is not enough to \ntry and contain terrorists in the Middle East. They have proven capable \nof a global reach.\n  Mere hope isn't going to win this, nor is sporadic, short-term \nplanning. American leadership and an international coalition are \nrequired.\n  The U.S. should move to indefinitely suspend resettling Syrian \nrefugees here. The records simply do not exist in a war-torn Syria to \nproperly vet individuals with needed confidence.\n  All involved will be better served with an established safe haven in \nthe Middle East and addressing the root cause that provides a motive \nfor people to leave their own homeland.\n  Our first responsibility is to protect our Nation. No one wants to \nfight this war here. The world must defeat this ideology and its \nevildoers at their doorstep, not ours.\n  Our Nation recognizes that we need a short- and a long-term strategy, \na smart use of force, and a greater commitment to victory. Eliminating \nthe threat we face from the enemies of freedom is the challenge of this \ngeneration of Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, our children are counting on us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8291-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8291-H8292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF KENNETH GEORGE MASSREY\n\n  (Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory \nof Kenneth George Massrey, a dear friend who passed away on Sunday, \nOctober 25, 2015, at the age of 66.\n  Ken was a loving husband, father, brother and grandfather. He lived \nin San Juan Capistrano, California, where he was a successful \nentrepreneur, an avid sports fan, and a generous contributor to \ncharity.\n  The oldest of five children, Ken was born in Warwick, Rhode Island, \nand, at the age of six, his family moved to California.\n  Ken received a scholarship to UCLA, where he was a catcher for the \nBruins\n\n[[Page H8292]]\n\nbaseball team. He later graduated from Cal State Long Beach.\n  His professional career began at a California video security products \nfirm, and in 1989, Ken launched his own company in Irvine, California, \nwhere he served as CEO for 26 years.\n  Ken is survived by his wife, Barbara; his daughters, Katie and \nChrissie; his grandson, Griffin; his son-in-law, Ryan Downey; and his \nfour siblings.\n  I am honored to have had the privilege of calling Ken a friend. I \nhave very fond memories of our political discussions, and they were \ndynamic.\n  He will be deeply missed by all those who knew him, and his memory \nwill live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8292-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEADLY ATTACKS IN PARIS\n\n  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, this past Friday, the world \nwatched in horror the unfolding of the deadliest attack on French soil \nsince World War II.\n  The attacks in Paris killed 129 people from 26 countries, including \none American, a young student from California. To all those affected by \nthese terrible acts, I offer my deepest sympathies.\n  Around the world, tragedies of this scale have become distressingly \nfamiliar, but to see one happen in a country at peace, a country with \nwhich the United States has shared such a special relationship since \nour founding days, hits particularly hard.\n  Those who carried out these horrific attacks want us to react with \ndivisiveness and hate; in fact, they depend on it. They know they \ncannot survive in a world that stands united against them.\n  We must, of course, respond to this threat with strength. But we \ncannot forget our compassion toward those in France and those in the \nMiddle East fleeing the very same dangers.\n  As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said: ``Darkness cannot drive \nout darkness; only light can do that.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of lifesaving \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health.\n  As we debate the priorities for the upcoming omnibus appropriations \nact, one of our top initiatives must be an increase in support for \nresearch to cure and prevent disease. Cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, \nand more than 10,000 known diseases in our world affect millions of \nfamilies throughout our country and in each and every one of our \ndistricts.\n  This year, 600,000 Americans will die of cancer. The best defense to \nsaving those lives is enhancing and supporting funding at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  Earlier this year, we passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which \nincreased funding for the NIH by over $3 billion in FY 2016. Passing \nwith 344 votes, it also had the support of both parties, including 170 \nRepublican votes.\n  Now is the time to meet the moment and to increase NIH by $3 billion \nin the upcoming appropriations act.\n  Now is also the time to send a message of hope to each and every \npatient waiting for a cure, that Congress hears you, and Congress is \ngoing to do everything we can to find innovative cures and treatments \nthat can ease suffering and save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8292-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LOCAL BUSINESSES DESERVE OUR SUPPORT\n\n  (Mr. BLUM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BLUM.

As a career small businessman myself, I understand \nfirsthand the difficulties our entrepreneurs face when starting and \nrunning a business.\n  Small business is the backbone of our economy and a place where the \nAmerican Dream happens every day. In fact, 2 million of the roughly 3 \nmillion private sector jobs generated in 2014 were created by small \nbusinesses.\n  As I visit small businesses throughout the First District, I am \namazed at their innovation, determination, and optimism, often in the \nface of government policies that make doing business most difficult.\n  Mr. Speaker, local business deserves our support.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule for H.R. 1210, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage \nAccess Act, and H.R. 3189, the Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization \nAct of 2015. House Resolution 529 provides a structured rule for \nconsideration of H.R. 1210 and H.R. 3189.\n  The resolution provides 1 hour of debate equally divided between the \nchair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial \nServices for H.R. 1210 and for H.R. 3189. The resolution provides for \nthe consideration of one amendment to H.R. 1210 and consideration of \nsix amendments to H.R. 3189. The resolution also provides a motion to \nrecommit for each bill. In addition, the rule provides the normal \nrecess authorities to allow the chair to manage pro forma sessions \nduring next week's district work period.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and the \nunderlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you know, the 2008 financial crisis was caused, in \npart, by the subprime lending meltdown. Financial institutions would \noriginate loans. They would sell off 100 percent of those loans with no \nskin in the game to some investment party, a third party, and they \nwould keep their fee. But they wouldn't keep any of the risk.\n  This led to a lot of loans to individuals and families that had an \ninability to repay those loans, and that resulted in our crisis. The \nbottom line was these institutions had no skin in the game.\n  The situation became so egregious that, at one point, there was a \nterm in the industry called a NINJA loan. NINJA stood for no income, no \njob, no assets.\n  Borrowers across the country were being given loans by loan \noriginators. Those originators knew they were impossible to repay, but \nthe originators didn't care because they took their fee and had no skin \nin the game.\n  When the borrowers began to default on these loans, banks and others \nholding these mortgages began to lose tremendous amounts of assets, \nwhich precipitated the financial collapse.\n  In response, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which reforms \nmortgage lending and makes a lot of changes. One of those is around the \nability to repay.\n  The Dodd-Frank statute created a category of loans called qualified \nmortgages that are deemed to comply with the law's ability-to-repay \nrequirements. It provided a safe harbor from lawsuits, and it made sure \nthat that safe harbor also covered regulatory action, provided that \nthose loans met certain characteristics and underwriting criteria.\n  While it is important that we ensure the creditworthiness of \npotential homeowners and home buyers to avoid repeating our past \nmistakes, the current regulatory environment has unnecessarily \nrestrained mortgage lending and has made it difficult for some \ncreditworthy borrowers to obtain a loan. The bottom line of this crisis \nwas that it was created by no skin in the game.\n  The Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act would provide much-\nneeded regulatory relief and allow consumers to buy a home and ensure \nnot only that there is some skin in the game--there is 100 percent skin \nin the game. The banks and institutions that make these portfolio loans \nhave 100 percent skin in the game. They lose dollar one when the loans \ngo bad.\n  This bill provides that, when residential mortgages are held by that \noriginator, the bank, if they hold them in their portfolio as opposed \nto being sold into the secondary market, they will be considered a \nqualified mortgage for the purpose of ability to repay.\n  It will make sure that more financial institutions have an incentive \nto make loans to individuals and the requirement for making those loans \nwill be to take the entire risk, not pass that risk on to some un-named \nthird-party investor, but keep that risk in their portfolio.\n  That is why it is called the Portfolio Lending Act. They will have \n100 percent of the skin in the game. This legislation will also help \nborrowers gain access to mortgages that they badly need.\n  H.R. 3189, the Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act, pulls back \nthe curtain at the Federal Reserve and makes it more accountable and \ntransparent to the American people. The Federal Reserve has more power \nand responsibility today than ever before,\n\n[[Page H8294]]\n\nand that is precisely why this law is so important. The institution \nneeds to be modernized, and the decisions they make need to be \ntransparent and predictable to the marketplace.\n  The FORM Act, as it is called, requires the Federal Reserve to \ntransparently communicate its monetary policy decisions to the American \npeople. It does not require them to choose any one method.\n  Some people talk a lot about the so-called Taylor rule. This bill \ndoes not require the Federal Reserve to use the Taylor rule or any \nother process. It just requires that, when they make decisions, they \nneed to make that decision and the reasons behind it transparent to the \nAmerican people and explain how they make their decisions. Whether they \nuse a rule or whether they use some other process, it needs to be \ntransparent.\n  This bill also requires the Federal Reserve to conduct a cost-benefit \nanalysis that every other Federal agency already has to comply with so \nthat we know whether the costs of complying with the regulations exceed \nor are less than the benefits of those regulations. It is simple common \nsense. Other agencies use this cost-benefit analysis today.\n  The FORM Act protects the Federal Reserve's independence, as it \nrequires the Federal Reserve to generate a monetary strategy of their \nown choosing, but requires them to give more accounting of their \nactions and transparency to their actions. The bill ensures that the \nAmerican people understand how the Federal Reserve makes the decisions \nthey make and why they make the decisions they make.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know that I, along with many of our colleagues in the \nHouse, have believed for a long time that we should audit the Federal \nReserve. I am pleased to inform my colleagues that this legislation \nrequires an audit of the Fed, and it contains provisions that remove \nrestrictions placed on the GAO's ability to conduct an audit of the \nFederal Reserve. It directs the GAO, in fact, to conduct an audit of \nthe Federal Reserve within 12 months of enactment and requires the GAO \nto report to Congress within 90 days of completion of that audit.\n  As the Federal Reserve plays an outsized role in the health of our \nNation's economy, it is imperative that we make sure that their opaque \nstructure is made transparent so the American people understand the \ndecisions the Federal Reserve makes and why they make them because it \nhas such an incredible impact on our economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to debating these bills with our \ncolleagues in the House as well as the amendments yet to come, and I \nwould ask adoption of both the underlying bills and support of the \nunderlying bills.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentleman, my friend from Ohio, for yielding me the \ncustomary 30 minutes for debate.\n  I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in opposition to this rule, which provides \nfor consideration of both H.R. 1210, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage \nAccess Act, and H.R. 3189, the Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization \nAct of 2015.\n  As the first matter of business, I would like to recognize that \nyesterday's rule, H. Res. 526, marked the 45th closed rule of this \ncongressional session, making it the most closed session in history.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  I join my colleagues in the minority in their distaste for this \nclosed and exclusive process and echo their calls to Speaker Ryan to \nmaintain his pledge to usher in a more transparent and open debate \nprocess that includes input from Members of both parties.\n  Very occasionally I talk about when I first came to Congress in 1993. \nThe radio at that time was hammering those who were perpetrating closed \nrules. My party was in the majority and was being rightly, in my \nopinion, accused in that regard. I didn't know what a closed rule was. \nI didn't come here and start on this committee. But now that I have had \na considerable amount of experience on this committee, I have come to \nbelieve that it is wrong for either party in the majority to conduct a \nprocess that disallows Members in this body from having an opportunity \nto participate in refining the underlying bills that come here for our \nconsideration.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1210 seeks to amend the Truth in Lending Act to \nprovide that depository institution creditors be subject to a legal \nsafe harbor for mortgage loans meeting specified limitations that, \nsince origination, have been held on the institution's balance sheet. \nThe bill would extend this legal safe harbor to mortgage originators \nthat steer borrowers to a nonqualified mortgage loan if the originator \nand borrower are notified that the lender intends to hold the loan in \nits portfolio.\n  We have seen firsthand the consequences that ensue when underwriting \nstandards are virtually abandoned by both large and small lenders. This \nphenomenon, which contributed to the financial crisis and a bank \nbailout to the tune of $700 billion in taxpayer money, enabled \npredatory lenders to offer loans, the terms of which individuals could \nnot afford or, worse, incentivize their brokers to steer families into \nmore expensive loans, even when they qualified for lower rates and a \nstandard mortgage product. African American and Latino borrowers and \nsingle persons were disproportionately affected by these bad loans.\n  This legislation would eliminate effective reforms that require \nlenders to verify a consumer's ability to repay and would allow lenders \nto once again steer families into the same risky mortgage products with \nthe same predatory practices that destroyed the savings and investments \nof American families a few short years ago.\n  Today's rule also allows for consideration of H.R. 3189, the Fed \nOversight Reform and Modernization Act. This bill will fundamentally \nchange the way the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy. In doing \nso, this bill will change the current proven nonpartisan approach to \nmonetary policy the Fed currently embraces and will replace it with a \nrule-based and politically partisan regime.\n  H.R. 3189 will tie the hands of the Federal Reserve whose objective \nwith regard to monetary policy is to maximize employment, stabilize \nprices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This legislation will \nrequire the Fed to engage in a rulemaking to provide a ridged \nmathematical formula for setting the interest rate. This notion is not \nonly bad policy that will prevent the Fed from acting swiftly and \nnimbly to address a potential financial crisis, but Fed Chair Janet \nYellen has stated that it ``would be a grave mistake for the Federal \nReserve to commit to conduct monetary policy according to a \nmathematical rule.''\n  Additionally, this bill will create a partisan commission, with twice \nas many Republican Members as Democrats, to review the Federal Reserve \nmonetary policy and make changes to its current vital role in \ndetermining that policy. The objectives of the Fed and the policy \nbehind our money supply are much too important to be subjected to \npolitical pressure from a partisan commission.\n  This legislation will do serious harm to the Federal Reserve, leading \nus down a path of politicizing monetary policy and hamstringing the \nagency with onerous and unnecessary rulemakings.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to address, Mr. Speaker, a couple of the gentleman from \nFlorida's points about the process.\n  Under our new Speaker, we have had five rules. Four have been \nstructured, and let's look at today's rule.\n  All of the germane amendments were made in order. In fact, to H.R. \n1210, there is one amendment, and it is a Democratic amendment; to H.R. \n3189, there are six amendments, and four are Democratic amendments. \nThat is 75 percent of the amendments are Democratic amendments. That is \na pretty open process. I am leaving out the fact that we also allow for \na motion to recommit to each of the bills.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. STIVERS. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. My question to you is, even though the germane \namendments were made in order, under the structured rule, am I correct \nthat\n\n[[Page H8295]]\n\nother Members of the House of Representatives who did not, at the time, \nfile an amendment before the Rules Committee that you and I serve, that \nthey are precluded? That is basically what I am arguing.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman from Florida's point, it \nis true that, with a structured rule, somebody can't walk in off the \nstreet, a Member of Congress, that didn't come to the Rules Committee, \nand come up with an amendment right now that they are writing on a \nnapkin and bring it in here.\n  But we did have an open process. We published the deadline, and we \naccepted not only ones that met the deadline, but late amendments. In \nfact, I think, of the amendments that we made in order, five of the \nseven amendments made in order today were actually filed late, so we \ndid allow late amendments. That is off the top of my head. We will \ndouble-check the facts on five, but it was several of the amendments \nthat were even filed late, we allowed.\n  It is true, though, that somebody can't just walk right in here. It \nis not an open rule. It is a structured rule. So you can't just walk in \nthe day of the floor hearing in about 45 minutes and offer an amendment \nthat nobody has ever seen before. So I understand the gentleman's \npoint.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Will the gentleman continue to yield?\n  Mr. STIVERS. I yield again to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  My ultimate point was that in this year, we have had 45 closed rules \nand, clearly, Members are precluded. That 45, I might add, has been \nachieved in this year, and that is more than in the previous session of \nCongress. That is the point I wish to make.\n  Mr. STIVERS. I appreciate the gentleman making his point.\n  Mr. Speaker, my point is, under the new Speaker, we have only had one \nclosed rule.\n  Will we occasionally have a closed rule? Yes. When the other party \nwas in charge, they had closed rules all the time, too. Closed rules \nwill happen occasionally, but we will have an open process. I think \nhaving four out of five as structured rules is a pretty good \nmeasurement for the brand-new Speaker in our new day that we are \nexperiencing.\n\n  I appreciate the gentleman's point, but the point is we are making \nthe process more open. It may not be to the gentleman's liking, Mr. \nSpeaker, but we are attempting to make the process more open and will \ncontinue to work on that.\n  I do want to make a couple of points, and then I will reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  With regard to the charge that somehow in H.R. 1210 this will result \nin risky mortgage loans--and that is why I went through the history of \nthe crisis where people took a fee, securitized the loan. They \nprivatized gains and socialized losses for the taxpayers to cover. The \nonly way this portfolio lending bill works is if these lenders hold \nthese loans in their own portfolio and take 100 percent of the downside \nrisk. That is not placing it on anybody else. That was one of the \nreforms that was put in place, and Dodd-Frank was skin in the game. I \ncan't think of anything more than 100 percent skin in the game. We \nthink that will ensure that nobody privatizes the gains and socializes \nthe losses, and we think it is a reasonable step to allow people to get \naccess to mortgages where somebody is willing to put their own money at \nrisk.\n  With regard to the charge that this is going to somehow tie the \nFederal Reserve's hands in H.R. 3189, this bill is about transparency \nand accountability. It is making sure the Federal Reserve communicates \nwhatever they use. If they want to use a Magic 8 Ball, they just have \nto tell everybody, ``Hey, we are using a Magic 8 Ball.''\n  I think there is nothing wrong with transparency. Transparency is \ngreat for the American economy, and it is great for the American \npeople. The gentleman was just making the argument about how we need to \nbe more open and transparent, and I think we need to demand it of the \nFederal Reserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record Statements of Administration \nPolicy.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n          H.R. 1210--Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act\n\n                       (Rep. Barr, R-KY, Nov. 17)\n\n       As a result of the Ability-to-Repay rules issued by the \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, pursuant to the Truth \n     in Lending Act, American consumers are protected against \n     harmful mortgage products and abusive lending practices that \n     were common in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Among \n     other protections, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's \n     Qualified Mortgage (QM) rule requires a lender to make a good \n     faith effort to determine that a borrower has the ability to \n     repay a mortgage, and that the loan does not include \n     excessive upfront points and fees. The final rule also \n     contains special provisions and exemptions that are available \n     only to small lenders or to small lenders that operate \n     predominantly in rural or underserved areas.\n       H.R. 1210 would broaden the definition of qualified \n     mortgages--those that qualify for the safe harbor--to include \n     all mortgages held on a lender's balance sheet. Under the \n     bill, depository institutions that hold a loan in portfolio \n     would receive a legal safe harbor even if the loan contains \n     terms and features that are abusive and harmful to consumers. \n     The bill would limit the right of borrowers to file claims \n     against holders of such loans and against mortgage \n     originators who directed them to the loans. H.R. 1210 also \n     would open the door to risky lending by allowing balloon \n     loans made in any geographic area to qualify for the safe \n     harbor as long as they are held in portfolio.\n       The Administration strongly opposes this bill because it \n     would undermine critical consumer protections by exempting \n     all depository financial institutions, large and small, from \n     QM standards--including very basic standards like verifying a \n     consumer's income--as long as the mortgage loans in question \n     are held in portfolio by the institution. This bill would \n     undermine the essential protections provided under the \n     Qualified Mortgage rule. The Congressional Budget Office \n     estimates that the mortgages offered legal protections under \n     the bill would likely default at a greater rate than the \n     qualified mortgages with current legal protections.\n       For these reasons, if the President were presented with \n     H.R. 1210, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \n     the bill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n     H.R. 3189--Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act of 2015\n\n                  (Rep. Huizenga, R-MI, Nov. 17, 2015)\n\n       H.R. 3189 would establish requirements for policy rules, \n     codify blackout periods of the Federal Open Market Committee, \n     establish a cost-benefit requirement for other rulemakings by \n     the Federal Reserve Board, and establish numerous, burdensome \n     reporting requirements for the Federal Reserve Board and its \n     members. The Administration therefore strongly opposes H.R. \n     3189.\n       The Federal Reserve is an independent entity designed to be \n     free from political pressures, and its independence is key to \n     its credibility and its ability to act in the long-term \n     interest of the Nation's economic health. One of the most \n     problematic provisions in the bill would require the \n     Comptroller General to audit the conduct of monetary policy \n     by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market \n     Committee. The operations of the Federal Reserve are already \n     subject to numerous audit requirements that ensure it is \n     accountable to the Congress and the American people. The only \n     aspect of the Federal Reserve's operations not subject to \n     audit is its monetary policy decision-making, and for good \n     reason. Subjecting the Federal Reserve's exercise of monetary \n     policy authority to audits based on political whims of \n     members of the Congress--of either party--threatens one of \n     the central pillars of the Nation's financial system and \n     economy, and would almost certainly have negative impacts on \n     the Federal Reserve's work to promote price stability and \n     full employment.\n       H.R. 3189 also would impose numerous, burdensome \n     requirements for the Federal Reserve Board rulemaking \n     authorities, including the imposition of a duplicative \n     requirement that the Federal Reserve Board undertake a \n     proscriptive cost-benefit analysis and a post-adoption impact \n     assessment when promulgating rules. When a Federal agency, \n     including an independent agency such as the Federal Reserve, \n     promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the \n     robust substantive and procedural requirements of Federal \n     law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the \n     Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and \n     the Congressional Review Act, among other statutes. \n     Additionally, Executive Order 13579 encourages independent \n     regulatory agencies to conduct reasoned cost-benefit \n     analysis, engage in public participation to the extent \n     feasible, and conduct a systematic retrospective review of \n     regulations. The provisions in this bill, therefore, would \n     create unnecessary, duplicative, and onerous requirements for \n     an entity tasked with ensuring the financial safety and \n     soundness of the Nation's financial system.\n       In addition, the bill would add a number of procedural \n     hurdles that would impede the Federal Reserve's ability to \n     engage with international regulatory bodies and divert its \n     resources to unnecessary reporting requirements. These \n     provisions, along with\n\n[[Page H8296]]\n\n     provisions imposing parallel notification and consultation \n     requirements on several other Executive Branch entities, \n     could impair the President's exercise of his exclusive \n     constitutional authority to conduct the Nation's diplomatic \n     relations.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 3189, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am trying to help us to get to a time \nconstraint and, unfortunately, on either side we don't have a lot of \nspeakers. Therefore, I would not ordinarily have done anything other \nthan include in the Record Statements of Administration Policy. But to \ntry to help us meet our deadline, what is said in the Statement of \nAdministration Policy, H.R. 1210, Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access \nAct, is:\n  ``As a result of the Ability-to-Repay rules issued by the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act, \nAmerican consumers are protected against harmful mortgage products and \nabusive lending practices that were common in the run-up to the 2008 \nfinancial crisis. Among other protections, the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau's qualified mortgage rule requires a lender to make a \ngood faith effort to determine that a borrower has the ability to repay \na mortgage, and that the loan does not include excessive upfront points \nand fees. The final rule also contains special provisions and \nexemptions that are available only to small lenders or to small lenders \nthat operate predominantly in rural and underserved areas.''\n  Skipping one paragraph, getting to the heart of what the \nadministration says:\n  ``The Administration strongly opposes this bill because it would \nundermine critical consumer protections by exempting all depository \nfinancial institutions, large and small, from QM standards--including \nvery basic standards like verifying a consumer's income--as long as the \nmortgage loans in question are held in portfolio by the institution. \nThis bill would undermine the essential protections provided under the \nqualified mortgage rule. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nthe mortgages offered legal protections under the bill would likely \ndefault at a greater rate than the qualified mortgages with current \nlegal protections.\n  ``For these reasons, if the President were presented with H.R. 1210, \nhis senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.''\n  Mr. Speaker, not to belabor the point that my good friend from Ohio \nand I were speaking about with reference to rules, I join him in saying \nthat the new Speaker at least has had only one closed rule. But I would \nremind him, of the 45 closed rules that we had previously, the new \nSpeaker voted for every one of those closed rules. So if it is a \nprecursor of what is to come, we will have to judge that in the future.\n  Now, as to H.R. 3189, the administration says--and I will cut to the \nheart of the matter:\n  ``H.R. 3189 also would impose numerous, burdensome requirements for \nthe Federal Reserve Board rulemaking authorities, including the \nimposition of a duplicative requirement that the Federal Reserve Board \nundertake a proscriptive cost-benefit analysis and a post-adoption \nimpact assessment when promulgating rules.''\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  When a Federal agency, including an independent agency such as the \nFederal Reserve, promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to \nthe robust act--the Regulatory Flexibility Act--the Paperwork Reduction \nAct, and the Congressional Review Act, among other statutes. \nAdditionally, Executive Order No. 13579 encourages independent \nregulatory agencies to conduct reasoned cost-benefit analyses, to \nengage in public participation to the extent feasible, and to conduct a \nsystematic, retrospective review of regulations.\n  The provisions in this bill, referring to H.R. 3189, would therefore \ncreate unnecessary, duplicative, and onerous requirements for an entity \ntasked with ensuring the financial safety and soundness of the Nation's \nfinancial system. In addition, the bill would add a number of \nprocedural hurdles that would impede the Federal Reserve's ability to \nengage within our national regulatory bodies and divert its resources \nto unnecessary reporting requirements.\n  In addition and at the heart of the matter, the bill would add a \nnumber of procedural hurdles that are too numerous for me to mention at \nthis time. These provisions, along with provisions imposing parallel \nnotification and consultation requirements on several other executive \nbranch entities, could impair the President's exercise of his exclusive \nconstitutional authority to conduct the Nation's diplomatic relations.\n  Again, if the President were presented with H.R. 3189, his senior \nadvisers would recommend that he veto the bill.\n  As I have said time and again, far too much important work still \nremains. In fact, Congress has only 9 legislative days before the \nDecember 11 deadline to avert yet another Republican government \nshutdown and pass an omnibus spending bill. The clock is ticking. Quite \nfrankly, this Nation cannot afford to shut down once again due to my \nfriends'--the House Republicans--continued manufactured crisis.\n  The American people need and deserve better; so I urge my colleagues \nto vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I thank the gentleman from Florida for this civil debate on the rule.\n  I will remind my colleagues that these two bills are about reform and \ntransparency. H.R. 1210 is reform that will give more people access to \nmortgages and, at the same time, will require that these lenders have \n100 percent skin in the game. H.R. 3189 is about transparency and \naccountability for the Federal Reserve to make sure they tell the \nAmerican people how they make the decisions that they make. These are \nreasonable bills, important bills.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The question is on the \nresolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 243, \nnays 184, not voting 6, as follows:\n\n

Pursuant to House Resolution 526 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1737.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) to preside over \nthe Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1344\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 1737) to nullify certain guidance of the Bureau of Consumer \nFinancial Protection and to provide requirements for guidance issued by \nthe Bureau with respect to indirect auto lending, with Mr. Poe of Texas \nin the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1737, the Reforming \nCFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act. It is an important, \nbipartisan bill cosponsored by 166 Members of the House, including 65 \nDemocratic Members. It was approved by the Financial Services Committee \nthat I chair with strong bipartisan support, including more than half \nof the committee's Democratic members who voted.\n  If Congress means what it says when we write a law, then the CFPB \ncannot be allowed to willfully ignore the law. Without this bill, the \nCFPB would have done a blatant end run around the Dodd-Frank Act as \nwell as the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  I would like to thank Representative Guinta of New Hampshire and \nRepresentative Perlmutter of Colorado for their leadership in providing \nthe CFPB with an opportunity to live up to its claim of transparency \nand accountability. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nWilliams) as well for his outstanding work on this bill.\n  The CFPB's flawed bulletin on indirect auto lending attempts to \nregulate compensation paid to auto dealers despite the fact that auto \ndealers were specifically exempted in the Dodd-Frank Act from CFPB \nrulemaking.\n  By using this bulletin, the Bureau went far beyond merely clarifying \nexisting law and instead, in trying to make new policy through this \nguidance, did this without using the normal rulemaking process and \nwithout public input.\n  This is an affront, Mr. Chairman, to due process. This is an affront \nto the rule of law and to basic fairness. Furthermore, the CFPB has not \nbeen transparent in revealing the methodology it used to determine \nwhether fair lending violations existed in the auto finance market.\n  It took a year of constant pressure from Members of Congress and 13 \ndifferent letters from 90 Democrat and Republican Members to get the \nCFPB to finally provide documentation regarding its disparate impacts.\n  In the white paper ultimately provided by the CFPB, they admitted \nthat their own proxy methodology for determining racial disparities is \nflawed and overestimates the number of African Americans by perhaps as \nmuch as 20 percent. Outside statisticians at the well-respected Charles \nRiver Associates found the figure could be off by as much as 41 \npercent.\n  According to a series of three articles published this past September \nin the American Banker, internal agency documents show the CFPB was \naware that their disparate impact methodology significantly overstates \nracial impact. In other words, Mr. Chairman, they knowingly used junk \nscience and may have no evidence of unintentional discrimination based \non the disparate impact theory.\n  In those same internal memos, the American Banker newspaper also \nfound that unaccountable CFPB bureaucrats\n\n[[Page H8298]]\n\nchose to disregard the explicit exemption of auto dealers that \nDemocrats, when they had a supermajority in both the Senate and the \nHouse and controlled the White House, put into Dodd-Frank.\n  They chose to disregard the formal rulemaking requirement set out by \nthe Administrative Procedure Act and instead used high-profile \nenforcement actions against large auto lenders to pressure them to \nlower the caps they set on dealer reserve.\n  Now, not only does this call into question the CFPB's attempts to \npolice the fairness of auto loans, its preferred outcomes will \nobviously increase costs for consumers.\n  As was noted earlier, the CFPB has pressured finance companies to \nlower the caps they set on dealer reserve or eliminate this discretion \naltogether. However, under this pricing model, The Wall Street Journal \nrecently revealed that interest payments for some consumers could \nincrease by as much as $580 over the life of the loan.\n  This shows the dire need for the CFPB to follow a transparent process \nwhen issuing any subsequent auto finance guidance. That is what H.R. \n1737 will ensure.\n  The bill is a simple bill. It requires the Bureau to, number one, \nprovide notice and an opportunity for public comment. Number two, it \nsays the CFPB must make any studies, data, or analysis used in writing \nthe bulletin public. Number three, it must consult with other relevant \nregulators. Four, it must study the impact of the guidance on consumers \nas well as women-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses, and small \nbusinesses.\n  To those who claim this bill somehow undermines the CFPB'S \nantidiscrimination efforts, let me quote from the views the Democrat \nmembers stated in our report:\n\n       H.R. 1737 does not alter the CFPB's examination or \n     enforcement activity pursuant to ECOA. That is simply a red \n     herring.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1737.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1737, \nwhich would impede the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's important \nwork of regulating discriminatory auto lending practices and protecting \nminority borrowers.\n  In spite of the fact that Chairman Hensarling just talked about a \nstudy, what he didn't tell you is that was a study that was done by the \nautomobile industry, who is supporting this bill.\n  H.R. 1737 would cancel important policy guidance the CFPB provided to \nlenders to help them comply with Federal fair lending laws.\n  The bill also imposes burdensome restrictions on the issuance of any \nfuture auto lending guidance by requiring that the CFPB undergo a \npublic notice and comment period and conduct cost-benefit studies \nbefore issuing guidance, requirements that have historically only been \napplied to agency rulemakings.\n  These restrictions are clearly designed to substantially delay or \neffectively prevent the Bureau from issuing future antidiscrimination \nguidance to auto lenders, action that would undermine a lender's \nability to comply with the law at the expense of minority borrowers. \nThe long shadow of discrimination is still alive and well in some \ncorners of the auto lending marketplace.\n  The CFPB has secured nearly $140 million in relief to minority \nborrowers since December 2013 in landmark settlements against Ally \nFinancial, Fifth Third Bank, and American Honda Finance Corporation, \nfinding in each case that undisclosed dealer markups caused minority \nborrowers to overpay for their auto loans by an average of $200 over \nthe life of the loan compared to similarly situated White borrowers, \neven when considering the borrower's creditworthiness.\n  Mike Jackson, the CEO of the Nation's largest auto retailer, \nAutoNation, commended the CFPB's approach in its settlement with Honda, \nnoting that other lenders should take a close look at the Honda \nsettlement as a template for a solution.\n  Much like Mr. Jackson, I believe that the CFPB is doing a commendable \njob of tackling a decades-old problem of minority borrowers not getting \na fair deal when they obtain financing from dealerships.\n\n  The Bureau's work in this regard should be supported, but instead, we \nare faced with H.R. 1737, yet another legislative proposal that would \nattempt to tie the Bureau's hands as it attempts to inform lenders of \nthe steps that they can take to comply with Federal fair lending laws \nand to protect minority borrowers.\n  I wouldn't care if everybody were treated the same way--you charge \neverybody too much--but, when you single out a certain segment of our \nsociety that happens to be minorities and you charge them more than \nother borrowers, it is a problem.\n  H.R. 1737 follows a familiar script of industry-driven attempts to \nundermine the CFPB. Cost-benefit analysis, public notice and comment \nperiods, outside rulemakings, unnecessary interagency consultation \nrequirements are all designed to do the same thing, delay and undermine \nthe important work of the CFPB.\n  Instead of addressing the underlying discrimination in indirect auto \nlending that the CFPB is seeking to address, H.R. 1737 takes away an \nimportant tool for lenders seeking to follow the law who have been \nrelying on the guidance for almost 3 years to develop their compliance \npolicies.\n  This is not a modest proposal designed to bring about transparency in \nthe CFPB's oversight of auto lenders. Since issuing its guidance in \nMarch 2013, the CFPB has been transparent.\n  It has provided industry with its models for identifying potential \nfair lending violations. Its supervisory manual describes exactly what \nthe Bureau is seeking when conducting fair lending exams and \nsupervisory highlights that clearly set forth the kinds of business \npractices that the Bureau will focus on when it examines an indirect \nauto lender.\n  Furthermore, the CFPB's settlement agreements all follow a similar \ntemplate that give lenders a glimpse into the kind of remediation that \nthe Bureau will pursue should there be potential fair lending \nviolations within a lender's portfolio.\n  H.R. 1737's supporters have yet to identify what information any \nadditional transparency would yield or what additional information \nlenders need to comply with Federal fair lending laws.\n  If enacted, H.R. 1737 would actually place lenders at a disadvantage, \njust as scrutiny for fair lending violations from the CFPB and the DOJ \nintensifies. We should be working to support efforts to give industry \nas much information as possible so that they can comply with the law. \nH.R. 1737 does just the opposite, creating unnecessary uncertainty for \nlenders.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Hampshire (Mr. Guinta), the author of H.R. 1737, a real champion \nfor due process and auto buyers.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership on this \nvery, very important issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, it has been over 2 years since the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau issued flawed auto financing guidance that created \nmuch uncertainty in the auto lending market.\n  More than half of car buyers finance their purchase when they acquire \nan automobile. These consumers have the ability to receive great auto \nrates through dealer-assisted financing.\n  However, this flawed and unstudied guidance threatens to eliminate \nauto dealers' flexibility to discount the interest rates offered to \ntheir consumers, the customers.\n  My good friend across the aisle, Mr. Perlmutter of Colorado, and I \nhave introduced H.R. 1737, along with 166 of our colleagues, both \nRepublican and Democrat, to give the CFPB a chance to fix this faulty \nguidance. This bill was carefully written by Republicans and Democrats \nvery simply and narrowly to provide clarity, fairness, and, most \nimportantly, due process.\n  No Federal agency can set new policies through guidance. However, in \nMarch of 2013, the CFPB attempted to go outside the formal rulemaking \nprocess by blatantly disregarding consumers and small businesses, \nblatantly disregarding their ability and their\n\n[[Page H8299]]\n\nright to comment on guidance that will directly affect them.\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1737 asks that the CFPB rescind their flawed \nguidance and reissue it under a more transparent process by consulting \nother regulators and allowing the public notice and comment.\n  I want to be clear. This bill does not strip the CFPB of any \nrulemaking authority it currently has. H.R. 1737 gives the CFPB the \ngolden opportunity to correct and reissue their guidance that would \ntake into account consumers and bring clarity to the market.\n  Mr. Chairman, again, I want to reiterate that my colleagues and I are \nmerely trying to promote transparency, accountability, and due process.\n  There are a small number of critics that believe this bill is \nunnecessary because the CFPB already has the tools to correct their \nauto guidance. Well, the CFPB could have fixed this issue without \nlegislation over 2 years ago, but they disregarded 13 bipartisan \nletters that were sent urging them to correct the fallacies in their \nguidance.\n  I find it ironic that the agency that is supposed to protect the \nconsumer is, in fact, harming them with this guidance. In fact, this \nguidance impacts much more than car buyers. It harms auto dealers, RV \ndealers, motorcycle dealers, international dealers, and even \nmanufacturers.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Congress created the CFPB to protect consumers, not hurt them by \nsilencing the voices of thousands of consumers and small businesses.\n  On August 31 of this year, The Wall Street Journal reported: ``Some \nautomakers have responded by overhauling their loan pricing in ways \nthat will likely mean higher costs for some borrowers.''\n  If the CFPB really cares about developing policies that are truly in \nthe best interest of consumers, they should amend their guidance to be \nmore transparent and allow public participation.\n  Mr. Chairman, my bill is very simple and narrow, and, quite frankly, \nit is common sense. It only asks for five things: public notice and \ncomment; make the data available to the public; consult with the \nFederal Reserve Board, the FTC, and the DOJ; create a consumer impact \nreport; and conduct a study on women- and minority-owned businesses. \nThat is the crux of the bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters of support from the \nNational Automobile Dealers Association, the National Independent \nAutomobile Dealers Association, the Recreation Vehicle Industry \nAssociation, American International Automobile Dealers Association, the \nNational Auto Auction Association, Alliance of Automobile \nManufacturers, the National RV Dealers Association, the Motorcycle \nIndustry Council, American Financial Services Association, New \nHampshire Automobile Dealers Association, and the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Council, the U.S. Chamber, and the U.S. Consumer \nCoalition.\n  I urge my colleagues to join the 166 Members in support of H.R. 1737.\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                                November 17, 2015.\n       To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing the interests of more than three \n     million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as \n     well as state and local chambers and industry associations, \n     and dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending \n     America's free enterprise system, strongly supports H.R. \n     1737, the ``Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance \n     Act,'' and H.R. 1210, the ``Portfolio Lending and Mortgage \n     Access Act.''\n       H.R. 1737 would change the Consumer Financial Protection \n     Bureau's (CFPB) approach to the indirect auto lending market, \n     and bring much-needed transparency. The CFPB has created \n     enormous uncertainty in this market by issuing guidance \n     without notice and comment, and undertaking enforcement and \n     supervisory actions based upon post hoc statistical models--\n     but has failed to share its analysis and assumptions, thus \n     depriving lenders of the ability to anticipate the CFPB's \n     analysis and to comply accordingly. H.R. 1737 would establish \n     clear rules and put any guidance regarding indirect auto \n     lending on a solid footing by eliminating any legal effect of \n     the CFPB's 2013 guidance, and then imposing reasonable \n     conditions on any future guidance on this topic.\n       The Chamber supports H.R. 1210, which would provide \n     regulatory certainty to lenders--particularly small lenders \n     such as community banks and credit unions--by allowing loans \n     held on the books of a lender to be eligible for the safe \n     harbor provided under the Qualified Mortgage (QM) rule. It \n     would also correct the CFPB's ``one-size-fits-all'' approach \n     for the mortgage market. H.R. 1210 would facilitate a robust \n     underwriting process by lenders and would also help qualified \n     borrowers obtain mortgages by alleviating some of the \n     uncertainty that currently exists under the QM rule.\n       Collectively, these bills would provide clear rules and \n     establish certainty in the marketplace benefiting consumers \n     and businesses. The Chamber urges the House of \n     Representatives to pass these bills as expeditiously as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R.

We urge you to vote for this \n     bipartisan legislation when it is acted upon by the full \n     House this week.\n       This important piece of legislation rescinds the \n     problematic guidance issued by the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau (CFPB) on indirect auto financing. The \n     guidance is based on assumptions and analysis the CFPB has \n     not made public. In the end, CFPB's action would prevent \n     consumers from negotiating and selecting a financing method \n     that makes the most sense for them. This guidance would also \n     raise costs. Small firms and self-employed individuals who \n     purchase vehicles to conduct businesses would be impacted by \n     this unnecessary auto-financing rule. To compete and survive, \n     small businesses need flexibility in choosing their best \n     financing arrangement.\n       H.R. 1737 requires that the CFPB be more transparent on \n     future rules or guidance by making those proposed actions \n     available for public review and comment. The CFPB would also \n     be required to study the impact of its actions on consumers.\n       Thank you for your consideration, and for your support of \n     America's entrepreneurs and small business owners.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Motorcycle Industry Council,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, November 17, 2015.\n     Hon. Frank Guinta,\n     House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Guinta: On behalf of the Motorcycle \n     Industry Council (MIC), I write in support of H.R. 1737, the \n     ``Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act.'' This \n     important legislation was voted out of Committee with \n     overwhelming support and currently has 166 cosponsors. We are \n     encouraged that this bipartisan legislative measure will be \n     considered by the full House of Representatives this week and \n     look forward to continuing to work with you as the bill moves \n     through the legislative process and ultimate enactment.\n       The MIC is a not-for-profit national industry association \n     with offices in Irvine, California and metropolitan \n     Washington, D.C. The MIC seeks to support motorcyclists by \n     representing manufacturers, distributors, dealers and \n     retailers of motorcycles, scooters, ATVs, ROVs, motorcycle/\n     ATV/ROV parts, accessories and related goods and services, \n     and members of allied trades such as insurance, finance and \n     others with a commercial interest in the industry.\n       H.R. 1737 is necessary as a result of 2013 Consumer \n     Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) guidance that threatens \n     the ability of dealers to discount the annual percentage rate \n     offered to consumers to finance vehicle purchases. The \n     guidance was issued without adequate public input, \n     consultation with sister agencies or study of the impacts of \n     the guidance on consumers. Your legislation would address \n     these issues by requiring the CFPB to provide notice and a \n     period for public comment; make public any studies, data, and \n     analyses upon which the guidance is based; consult with the \n     Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade Commission and the \n     Department of Justice; and study the cost and impact of the \n     guidance on consumers as well as women-owned, minority-owned, \n     and small businesses.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Duane Taylor,\n     Director, Federal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 18, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: We, the undersigned organizations who \n     represent businesses that make, sell, finance, auction and \n     service motor vehicles are writing to express our strong \n     support for H.R. 1737, the ``Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto \n     Financing Guidance Act.'' This bipartisan bill, introduced by \n     Reps. Guinta (R-NH) and Perlmutter (D-CO), would rescind the \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) flawed 2013 \n     auto finance guidance and allow the CFPB to reissue it under \n     a more transparent and better informed process.\n       H.R. 1737, drafted by members of the House Financial \n     Services Committee on a bipartisan basis, has 166 bipartisan \n     cosponsors. On\n\n[[Page H8300]]\n\n     July 29, the House Financial Services Committee passed H.R. \n     1737 by a vote of 47-10. In addition to rescinding the 2013 \n     guidance, H.R. 1737 would require that, prior to issuing any \n     new guidance related to indirect auto financing, the CFPB:\n       provide notice and a period for public comment;\n       make public any studies, data, and analyses upon which the \n     guidance is based;\n       consult with the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade \n     Commission and the Department of Justice; and\n       study the cost and impact of the guidance on consumers as \n     well as women-owned, minority--owned, and small businesses.\n       This is the entire scope of the bill. By design, H.R. 1737 \n     does not impinge on the CFPB's structure, jurisdiction, or \n     authorities.\n       H.R. 1737 is needed to produce a more informed guidance \n     compared to the 2013 guidance, which lacked public input, \n     transparency, consultation with the CFPB's sister agencies \n     and, by the CFPB's own admission, any study of the impact of \n     the guidance on consumers. As a consequence of being issued \n     without these essential safeguards, the CFPB's guidance could \n     potentially (1) eliminate a dealer's ability to discount \n     credit in the showroom; (2) raise credits costs; and (3) push \n     marginally creditworthy consumers out of the auto credit \n     market entirely.\n       Apart from the fact that guidance should not be used as a \n     means to make sweeping policy and market changes, the CFPB \n     auto guidance does not effectively manage fair credit risk in \n     the showroom, which is its purported goal. The Department of \n     Justice (DOJ), however, has created a better approach to \n     address fair credit risk without decreasing competition and \n     harming consumers. The DOJ model was used as a template for a \n     comprehensive compliance program that the National Automobile \n     Dealers Association, National Association of Minority \n     Automobile Dealers, and American International Automobile \n     Dealers Association issued last year to their respective \n     members. This compliance program addresses fair credit risk \n     where it matters--in the showroom--while preserving a \n     dealer's ability to discount credit.\n       Thirteen Congressional letters signed by over 90 Members \n     and Senators on both sides of the aisle have been written to \n     the CFPB asking questions and expressing concern regarding \n     its auto guidance. Nonetheless, many essential questions \n     still remain unanswered. The open and transparent process \n     required by H.R. 1737 would provide a framework for those \n     questions to be answered, and to ascertain whether the CFPB's \n     new policy can withstand public scrutiny.\n       Since the 1920s, credit has been the lifeblood of America's \n     auto industry. H.R. 1737 is a moderate, bipartisan process \n     bill that does not direct a result or tie the CFPB's hands, \n     but merely gives the public an opportunity to scrutinize and \n     comment on the CFPB's attempt to change the auto loan market \n     via ``guidance.''\n       We respectfully ask you to protect consumers and vote \n     ``yes'' on H.R. 1737. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Peter Welch,\n       President, National Automobile Dealers Association.\n     Chris Stinebert,\n       President and CEO, American Financial Services Association.\n     Steve Jordan,\n       CEO, National Independent Automobile Dealers Association.\n     Cody Lusk, AIADA,\n       President, American International Automobile Dealers \n     Association.\n     Mitch Bainwol,\n       President and CEO, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.\n     Phil Ingrassia,\n       President, The National RV Dealers Association.\n     Frank Hugelmeyer,\n       President, Recreation Vehicle Industry Association.\n     Frank Hackett,\n       CEO, National Auto Auction Association.\n     Tim Buche,\n       President and CEO, Motorcycle Industry Council.\n                                  ____\n\n                                 United States Consumer Coalition.\n     Majority Leader McCarthy,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Majority Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the U.S. Consumer \n     Coalition, I write in support of H.R. 1737, the ``Reforming \n     CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act.'' USCC thanks you \n     for scheduling a House vote on legislation that would rescind \n     flawed guidance from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n     (CFPB) that was designed to eliminate the ability of \n     consumers to access auto financing discounts.\n       USCC would also like to thank Representative Guinta and \n     Chairman Hensarling for prioritizing the needs of American \n     consumers by introducing and shepherding this legislation \n     through Committee.\n       The U.S. Consumer Coalition (USCC) is a grassroots advocacy \n     organization that works to protect consumers' rights to \n     access free-market goods and services, and we believe that \n     all Americans benefit from a thriving free-market economy. \n     Unfortunately, the CFPB is actively engaging in efforts to \n     regulate, restrict, and diminish consumer choice. As an \n     advocate on behalf of America's consumers, defending their \n     right to make decisions for themselves and their families \n     without burdensome government interference, USCC supports \n     H.R. 1737.\n       H.R. 1737 would grant consumers continued access to auto \n     financing discounts that can save them millions of dollars \n     every year. To further protect the rights' of consumers, H.R. \n     1737 would also require more transparency in the CFPB's \n     regulation and rule making process. Specifically, the bill \n     would require the CFPB:\n       Provide a public notice and comment period before issuing \n     any final guidance on indirect auto financing;\n       Make publicly available all information relied on by the \n     CFPB for making such a rule;\n       Consult with other government agencies that share \n     jurisdiction over the indirect auto lending market; and\n       Study the costs and impacts of the guidance to consumers \n     and women-owned, minority-owned, and small businesses.\n       By the CFPB's own admission, the 2013 guidance was made \n     without any study on the impact that it would have on \n     consumers. It is imperative that such studies are done to \n     show the direct, and indirect, impacts that the powerful CFPB \n     can have on the every day lives of the American consumer.\n       USCC supports the reforms that H.R. 1737 seeks to make, as \n     well as any effort to protect consumers' freedom and choice.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Brian Wise,\n     President, USCC.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          New Hampshire Automobile\n\n\n                                    Dealers Association, Inc.,\n\n                                   Concord, NH, November 16, 2015.\n     Hon.

This bipartisan bill \n     was introduced on April 8 by you and Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-\n     CO). H.R. 1737 would rescind the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau's (CFPB) flawed 2013 auto finance guidance \n     and allow the CFPB to reissue it under an open and \n     transparent process.\n       In addition to rescinding the 2013 guidance, H.R. 1737 \n     would require that, prior to issuing any new guidance related \n     to indirect auto financing, the CFPB:\n       provide notice and a period for public comment;\n       make public any studies, data, and analyses upon which the \n     guidance is based;\n       consult with the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade \n     Commission and the Department of Justice; and\n       study the cost and impact of the guidance on consumers as \n     well as women-owned, minority-owned, and small businesses.\n       By design, H.R. 1737 does not impinge on the CFPB's \n     structure, jurisdiction, or authorities.\n       H.R. 1737 is needed to produce a more informed guidance \n     compared to the 2013 guidance, which lacked public input, \n     transparency, consultation with the CFPB's sister agencies \n     and, by the CFPB's own admission, any study of the impact of \n     the guidance on consumers.

This optional compliance program \n     addresses fair credit risk where it matters--in the \n     showroom--while preserving a dealer's ability to discount \n     credit.\n       H.R. 1737 establishes an orderly, transparent process \n     whereby the CFPB can identify the DOJ model as a viable means \n     to address fair credit risk.\n       Since the 1920s, credit has been the lifeblood of America's \n     auto industry. H.R. 1737 is a moderate, bipartisan process \n     bill that does not direct a result or tie the CFPB's hands, \n     but merely gives the public an opportunity to scrutinize and \n     comment on the CFPB's attempt to change the auto loan market \n     via ``guidance.''

I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Al Green), who is the ranking member on the Oversight \nand Investigations Subcommittee.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank President Obama; I thank \nMr. Cordray, who is the head of the CFPB; and I thank the ranking \nmember for taking the position of protecting consumers.\n  Mr. Chairman, we live in a world where it is not enough for things to \nbe right. They must also look right. And here is what doesn't look \nright and, in fact, is not right.\n  It doesn't look right and is not right for a person to go into an \nauto dealership, agree on a price, and then be sent to a finance \ndepartment where this indirect lending takes place. It doesn't look \nright for that person to then be quoted an interest rate and agree to \nthat interest rate, not knowing that the interest rate that the person \nhas agreed to is higher than the one the person qualified for.\n  This is what we are dealing with, consumers not knowing that they are \npaying more for their interest rates than they have qualified for. We \ndealt with this with the yield spread premium, same thing, slightly \ndifferent, in that it dealt with home mortgages, but we outlawed that \nin Dodd-Frank. The CFPB is now trying its very best to make sure all \npeople are treated fairly and equally when they apply for auto loans.\n  It doesn't look right for this to happen, and studies consistently \nshow that minorities, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, are charged \nmore for these loans than others are charged. The empirical evidence is \nthere for those who wish to see it.\n  It is not enough for things to be right; they must also look right. \nThis bill just doesn't look right, and it doesn't smell right, and it \nis not right, and we ought not continue this kind of behavior in this \ncountry.\n  In a righteous world, we would be debating the type of fraud that is \nbeing perpetrated on consumers.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask that people vote their conscience. But I will \ntell you that I am not going to support this kind of procedure that \nmakes it entirely possible for invidious discrimination to continue. I \ncame here to fight invidious discrimination. This is a part of that \nfight.\n  We must not allow this kind of behavior to continue when we have got \na CFPB that is willing to stand up for minorities, we have got a \nPresident who has appointed this man, and we have got a ranking member \nwho is fighting hard to make sure minorities are treated fairly.\n  To this end, I would say, consumers have no greater friend in the \nCongress of the United States of America than the Honorable Maxine \nWaters, who goes to bat every day to make sure that consumers, \nregardless of race, creed, color, national origin, or sexuality, are \ntreated fairly.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Garrett), chairman of the Capital Markets and \nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee of our committee.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, it was just back in 2013, the CFPB, the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, issued something called a \nbulletin.\n  What did it do? It tried to eliminate auto dealer discounts, \nessentially helping consumers, on the grounds that these discounts \ncreate a fair credit risk.\n  Now, there are two major problems with what they did. First, the \nCFPB's actions will actually raise costs, raise credit costs for \nfamilies--these very same families that are having a tough time, as it \nis, in this economy because this is a bad economy right now--and make \nit harder for these family to purchase a car.\n  Secondly, the CFPB's action is expressly prohibited by law from \nregulating auto dealers by the authorizing statute in Dodd-Frank.\n  You see, the CFPB acted behind closed doors, without any transparency \nor input from the general public that they are supposed to be \nprotecting, to circumvent, to go around the law, and found an indirect \nway to alter an industry that the CFPB is prohibited by law from doing.\n  If that is not the very definition of an out-of-control agency, I \ndon't know what it is.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is time that we defend the rule of law in this \ncountry and defend transparent government against these unaccountable \nbureaucrats down the street at the CFPB.\n  That is why I am proud to sponsor the Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto \nFinancing Guidance Act. And by doing so, by repealing their improper, \nunlawful actions and denying the ability to provide dealers discounts, \ndenying the ability to provide them the discounts to the customers, and \nrequiring a transparent process for all future actions, this bill will \npreserve the consumers' ability to get a discounted auto rate and \npreserve the ability to adhere to the principles of open, honest, \ntransparent, lawful government.\n  So I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support H.R. \n1737.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  We must realize that what Mr. Garrett just shared with us is \ncertainly not what the CFPB has done. As a matter of fact, what the \nCFPB has done, it has said: Lender, you cannot say that I will take X \namount of percentage of interest; I will take 5, 10 percent interest; \nand, dealer, you can mark it up another 3, 4, 5 percent.\n  So he has not exactly shared with you what happens with the CFPB.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), a \nmember of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. ELLISON. I want to thank the gentlewoman for the time. The \nranking member has been an outstanding advocate for American consumers, \nand I thank her.\n  I rise today to ask people to vote ``no'' on this piece of \nlegislation and to alert the American people of another attempt to make \nit easier to overcharge you when you make a purchase.\n  Today's threat to Americans' wallets occurs when you try to buy a \ncar. Most people need to take out a loan to buy a car or a truck. They \nfrequently get their financing through an auto dealer.\n  Car buyers don't realize that some dealers can raise the price or the \ninterest rate offered by the partnering bank to make an additional \nprofit.\n  For years, there has been a concern that African Americans and \nLatinos, despite negotiating harder and having good credit scores, pay \na higher interest rate than white car buyers, charging some people 2 or \n2.5 more percent than others, based on skin color.\n  It is also a violation of the law. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act \nprohibits discrimination in the financial marketplace. Lenders who \npartner with auto dealers have a responsibility to ensure that \nborrowers receive fair treatment. That is what the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau is trying to do.\n  The CFPB issued guidance recommending that the auto industry \nestablish flat-rate pricing and some other approach to ensure that they \nare not discriminating against their customers. This makes sense to me \nand would be beneficial to consumers.\n  This bill, on which I urge a ``no,'' nullifies the CFPB's guidance. \nIt requires the bill to jump through a number of hoops that open the \nBureau up to litigation before the CFPB can establish new guidance.\n\n  The National Association of Minority Auto Dealers opposes this bill. \nThey say: ``To date, the recent consent orders between the CFPB, DOJ \nand financial institutions and captive finance companies to settle \ndiscrimination claims have not resulted in any negative outcomes or \nloss of revenue for minority dealers. We are convinced that this matter \nshould and, more importantly, can be resolved with a nonlegislative \nfix.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I say thank you to them.\n  When people are overcharged or treated unfairly in the marketplace, \nit\n\n[[Page H8302]]\n\nharms their ability to build wealth and fully participate in this \neconomy. If you want to do something about income inequality, you must \nsay ``no'' to this bill.\n  Join the National Association of Minority Auto Dealers, the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, the Center for \nResponsible Lending, the Consumers Union, Consumer Action, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, Americans for Financial Reform, American \nAssociation for Justice, ColorOfChange, Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights and Human Rights, the Urban League, and more to vote ``no'' on \nthis legislation.\n  I include in the Record the National Association of Minority \nAutomobile Dealers' letter opposing this legislation and the NAACP's \nletter opposing this legislation.\n  I just want to point out that discrimination in this country has been \nfought long and hard for centuries. Let's not stop now.\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                  Minority Automobile Dealers,\n\n                                     Largo, MD, November 13, 2015.\n     Hon.

Butterfield,\n     RHOB,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Butterfield: The National Association of \n     Minority Automobile Dealers (NAMAD) is not in support of H.R. \n     1737, ``Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance \n     Act'', as we believe this issue can and should be resolved \n     non-legislatively. This legislation does nothing to alter the \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) authority to \n     enforce, or lenders' obligations under the Equal Credit \n     Opportunity Act (Act).\n       We support the CFPB's mission to ensure that consumers are \n     protected and treated fairly. Reversing guidance to lenders \n     at a time of heightened regulatory scrutiny could delay \n     lenders' efforts to comply with the Act.\n       Looking back on the great financial crisis of 2008, \n     legislation enacted to bail out financial institutions and to \n     aid General Motors and Chrysler through bankruptcy was not \n     beneficial for minority dealers. Minority-owned dealers were \n     disproportionally affected with a 40% (400 dealers) decline \n     in its dealer body in comparison to non-minority dealers, who \n     suffered only a 6% decline. Today, out of the 18,000 new \n     automobile dealerships, only 1,100 are minority owned.\n       NAMAD finds that, to date, the recent consent orders \n     between the CFPB, DOJ and financial institutions and captive \n     finance companies to settle discrimination claims have not \n     resulted in any negative outcomes or loss of revenue for \n     minority dealers.\n       We are convinced that this matter should, and more \n     importantly, can be resolved with a non-legislative fix. In \n     particular, NAMAD believes that the Fair Credit Compliance \n     Policy & Program it instituted in 2014 along with NADA and \n     AIADA achieves this goal, as the program is designed to \n     prevent any discriminatory practices for all consumers.\n       We do not support H.R. 1737, as the solution to \n     discrimination in auto lending, but rather urge you and your \n     colleagues to assist us in coming up with and implementing a \n     non-legislative answer.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Damon Lester,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 18, 2015.\n     Re NAACP Strong Opposition to H.R. 1737, The Reforming CFPB \n         Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act.\n     Members,\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Ellison, On behalf of the NAACP, our \n     nation's oldest, largest and most widely-recognized \n     grassroots-based civil rights organization, I strongly urge \n     you to oppose and vote against H.R. 1737, the Reforming CFPB \n     Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act. If enacted, this \n     legislation will allow racial and ethnic minorities to \n     continue to be discriminated against by auto lenders. \n     Discrimination based on race or ethnicity in the financial \n     services or any other arena must be stopped, and this bill \n     goes in the opposite, and wrong, direction.\n       Financial regulators have known for more than 20 years that \n     the full price you may pay for an auto may not be based \n     solely on the make, type, and model of the car; some of the \n     less scrupulous car dealers would offer higher loan rates to \n     people based on the color of their skin, their last name, or \n     what they look like. In the mid-1990's, this trend of \n     discrimination became apparent and a series of lawsuits were \n     filed against the largest auto finance companies in the \n     country. The data from those lawsuits showed that borrowers \n     of color were twice as likely to have their loans marked up, \n     and paid markups twice as large as similarly situated white \n     borrowers with similar credit ratings. Thus, on March 21, \n     2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued \n     a bulletin providing guidance for indirect auto lenders who \n     may fall within the CFPB's jurisdiction on ways to limit fair \n     lending risk under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or ECOA.\n       This CFPB bulletin explained that certain lenders who offer \n     auto loans through dealerships are responsible for any \n     unlawful, discriminatory pricing, which may occur and that \n     they should take actions to eliminate the discrimination. In \n     other words, dealers could continue to mark up loans, and \n     they could continue to be compensated for such mark-ups; \n     simply, they should not discriminatorily mark-up loans based \n     on race. And the financial servicers which underwrote the \n     loans should do what they could to ensure that discrimination \n     based on race or against any other protected class was not \n     perpetuated.\n       The NAACP commends the CFPB on this guidance on indirect \n     auto lending. It is an important step in the Bureau's \n     enforcement of fair lending laws and regulations, and it is \n     clearly within the jurisdiction of the CFPB to ensure that \n     there is not discrimination in lending.\n       The CFPB has authority to examine large banks, and credit \n     unions--and their affiliates--that have assets over $10 \n     billion. The CFPB supervises more than 150 of the nation's \n     largest financial institutions. Furthermore, existing law, \n     ECOA, makes it illegal for a creditor to discriminate in any \n     aspect of a credit transaction on prohibited bases including \n     race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, \n     and age. Under ECOA, and not to mention under the rules of \n     basic fairness and a moral sense of right and wrong, lenders \n     have an obligation to monitor and eradicate discrimination, \n     and to change those practices that lead to the \n     discrimination. In its bulletin, the CFPB reiterated that \n     certain lenders which may offer auto loans through \n     dealerships are liable for unlawful, discriminatory pricing.\n       Racial and ethnic minorities have long been victims of high \n     priced, often-unsustainable, predatory, loans. This is true \n     when we are discussing almost every financial transaction: \n     whether it be a mortgage, an auto loan, or a short-term loan \n     just to make ends meet, including a payday loan. These high \n     cost, predatory, loans have been a staple in our community \n     for decades. Study after study has clearly demonstrated that \n     even when credit history is taken into account, African \n     Americans and Latinos are regularly charged more for home or \n     auto loans than white customers. While dealer markups affect \n     all consumers, research has shown that Latino and African \n     American borrowers are more likely than White borrowers to \n     receive an unnecessary markup in their interest rate, and the \n     markup is typically higher for Latinos and African Americans \n     than Whites, regardless of creditworthiness.\n       H.R. 1737, the Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing \n     Guidance Act'' would undermine the ability of the CFPB to \n     root out discrimination, something that has no place in our \n     lending markets, yet has, unfortunately, been proven to \n     exist. The role of the CFPB is to protect consumers, and with \n     their 2013 guidance, they have done just that. We should be \n     applauding and encouraging the agency's measured, yet \n     affirmative, steps to stop discrimination. Yet H.R. 1737 \n     attacks the Bureau's attempts to protect us.\n       Auto dealers and auto dealer financing agencies who play by \n     the rules and do not discriminate should have no problems \n     with the CFPB guidance. In fact, they should welcome it as it \n     helps clean up an industry which has been tainted by \n     discrimination for too long. An auto is too prevalent, too \n     necessary, and too much of a family investment for us to \n     allow discrimination to exist in the cost of the car.\n       Thank you in advance for your attention to the NAACP \n     position. Should you have any questions or comments on the \n     NAACP position, please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hilary O. Shelton,\n       Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President \n     for Policy and Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Prevent Discrimination in Auto Lending\n\n\n Oppose H.R. 1737: the Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance \n                                  Act\n\n     H.R. 1737 is opposed by the National Association of Minority \n         Auto Dealers, Center for Responsible Lending, NAACP, \n         Consumers Union, Consumer Action, National Council of La \n         Raza, Americans for Financial Reform, American \n         Association for Justice (AAJ), Color of Change, \n         Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, National \n         Consumer Law Center, National Urban League, U.S. PIRG, \n         the Woodstock Institute and more.\n       Dear Colleague: We urge you to oppose H.R. 1737, the so-\n     called ``Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance \n     Act.'' This legislation would prevent the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau (CFPB) from enforcing laws against \n     discrimination in auto lending. This bill nullifies CFPB's \n     guidance to lenders on how to avoid practices that may lead \n     to discriminatory pricing.\n       Automobiles are the most common financial assets owned by \n     American households, and are a prerequisite for many jobs. \n     When people buy cars with dealer financing, they can be \n     charged an interest rate mark up. This mark up can be set by \n     the individual car dealer. Such variable pricing can lead to \n     discrimination. Even though current U.S. law prohibits \n     lending discrimination based on unrelated background traits, \n     African Americans, Latinos and others could be charged a \n     higher interest rate, regardless of credit scores or income.\n       In recent years, the CFPB and the Department of Justice \n     took actions resulting in\n\n[[Page H8303]]\n\n     more than $176 million in fines and restitution to people who \n     paid higher interest rates for auto loans based not on their \n     credit risk but on their ethnicity.\n       There is no reason why the CFPB should not be able to \n     continue to enforce these rules for indirect auto lenders. \n     When people are overcharged, they have less money to spend \n     and invest which slows our economy. We urge members to \n     support, not weaken, the CFPB's effort to fight \n     discrimination in auto lending. Oppose H.R. 1737.\n           Sincerely,\n     Keith Ellison,\n       Co-Chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n     Raul Grijalva,\n       Co-Chair, Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Support Fair Lending, Oppose H.R. 1737\n\n\n Stand with Nearly 70 Civil Rights and Consumer Advocacy Organizations \n                       in Opposition to H.R. 1737\n\n       Dear Colleague: This week, the House will consider H.R. \n     1737, the ``Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Lending Guidance \n     Act.'' This legislation sends a clear message to the CFPB \n     that they should back down from enforcing our fair lending \n     laws against auto lenders. The CFPB has recovered $140 \n     million in fines and penalties against auto lenders for \n     engaging in discriminatory auto lending practices in two \n     years--more than other regulators in the 40 years since the \n     Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) was enacted. Now is not \n     the time to tell the Bureau to back away from their mission \n     in ensuring lending free from discrimination on the basis of \n     race, ethnicity or other protected characteristics or to \n     introduce unnecessary uncertainty to ongoing lender efforts \n     to comply with fair lending laws.\n       Over the course of several investigations, the CFPB has \n     found that auto lenders have failed to appropriately monitor \n     practices that allow African-American, Hispanic, and Asian \n     and Pacific Islander borrowers to be charged more than their \n     white counterparts through undisclosed interest-rate markups. \n     These additional markups are charged without regard to the \n     borrower's credit history and have displayed a clear pattern \n     of discrimination. Several large auto financers have already \n     settled with the CFPB and pledged to reform their practices, \n     while at least seven additional investigations are still \n     ongoing.\n       Dealers should be fairly compensated for their work, but it \n     should not be at minority borrowers' expense. Fair \n     compensation for dealers can co-exist with affordable and \n     equitable access to credit, and the CFPB's approach to date \n     reflects this recognition. Even the CEO of the largest auto \n     retailer in the country, AutoNation's Mike Jackson, has \n     commended the CFPB's approach stating that ``[t]he goal [of \n     the Honda Settlement] is to reduce the variability in loans \n     without hurting the dealer economically . . . [t]h[e] [Honda \n     agreement] is a very viable method of doing both of those \n     things, and I'm saying the industry should look at this as a \n     template for moving forward.''\n       The CFPB is tackling decades of discrimination in the auto \n     lending marketplace, and they have done it in spite of \n     various attempts to undermine their authority to do so \n     directly through familiar attacks on the Bureau's structure \n     and funding and indirectly through proposals like H.R. 1737. \n     This legislation would tie the Bureau's hands at the very \n     time that they are making progress in reining in decades-old \n     practices that have left far too many borrowers overpaying \n     for their auto loans.\n       Supporters of H.R. 1737 contend that the proposal is modest \n     because it is not a direct attack on the Bureau's structure, \n     budget or enforcement authority under ECOA. This is \n     misleading, as it undermines lenders' attempts to comply with \n     ECOA. Lenders have used the guidance H.R. 1737 nullifies for \n     nearly three years to develop compliance policies designed to \n     protect consumers. As the Administration notes in their \n     opposition to H.R. 1737, ``[t]he bill would create confusion \n     about the existing protections in place to prevent \n     discriminatory auto loan pricing, and effectively block [the] \n     CFPB from issuing related guidance in the near-term.''\n       Further, while H.R. 1737 does not expressly prohibit the \n     reissuance of future guidance, the restrictions it places on \n     the Bureau concerning any future guidance ensures that it \n     will be substantially delayed or never reissued. No other \n     agency is required to undergo requirements similar to a \n     rulemaking for simply issuing guidance to regulated entities, \n     and no other type of guidance from the CFPB is subject to \n     these burdensome restrictions except guidance to auto \n     lenders. Indeed, H.R. 1737's supporters have yet to \n     demonstrate why guidance to auto lenders requires that the \n     Bureau jump through so many bureaucratic hoops when the \n     guidance is there to help lenders comply with the law.\n       Contrary to H.R. 1737's supporters' claims that the \n     proposal is necessary to maintain affordable auto financing, \n     the CFPB's oversight of potentially discriminatory lending \n     practices has not led to higher borrower costs or restricted \n     access to credit. Outstanding auto loan balances reached $1 \n     trillion dollars in the second quarter of 2015--the first \n     time in U.S. history. Industry experts predict that the \n     number of vehicles sold in 2015 will exceed 17 million for \n     the first time since 2001. The National Association of \n     Minority Auto Dealers have confirmed this, noting in their \n     opposition to H.R. 1737 that the CFPB's activity, ``ha[s] not \n     resulted in any negative outcomes or loss of revenue'' for \n     their member dealers. There is simply no evidence that the \n     Bureau's oversight has caused prices to increase or led to \n     fewer borrowers being able to get financing.\n       Make no mistake, H.R. 1737 leaves consumers more vulnerable \n     to unfair or discriminatory business practices. This is why \n     the Administration, the nation's minority auto dealers, the \n     largest auto dealer in the country, and nearly 70 civil \n     rights organizations and consumer advocacy groups oppose H.R. \n     1737--it does nothing to move the ball forward on the \n     important work of eliminating potentially discriminatory \n     lending practices.\n       The people best positioned to address discriminatory \n     lending practices are the lenders themselves, and H.R. 1737 \n     denies lenders vital information they need to ensure that \n     they are not underwriting loans that contain potentially \n     discriminatory interest rate markups that harm borrowers.\n       For the foregoing reasons I would urge a NO vote on H.R. \n     1737.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Maxine Waters.\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say \nthat the exact same group the gentleman quoted, the National \nAssociation of Minority Auto Dealers, says in their letter: ``This \nlegislation does nothing to alter the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau's authority to enforce, or lenders' obligations under the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act.''\n  Again, that is a red herring.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n  Ignoring this simple wisdom, the CFPB issued a guidance bulletin, \nwithout public notice and comment, threatening to eliminate a car \ndealer's ability to discount interest rates for their customers.\n  This so-called guidance was offered with no study of the impact on \nconsumers or small businesses, and it was issued with no proof that \ncurrent industry standard discount practices were harming consumers.\n  Let me repeat. Despite the rhetoric, the guidance was issued with no \nevidence of any discrimination.\n  This much is clear: the regulatory burden imposed by this guidance \nwill be bad for car dealers because it eliminates a car dealer's \nability to provide lower interest rates for their customers, and it is \nbad for consumers because they will inevitably pay more.\n  H.R. 1737 is commonsense legislation that stops the CFPB's solution \nin search of a problem. It nullifies the CFPB's current guidance \nbulletin restricting discounts on auto loan interest rates, and it \nrequires the CFPB to allow for public notice and comment before any \nfurther restrictions can be imposed.\n  It also requires a study of the costs and impacts of interest rate \ndeductions on consumers.\n  It is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman and Members, this \nbusiness about consumers not being able to negotiate down, that somehow \nthe car dealers can't give a discount is absolutely not true, \nabsolutely not true.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), the \nranking member on the Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Ms. MOORE. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, I do rise to oppose H.R. 1737. I have listened very \ncarefully to my colleagues, and I am very sympathetic and empathetic to \ntheir desire to help their auto dealers. Too bad this legislation \ndoesn't do that.\n  I also agree with the proponents of this bill that the CFPB can't \ndirectly regulate auto dealers, and I don't think the CFPB wants to \nregulate auto dealers.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  The problem with this bill is that it doesn't help auto dealers, and \nit is not a response to CFPB regulatory overreach. What the CFPB does \nhave jurisdiction over is the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\n  A few years ago, the Bureau noticed a funny thing: that minorities \nwere paying higher markups on auto loans, even when you control for \ncredit risk and other factors, discounts. They noticed if you were \nJesus Rodriguez or Barack Obama Jones that somehow you paid a higher \nprice for the car.\n\n[[Page H8304]]\n\n  Now, the problem is that this legislation attempts to free the auto \ndealers from discrimination. Of course, discrimination is a violation \nof the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The CFPB and the Department of \nJustice brought actions against these lenders for violations of ECOA.\n  We heard from the other side that there was no evidence that these \ncar dealers had done anything wrong. No, because it didn't go to court. \nThat is why there was no evidence. It went to settlement, and they \nsettled for $140 million.\n  Pretty simple, the CFPB protected borrowers from discrimination and \nthen put out helpful guidance.\n  So why are we here today, Mr. Chairman? We are here considering this \nlegislation so that auto dealers can violate the ECOA.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Stutzman).\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his yielding and \nhis work on this issue. I also thank Mr. Guinta for bringing this bill \nforward.\n  Mr. Chairman, ever since the CFPB introduced its 2013 bulletin on \nindirect auto lending, the need for this legislation has been clear.\n  First, the CFPB issued its bulletin in order to get around the \nrulemaking process for indirect auto lending. This kind of guidance is \ntraditionally used as a mere restatement of law or to provide further \nexplanation of rulemaking. It is not traditionally used to make a major \npolicy like fundamentally altering the auto loan market.\n  Second, it is clear that the CFPB is unwilling to publish online all \nof the data and assumptions it has relied upon for this guidance. \nProviding these details should be an obvious and easy step to implement \nfor any credible government agency.\n  Unfortunately, because the CFPB is not subject to the appropriations \nprocess, they seem unwilling to comply with even the most commonsense \noversight by Congress. Therefore, H.R. 1737 is necessary to require the \nCFPB to provide for a notice and comment period before it can reissue \nany related guidance.\n  Mr. Chairman, this compromise legislation represents fair and \nreasonable adjustments to the CFPB's regulatory guidance process \nintended to promote transparency and accountability for regulators. \nThis legislation is truly a bipartisan effort that was supported in \ncommittee by 13 Members on the minority side of the aisle.\n  I am also glad to see widespread support for this legislation from a \nrange of groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAutomobile Dealers Association, the national RV Dealers Association, \nthe Independent Community Bankers Association, and the Credit Union \nNational Association.\n  Mr. Chairman, last year I was proud to introduce legislation similar \nto Mr. Guinta's after hearing from so many auto dealers in my State the \nfrustrations they had with this particular rule. I am proud to support \nthis legislation, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto help us promote greater transparency and accountability and bring \ncommon sense back to the marketplace.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, what Mr. Stutzman is \ndoing is trying to confuse people between a rule and a guidance. This \nis a guidance, and they are trying, through this legislation, to make \nguidance comply with the same kind of rules that the rules have to go \nthrough. So don't pay any attention to that. He is just trying to \nconfuse people.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. \nVelazquez), a member of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. \n1737.\n  Mr. Chairman, this legislation is yet another attempt to obstruct the \nmost important watchdog working on behalf of U.S. consumers, the CFPB.\n  Since its creation, the agency has returned over $11 billion to more \nthan 25 million consumers harmed by unfair and deceptive practices. Its \nwork is absolutely essential for everyday Americans, giving them the \nsecurity of knowing that there is someone on their side.\n  One area where the CFPB's role is increasingly important is auto \nfinance, where outstanding car and truck loan balances now reach $1 \ntrillion, the highest in history.\n  Unfortunately, discrimination is still alive and well in the indirect \nauto lending marketplace. In the three settlements to date against Ally \nFinancial, Fifth Third Bank, and Honda, the CFPB secured nearly $140 \nmillion in borrower relief and penalties. It found that minority \nborrowers paid $200 more over the life of a car loan than White \nborrowers, even when controlling for borrowers' creditworthiness.\n  The CFPB's findings are consistent with decades of litigation and \nresearch that confirm that discretionary markups in indirect auto \nlending cause millions of dollars in overpayments from minority \nborrowers. To further their work in this area, the CFPB issued specific \nguidance regarding auto lending practices.\n  Unfortunately, H.R. 1737 will repeal this guidance and place absurd \nrestrictions on the reissuance of any new guidance. These new \nrestrictions would be unique to the CFPB and would place an \nunprecedented burden on the agency's issuance of guidance designed to \nhelp lenders comply with Federal fair lending laws. This undermines the \nbasic role of the CFPB and will create uncertainty regarding the \napplication of Federal lending laws in the auto finance sector.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). The time of the gentlewoman \nhas expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield the \ngentlewoman from New York an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Doing so is a raw deal for car buyers, especially \nminorities, who continue to fall victim to deceptive and unfair \npractices.\n  Let's let the CFPB do what it is supposed to do--protect the millions \nof consumers that will buy cars this year--and reject H.R. 1737. I urge \na ``no'' vote on this misguided legislation.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, might I inquire how much time is \nremaining on each side.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 15 minutes remaining. \nThe gentlewoman from California has 13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hinojosa), my Democratic colleague.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1737, the \nReforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act.\n  I am proud to say that in my 19 years in Congress, I have been a \nchampion of the consumer and have fought for their protection. As a \nmember of the Financial Services Committee, I strongly supported the \ncreation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and continue to be \na strident defender and proponent of CFPB.\n  I support this bill to correct the CFPB's guidance with respect to \nindirect auto lending, which would increase the cost of consumer \nfinancing. In our effort to find discrimination in the marketplace, we \nmust be careful not to push for policy solutions that hurt the very \nconsumers we are trying to protect.\n  This bill does not prevent nor hinder the CFPB or any agency from \nenforcing fair lending laws. Rather, it provides an opportunity to \nreissue the guidance in a more inclusive and transparent manner.\n  As part of our mission to protect consumers, I urge the CFPB to work \nclosely with stakeholders to improve the guidance in this important \narea. I also encourage the Bureau to develop and implement a financial \nliteracy program aimed at teaching consumers the skills necessary to \nmake informed financial decisions regarding the purchase of an auto \nthrough the use of financing. We need to do everything we can to ensure \nAmericans have the basic financial literacy skills to enable them to \nnavigate our increasingly complex financial system and make good, \ninformed decisions.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Will the gentleman from Texas yield?\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. I yield to the gentleman from New Hampshire so that he \nmay express support for financial literacy and offer to work with us to \nencourage the Bureau to develop a financial literacy program aimed at \nauto financing.\n\n[[Page H8305]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GUINTA. I would like to reiterate that the CFPB has the authority \nand the tools to increase financial literacy skills to consumers. I \nwould be more than happy to work with the gentleman personally to make \nsure that they better educate consumers when they are purchasing a car. \nThat is something that is important and critical. I value the interest \nthat the gentleman has on this component of the bill, and I plan to \nwork with the gentleman.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. I thank the gentleman. I gladly accept his offer, and I \nlook forward to working together to promote financial literacy, \nespecially with respect to auto financing.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1737.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman and Members, this is \nnot about financial literacy. This is about raw discrimination.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the \nranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He is \na real fighter for freedom and justice.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and \nI thank the gentlewoman for her strong leadership.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose H.R. 1737. If this bill is \nenacted, it will cost minority auto purchasers millions of dollars.\n  Car purchases are extremely complicated transactions. Most Americans \nmake only a few in a lifetime, and they are not familiar with the many \ndetailed terms and procedures of these transactions. One thing that is \nnot complicated is that charging a markup just because a buyer is a \nminority is simply illegal.\n  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau protects minority purchasers \nagainst auto dealers that seek to charge abusive and predatory markups. \nThe purpose of the bill before us today is to eliminate this \nprotection--that is exactly what it is--leaving minority consumers at \nrisk of being charged abusive and predatory interest rates.\n  In 2013, the CFPB ordered Ally Bank to pay $80 million in damages and \n$18 million in penalties for imposing higher interest rates on 235,000 \nminority borrowers. Just this year, the Bureau ordered Fifth Third Bank \nto pay $18 million in damages for permitting markups of as much as 2.5 \npercent for minorities.\n  Because this bill would prevent the CFPB from carrying out its duty \nto protect minority borrowers, the administration has announced they \nwould veto this bill.\n  This House should reject H.R. 1737 and every repeated effort to \nundermine--and that is exactly what it is, to undermine--the CFPB.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. David Scott), my Democratic colleague.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I \nwant to take a moment to point out why I am supporting this and am a \ncosponsor of this bill.\n  First of all, to our leader, the ranking member who does an excellent \njob, she is absolutely right. We must go at discrimination with \nlenders. But, Mr. Chairman, the unintended consequence of this is not \npunishing the lenders who may or may not be doing discrimination. If we \nshow it, they should. Unfortunately, this guidance goes directly at \ndealers and low- and moderate-income customers, African Americans and \nother minorities who will be denied, because it takes away the dealers' \nability to discount interest rates and be flexible.\n  Now, Mr. Chairman, there are 55 million unbanked and underbanked \npeople in the United States. They don't have the bank. They are not \ngoing to Ally Bank.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  But when they want, they have to buy a car. Some of them don't even \nhave a credit card, but they have that dealer that can walk through the \ndoor. And if that dealer has the flexibility to be able to discount the \ninterest rate, bringing a lower price to the car, they shouldn't be \ndenied from having that opportunity to do it.\n  Now, let me go to the racial issue. When you play the race card, you \nhave got to make sure you play it right. That is all I am saying.\n  When we looked at the CFPB and we looked at the methodology that they \nused to determine who the Black people were, they said: Hey, the best \nway of doing this is to go by the last names: Jackson, Williams, \nJohnson, Robinson.\n  Yeah. A lot of Black people are named that, but there are an awful \nlot of White people that are named that, too.\n  So is there any wonder, when the checks went out, that there were \nsome happy White people, looking: Where did I get this money? Where did \nI get this $200 or $300 from?\n  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I take a backseat to nobody when it comes \nto standing up and fighting for racial equality. My life's story is \nthat. I integrated the school systems in Scarsdale, New York, where not \nonly was I just the only Black kid in the school or in my class, but I \nwas the only Black kid in the whole city of Scarsdale.\n  My office mate in the Senate was Julian Bond. We went all across this \ncountry speaking for 40 years as a State representative, as a State \nsenator, and now as a Congressman. My whole life has been for fighting \nthis.\n  But when you deal with racial discrimination, it has got to be right. \nThe methodology that the CFPB used is flawed. It is absolutely flawed. \nIn the process, the CFPB itself is being charged with racial \ndiscrimination.\n  Now, all I am saying is what is fair is fair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield the gentleman from Georgia an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. We are not asking to discontinue this. We \nare asking to go after where the discrimination is. But don't hurt the \nlower middle-income people who don't have the credit or don't have a \ncredit card.\n  They have to go in there and work with that dealer. If you take that \nout of the way of the dealer, you are hurting the very people that some \nof the people who are opposing our bill want to help.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, let's get clarity here. Let's get truth here. All \nwe are doing is asking the CFPB to come back, start over, get the right \nmethodology, so you are getting the right people that you are sending \nthe checks to, and also call in the Justice Department, the Federal \nTrade Commission, and the Federal Reserve, who are the ones under Dodd-\nFrank that regulate the auto dealers and not auto lenders.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, all of the arguments that are used by the \nother side simply are not true.\n  They claim that the CFPB does not have the authority. They do have \nthe authority under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\n  They claim that they didn't use the right methodologies, the same \nthat is used by the Justice Department.\n  They claim that the dealers can't give discounts. That is absolutely \nnot true. They can.\n  I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York \n(Mr. Jeffries), a young man that has been leading an effort on the \nfloor of Congress for justice for minorities and women consistently.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman \nfrom California for yielding and for her leadership.\n  Let's be clear. The opponents of this legislation are not playing the \nrace card. America for centuries has played the race card--slavery, Jim \nCrow, lynchings, the Black Codes, institutional racism, unconscious \nbias--that continues to this day.\n  Yes. Of course we have come a long way in the United States of \nAmerica, but we still have a long way to go. Everyone should have \nrecognized the fact a few months ago when those souls were killed in \nCharleston, South Carolina, that racism in many corridors in this \ncountry is still functional, in existence, and poisoning our society.\n  So when we take a situation where African American consumers are \npaying higher interest rates for the same financial product when \ncontrolling for creditworthiness put in the context of history in this \ncountry, we are concerned.\n  All we are simply saying is that, if we really believe in a country \nwhere\n\n[[Page H8306]]\n\neveryone, regardless of color, has the opportunity to robustly pursue \nthe American Dream, we need a level playing field. We need rules of \nengagement that apply to everyone, regardless of the color of their \nskin. We need equal opportunity.\n  That doesn't exist right now in the automobile lending context. That \nis why I urge a ``no'' vote against this legislation. Let the CFPB do \nits work.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Williams), one of the outstanding workers for H.R. 1737.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, in full disclosure, my name is Williams, \nas Mr. David Scott had said. I am also an auto dealer, but my \ncolleagues here in the House already know that. It is not something I \nam ashamed of. In fact, it is something I am very proud of.\n  But Mr. Guinta's bill isn't just about auto dealers. It is about an \nagency that continues to act not in the best interest of the consumer, \nbut bigger government.\n  Well, Mr. Chairman, I am here this afternoon to give you a little \nperspective on that. As many small-business owners can tell you, the \nfinancial crisis of 2008 was the worst they had ever seen. Millions of \nAmericans and thousands of small-business owners never recovered.\n  In response, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which, in turn, \ncreated the CFPB. The CFPB was given broad jurisdiction over the \nfinancial services sector: banks, insurance companies, mortgage \nlenders, credit card companies, payday lenders. The list goes on and on \nand on.\n  Dodd-Frank consisted of 2,300 pages of new laws and regulations. Mr. \nChairman, I want to take a second and read from one of the sections of \nDodd-Frank that has particular importance to us today. Section 1029 \nsays:\n  The Bureau may not exercise any rulemaking, supervisory enforcement \nor any authority, including any authority to order assessment, over a \nmotor vehicle dealer that is predominantly engaged in the sale and \nservicing of motor vehicles, the leasing and servicing of motor \nvehicles, or both.\n  So how did we get here today? In 2013, the CFPB didn't propose a new \nrule or a new regulation. In fact, they didn't seek comments from \nindustry, consumers, or even Congress. But, instead, they offered \nguidance.\n  Since releasing this guidance in 2013, the CFPB has acknowledged that \nthey did not analyze or estimate the economic impact it would have on \ncustomers. In addition, an independent study commissioned by the \nAmerican Financial Services Association found several significant flaws \nin the Bureau's methodology, which led to inaccurate, incomplete, and \nunreliable conclusions about pricing disparities in the auto finance \nmarket.\n\n  In addition, recent settlements from the CFPB and lenders have \nhighlighted the Bureau's strong-arm tactics and inability to prevent \nfraudulent claims. At a hearing a few months ago, the Committee on \nFinancial Services heard testimony about the lack of oversight \nimplemented by the CFPB when paying claims to those who were \npotentially discriminated against.\n  Mr. Chairman, what most don't understand is that auto dealers--I \nrepeat--auto dealers--are driven by competition. We are driven by \nprotecting our reputation, providing service to our customers, and \nserving our communities.\n  When the CFPB issues fines on auto lenders for alleged discriminatory \npractices, they don't punish the dealers. They punish the consumer, the \nvery people they are trying to supposedly protect, just as most \ngovernment involvement does.\n  Mr. Guinta's bill would finally bring transparency and clarification \nto a process that has had neither.\n  Mr. Chairman, I know Director Cordray and all those at the CFPB think \nthey can control my industry by controlling the lenders we do business \nwith. But let's not lose sight on what the law says.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 1737. Let your conscience be your guide.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), a former insurance \ncommissioner of California who has dealt with a lot of these issues.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman.\n  My colleague from California has raised a very significant issue \nhere. It kind of helps to actually read the guidelines.\n  I have spent 8 years of my life as a regulator trying to protect the \nconsumers from unfair practices in the insurance industry, some of \nwhich dealt with the issue of credit.\n  What we have here is an effort by the CFPB to give guidance--not a \nlaw, not a regulation, but guidance--to auto dealers and to indirect \nlenders on what they should do--not must do, but what they should do--\nto obey the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which the CFPB actually does \nhave the power to enforce.\n  By extension, an indirect lender stands in the place of an auto \ndealer in developing the terms of credit. That then makes the indirect \nlender subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\n  It is pretty simple here. This is guidance about how you could \nmonitor what you should do as a dealer or as an indirect lender in \nobeying the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\n  It is pretty simple. And when you don't do it, there are outlines \nabout what you should do to deal with any problem that is found.\n  I am going: What is the problem here? The problem here is obeying the \nlaw as an indirect lender where you actually have the power to direct \nand to determine what the loan is.\n  Now, my history in regulating the insurance industry is that there is \na pernicious and continuing discrimination that takes place, not \nnecessarily Black, not necessarily Hispanic, but it exists in the \npoorer communities and keeps those communities down because they wind \nup paying a whole lot more for insurance, for credit, and for other \neconomic policies. Pretty simple.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield the gentleman an additional \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Let me wrap up very quickly, then.\n  This is about being fair in the practices of lending. I understand \nthe auto dealers and the indirect lenders would rather not, but there \nis a history here, as has been stated in the debate, of where lenders \nhave been found to be out of compliance with the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act.\n  So what we are trying to do here with this opposition to this bill is \nsaying to follow the guidance, follow the guidance and stay out of \ntrouble. Pretty simple.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my colleague from \nNew Hampshire on his bipartisan bill to reform and assist our Nation's \nauto dealers and consumers and increase the oversight and transparency \nof the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  Dodd-Frank explicitly prohibited the CFPB from regulating auto \ndealers, but their guidance on indirect auto lending is an end around \nto indeed do just that, regulate auto dealer sales.\n  Not only is the CFPB's guidance inherently flawed, but the agency has \nnot provided the opportunity for public comment or input, nor have they \nshared any of their analysis or assumptions on which they based their \nmodel.\n  This guidance is another example of emerging government price \nregulation and fee setting in the financial services industry. We have \nalways, as a part of our financial regulation, tried not to set price \nby regulatory directive. Instead, we have operated on a consumer \ndisclosure and consumer education model.\n  But price regulation is clearly what this guidance does. It is softer \nand more delicate in its language, but it clearly is leading towards \nprice regulation.\n  Consumer lending in banking is down among community banks. It has \nbeen cut in half over the past few years. One reason for that, one key \nreason for that, is the inability of a consumer bank to price for risk.\n  Today's legislation is not about discrimination. It is about giving \naccess to credit to people who need it and giving access to credit to \nthem in the right way, particularly those families with limited \nresources.\n  This bill in no way ties CFPB's hands. It merely gives the public an \nopportunity to comment on the Bureau's\n\n[[Page H8307]]\n\nattempt to reshape the auto loan market.\n  Whether it is in a rural area or an urban area, this pernicious \nexpansion of price regulation in financial services by the Federal \nGovernment will have a negative effect on credit allocation in our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Independent \nCommunity Bankers of America.\n\n                                             Independent Community\n\n\n                                           Bankers of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Maxine Waters,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: On \n     behalf of the more than 6,000 community banks represented by \n     ICBA, I write to thank you for scheduling a markup for July \n     28 on important regulatory reform bills. We are particularly \n     pleased that a number of the bills scheduled for markup \n     reflect community bank regulatory relief advanced in ICBA's \n     Plan for Prosperity. We strongly encourage all committee \n     members to vote YES on the bills noted below:\n       The Financial Institution Customer Protection Act (H.R. \n     766). Sponsored by Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, H.R. 766 is \n     designed to curtail the abuses of Operation Choke Point. The \n     bill would prohibit the federal banking agencies from \n     suggesting, requesting, or ordering a bank to terminate a \n     customer relationship unless the regulator put the order in \n     writing and specified a material reason for the action, among \n     other provisions.\n       The Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act (H.R. 1210). \n     Sponsored by Rep. Andy Barr, H.R. 1210 would provide that any \n     residential mortgage held in portfolio by the originator is a \n     ``qualified mortgage'' for the purposes of the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Bureau's ``ability to repay'' rule. H.R. \n     1210 will help preserve access to credit for customers of \n     community banks and other lenders.\n       The Small Bank Exam Cycle Reform Act of 2015 (H.R. 1553). \n     Sponsored by Rep. Scott Tipton, H.R. 1553 would allow a \n     highly rated community bank with assets of less than $1 \n     billion to use an 18 month exam cycle. ICBA supports a 24 \n     month exam cycle for highly rated community banks. Because \n     examiners have more than sufficient information to monitor a \n     community bank from offsite, we believe that this change \n     would not compromise supervision, and would actually increase \n     safety and soundness by allowing examiners to focus their \n     limited resources on the true sources of risk.\n       The Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act \n     (H.R. 1737). Sponsored by Rep. Frank Guinta, H.R. 1737 would \n     effectively nullify the CFPB's guidance on indirect auto \n     lending. In proposing and issuing guidance primarily related \n     to indirect auto financing, the CFPB would be required to \n     provide for a public notice and comment period, make \n     available all studies, data, and other information on which \n     the guidance is based, and meet other requirements intended \n     to ensure the process is open, transparent, and responsive to \n     public input. The CFPB would also be required to consult with \n     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the \n     Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Justice. ICBA \n     suggests strengthening H.R. 1737 by requiring the CFPB to \n     also consult with the Federal banking regulators, the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the \n     Comptroller of the Currency.\n       Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act \n     (H.R. 1941). Sponsored by Reps. Lynn Westmoreland and Carolyn \n     Maloney, H.R. 1941 would go a long way toward improving the \n     oppressive examination environment that many community banks \n     experience during and following an economic downturn.\n       Among other other provisions, H.R. 1941 would create an \n     Office of Independent Examination Review within the Federal \n     Financial Institutions Examination Council and give financial \n     institutions a right to an expedited, independent review of \n     an adverse examination determination before the Office's \n     Director or before an independent administrative law judge.\n       ICBA also supports the provisions of H.R. 1941 that would \n     create more consistent and commonsense criteria for loan \n     classifications and capital determinations. Establishing \n     conservative, bright-line criteria will allow lenders to \n     modify loans, as appropriate, without fear of being \n     penalized. If these standards become law, they will give \n     bankers the flexibility to work with struggling but viable \n     borrowers and help them maintain the capital they need to \n     support their communities.\n       The Homebuyers Assistance Act (H.R. 3192). Sponsored by \n     Rep. French Hill, H.R. 3192 would provide a critical safe \n     harbor from enforcement actions for compliance errors arising \n     from the implementation of the Consumer Financial Protection \n     Bureau's Truth in Lending Act/Real Estate Settlement \n     Procedures Act Integrated Disclosures, provided the lender \n     has acted in good faith to implement and comply with new \n     regulations. Without this safe harbor, consumer mortgage \n     closings are likely to be delayed due to the enormous \n     complexity of the new rules and fear of excessive enforcement \n     actions for minor errors.\n       Taken together, the bills noted above would provide \n     significant regulatory relief for community banks to the \n     benefit of the customers and communities they serve. We will \n     continue to press lawmakers to enact these sensible \n     regulatory relief measures into law.\n       Thank you again for bringing these bills before the \n     committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Camden R. Fine,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), a true champion for \nconsumers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose H.R. 1737.\n  The title of this legislation, the Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto \nFinancing Guidance Act, is misleading. The legislation is not about \n``reforming'' the guidance of the CFPB. It is about erasing and \nundermining CFPB's guidance altogether and suspending the Bureau's good \nwork when it comes to monitoring and identifying discrimination in auto \nlending. Both the CFPB and the Department of Justice have found \nrepeatedly that dealer discretion in determining the interest rates on \nauto loans leads to systemic discrimination against minority borrowers.\n  Supporters have argued that this legislation would bring clarity and \ntransparency to the auto loan market, but we must ask ourselves: \nClarity and transparency for whom? It sure doesn't bring transparency \nfor the American public when it comes to auto dealers who have been \nfound to have been targeting minority communities with discretionary \ninterest rate markups, increasing the carrying costs of car ownership \nfor individuals who too often cannot afford the increased financial \nburden.\n  Of course, not all auto dealers engage in such practices, and we must \nbe careful in painting with a broad brush. In fact, I believe the \nCFPB's guidance is a useful tool to protect the reputation of auto \ndealers who do the right thing by their customers--many of whom are \nleaders in their communities--against the predatory practices of a \nselect few who tarnish the industry.\n  We should have clarity and transparency--clarity and transparency in \nhow interest rates are determined so as to prevent discriminatory \nlending practices--but let the CFPB do its job, the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau.\n  Wall Street, the lenders, the mortgage companies, the big banks blew \nup our economy in 2009. They were exploiting a lot of consumers across \nthe country. We set up the CFPB to protect financial consumers across \nthe country. Let the CFPB do the job that it was given, which it is \ndoing very well.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 1737 and support the CFPB's \nongoing work on behalf of American consumers.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining on both sides.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, and the gentlewoman from California has 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I stand in strong support of H.R. 1737, and I will tell \nyou why. It is because it is what I have done and what my family has \ndone for almost 60 years. We are a third-generation automobile dealer.\n  I can tell you that it is a people business, not a White person \nbusiness, not a Black person business, not a Brown person business, not \na Red person business, or a Yellow person business. It is a business \nthat is done face-to-face. I have sat across the desk from many people, \nlower income people, who cannot afford to get a car because they don't \nhave the ability to negotiate the auto loan.\n  It is our business, and I am stunned by people who have never done \nwhat we have done who have somehow decided that we are racist and that \nwe are overcharging people. We are doing exactly the opposite, and you \nare doing exactly the opposite. You are discriminating against the very \npeople who need our help to buy cars. We negotiate the deal\n\n[[Page H8308]]\n\nfor them. We negotiate the cost down. So to stand here today and think \nthat somehow this is racist--if I were a person of color, I would be \noffended that you would even begin to suggest that I do not understand \nhow to negotiate and that I do not understand who to trust and who not \nto trust.\n  Three generations of Kellys have sold over 150,000 cars. You don't do \nthat by cheating people. You don't do that by being a racist. You don't \ndo that by discriminating against people. You do that by working with \npeople. It is stunning in this House--America's House--that we would \nreduce this down to an issue of color and not of cooperation. The \nability to get these people transportation--private transportation--\nfalls on the shoulders of those who are the dealers. We negotiate in \ntheir best interest.\n  How stunning to think that somehow we are these predators who are \njust taking advantage of these poor people who don't have any financial \nliteracy. That, my friends, ultimately, is the biggest insult you could \ngive people of color or people of gender. It is absolutely incredible \nto me that we would bring it to this issue.\n  If you don't understand our business, please learn about it. I don't \nhave to have a book of talking points in order to talk about what we \nhave done our whole life.\n  I stand in strong support of H.R. 1737 and in strong support of \ncommon sense and the American way.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the \nChair.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman and Members, no one on \nthis side of the aisle mentioned the word ``racist.'' It is only coming \nout of the mouths of the people on the opposite side of the aisle.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), a \nmember of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank the gentlewoman from California, my ranking \nmember. I appreciate the emotionally charged conversation that we are \nhaving here on the House floor today.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1737.\n  In the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, there \nare two basic principles among the others that are noted. One is that \nno one shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due \nprocess of law. The other one is that no one shall be denied equal \nprotection under the laws of the United States of America.\n  We have kind of a collision of these two principles today. One is \nthat there is the potential for the disparate treatment of people--\ndiscrimination--which all of us abhor and that we want to see rooted \nout by root and branch. The other is that, before you do a major policy \nin this country, there is always notice and an opportunity to be heard. \nThat is where the collision comes in today.\n  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a bulletin without, \nreally, notice and an opportunity to be heard to determine whether or \nnot there was disparate treatment or whether methodologies that \nindicate there is are accurate. In fact, what we have seen is, 4 out of \n10 times, it can be inaccurate based on this bulletin.\n  So H.R. 1737, with as much emotion as it has raised, asks the CFPB to \ngo back and check what they have done. At no time is there any \nlimitation to CFPB's or to the Department of Justice's rights under the \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act to go after discriminating individuals, to \ngo after bad actors.\n  I would suggest to the CFPB that, while they are looking at their \nbulletin again, if they see evidence of discrimination, they refer it \nto the Justice Department and that it be condemned loudly and roundly.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, this discussion today has been about \ndiscrimination. This discussion today is about the very powerful \nautomobile dealers who come to the Congress of the United States and \nuse their considerable influence to get the Members of Congress to get \nrid of a guidance that was put together by the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau.\n  They don't want the guidance because they don't want to be guided in \nhow not to discriminate. They have gotten away for years with markups, \nand they have gotten away for years with targeting certain communities. \nFor those who say that this has not happened, you are absolutely wrong. \nMinority communities, poor communities are targeted by every scheme and \nevery fraudulent operation that you can think of.\n  Whether we are talking about this markup that causes minorities to \npay more for automobiles or payday loans or whether we are talking \nabout these private, postsecondary rip-off schools, communities of \ncolor are not only targeted in these ways, but we discovered in the \n2008 subprime meltdown that communities have been targeted and that \nminorities who have the same credit ratings as others who are given \nloans--minorities who pay their bills--were charged more in interest \nrates for their mortgages than others.\n  This is not something that we are making up. The people on the \nopposite side of the aisle will have you believe they are working in \nthe best interest of these minorities who continue to be ripped off. I \ndon't have to say much, if anything, to prove that that is not true. \nJust take a look at who is supporting them. We are supported by the \nNAACP, the National Council of La Raza, the National Association of \nMinority Auto Dealers, the Center for Responsible Lending, the National \nConsumer Law Center, the Center for Working Families, the Consumers \nUnion. There are 67 consumer organizations who are sick and tired of \nseeing minorities being ripped off.\n  We are often counseled by those who say we are not pulling ourselves \nup by our bootstraps, that we are not doing enough. Why do you think a \nwealth gap exists? It exists because these fraudulent schemes are \nsupported by people like those on the other side of the aisle.\n  I urge everyone in Congress to vote ``no'' on this discriminatory \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  It is fascinating to me how often the ranking member talks about \ndiscrimination, but she didn't seem to talk about the discrimination \ncoming out of the CFPB. She knows good and well, Mr. Chairman, that we \nhave had witness after witness not come up with junk science about some \ndisparate impact methodology that is proven wrong, but we have had \nactual witnesses come and talk about discrimination at the CFPB, which, \napparently, the other side is now holding up as a paragon of virtue to \nenforce our civil rights laws.\n  We have had the inspector general come and say, at the CFPB, \nminorities are underrepresented in upper pay bands. The inspector \ngeneral says minority applicants are not hired in proportion to \nqualifications. The inspector general says minority employees receive \nlower performance ratings. We have had one division of the CFPB that \nemployees refer to as the ``plantation.'' This is in the 21st century? \nNow the ranking member wants to hold up the CFPB as some paragon of \nvirtue because they use junk science--a methodology they admit \nthemselves overrepresents minority populations?\n  This is about due process, Mr. Chairman, due process for every \nAmerican. We can't have some rogue agency putting out guidance and not \nallowing any public comment. We cannot allow this agency, regardless of \nwhat its motivations may be, to ultimately take away the credit \nopportunities of hard-working Americans who are trying to get ahead. We \ncannot let this rogue agency increase prices.\n  It is time for us to support the legislation. I encourage all Members \nto support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chair, I join many of my Democratic colleagues, as \nwell as the NAACP, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, \nthe National Council of La Raza, the National Association of Minority \nAutomobile Dealers, and many other civil rights groups, in opposing \nH.R. 1737, the Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act, a \nbill that would significantly diminish the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau's (CFPB) ability to protect consumers\n\n[[Page H8309]]\n\nfrom racial discrimination in the auto lending market and give auto \ndealers a leg up in charging higher interest rates, and, as studies \nhave shown, in discrimination. In 2013, the CFPB issued guidance that \nwas aimed at combatting these biases in the auto lending industry--\nbecause of a practice used by car dealers known as ``markups,'' people \nof color were paying more for car loans than their white counterparts \nwith similar or identical credit histories.\n  As the former chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, I \nam dismayed by the practice of ``markups,'' which allows discriminatory \ncar dealers, who get a cut of the additional charges and fees that \nmarkups provide, to profit from their bad behavior. The CFPB has done \nimportant work toward eradicating discriminatory lending practices. I \noppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule. The bill shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1737\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in House Report 114-340.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 11, insert ``veteran-owned,'' after \n     ``minority-owned,''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 526, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense \namendment to H.R. 1737.\n  This simple amendment ensures that any costs or potential impacts to \nany and all veteran-owned businesses are considered and included in the \nstudy required by this bill for any future auto financing guidance that \nmay be put forth by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  The three main categories that the SBA utilizes for set-aside \ngovernment contracts are women-owned, minority-owned, and veteran-owned \nbusinesses. The base bill requires a report that would include any cost \nor impacts associated with new guidance for minority-owned businesses \nand women-owned businesses.\n  I think we should all agree that it only makes common sense, then, to \nalso consider any costs or implications for our Nation's heroes and \nveteran-owned businesses that may arise from any future guidance being \nconsidered.\n  Our servicemen and -women already face tough challenges finding work \nwhen they return from service. In recent years, veterans' unemployment \nnumbers have been some of the highest in the country and, at times, \nhave been in double digits. Earlier this year, post-9/11 veterans faced \nunemployment numbers north of 7.2 percent. We shouldn't let any \npotential future guidance from an already rogue agency created under \nDodd-Frank exacerbate employment hurdles for our Nation's veterans.\n  One week ago today, we celebrated Veterans Day and the patriotic \nservice that so many men and women have given to this great Nation. We \nhave asked these heroes to risk their lives for this country, and many \nof our veterans have answered that call time and time again, including \nmultiple tours overseas. Most veterans return from service seeking not \nonly to reintegrate and establish normal lives, but to continue serving \ntheir country by contributing to the workforce, finding jobs, and even \ncreating jobs for others by starting small businesses.\n  My amendment is a simple measure and will help ensure veteran-owned \nbusinesses are not harmed by any future auto financing guidance put \nforth by CFPB.\n  Chairman Hensarling supports this amendment. I thank the chairman for \nhis support and also for bringing forth this commonsense bill that \nrejects this misguided guidance. I also applaud the chairman and \ncommittee for everything they do to advocate for small businesses and \njob creators throughout the country.\n  I ask that all my colleagues support our veterans and the businesses \nthey own by voting in favor of my commonsense amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment compounds one of the underlying problems \nthat I have expressed in my opposition to H.R. 1737.\n  While I have been and continue to be one of Congress' most vocal \nsupporters of minority-owned businesses, further expanding an already \nunnecessary cost-benefit study concerning the impacts of nonbinding \npolicy guidance is unproductive and only increases the likelihood that \nfuture guidance designed to actually help lenders comply with the law \nis further delayed or never issued.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, I want you to understand what is being said \nby the opposite side of the aisle. They basically are saying: Help me \nto look out for our veterans and make sure that they don't have any \nguidance that would impede their ability to do business. Well, I mean, \nthat is kind of a made-up problem.\n  This is not a problem. Simply, what is happening by the attempt to \nthrow veterans into this is to get Members thinking ``perhaps I want to \nsupport this amendment because I don't want to be thought of as not \nsupporting veterans.'' When you talk about cost-benefit analysis and \nstudies, what you are talking about is: How do I tie up the agency? How \ndo I create impediments to the agency being able to do its job.\n  This Congress supports veterans in so many ways. We support them in \ntheir quest to do business, and we have laws on the books that will \nhelp them to successfully get into business. We support them in \nhousing. We support them with better health care.\n  I don't want any Members of Congress to think somehow this kind of \nmade-up amendment is something that really they should be supporting if \nthey want to help veterans. This is simply a way by which to get you to \ndo something, making you think you are supporting veterans and thinking \nyou cannot oppose it.\n  This is an unnecessary amendment, and it gets in the way of good \nguidance coming out of the Consumer Financial\n\n[[Page H8310]]\n\nProtection Bureau, so I would ask you to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I can't believe, Mr. Chairman, what I just heard. I just \ncan't believe it. I hope that veterans who are watching C-SPAN today \nare listening carefully, listening very carefully about this amendment.\n  The three divisions which it oversees, the veterans were left out, \nand we just want to make sure that our veterans are included in any \nstudy that CFPB would go forward with.\n  That is sad. That is sad.\n  When we talk about the Veterans Administration being so pristine, \nwhen we look at their healthcare system, it is 50 percent worse than it \nwas a year ago. Many of the veterans that I have in rural Arizona are \nstruggling to find anybody that will even hear from them.\n  What a sad shame. What an absolute shame.\n  So I actually would ask my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It \nis pretty straightforward. I think America gets it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hensarling).\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to adopt this \namendment.\n  I must admit, if people all over America are wondering why it is so \ndifficult to get something done on a bipartisan basis, traditionally, \nthe least controversial thing we do here is study something. What is \neven less controversial is coming together on behalf of our veterans, \nyet we have the ranking member of this committee opposing both. I hope \nthe American people are watching closely.\n  Again, I think this is a very commonsense, modest amendment by the \ngentleman from Arizona. I encourage all Members to vote for it.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, once again, I ask all Members to vote for \nthis.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Smith of Missouri\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-340.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 12, strike the first period and insert ``, \n     including consumers and small businesses in rural areas.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 526, the gentleman \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, the American people have been \nmisled. They were incorrectly told that Dodd-Frank was meant to go \nafter big banks and Wall Street. However, in my rural congressional \ndistrict, the effects of this law and its close to 500 regulations have \nbeen devastating.\n  The total economic cost of Dodd-Frank-based regulations has eclipsed \n$35 billion and over 60 million hours of paperwork burdens. That is the \nequivalent of 30,000 employees a year dedicated solely to regulatory \npaperwork. A new army of regulators aren't the kind of jobs that \nAmericans were promised.\n  The biggest and most costly regulation to come out of Dodd-Frank is \nthe deceptively named Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an \nunconstitutional, uncontrollable, and unaccountable agency whose total \nnegative impact on our economy won't be known for decades.\n  The CFPB was supposed to protect consumers from the predatory \npractices of financial institutions. Instead, it has limited Americans' \naccess to credit, the ability to be financially independent, and \nimpeded the availability of homes and, in this case, cars. The CFPB \nachieved this by hiring big, spending big, and regulating big.\n  The CFPB started with a staff of 178 in 2011 but now has close to \n2,000 employees. In that same period, its annual spending grew from $10 \nmillion to, now, $600 million. The safest place to find a job in this \ngovernment economy is with a Federal financial regulator. In the last 5 \nyears, those regulators have seen a 16 percent increase in job growth.\n  The CFPB still has more regulations and guidance in its pipeline just \nready to roll out and crush rural America. That is why this amendment \nis so important.\n  In the endless search for a job in this economy, many Americans are \nforced to migrate to urban areas. In 2013, over half of all the rural \ncounties in the United States actually shrank in population. In 2014, \naccording to the Department of Labor, rural counties lost 330,000 jobs, \nwhile metropolitan counties gained over 3 million jobs. The last thing \nWashington should be doing is authoring regulations which further \nenable this trend.\n  With adoption of H.R. 1737 and this amendment, we are telling the \nCFPB that, when you issue regulations like this, in addition to \nanalyzing the impact on women-owned, minority-owned, and small \nbusinesses, you must also take a look at those regulations' impact on \nrural businesses and rural consumers.\n  My amendment is a simple one, but it would go a long way to providing \nsome clarity for the folks of Missouri's Eighth Congressional District \nand all of those Americans living in rural communities across the \nNation. While 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue might be looking at ways to make \ntheir life harder, this body, this Chamber, will continue to fight to \nmake sure the Federal Government stays out of their way.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from New Hampshire for introducing \nthis legislation. Burdensome regulation is a problem that hits rural \nAmerica the hardest. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, I am in opposition to this bill because it \nis simply another study, another cost to government, another \nunnecessary cost. While my friends on the opposite side of the aisle \nalways claim that they are reducing the cost of government, these \nstudies do very little.\n  As a matter of fact, instead of a study, some of these Members who \nrepresent rural areas ought to become real advocates for their \nconstituencies. They charge many of us as being advocates for health \ncare, education, housing, and transportation, all of which they lack in \ntheir communities, but you never see them fighting for it. If it were \nnot for some of us who are out there demanding better health care, \nbetter transportation systems, better education, and fighting for those \nwho get ripped off by these fraudulent businesses every day, they \nwouldn't have any protection because they send too many Members to \nCongress who mislead them on other kinds of issues, but when it comes \nto their economics, you cannot find them anywhere.\n  So, instead of a study, another study, another cost to government, \nwhy don't they become real advocates for their constituency? Why is it \nthat we don't have transportation systems in rural communities? Why is \nit they have to travel miles for health care? It is because they have \nRepresentatives whom they send to Congress who are really not \nrepresenting their real interests. They may get their colleagues to \nvote for yet another study because they don't do anything that is real \nand substantive for their communities.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. Sewell of Alabama\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-340.\n\n[[Page H8311]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk \nlisted as Sewell Amendment No. 3.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end of the bill the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this bill shall be construed to apply to \n     guidance issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial \n     Protection that is not primarily related to indirect auto \n     financing.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 526, the gentlewoman \nfrom Alabama (Ms. Sewell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my \namendment to H.R. 1737.\n  My amendment is a commonsense and straightforward amendment. It \nsimply states that nothing in this bill shall be construed to apply to \nguidance issued by the CFPB that is not primarily related to indirect \nauto financing.\n  This amendment is intended to help ensure that the underlying bill in \nno way prohibits, disrupts, or affects the enforcement of other fair \nlending laws or guidance that protects millions of Americans from \nunfair or discriminatory lending practices.\n  The underlying bill, H.R. 1737, provides the CFPB with criteria to \nconsider when issuing further guidance on indirect auto lending. While \nI agree that the CFPB should reevaluate its recent guidance, we should \nalso ensure that the scope of this legislation stays narrow and applies \nonly to indirect auto financing.\n  Mr. Chairman, I applaud the CFPB's efforts to protect consumers from \ndiscriminatory lending practices. We can all agree that no one supports \nor should condone abusive or discriminatory practices in auto lending \nor in any area of the marketplace. However, it is our job as Members of \nCongress to offer guidance and constructive critique to our regulatory \nagencies to enforce and ensure that regulations are pragmatic and \nworkable.\n  This noncontroversial amendment simply clarifies that the other \nvaluable tools possessed by the CFPB are not infringed upon and ensures \nthat there is no room for ambiguity. The CFPB plays a critical role in \nprotecting consumers and buyers. My amendment helps ensure that laws \nlike the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and other fair lending laws are \nnot inadvertently or directly affected by this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  My amendment helps ensure that the Bureau continues to play this role \nwhile hardworking Americans continue to have access to the necessary \ncredit to purchase any central mode of transportation. I urge support \nof this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Smith of Missouri). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from Alabama is a \nvalued member of the Committee on Financial Services. The absolute \nworst thing I could say about her amendment is it might be redundant. \nHopefully it is. But if it is not, we want to simply clarify, again, \nthat the underlying bill from the gentleman from New Hampshire only \ndeals with this auto finance guidance.\n  Again, absolutely nothing in the underlying bill to H.R. 1737 in any \nway, shape, or form affects the CFPB's ability to enforce the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act. If this clarification is needed, I am happy \nthat the gentlewoman is offering it, and I would urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may \nconsume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), the ranking \nmember of the committee.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the \ngentlewoman for yielding time.\n  As Mr. Hensarling said, it may be redundant, but that is okay. It \nreinforces basically what we have been talking about in relationship to \n1737.\n  I will just take a moment to say how proud I am of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, how proud I am of Mr. Cordray, how pleased \nI am that this is the centerpiece of the Dodd-Frank reform, how pleased \nI am that we now have an agency that is looking out for consumers.\n  Prior to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, our regulatory \nagency said their job was for safety and soundness. They forgot about \nthe consumers; they were dropped off the agenda.\n  Now we have a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that is \nchallenging the practices of many who claim they are in legitimate \nbusinesses. They are challenging them. They are saying to them: No \nlonger can you rip off our consumers. No longer can you target \nminorities. No longer can you have discriminatory practices.\n  Thank God for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking \nmember, Congresswoman Waters, for her diligence on this committee. She \nserves as a model for all of us in her vigor and fervor for making sure \nthat we are not discriminating against average Americans. All of us \nagree that nothing we do should be about discriminating or adding to \nthe effects of discrimination.\n  I ask for support of this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule \nthe committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nByrne) having assumed the chair, Mr. Smith of Missouri, Acting Chair of \nthe Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported \nthat that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. \n1737) to nullify certain guidance of the Bureau of Consumer Financial \nProtection and to provide requirements for guidance issued by the \nBureau with respect to indirect auto lending, and, pursuant to House \nResolution 526, he reported the bill back to the House with sundry \namendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the \nCommittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to House Resolution 529, an \namendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules \nCommittee Print 114-34 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is \nconsidered read.\n  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:\n\n[[Page H8312]]\n\n  \n\n\n                               H.R. 1210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Portfolio Lending and \n     Mortgage Access Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR FOR CERTAIN LOANS HELD ON PORTFOLIO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 129C of the Truth in Lending Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 1639c) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(j) Safe Harbor for Certain Loans Held on Portfolio.--\n       ``(1) Safe harbor for creditors that are depository \n     institutions.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A creditor that is a depository \n     institution shall not be subject to suit for failure to \n     comply with subsection (a), (c)(1), or (f)(2) of this section \n     or section 129H with respect to a residential mortgage loan, \n     and the banking regulators shall treat such loan as a \n     qualified mortgage, if--\n       ``(i) the creditor has, since the origination of the loan, \n     held the loan on the balance sheet of the creditor; and\n       ``(ii) all prepayment penalties with respect to the loan \n     comply with the limitations described under subsection \n     (c)(3).\n       ``(B) Exception for certain transfers.--In the case of a \n     depository institution that transfers a loan originated by \n     that institution to another depository institution by reason \n     of the bankruptcy or failure of the originating depository \n     institution or the purchase of the originating depository \n     institution, the depository institution transferring such \n     loan shall be deemed to have complied with the requirement \n     under subparagraph (A)(i).\n       ``(2) Safe harbor for mortgage originators.--A mortgage \n     originator shall not be subject to suit for a violation of \n     section 129B(c)(3)(B) for steering a consumer to a \n     residential mortgage loan if--\n       ``(A) the creditor of such loan is a depository institution \n     and has informed the mortgage originator that the creditor \n     intends to hold the loan on the balance sheet of the creditor \n     for the life of the loan; and\n       ``(B) the mortgage originator informs the consumer that the \n     creditor intends to hold the loan on the balance sheet of the \n     creditor for the life of the loan.\n       ``(3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection:\n       ``(A) Banking regulators.--The term `banking regulators' \n     means the Federal banking agencies, the Bureau, and the \n     National Credit Union Administration.\n       ``(B) Depository institution.--The term `depository \n     institution' has the meaning given that term under section \n     19(b)(1) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 505(b)(1)).\n       ``(C) Federal banking agencies.--The term `Federal banking \n     agencies' has the meaning given that term under section 3 of \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.''.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in the amendment made by \n     this Act may be construed as preventing a balloon loan from \n     qualifying for the safe harbor provided under section 129C(j) \n     of the Truth in Lending Act if the balloon loan otherwise \n     meets all of the requirements under such subsection (j), \n     regardless of whether the balloon loan meets the requirements \n     described under clauses (i) through (iv) of section \n     129C(b)(2)(E) of such Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) \nand the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters) each will control 30 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1210, the Portfolio Lending and \nMortgage Access Act, a bill approved by the Committee on Financial \nServices, which I chair, on a bipartisan vote of 38-18.\n  First, I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), an \noutstanding member of our committee, for his leadership in finding \nsimple ways to allow aspiring home buyers across the Nation to obtain \nmortgages more easily, absent the onerous regulations that are \npresently being applied so that they can qualify a mortgage through \nmarket competition.\n  The aim of H.R. 1210 is simple. Banks and credit unions should be \nfree to originate mortgages as long as they keep them on their books, \nas long as they keep the risk. This is responsible lending, Mr. \nSpeaker, and it helps more qualified borrowers obtain mortgages so that \nperhaps they can get their piece of the American Dream.\n  H.R. 1210, again, does this by allowing lenders, particularly \nhometown community banks and credit unions, to treat mortgages held on \ntheir balance sheets as ``qualified mortgages'' for purposes of the \nCFPB's mortgage lending rules.\n  As we know, the Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to our \nmortgage lending marketplace. One specific provision in section 1411 of \nDodd-Frank requires mortgage lenders to determine at the time a loan is \nmade that the borrower has a reasonable ability to repay it. The \nability to repay requirements are intended to ensure a lender takes \ninto account the borrower's capacity to actually repay the loan.\n  Section 1412 of Dodd-Frank creates a legal safe harbor for compliance \nwith the ability to repay rule for lenders who issue so-called \nqualified mortgages, or QMs.\n  Now, Mr. Chairman, it seems obvious that loans that are held by a \nlender should be regulated differently than loans that are originated \nand then sold to a third party. They have completely different \ncharacteristics.\n  Again, lenders that hold the loans on their own books in their own \nportfolio assume all--all--of the exposure of risk to nonperformance \nand default. Lending 101 tells us that when the borrower is unable to \nrepay the loan, the bank that made the loan, if it keeps it on its \nbooks, is the one that is going to lose the money and any future profit \nthat would be derived from the loan.\n  Portfolio lenders with poor underwriting thus will not stay in \nbusiness very long. In this sense, mortgages that are held in portfolio \nare already prudently regulated by market discipline. Yet without a \nsafe harbor from the threat of litigation, which H.R. 1210 would \nprovide, lenders will not make loans to otherwise creditworthy \nindividuals.\n  We hear this from community banks and credit unions every day. If \nthey don't meet the QM standards, the loans simply aren't going to get \nmade as a practical matter.\n  So let me stress, the CFPB's restrictions on mortgage lending will \nhave a disproportionate impact on low- and moderate-income home buyers, \nespecially those from rural and certain urban areas.\n  According to the Federal Reserve, within a few years under this QM \nrule, roughly one-third of Black and Hispanic borrowers may find \nthemselves disqualified from obtaining a mortgage because of the \nqualified mortgage rule. This is based simply on a rigid debt-to-income \nrequirement.\n  A recent survey tells us that 73 percent of community bankers have \nactually decreased their mortgage business or completely stopped, Mr. \nSpeaker, completely stopped their mortgage business or providing \nmortgage loans due to the expense of complying with the QM, qualified \nmortgage, regulatory burden. That is why a lot of community banks and \ncredit unions across the country say that QM doesn't stand for \n``qualified mortgage''; it stands for ``quitting mortgages.''\n  It should not be the job of Congress or unelected and unaccountable \nWashington regulators to decide who gets a mortgage and who does not or \nto force community banks and credit unions to function like regulated \nutilities, issuing only plain vanilla mortgages, rubberstamped in \nWashington for select groups.\n  Now, opponents of this bill will attempt to derail it in branding it \nsome kind of gift to Wall Street. Let me be clear. H.R. 1210 is a gift \nto home buyers, all home buyers looking for a more transparent and \ncompetitive market.\n  When it comes to loans that are held on the books, the size of the \ninstitution does not matter. A loan held in portfolio will carry the \nexact same amount of risk and profit regardless of the size of the bank \nthat holds it.\n  The commonsense legislation that is before us recognizes that the \nmost effective way to ensure a borrower has the ability to repay is not \none-size-fits-all, top-down regulation from Washington.\n  Let's, again, remember that the financial crisis was primarily caused \nby misguided Washington policies helping put people into homes they \ncould not afford to keep, hurting underwriting standards. Portfolio \nlending did not cause the crisis.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the legislation of the \ngentleman from Kentucky. Support the American Dream.\n\n[[Page H8313]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1210. Today we are \nagain wasting time on the floor discussing a bill that President Obama \nhas already pledged to veto because it would undermine important \nfinancial reforms and put consumers and the economy at risk.\n  H.R. 1210 would allow lenders to deal in the same kind of risky loans \nthat sank Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Countrywide, and eventually the \nentire economy in 2008. The bill undermines the antipredatory lending \nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and virtually eliminates one of the \nmost significant consumer protection rules implemented by the CFPB.\n  The bill also revives an industry practice under which mortgage \nbrokers can earn hefty bonuses by steering borrowers into riskier, more \nexpensive loans regardless of whether they qualify for better rates. My \ncolleagues seem to forget that we went through a terrible financial \ncrisis.\n  While we did spend hundreds of billions of dollars to rescue the \nbanking system, millions of victims of predatory lending were left to \nfend for themselves as they were displaced from their homes and saw \ntheir life savings disappear.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Many reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act ensure that the financial industry \nwill never again be allowed to take the kinds of risks that drove us to \nnational crisis, but the mortgage lending rules are designed \nspecifically to protect families from financial crisis.\n  The fact is that many banks, whether they held loans on their books \nor sold them off to investors, were able to profit from loans they knew \nborrowers could not repay. Rather than perform careful underwriting, \nmany banks demanded high upfront fees and relied on rising home prices \nand private mortgage insurance to protect them from losses when \nborrowers inevitably defaulted.\n  Banks also targeted families in financial trouble that owned their \nhomes free and clear, offering them cash-outs, refinancing with high \norigination fees and unaffordable terms.\n  Refinances accounted for 70 percent of subprime lending in the 3 \nyears before the crisis and ended up sapping the life savings from many \nfamilies who relied on these products to pay for unexpected medical \nbills or financial hardships.\n  Department of Justice investigations found that lenders specifically \ntargeted, again, minorities with predatory loans, destroying a \ngeneration's worth of wealth in many communities of color.\n  Under the new mortgage rules, it is illegal to pay bonuses to brokers \nfor steering borrowers into loans with bad terms. CFPB rules establish \nsensible underwriting standards so lenders are incentivized to design \nproducts that perform over the long run and make sense for consumers.\n  In cases where banks want to make riskier loans with higher fees, \nthey are allowed to do so, but the consumer will have extra protections \nif the loan goes bad. These include the right to sue for financial harm \nand a defense against foreclosure.\n  The mortgage rules make good sense by protecting consumers while \nstill allowing them access to credit and ensuring the economy can grow. \nThese are exactly the types of regulations we should want from our \nregulators, and the CFPB should be commended for its success.\n  Republicans continue to declare that the Dodd-Frank Act and the CFPB \nhave been bad for the economy. During the last Republican Presidential \ndebate, a rightwing group aired a commercial painting the CFPB as a \ncommunist bureaucracy and claiming the CFPB staff were responsible for \ndenying loans to consumers. The facts show a much different picture.\n  Even the conservative Wall Street Journal recently reported that \nindustry analysts and experts agree that compliance costs aren't the \ngreatest challenge facing community banks. The same article notes that \nloan balances at community banks grew twice as fast as their large \ncounterparts over the last year and that their profitability is much \ncloser to larger banks than it was prior to the passage of the Dodd-\nFrank Act.\n  The Mortgage Bankers Association recently revised their expectations \nfor 2016 and 2017 to expect even more growth in housing credits. And \nthis week, at the National Association of Realtors' annual conference, \nindustry economists pointed to a strong housing market, with high \nprospects for continued growth.\n  It is time for Republicans to realize that Dodd-Frank and the CFPB \nare not the problem. They are the solution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield myself 30 seconds to say I am fascinated to \nhear the specter of discrimination continually waved by the other side, \nyet the Federal Reserve says, when the qualified mortgage rule is fully \nimplemented, fully one-third of all Blacks and Hispanics won't be able \nto qualify for a mortgage. Yet we hear silence from the other side.\n  The reason we had the meltdown is because so many of my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle wanted to roll the dice on so-called \naffordable housing goals of Fannie and Freddie. It turned out to be the \nlargest bailout in American history.\n  If people are going to make bad loans, here is an idea: Let's not \nbail them out with taxpayers' money, but give everybody a fair shot at \nhome ownership. That means, if a bank makes the loan, they hold it on \ntheir books. Let them keep it. Let it be a qualified mortgage.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the \nsponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. BARR. I thank the gentleman from Texas, the chairman of our \ncommittee, for his leadership and support of this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, the best policies serve both the interests of the \nindividual and the broader national interests. In this case, it is in \nthe interest of the borrower to have an affordable, right-sized \nmortgage. It is also in the interest of the Nation to have a sound \nfinancial system safe from the excesses that led to the crisis in 2008. \nIt is possible to satisfy both objectives, but it will require the \nFederal Government to acknowledge that changes must be made to the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau's interpretation of the Dodd-Frank \nlaw.\n  The ability to repay requirements in Dodd-Frank are designed to \nensure that a lender takes into account the borrower's ability to repay \na loan. Simple enough. But the CFPB has implemented the ability to pay \nrule provision by promulgating a one-size-fits-all, top-down, \nWashington-directed qualified mortgage rule.\n  Under the CFPB's approach, mortgages have been made safer by \neffectively making them unavailable to a substantial number of would-be \nhome buyers. According to the Federal Reserve, 22 percent of those who \nborrowed to buy a home in 2010--one out of every five borrowers--would \nnot have met the underwriting requirements for a qualified mortgage.\n  There is no debating that for the benefit of a mortgage borrower or \nhis or her lender and the financial system, a borrower should have a \ndemonstrable ability to repay that loan. The only question is who is in \nthe better position to determine whether that borrower is able to repay \nthe loan. Is it a Washington bureaucrat without any relationship with \nthe borrower, or is it a lender with a full view of the customer's \nfinances and a bank or credit union that must bear 100 percent of the \ndownside risk of default?\n  Dodd-Frank answered that question by taking sides with the Washington \nbureaucrats. The result has been a housing market struggling to recover \nas a result of scarce mortgage credit, impacting job creation and \naffordable housing, and the loss of the consolidation of community \nbanks and credit unions.\n  It is time to try something different. H.R. 1210, the Portfolio \nLending and Mortgage Access Act, is the solution. This legislation \nwould treat mortgages held on the balance sheets of financial \ninstitutions as qualified mortgages for purposes of the Bureau's \nmortgage lending rules.\n  Because mortgage lenders retain all of the risk of the loans held on \nportfolio, they have a strong incentive to\n\n[[Page H8314]]\n\nensure that the loan is repaid. Such a policy would drive private \nsector risk retention--a goal of the Dodd-Frank Act itself--and mark a \nreturn to relationship lending where a bank or credit union can tailor \nproducts to a customer's needs and credit risk without running afoul of \nthe one-size-fits-all government requirements.\n\n  Small banks and credit unions have been disproportionately impacted \nby these rules. It is no coincidence that Harvard researchers have \nfound that, since Dodd-Frank's passage, community banks have lost \nmarket share at a rate double that experienced prior to Dodd-Frank's \npassage in 2006 to 2010, a period including the entirety of the \nfinancial crisis.\n  By bearing the risk, financial institutions have every incentive to \nmake sure that the borrower can afford to repay that loan. And no less \nthan Chairman Barney Frank endorsed this concept at a hearing before \nthe Financial Services Committee last year, saying he would like the \nmain safeguard against bad loans to be risk retention because that \nleaves the decision in the hands of whoever is making the loan.\n  The Bureau, itself, made this key point in its own rulemaking where \nit recognized that portfolio lenders have a strong incentive to \ncarefully consider whether a consumer will be able to repay a portfolio \nloan, at least, in part, because the small creditor retains the risk of \ndefault.\n  This bill also importantly provides a viable alternative to the \noriginate-to-distribute mortgage lending model that contributed to the \nbubble in residential real estate and massive taxpayer bailouts. \nIndeed, this legislation embraces an approach that more effectively \nensures that borrowers have the ability to repay than the CFPB's \nrestrictive rule. The result will be expanded access to mortgage credit \nwithout additional risk to the financial system or the taxpayer.\n  I would just note that the ranking member talks about putting \ntaxpayers at risk again. But the cause of the financial crisis was not \nportfolio lending by community banks and credit unions; it was \ngovernment policy: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buying billions of \nsubprime, improperly underwritten mortgages.\n  This policy, the GSE exemption to the qualified mortgage rule, \ncontinues to do this day. My bill offers an alternative to this risky \npractice of incentivizing origination without underwriting and \ndistribution to taxpayer-backed GSEs. This is particularly important \nbecause the commonsense bill that is before the Congress recognizes \nthat the most effective way to ensure that a borrower has an ability to \nrepay is not one-size-fits-all Washington mandates.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BARR. Just to conclude, instead, the most effective way to ensure \nthat a borrower has the ability to repay is to restore the traditional \nrelationship banking that ensures that financial institutions bear the \ndownside risks associated with their business decisions.\n  H.R. 1210 has the support of the American Bankers Association, the \nIndependent Community Bankers of America, the Credit Union National \nAssociation, the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, the \nNational Association of Home Builders, and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  The housing sector represents a third of the economy, and the lack of \navailable mortgage credit is impacting our recovery. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me to expand access to mortgage financing and \nsupport economic growth.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, I just heard that these bankers have the \nability to understand and know whether or not the consumers have the \nability to repay. That is what they told us before 2008. Unfortunately, \nthey are the same ones now that are telling us that they can determine \nability to repay. They didn't do it then, and they won't do it in the \nfuture.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), a \nmember of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the efforts of my colleague and classmate \nMr. Barr in attempting to address this issue. I appreciate the impact \nthat the qualified mortgage rule has had in terms of mortgage lending \nfor consumers and access to credit. It is especially true for our local \nand community bankers who have longtime personal relationships with \nindividuals and families. It is these types of relationships that we \nneed to encourage: the personal knowledge of people that banks and \nfinancial institutions lend to.\n  I also appreciate the aspects of the bill intended to increase access \nfor consumers that are just shy of the strict qualified mortgage \nstandards, and I support the policy of allowing otherwise non-QM-\ncompliant individuals having access to qualified mortgage products if \nlenders are willing to keep the loans on their books.\n  My concern with this legislation, among others, is that it does not \nexplicitly disallow the exotic mortgage products that were so much a \npart of the housing crisis.\n  There are consumer protections that could improve this legislation in \nterms of how we allow safe borrower protections for banks and mortgage \noriginators. I do think we should focus on consumer protection and \nallow non-QM loans to be non-QM only in terms of the borrower--those \nindividuals that fall just outside QM standards--and not open up to \nnon-QM products, particularly because this is not applicable only to \nthose small community banks or credit unions that we are so familiar \nwith, but to all institutions.\n  Portfolio lending is an important opportunity to find bipartisan \nagreement. I hope we can continue to work on this.\n  One other issue that I raise--and it was included in the amendment \nthat I offered that the Rules Committee did not make in order--is that \nI would have preferred that the legislation require that the \ninstitutions making loans under this title collect data on how these \nloans are being made and how they are performing, and get us the \ninformation to determine whether or not the effect that we are trying \nto create with this sort of approach is actually being met or if, in \nfact, it is not.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my friend and colleague. I wish I could \nwork with him if, in fact, this moves forward in a way that it is open \nto suggestion.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Huizenga), the distinguished chairman of the Monetary \nPolicy and Trade Subcommittee of our committee.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity.\n  I want you to imagine with me. Imagine a single mom moving out of a \ntrailer. She has had some tragedy in life. She has got two kids that \nare watching very, very closely, though, what she is doing and how she \nis handling it.\n  Imagine, as a former realtor, the joy that I took in being able to \nget her into her own home, the first thing that she had felt like was \ntruly hers and something that her kids could be proud of.\n  Well, that is the type of scenario that we are trying to promote, I \nwould think, as a country. Unfortunately, with the rules that have been \npromulgated under this qualified mortgage rule, lenders determine a \nborrower's ability to repay using, really, an arbitrary standard set by \na formula.\n  They don't look at the character. They don't look at the background. \nThey don't look at the history of that person because it is outside the \nformula. If a lender does not adhere to this bureaucratically \nestablished formula, a borrower can actually sue the lender.\n  This has caused 73 percent of community bankers, those who know their \ncustomers best, to cut back their mortgage business or simply stop \nproviding mortgages altogether. That is the worst-case scenario.\n  The Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act removes bureaucrats \nfrom the equation and allows lenders to work directly with borrowers to \nprovide them with loans that they can afford. That is a key element \nhere: loans that they can afford.\n  How do we know that they are going to do this?\n  Well, by keeping the loan on their own portfolio, on their own books, \nthe\n\n[[Page H8315]]\n\nlender assumes the full risk of the loan. Let me repeat that. The \nlender retains the full risk of those loans. If they didn't think that \nthat borrower could pay back the loan, they would not lend it to them.\n  Now, in my mind, that is the definition of what a qualified mortgage \ntest really ought to be. So this bill is going to allow those mortgage \nlenders to extend and cover those loans and really offer those services \nto those people who are looking for that.\n  I have heard on the other side of the aisle a claim, as the White \nHouse did in its veto threat, that this bill would ``open the door to \nrisky lending by undermining consumer protections under the rule and \nexpanding the amount of loans that would be exempt from it.''\n  As was pointed out by my friend from Kentucky, portfolio loans had \nnothing to do with the financial crisis that we went through.\n  In addition, loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and insured by \nthe Federal Housing Administration, which make up the vast majority of \nthe market, are already exempt under the QM rule.\n  So who exactly are we protecting? Who exactly are we maybe not \nservicing the way that this Congress ought to be servicing and ought to \nbe advocating for?\n  The originate-to-distribute model incentivized predatory and subprime \nlending, and, because those loans would be readily securitized, moved \noff of their books, they no longer had any responsibility. All they had \nto do was meet kind of a blush of a requirement, and they could move it \nright on off of their books.\n  I can tell you this: as a former realtor, I understand that nobody \nhas a greater incentive to ensure that a borrower can repay their loan.\n  I just pray that my colleagues on both sides will support this bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), a member of the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Waters.\n  Today I rise in opposition to H.R. 1210. During the financial crisis \nof 2008, predatory subprime lending was far too prevalent and \nunderwriting standards were not adequately adhered to by lenders.\n  In response to these practices, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new set \nof mortgage underwriting rules. These qualified mortgage rules are \ncritically important to helping ensure that all American consumers are \nprotected against harmful mortgage products and abusive lending \npractices. These commonsense rules now require a lender to make a good \nfaith effort to determine that a borrower has the ability to repay a \nmortgage.\n  Additionally, the final rule contains critically important and \nspecial provisions and exemptions that are available only to small \nlenders and to lenders that operate predominantly in rural and \nunderserved areas, exceptions that are critically important for \ndistricts like mine.\n  The QM rules simply state that, if banks make risky loans, like \ninterest only, or adjustable mortgage loans, consumers can hold them \naccountable if those mortgages go bad. Lenders are also responsible for \naccurately researching and documenting borrowers' incomes and their \nability to repay.\n  Unfortunately, as currently drafted, H.R. 1210 would undermine these \ncritically important consumer protections by exempting all depository \nfinancial institutions, large and small, from QM standards as long as \nthe mortgage loans in question are held in portfolios by those \ninstitutions.\n  H.R. 1210, broadly defined, would broaden the qualified mortgages to \ninclude all mortgages held on a lender's balance sheet.\n  Under the bill, depository institutions that hold a loan in \nportfolios could arguably receive legal safe harbor, even if the loan \ncontains terms and features that are abusive and harmful to consumers.\n  Essentially, the bill would limit the rights of borrowers to hold \nharmful those banks that do bad practices.\n  We all know that no regulation or law is perfect. We must work \ntogether to strike a delicate balance and ensure that regulations are \npragmatic and workable without placing undue harm on financial \ninstitutions that provide critically important access to capital for \npotential homebuyers.\n  Home ownership remains an important goal for most Americans and one \nof the most traditional gateways to the middle class. However, the \nfinancial crisis of 2008 reminds us that we must have in place sensible \nsafeguards to protect consumers against harmful mortgage products.\n  I want to thank the ranking member for her leadership on this matter.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 1210.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  I would like to thank my good friend from Kentucky, the sponsor of \nthis legislation, for leading on this important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, for many western Pennsylvanians, home ownership is a \nsignificant aspect of realizing the American Dream. Moving from paying \nrent to owning a home is an investment in the future for these families \nand an investment in their local communities.\n  Unfortunately, today that dream is being threatened unnecessarily by \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's qualified mortgage rule, or \nQM. The QM rule is a Washington-knows-best approach to mortgages that \nis hampering access to home loans across this country and hurting \npotential homebuyers and their communities.\n\n  As with many complicated and one-size-fits-all regulations, the QM \nrule has brought substantial unintended consequences. The rule's strict \narbitrary standards have made it more difficult for many deserving \nconsumers to get a mortgage and, as a result, has stalled much-needed \ninvestment in distressed and recovering communities.\n  Notably, a significant amount of low-to-moderate-income borrowers now \ndo not qualify for a mortgage based on the rule's 43 percent debt-to-\nincome ratio requirement. In fact, according to the Federal Reserve, 22 \npercent of those who borrowed to buy a home in 2010, after the \nfinancial crisis, 1 out of every 5 borrowers would not have met this \nrequirement.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are hardworking, everyday people we are talking \nabout. These are the people we are fighting for today.\n  It is our local community banks and credit unions that have \nlongstanding relationships with these everyday people, and they are in \nthe best position to judge creditworthiness and ability to repay.\n  But the QM rule effectively takes that opportunity away from these \ncommunity institutions and subjects them to an increased potential \nliability should they ever decide to stray outside the regulation. This \nis why, as the American Banker and others have put it well, for \ncommunity financial institutions, QM means quitting mortgages.\n  Thankfully, Mr. Speaker, this commonsense legislation that we are \nconsidering today offers a real opportunity to change this. In short, \nthe bill provides a very reasonable tradeoff for financial \ninstitutions.\n  Should an institution decide to hold a mortgage in portfolio and \nretain the risk of default on its balance sheet, the institution \nreceives the legal protections that are otherwise afforded by the QM \nrule.\n  On the other hand, if that institution decides not to hold the \nmortgage in portfolio, sells it in the secondary market and does not \nretain the risk, the institution does not receive those legal \nprotections.\n  By providing this option, the legislation will allow institutions to \nmeet the credit demands of their consumers while incentivizing them to \nensure that potential borrowers can meet the monthly obligations of a \nmortgage.\n  In other words, it properly realigns the risk, facilitates effective \nunderwriting by lenders, and ensures that mortgages will be readily \navailable for deserving homebuyers.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's pass this legislation so we can help transform \ncommunity through home ownership.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the vice chair of the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus and a member of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n\n[[Page H8316]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and \nfor her leadership to protect consumers.\n  H.R. 1210 would allow the largest banks in the country to deal in the \ntypes of predatory and risky loans which brought down Washington \nMutual, Wachovia, Countrywide, Lehman, Bear Stearns and, eventually, \nthe entire economy.\n  It undermines one of the most important titles of the Dodd-Frank Act \nand one of the most significant consumer protection rules implemented \nby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  Furthermore, this bill contains a provision which explicitly allows \nmortgage brokers to steer borrowers to riskier, more expensive loans, \nregardless of what they qualify for.\n  Some supporters of this bill think that, if banks hold these loans \nand, therefore, their risks in their own portfolios, they will be \ncareful not to originate bad loans, but this isn't true. It is not \ntrue.\n  Several portfolio lenders went under during the crisis due to a \nfailure to underwrite loans because they were focused on short-term \nbenefits of up-front fees rather than the long-term performance of the \nmortgages that they originated.\n  Investment banks also chased these short-term profits and bought up \nrisky derivatives based on loans that were poorly underwritten without \ndue diligence.\n  More importantly, this bill does not change what types of loans a \nbank is allowed to make. It just removes consumer protections from the \nriskiest subprime loans.\n  The CFPB's ability to repay rule is the only line of defense against \npredatory mortgage practices that brought down the economy and \ndestroyed billions in homeowners' wealth, and it is working.\n  Under the new mortgage rules, defaults are down and lending to \nminorities is up. Last quarter had the most loan originations since the \nthird quarter of 2007. The rules are protecting consumers while also \nfostering competition among banks and growing the economy.\n  We should not change a rule that is working. If it ain't broke, don't \nfix it.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining \non each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 12\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from California has 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Westmoreland).\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  The great American philosopher Ron White has a saying, and it says, \n``You can't fix stupid.'' So I guess that is the reason we can't fix \nthe QM rule that has come from the CFPB because it is stupid.\n  Here is the reason why. Why would we not want to give a bank or a \ncredit union the ability to loan somebody money when they are taking \n100 percent of the responsibility for the person to pay back that loan?\n  That is exactly what H.R. 1210 does. It says that a small bank, a \ncommunity bank, or credit union--I don't really care who it is--is \nwilling to put up their own money to somebody that they may know in \ntheir community that might not have the ability to have credit \notherwise to be able to buy a house.\n  I had that personal experience. Before I went in the building \nbusiness, the only thing that I had was a home. So I went and I paid \nabout 13 percent interest. I probably paid a number of points at \nclosing to be able to open up my building business. In doing that, I \nwas able to do that and I was able to pay back that loan. But had these \nrules been in effect, that would not have been possible to do.\n  There are other Americans and there are other people out there \nwaiting to get their foothold in society by buying a house, becoming \npart of the American Dream. And, to me, part of that dream is home \nownership.\n  So the philosopher is right. You can't fix stupid.\n  The CFPB has come up with many stupid rules, but I have got to give \nthis one the crown, because why we would want to keep people from \nhaving credit and the ability to prosper and to move on and to grow in \ntheir life and provide shelter for their family is beyond me.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as \nhe may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that the fact is that 2008 was a \nhorrendous time here in Congress, but it was even worse across America. \nYou can go into neighborhoods not just in my district in Minnesota but \nall over the country--Florida, Arizona, and California--all over the \ncountry, and the foreclosure crisis was wreaking havoc from sea to \nshining sea. Why? Because of poor underwriting standards. Why else? \nBecause we didn't require much of anything to prove that people could \npay a loan back.\n  I remember these days, and I remember them so well that I am not \nreally one to want to return to them right away. I think Congress has a \nduty to protect homeowners and protect consumers from predatory \nlenders. I vividly recall panic. I vividly recall the loss in property \nvalues, and I vividly recall the exploding unemployment numbers. I \nremember the calls from homeowners in my district facing foreclosure.\n  In Hennepin County, which is the county in which Minneapolis is \nlocated, we had more than 35,000 foreclosures since 2007. In many \ncases, these home buyers were sold loans with predatory terms even \nthough they qualified for better mortgages. They were literally steered \nto bad mortgages.\n  I have talked to people both young and elderly, people who had \nEnglish as a second language, and people who have been born speaking \nEnglish their whole lives, in fact, a diverse group of people who were \nsteered to cash-out refinancing that stripped them of their wealth and \nleft them homeless.\n  We acted to stop these predatory practices, and I am proud that we \ndid. Dodd-Frank was good legislation to try to stop these irresponsible \npractices. We passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act and created a standard mortgage, one that we call a \nqualified mortgage. This is a good step. It was wise to create a nice, \nboring mortgage loan product. It was a good idea.\n  Qualified loans must not at the time of origination be interest only \nor negatively amortizing, have a term longer than 30 years, be a no-\nincome, no-documentation loan, also known as liar loans, be a balloon \nloan, have a cap on fees and points, and leave the borrower with a \ndebt-to-income ratio of greater than 43 percent.\n  These are commonsense requirements, and if you get a loan like this, \nit is probably going to be fine. These commonsense requirements are \ngoing to enable sustainable homeownership and allow people to maintain \nthat American Dream that they have been hoping for and saving for for \nso long.\n  The fact is, we remember when we had yield spread premium. We \nremember no-doc, NINJA loans. We remember these interest-only loans and \nnegative amortization. These things were ruinous and harmed the \nAmerican working and middle classes. These commonsense requirements--\nthese commonsense requirements--are what we should do.\n  Here we are today. H.R. 1210 seeks to repeal these protections. They \nwant to take us back in time. They want to put us at risk and tender \nmercies again. The fact is, it is a huge mistake.\n  H.R. 1210 would allow banks with assets up to $1 trillion to seek \nmortgage brokers to issue the kinds of exotic products which caused the \nfinancial collapse.\n  Even before the ink on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform bill was \ndry, there were people trying to undermine it. Even before we even \nimplemented the rules, all the rules from Dodd-Frank have not even been \nin place yet, we are trying to change it and undermine it, really to \nkick the door open so that the American working and middle class can be \nat the tender mercies of unscrupulous lenders again. That is not to say \nthat all home lenders are unscrupulous. Many are good. But it doesn't \ntake that many to really ruin the industry.\n  These changes that H.R. 1210 proposes would encourage lenders to make\n\n[[Page H8317]]\n\nloans that are not in the best interest of the home buyer, and this I \nhave to stand against. But I am not by myself. Not only does our \nranking member know that this is a bad idea--and many Members of this \nbody--but also the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople, the NAACP, is well aware this is bad legislation. The \nLeadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights knows it. Americans for \nFinancial Reform knows it. And the Consumer Federation of America and \ndozens more are opposing this piece of legislation.\n  Some argue that because these loans will be held in the portfolio of \nthe lender, they will be high quality loans. This is not true. This is \na faulty assumption, and it is wrong. They miss the whole point of the \nqualified mortgage rule enacted in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nand Consumer Protection Act. Mortgage rules are designed to provide \nsafeguards that would create a safer mortgage product for the \nborrowers. Simply keeping a loan in a portfolio is not necessarily a \nsubstitute for the type of sound underwriting mortgage rules are \ndesigned to establish.\n  There is ample evidence that predatory loans can and have been held \nin portfolio. Some of the largest mortgage lenders that failed during \nthe financial crisis were large portfolio lenders like Countrywide, \nWashington Mutual, and Wachovia. These lenders can still make money on \ndefaulted loans. During the 3 years before the crisis, 70 percent of \nsubprime loans were refinanced loans, Mr. Speaker, not purchased loans. \nWith refis, borrowers bring the equity to the table. If the bank \ncharges upfront fees and recovers the money from a foreclosure, \npredatory loans can be profitable even if they default. The same is \ntrue for predatory purchase loans when home values aren't falling. And \nthat is why we are going to stand here and protect home buyers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to urge all Members of this body to vote ``no'' \non H.R. 1210. And just remember, it has only been a few years since we \npassed Dodd-Frank. It has only been not even a decade since the \nfinancial crisis that really, really caused tremendous havoc to the \nAmerican working and middle classes. After the Great Depression of the \n1930s, at least it took them a couple of decades before they tried to \ndismantle all the financial protections. They haven't even taken a \nsingle decade. They are back at it again and fighting tooth and nail to \nleave the American working and middle class at the tender mercies of \npeople who have nothing but the profit motive in mind.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this piece of \nlegislation. It is not worthy, and I urge a strong ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Barr), the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, it is important to respond to the rhetoric \nfrom the other side because I don't think they are really understanding \nwhat we are trying to do here. What we are not talking about are the \npredatory, abusive, and risky loans that they are referring to. That is \nnot what we are talking about here. We are not talking about opaque \nsubprime securitizations. We are not talking about the GSE exemption to \nthe qualified mortgage rule.\n  By the way, Mr. Speaker, where is the outrage with the FHFA, the \nregulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for not prohibiting Fannie \nMae, Freddy Mac, and the GSEs from buying these non-QM mortgages that \nthey are complaining about? What we are talking about are portfolio \nloans where the risk is on the shareholder, not on the taxpayer.\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my good friend from \nKentucky (Mr. Barr) for his leadership on this important bill for \nconsumers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1210, the Portfolio Lending \nand Mortgage Access Act. Since the creation of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, it seems that all they have done is make it more \ndifficult for businesses to grow and create jobs and to restrict \nchoices for consumers. America needs an opportunity economy not \nhampered with massive bureaucratic regulations.\n  The CFPB's qualified mortgage rule is anti-opportunity. It does \nnothing but force overly burdensome underwriting requirements on \nhardworking American families and community financial institutions, \nmaking it harder for creditworthy individuals to buy a home they can \nafford to keep.\n  The Independent Community Bankers Association reports that 73 percent \nof community bankers have decreased their mortgage business or \ncompletely stopped providing mortgage loans due to the expense of \ncomplying with this regulatory burden.\n  Mr. Speaker, I sat on a community bank board for over 10 years. We \nknew who was creditworthy. We had personal relationships with our \ncustomers. We knew their character. Today, Mr. Speaker, it is one size \nfits all.\n  We understand the nature of loans and extending credit. Yet what is \nrequired today is a box to check. If you can't check all the boxes, you \nwon't get a loan. The regulators today, just like they did before the \ncrisis, are putting mandates on community financial institutions, whom \nyou can loan money to and whom you can't loan money to. This type of \nexcessive regulation is what is killing the opportunities and choices \nfor the American consumers.\n  Since I have been in Congress, I regularly hear how Washington's red \ntape prevents community financial institutions from serving their \ncustomers' needs. H.R. 1210 goes a long way to ensure community banks \nand credit unions, who know their customers and communities, are able \nto serve hardworking American families, and they should not be impeded \nby needless and misguided meddling of Washington bureaucrats.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Tipton).\n  Mr. TIPTON. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Kentucky, \nRepresentative Barr, for offering this piece of legislation.\n  This bipartisan Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act responsibly \nexpands access to mortgage credit without creating additional risk to \nthe financial system or to the taxpayer. By allowing insured depository \ninstitutions to hold residential mortgage loans in portfolio and have \nthem treated as qualified mortgages, this bill encourages strong \nunderwriting standards for lenders while also giving access to credit \nfor young families and first-time home buyers. These are people who may \nnot otherwise be able to meet the ability to repay requirements.\n  Existing mortgage rules are overly restrictive and have made it \ndifficult and, in some cases, impossible for banks to be able to make \notherwise safe and sound loans to creditworthy borrowers. This bill \nputs the ``community'' back in community lending.\n  Mr. Speaker, in my district and many others across the U.S., access \nto mortgage credit is crucial. Unfortunately, many smaller community \nbanks have been forced to stop mortgage lending since they could not \nafford the expensive compliance and personnel associated with those \ncosts. They simply made too few mortgage loans to be able to cover \ntheir costs. In rural areas, this is a significant problem because \ncustomers often do not have the alternative to find a lender to be able \nto approach for mortgage products.\n  Thankfully, this legislation promotes the type of lending that will \nboost the housing market in a safe and responsible manner without \ntaxpayer exposure. Portfolio lending is among the most traditional and \nlowest risk lending in which a bank can engage. Loans held in portfolio \nare well underwritten and conservative by their very nature since the \nlender retains 100 percent of the credit and interest rate risk on \ntheir own books.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to lend my support to this bill and encourage \nmy colleagues to be able to support this commonsense measure. Again, I \nthank the gentleman from Kentucky for his efforts on this bill.\n\n[[Page H8318]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. HILL. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1210, the Portfolio Lending \nand Mortgage Access bill, designed by my good friend from Kentucky.\n  We have seen in Arkansas loan approval rates decline significantly \nsince the QM rules were put in place. One bank noted a 40 percent \ndecline in eligible borrowers.\n  Today, I just want to tell a story. A community banker in my district \ncalled this week and said that he has a customer that from time to time \njust needs catch-up money, money to catch up on bills, medical \nexpenses, or to help out her kids. But her credit score is in the low \nrange of acceptable, and therefore, she doesn't qualify for unsecured \ncredit, and therefore, she uses the equity in her house. She has been \ndoing it for years and paid back those lines over and over again with \nno problems.\n  Now she has to go through the ability-to-repay process, which is long \nand arduous and, unfortunately for her, leading to mistrust between a \nlong-term client and her hometown bank.\n  As a former chairman, CEO, and president of a community bank in \nArkansas, I can assure you that members of our boards of directors \nacross this country scrutinize all portfolio loans, both those that are \nsold and those kept on the books. But there is no better incentive than \nto have good underwriting and to ensure the customer has the ability to \nrepay the loan held on the balance sheet of one of our financial \ninstitutions.\n  That is what we are talking about here today.\n  Community institutions know best how to serve their communities and \ntheir clients--not Washington.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaine (Mr. Poliquin).\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am still scratching my head. I am still scratching my \nhead at some of the folks on the other side of the aisle. I have no \nidea why they do not want to help those folks that are less fortunate \nthan others in this country.\n  This is an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, for all of us in this Chamber, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to step forward and show some compassion for \nfolks that want to live in their own home.\n  I urge all of my colleagues right here today to support H.R. 1210, \nand I salute Mr. Barr from Kentucky for the hard work that he did to \nput this Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act together. I also \nthank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership in bringing this out of \nthe committee and to the floor.\n  I enjoy, Mr. Speaker, traveling through my Second District in Maine, \nthe most beautiful part of the world, and I love talking to our small \ncredit unions and community banks. I talk to the folks up at the Maine \nFamily Credit Union in Lewiston or the Bangor Savings Bank, and they \ntell me how difficult it is to navigate through this huge, complex, \n2,300-page Dodd-Frank law that is preventing them from lending money to \nfamilies who are creditworthy and who deserve these loans.\n  One specific part of the Dodd-Frank law, Mr. Barr's bill addresses. \nIt is called the qualified mortgage rule, or QM. This is a one-size-\nfits-all rule that does not work for many of the families in Maine.\n  Now, let's say you are a lobster fisherman in the down east part of \nour State and you want to borrow money from the Machias Savings Bank to \nbuy a new home because you have a couple of new kids and you need a new \nbathroom, but your monthly income, Mr. Speaker, may vary depending on \nwhen you set your traps, when you pull your traps, and when you sell \nyour catch to a dealer. Now, what the regulators want is they want to \nsee a smooth, equal 12 mortgage payments to repay that loan; but that \nmight not be the case, Mr. Speaker, because your job doesn't work that \nway.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield the gentleman from Maine an additional 10 \nseconds.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. In addition to that, Machias Savings Bank may have \nknown your family for 50 years. Now, on top of this, Mr. Speaker, the \nbank takes all the risk. They own the load. So, God forbid, if a storm \ncomes up and sinks your traps and your boat in the harbor and you can't \nmake those loan payments, there is no risk to the market because the \nbank owns the loan.\n  I ask everybody, Mr. Speaker, to stand up and show compassion for the \nfolks around this country who want to buy a home and do qualify for \nthese loans.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Proponents of H.R. 1210 argue that if banks keep loans in portfolio, \nthey have every incentive to make sure those mortgages are sustainable \nand good for both the bank and the borrowers. Therefore, loans held in \nportfolio should automatically receive the CFPB's legal safe harbor \nunder the qualified mortgage rule. This simply ignores the history of \nthe recent crisis. How can banks benefit from loans that are \nunsustainable in the long term?\n  Let's look at how it really works:\n  Step one, underwrite a mortgage with high, up-front fees. Though an \nhonest broker may charge a 1 percent fee, a Better Business Bureau \nstudy from just before the crisis showed mortgage brokers often making \n5 percent in up-front fees. On a $200,000 mortgage, that is $10,000 \njust for one loan. Other examples are appraisal fees, escrow fees, \nsettlement fees, homeowners insurance. These fees could go back to the \nloan originator on an unlimited basis, and originators could still have \nlegal protection under H.R. 1210.\n  Step two, protect your bank from consumer defaults by requiring \nexpensive private mortgage insurance.\n  Step three, underwrite a large number of loans so that the fees add \nup--volume churn, volume churn. This has the added benefit of keeping \nregional home prices high by flooding the market with buyers.\n  Step four, refuse to offer loan modifications. Banks can divest from \nloss mitigation processes and keep the profits from the high up-front \nfees and mortgage volumes.\n  Step five, foreclose on the borrower and prevent them from suing the \nlender for lending violations. Once the borrower defaults, the lender \ncan then repossess the collateral. If home prices have risen, they can \nsell the home for a profit all the while keeping their up-front fees. \nMeanwhile, H.R. 1210 would provide the lenders with a legal shield \nagainst CFPB enforcement or private fair lending litigation.\n  Over and over, Republicans have attacked the CFPB and the important \nprotections it provides to American consumers. Yet again, we are \nwasting time on the floor considering a bill the President has already \npledged to veto when we could be doing other important business.\n  What this bill does is very simple. It forgets all of the lessons of \nthe financial crisis of 2008 and allows the country's biggest banks to \nput consumers and the economy at risk by bringing back complex, high-\ncost mortgages. The bill resurrects a practice that allows mortgage \nbrokers to receive bonuses from the big banks in exchange for steering \nconsumers into expensive, risky loans.\n  After the financial crisis, the Department of Justice investigated \nthese practices and found that minority communities were sought out by \nmortgage brokers and targeted for risky loans, even in the cases where \nthe borrowers were qualified for prime loans. These are the same types \nof loans that destroyed the life savings of millions of Americans that \nended up in foreclosure.\n  And then when I studied foreclosure practices at the largest banks, I \ndiscovered that the same banks that made these mortgages were also \nguilty of robo-signing. Remember that? Robo-signing, wrongfully \nforeclosing on families that were up to date on their payments and \nfabricating paperwork to defraud consumers.\n\n[[Page H8319]]\n\n  The Dodd-Frank Act and the CFPB have reined in these predatory \npractices, yet I have had to come down to the floor over and over again \nto defend our work eliminating fraud in the financial system. We have \nalready seen what happens when regulators do not do their jobs: \nconsumers are left on the hook. We must defend the work we have done in \nthe Dodd-Frank Act and the important work that CFPB continues to do. So \ncertainly I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.\n  It has been said over and over again by this side of the aisle that \nit appears that my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle are \nforgetting the lessons of 2008, forgetting what happened when we \nbrought this country to a recession, almost a depression, forgetting \nthe communities that have been destroyed with these foreclosures, \nforgetting these lessons, and coming back to the Congress of the United \nStates disregarding all of the harm that we have caused to families and \ncommunities and presenting legislation that could put them back in the \nsame position.\n  Well, we wonder why our constituents and consumers don't trust us \nanymore. They don't trust us because of these kinds of attempts to \npresent public policy that again could harm our economy and harm these \nfamilies and these communities. They wonder why it is we continue down \nthis path.\n\n  We bailed out the biggest banks in America. We bailed out big \ninsurance companies in America. We took the taxpayers' money, and we \nliterally said to the people who had caused the harm: We forgive you. \nIt is okay. We are going to make sure you stay in business. We are \ngoing to make sure that you have the ability to make money.\n  And while the taxpayers watch this, still many are reeling from the \nloss of their homes. And homelessness has increased in my own city of \nLos Angeles, over 12 to 15 percent increase in homelessness. Some of \nthose families are there because they are victims of the predatory \npractices that we allowed our regulators to turn their heads and bring \nharm to these families and these communities.\n  I don't understand why you don't understand simply ability to repay. \nI don't understand why you would simply say let the biggest banks in \nAmerica have portfolio loans if they don't have to be worried about \nqualified mortgages. I don't get it.\n  Why don't you err, if you are going to err, on the side of the \nconsumer? What is it about the biggest financial institutions in \nAmerica that can promote this kind of public policy and have so many \nMembers, particularly on the opposite side of the aisle, doing their \nbidding? I don't get it. I don't understand, and I don't understand why \nmany of your constituents don't really know what is going on.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not easy work. As you know, working on the \nFinancial Services Committee is extremely difficult and time-consuming \nwork.\n  Here we are divided: one side of the aisle going back to the risky \ndays, another side of the aisle protecting the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau and saying that we have to protect that Bureau no \nmatter how much you attack it.\n  Again, I want to remind you, before Dodd-Frank and this centerpiece \nthat was organized for reform, where we created the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, think about the name--Consumer, Financial, \nProtection, Bureau--protecting those who had been dropped off the \nprotection agenda by our own regulators.\n  So we created something, and we named it in such a way that consumers \nand our constituents would understand that we are sorry for what \nhappened to them and we don't like the fact that we almost destroyed \nthis economy. We support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We \nwill not go back to those days prior to 2008; and, whether you like it \nor not, this Bureau is here to stay, and we are going to defend it with \nevery ounce of energy that we have.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I find it fascinating that the ranking member says ``we \nhave to protect the CFPB,'' the very same CFPB that the Federal \nReserve's inspector general says, ``minorities underrepresented in \nupper pay bands''; the very same CFPB, ``minority applicants not hired \nin proportion to qualifications.'' She wants to protect the CFPB where \n``minority employees receive lower performance ratings,'' wants to \nprotect a qualified mortgage rule which the Federal Reserve says one-\nthird of Blacks and Hispanics will no longer be able to qualify for \nmortgages. Yet the ranking member says we have to protect CFPB.\n  No, we have to protect the American people from CFPB, the CFPB that \nis trying to take away their mortgages.\n  I hear almost every week from some credit union or community bank, \nlike the First Arkansas Bank and Trust, who wrote:\n  ``Our bank has a long history of helping consumers, especially those \nwho, for some reason, cannot qualify for secondary market financing at \nthe time. Due to the fact that this type of financing is now overly \nburdened by the qualified mortgage standards, we have ceased this type \nof financing.''\n  This includes for mobile homes. That is low-income people, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  We hear from the Reading Cooperative Bank, ``We have experienced a \nspike in loan declines to women,'' for their investigation identified \nthat women attempting to buy the family home to settle their divorce \nand stabilize their family were being declined at a high rate due to \nthe Dodd-Frank qualified mortgage rules and ability to pay.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  We hear this stuff all the time. We have to protect the consumer, and \nwe protect the consumer by having competitive, transparent, innovative \nfree markets that are vigorously policed for force and fraud and \ndeception. It is not by having this vaunted CFPB. I am shocked that we \nhave the ranking member again talking about discrimination, but, \napparently, it is okay if the CFPB practices it. That is outrageous, \nMr. Speaker. It is simply outrageous. The American people will not \nabide by it.\n  We have to protect the American consumers in their opportunity for \nthe American Dream of homeownership. That is why every single Member \nshould vote for the legislation from the gentleman from Kentucky, which \nis so simple. It says, if you make the loan and you keep your books, it \nis a qualified mortgage, and you have your shot at the American Dream. \nI urge the adoption of the legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.\n  The Chair understands that the amendment made in order pursuant to \nthe first section of House Resolution 529 will not be offered.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, \nas amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit \nat the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. I am, in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Thompson of California moves to recommit the bill H.R. \n     1210 to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions \n     to report the same back to the House forthwith with the \n     following amendment:\n       Page 2, line 5, strike ``and'' at the end.\n       Page 2, line 8, strike the period at the end and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       Page 2, after line 8, insert the following:\n       ``(iii) the consumer is not a veteran or a member of the \n     Armed Forces.''.\n       Page 3, line 3, strike ``and'' at the end.\n       Page 3, line 7, strike the period at the end and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       Page 3, after line 7, insert the following:\n       ``(C) the consumer is not a veteran or a member of the \n     Armed Forces.''.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask \nunanimous consent to dispense with the reading.\n\n[[Page H8320]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California is recognized for \n5 minutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker and Members, the bill on the \nfloor before us is a rotten deal for all consumers, but it is \nespecially bad for our servicemembers.\n  When you are a servicemember, you are often forced to relocate with \nlittle notice. That puts our men and women in uniform under tremendous \npressure to obtain housing for themselves and for their families, all \nthe while managing the enormous duties that military service requires. \nIt is a lot to handle. We know this and so do the financial predators. \nThat is why we often see them setting up shop around our military \nbases.\n  If a servicemember is targeted and sold a bad mortgage, why don't the \nauthors of this bill want to allow them some recourse to make things \nright?\n  As a combat veteran, I understand the pressures placed on our \nmilitary. Our men and women in uniform often don't have the time to \ninvestigate mortgages in detail. They have to trust that no one is \ntaking advantage of them. The problem is people often do take advantage \nof them. It is a despicable practice that is matched only by the \nmajority's bill, which denies them the opportunity to sue the predatory \nlender to make things right.\n  My amendment would change this. It would allow any servicemember or \nveteran to sue a predatory lender regardless of who holds the loan. The \nmere fact that a predatory lender holds a bad mortgage shouldn't \nprevent servicemembers from being able to take action to make things \nright.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side are going to vote to deny \nprotections to your average, hard-working American family who had the \nbad fortune of being sold a bad mortgage; but at the very least, let's \nexempt servicemembers from this bill. We ask enough of them already.\n  Reports from the Department of Defense have noted that financial \nstress can affect a servicemember's performance and combat readiness. \nAnd a DOD report specifically states: ``Forty-eight percent of enlisted \nservicemembers are less than 25 years old, have little experience \nmanaging their finances, and have little in savings to help them \nthrough emergencies.''\n  Yet, on the heels of Veterans Day, when Member after Member came to \nthe floor to praise our veterans, this majority wants to return 7 days \nlater and put predatory lenders ahead of our men and women in uniform. \nTheir bill limits consumer protections for servicemembers. It hurts our \nArmed Forces, and it hurts their families. It increases strain on \npeople who already volunteer for a stressful, dangerous job; and it \nreduces combat readiness.\n  Let's not forget all we pledged just a week ago on Veterans Day. \nLet's put our policy in line with our rhetoric. Let's protect our \ntroops. Let's protect their families. Let's protect our country. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this motion to recommit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the \ngentleman's motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I certainly salute the gentleman for his \nservice to our country in uniform and for his service to our country in \nCongress.\n  Although I applaud his service, I do not applaud what he is bringing \nbefore the House in this motion to recommit, because what his motion to \nrecommit will do, regardless of what he says it will do, is hurt \nveterans. It will hurt their homeownership opportunities.\n  I don't know if the gentleman was on the floor when I shared with the \nHouse correspondence from just two community financial institutions \nthat were saying that they can't make mortgage loans anymore under this \nQM rule. We know for a fact that, when fully implemented, 20 percent of \nthe people who qualified for mortgages just 5 years ago--after the \nfinancial crisis--would no longer qualify, many of them veterans. We \nknow the Federal Reserve has said that, when the QM rule is fully \nfunctional, one-third of all Blacks and Hispanics, many of them \nveterans, will not be able to qualify for mortgages.\n  Again, it is why so many in the industry are calling ``QM'' not \n``qualified mortgage,'' Mr. Speaker, but ``quitting mortgages.'' We \ndon't want banks and credit unions to be quitting on mortgages for our \nbrave men and women in uniform. They deserve the same homeownership \nopportunities. Frankly, they deserve better homeownership opportunities \nthan the rest of the population.\n  I would urge that the House reject this motion to recommit because, \nat the end of the day, what is going to be best for our veterans--what \nis going to be best for the American people--is more competition in the \nmortgage market, not less, not taking away their financing \nopportunities, particularly those who are of low income and \nparticularly our veterans. No. We want to have competitive, \ntransparent, innovative markets. They need to be policed for force and \nfraud and deception. We want as many different financial institutions \ncreating as many opportunities for homeownership for the American \npeople and for our veterans as possible. I would urge the House to \nreject this motion to recommit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas \nand nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by \n5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and passage of H.R. \n1737.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 184, \nnays 242, not voting 7, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 635]\n\n                               YEAS--184\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Duncan (TN)\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 3189, to amend the \nFederal Reserve Act to establish requirements for policy rules and \nblackout periods of the Federal Open Market Committee, to establish \nrequirements for certain activities of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System, and to amend title 31, United States Code, to \nreform the manner in which the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System is audited, and for other purposes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 529 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 3189.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Yoder) to preside \nover the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 3189) to amend the Federal Reserve Act to establish requirements \nfor policy rules and blackout periods of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, to establish requirements for certain activities of the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and to amend title \n31, United States Code, to reform the manner in which the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System is audited, and for other \npurposes, with Mr. Yoder in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Waters) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3189, the FORM Act, to \nreform the Federal Reserve. It is sponsored by the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Huizenga).\n  To paraphrase an old automobile advertising campaign, Mr. Chairman, \nthis is not your father's Fed.\n  Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has morphed into a \ngovernment institution whose unconventional activities and vastly \nexpanded powers would hardly be recognized by those who drafted the \noriginal act. Regrettably, commensurate transparency and accountability \nhave not followed.\n  Since the financial meltdown of 2008, the Fed has carried out \nunprecedented rounds of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing; \nand its balance sheet has swollen to almost $5 trillion, equal to one-\nfourth of the U.S. economy and almost five times its pre-crisis level.\n  We have had almost 7 years of near-zero interest rates, and the Fed's \nso-called forward guidance provides almost no guidance to investors on \nwhen rates might finally be normalized.\n  This ongoing uncertainty is a significant cause of businesses \nhoarding cash and postponing capital investments and community banks \nconserving capital and reducing lending.\n  Adding to the economic uncertainty, the Dodd-Frank Act granted the \nFed sweeping new regulatory powers to directly intervene in the \noperations of large financial institutions. This is totally separate \nand apart from its monetary policy responsibilities, Mr. Chairman.\n  The Fed now stands at the center of Dodd-Frank's codification of too \nbig to fail. With respect to these firms, the Fed is authorized to \nimpose heightened prudential standards, including capital and liquidity \nrequirements, risk management requirements, resolution planning, credit \nexposure report requirements, and concentration limits.\n  The Fed is even authorized on a vague, faint finding that if a \nfinancial institution poses a grave threat to financial stability, to \nactually break up the firm.\n  In other words, Mr. Chairman, the Fed can now literally occupy the \nboardrooms of the largest financial institutions in America and \ninfluence how they deploy capital.\n  The Fed's monetary policy must be made clear and credible, and its \nregulatory activities must comport with the rule of law and bear public \nscrutiny. To accomplish this, the Fed Oversight Reform and \nModernization Act, again, the FORM Act, authored by Congressman \nHuizenga, should be enacted into law.\n  Reform accountability and transparency, on the one hand, and \nindependence in the conduct of monetary policy, on the other, are not \nmutually exclusive concepts.\n  The main reforms of the FORM Act are as follows: Number one, on \nmonetary policy, the Fed must publish and explain with specificity the \nstrategy it is following.\n  The FORM Act allows the Fed to chose any monetary policy, strategy, \nor rule it prefers, and it has the power to amend or depart from that \nrule whenever the Fed decides economic circumstances so warrant.\n  Whether the Fed chooses to conduct monetary policy based upon the \nTaylor rule developed by Stanford Economist John Taylor or whether they \nchoose to conduct monetary policy based on a rousing game of rock-\npaper-scissors or any other rule or method, the Fed will retain the \nunfettered discretion to do that.\n  The FORM Act simply requires the Fed to report and explain its rule \nand its deviations from the standard benchmark to the rest of us.\n  Economic history clearly shows that, when the Fed employs a more \npredictable, rules-based monetary policy, more positive economic \nresults will occur.\n  Some have opined that such a provision will compromise the Fed's \nmonetary policy independence. It does not. The Fed again will retain \nunfettered discretion in the exercise of monetary policy.\n  Given that members of the Fed Board of Governors enjoy 14-year terms, \nsecond only to lifetime judicial appointments, and the Fed's budget is \nindependent of congressional appropriations, it is almost inconceivable \nthat\n\n[[Page H8324]]\n\nCongress could impose upon the Fed's monetary policy independence.\n  On regulatory policy, as distinct from monetary policy, the format \ncompels the Fed to conduct cost-benefit analysis for all its \nregulations. This is also known as common sense.\n  Under Dodd-Frank, the Fed is directed to publish upwards of 60 new \nregulations, some in conjunction with other agencies, but a cost-\nbenefit analysis is not required. The Fed's failure to carry out these \nstudies results in excessive regulatory burdens on our small banks and \nbusinesses, which harms the economy.\n  Furthermore, under the FORM Act, the Fed will be required to issue \nformal regulations after providing for notice and comment for Dodd-\nFrank stress test scenarios and disclose resubmitted stress tests.\n  The Fed's authority to use stress tests to direct operations of \nfinancial institutions it deems systemically important puts government \nbureaucrats in a position of essentially dictating business models and \noperational objectives of private businesses. Yet, the Fed's \nimplementation of stress testing is marked by a lack of transparency \nand a total disregard for the rule of law.\n\n  Given the secrecy surrounding the stress test, it is difficult for \nCongress and the public to assess either the effectiveness of the Fed's \nregulatory oversight or the integrity of their findings.\n  Again, under Dodd-Frank, vast powers have been expanded of the Fed. \nThe Fed is not using a transparent monetary policy. Because of this, \ngreater transparency, greater accountability is necessary. Otherwise, \nwe may soon awake to discover that our central bankers have morphed \ninto our central planners.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 3189, a bill \nthat would undermine the Federal Reserve's monetary policy \nindependence, politicize its decisionmaking, curtail its ability to \nrespond to a wide range of dynamic economic data, and weaken its \nability to effectively carry out its regulatory responsibilities to \npromote the safety and soundness of our financial system.\n  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3189, the Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization \nAct, should more appropriately be called the Eliminate the Federal \nReserve's Ability to Support the American Economy and Promote Full \nEmployment Act.\n  While no Federal agency is perfect and should be reflectively \nshielded from reform, this bill does not reflect a good faith effort to \nstrengthen the Federal Reserve or hold it accountable to its mission, \nto keep inflation low and stable, and to promote full employment.\n  Rather, this bill is designed to put monetary policy on autopilot \nunder a strict, rules-based approach subject to reviews and audits by \nthe GAO.\n  This approach seeks to discourage monetary policymakers from \nconsidering the wide range of ever-changing economic data that is \nrelevant to effective decisionmaking and would discourage the Fed from \nengaging in the types of bold and forceful actions that have been so \ncritical to our economy's recovery over the past 6 years.\n  As the largest economy in the world that is increasingly \ninterconnected to a vast and complex global economy, the notion that we \nshould be putting blinders on our central bank strikes me as a recipe \nfor disaster. In fact, had the Federal Reserve taken the approach \ncalled for in the underlying bill during and in response to the recent \nfinancial crisis, economic performance would have been substantially \nworse.\n  As Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen put it in a letter to \ncongressional leadership earlier this week, had the FOMC been compelled \nto operate under a simple policy rule for the past 6 years, the \nunemployment experience of that period would have been substantially \nmore painful than it already was and inflation would have been even \nfurther below the FOMC's 2 percent objective.\n  But the straitjacket approach to monetary policy isn't the only \nreason to oppose this bill. H.R. 3189 includes a host of provisions \nthat represent the latest Republican effort to block financial \nregulators from fulfilling their responsibility to promote the safety \nand soundness of our financial system as part of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  In particular, this bill would impose unworkable cost-benefit \nanalysis requirements that are designed to slow new rulemaking to a \nscreeching halt and ensure the few that do get issued are tied up in \ncourt.\n  The bill also requires the Federal Reserve to make public and solicit \ncomments on its stress test scenarios, a move that, while popular with \nthe biggest banks, would undermine the effectiveness of the test, \nturning this valuable regulatory tool for assessing the health of the \nfinancial system into a useless exercise.\n  Finally, the Rules Committee print adds to the end of H.R. 3189 the \ntext of H.R. 2912, a bill that would establish a partisan commission, \nwith twice as many Republicans as Democrats, to review the Federal \nReserve's conduct of monetary policy and recommend changes to its \nmandate as well as the specific instruments and operational regime to \nbe used in achieving it.\n  The fact is, the Federal Reserve's current dual mandate and \noperational monetary policy independence have served the economy well. \nSuch independence ensures that policy decisions are empirically driven \nrather than motivated by short-term political pressures while its clear \nobjectives allow Congress to hold it accountable.\n  Operating under the current model, the Federal Reserve played a major \nrole in ending the panic that gripped the financial sector in 2008 and, \nthrough its sustained efforts, has supported the creation of more than \n13.3 million private sector jobs and cut the unemployment rate in half \nsince the height of the crisis, all while keeping inflation well below \nthe target.\n  Frankly, I think it is a terrible idea to put those who thought \nshutting down the government was a good idea and who thought fiscal \nausterity would grow the economy in a position to micromanage our \nmonetary policy, also.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to note that the Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that this bill will cost $109 million over 10 \nyears by forcing the Federal Reserve to jump through new rulemaking and \nadministrative hoops.\n  To pay for this cost, the Rules Committee adopted an amendment that \nwould raid $60 billion from the Federal Reserve's surplus account, a \nbuffer that inspires confidence in the central bank itself. Ironically, \nthis is the very same fund that Republicans voted to eliminate just 2 \nweeks ago.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  For all of these reasons, I would urge Members to join me in opposing \nthis terrible legislation that would do enormous damage to our economy \nand the American people. I can't believe this bill is before us.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the author of the FORM Act \nand chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 3189, a wonderful bill called the Fed Oversight Reform and \nModernization Act, the FORM Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, Marriner Eccles, Chairman of the Federal Reserve under \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt, once began testimony to Congress by \nstating: ``I am speaking for the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System, an agency of Congress.''\n  Chairman Eccles recognized what many seem to have forgotten over the \nFederal Reserve's 100-plus-year history, that the Fed was created by \nCongress; the Board of Governors are all appointed for terms of 14 \nyears by the President and confirmed by Congress; and it operates per \nits charter and laws set out by, yes, Congress. Therefore, the Federal \nReserve is actually or, theoretically, is supposed to be accountable to \nCongress.\n  Today, the Federal Reserve is one of the most powerful institutions \nin the world. It is past time to restore transparency at the Fed and \nhold it accountable to the American taxpayers.\n\n[[Page H8325]]\n\n  The U.S. Federal Reserve System, or the Fed, as it is known, was \ncreated in 1913 in response to a series of economic crises early in the \n20th century. Although the Fed was created as an independent agency \nderiving its power from Congress, over the past 100 years, the Fed's \npower has significantly expanded.\n  While originally created to provide stability to the banking \nbusiness, the Federal Reserve has gained unprecedented power, \ninfluence, and control over the financial system while remaining \nshrouded in mystery to the American people. At the same time, the \nAmerican people have continued to suffer through a financial crisis, at \nleast once per generation. With such a poor record, the Fed should not \nbe free to carry on without accountability to the institution that \ncreated it.\n  Mr. Chairman, we will not fully realize robust economic growth until \nthe Fed changes the conduct of its monetary policy. Six years have \npassed since the recession officially ended, but the U.S. economic \nopportunity remains well short of its potential.\n  The Fed must be accountable to the people's Representatives as well \nas to the hardworking taxpayers themselves. We need to modernize the \nFederal Reserve, restore accountability, and bring it into the 21st \ncentury. That is why I introduced H.R. 3189, the FORM Act of 2015. The \nFORM Act makes two fundamental changes to improve how the Federal \nReserve conducts monetary policy.\n  Now, I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle tend to kind \nof like to pass bills before they know what is in those bills. That is \none of the ways that they discover what is in those bills. But if they \nactually read this bill, they would see that it protects the Fed's \nability to develop what it believes is the best course of action on \nmonetary policy--the exact opposite of what my colleague was saying. It \nrequires them to then give the American people a greater accounting of \nits actions.\n  My bill directs the Federal Reserve to transparently communicate its \nmonetary policy decisions to the American taxpayers--not what it must \ndo, as is being asserted. Rather, they must simply explain what they \nare doing and why they are doing it. By requiring the Fed to regularly \ncommunicate how its policy choices compare to a benchmark guideline \ninstead of continuing the ad hoc strategy currently being employed, the \nFORM Act will help consumers and investors make better decisions in \nboth the present and create more sound expectations about the future.\n  Even Chair Yellen once championed the merits of this approach, \nstating that ``the framework of a Taylor-type rule could help the \nFederal Reserve communicate to the public the rationale behind policy \nmoves.'' The FORM Act does not dictate any particular monetary policy \ncourse; it simply ensures that the Fed transparently communicates its \nmonetary policy decisions. I can't agree more with Chair Yellen.\n  Second, the FORM Act reforms the Federal Reserve's emergency lending \npowers under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, closing a \nglaring loophole and preventing the likelihood of future bailouts, as \nwe have seen in the past. During the last financial crisis, the Fed \nused extraordinarily broad powers to provide trillions of dollars in \nlow-cost loans to a handful of massive financial institutions.\n  The FORM Act raises the bar from the current trigger, permitting the \nFed to invoke its emergency lending powers only upon finding that--and \nthis is from the text of the bill--``unusual and exigent circumstances \nexist that pose a threat to the financial stability of the United \nStates.''\n  Responsibly limiting the Federal Reserve's lending authority has \nsupport from across the ideological spectrum, ranging from \nconservatives to liberals, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n  The FORM Act also does the following: It requires the Fed to conduct \ncost-benefit analysis for all regulations it promulgates. Failure to \nconduct cost-benefit analysis results in excessive regulatory burdens \non small banks and businesses, which harm the economy and I believe \nhave slowed our recovery.\n  It also requires transparency about the Federal Reserve's bank stress \ntests as well as the international financial regulatory negotiations \nconducted by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am afraid that we are sliding into a much broader \narea of regulation that is not U.S. regulation but is actually European \nand world regulation. It requires the Federal Reserve to review the \nsalaries of highly paid employees. It provides for at least two staff \npositions to advise each member of the Board of Governors independent \nfrom the Chair, and it requires Fed employees to abide by the same \nethical requirements as other Federal financial regulators.\n  That sounds like an excellent idea in my mind.\n  It clarifies the blackout period governing when Federal Reserve \ngovernors and employees may publicly speak to Congress as well as to \nthe public on certain matters, and it ends automatic seats at the \nFederal Open Market Committee table, which provides a more balanced \nrepresentation of votes on Federal policy at the FOMC.\n  It requires the full FOMC to decide policy rates on excess balances \nmaintained at a Federal Reserve Bank by a depository institution. It \nremoves restrictions placed on the Government Accountability Office's \nability to audit the Fed, and it directs the GAO to conduct an audit of \nthe Fed within 12 months of enactment and report back to Congress.\n  Finally, the FORM Act establishes a bipartisan monetary commission, \nas proposed by Chairman Brady, to identify other opportunities for \nimprovement.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, we can no longer afford to have an entity with so much \npower as the Federal Reserve by operating on a whim with ad hoc policy. \nThe reforms in this legislation strike the right balance between \nholding the Fed accountable to Congress and the American people while \nstill affording it its independence to make monetary policy decisions \nfree from political pressure of all stripes.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Federal Reserve System is an agency of Congress. As \nsuch, it is not infallible, and its independence should not be \nunlimited. Let's restore proper congressional supervision and provide \nthe American people with transparency. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nsupport of H.R. 3189, the Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act of \n2015.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, despite what my \ncolleague on the opposite side of the aisle, Mr. Huizenga, has said \nabout our not knowing what is in the bill, we know what is in the bill, \nand this Congress should be frightened about what you are attempting to \ndo with establishing this simple monetary policy rule that is \nunworkable. This is dangerous.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York \n(Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney). She is the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises of \nthe Financial Services Committee.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding and for her leadership.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3189.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record an article from The Wall Street \nJournal written by Alan Blinder, a former Vice Chair of the Federal \nReserve, a professor at Princeton, and the author of a book on the \nfinancial crisis, the response, and the work ahead. This is his strong \narticle in opposition to this bill which he feels is extremely \ndisruptive, problematic, and just plain wrong.\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 17, 2014]\n\n                     An Unnecessary Fix for the Fed\n\n                          (By Alan S. Blinder)\n\n       The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on \n     Federal Reserve reform on July 10. The hearing didn't get \n     much press attention. But it was remarkable. While the House \n     can't manage to engage on important issues like tax reform, \n     immigration reform and the minimum wage, it's more than \n     willing to propose radical ``reform'' of one of the few \n     national policies that is working well.\n       The bill under consideration is called the Federal Reserve \n     Accountability and Transparency Act. (That's right: FRAT.) To \n     be fair to an otherwise dreadful bill, accountability and \n     transparency are worthy objectives, and FRAT does include \n     some reasonable ideas, such as trimming the news blackouts \n     before and after meetings of the Federal Open Market \n     Committee. But it also includes some\n\n[[Page H8326]]\n\n     corkers, such as requiring public disclosures--in advance--\n     before entering into international negotiations, disclosures \n     that could make such negotiations next to impossible. How \n     would you like to play your poker hand open?\n       But the meat-and-potatoes of the House bill has little to \n     do with either transparency or accountability. Instead, it \n     seeks to intrude on the Fed's ability to conduct an \n     independent monetary policy, free of political interference.\n       As the title of Section 2 puts it, FRAT would impose \n     ``Requirements for Policy Rules of the Federal Open Market \n     Committee.'' A ``rule'' in this context means a precise set \n     of instructions--often a mathematical formula--that tells the \n     Fed how to set monetary policy. Strictly speaking, with such \n     a rule in place, you don't need a committee to make \n     decisions--or even a human being. A handheld calculator will \n     do.\n       In the debate over such rules, two have attracted the most \n     attention. More than 50 years ago, Milton Friedman famously \n     urged the Fed to keep the money supply growing at a constant \n     rate--say, 4% or 5% per year--rather than varying money \n     growth to influence inflation or unemployment.\n       About two decades ago, Stanford economist John Taylor began \n     plumping for a different sort of rule, one which forces \n     monetary policy to respond to changes in the economy--but \n     mechanically, in ways that can be programmed into a computer. \n     While hundreds of ``Taylor rules'' have been considered over \n     the years, FRAT would inscribe Mr. Taylor's original 1993 \n     version into law as the ``Reference Policy Rule.'' The law \n     would require the Fed to pick a rule, and if their choice \n     differed substantially from the Reference Policy Rule, it \n     would have to explain why. All this would be subject to audit \n     by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), with prompt \n     reporting to Congress.\n       In a town like Washington, the message to the Fed would be \n     clear: Depart from the original Taylor rule at your peril. \n     Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen understands this and, as \n     she made clear in her semiannual testimony to the House \n     Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, opposes the bill.\n       So what is this rule that FRAT would turn into holy writ? \n     It's a simple equation, which starts by establishing a \n     baseline federal-funds rate that is two percentage points \n     higher than inflation; that's about 3.5% now. It then adds to \n     that baseline one-half of the amount by which inflation \n     exceeds its 2% target (that ``excess'' is now roughly minus \n     0.5%). Next, it adds one-half the percentage amount by which \n     gross domestic product exceeds an estimate of potential GDP \n     (that gap is controversial but is perhaps minus 4% today). \n     Thus Taylor's mechanical rule wants the current fed-funds \n     rate to be about 3.5 - 0.25 - 2.0 = 1.25%--which is vastly \n     higher than the actual near-zero rate.\n       Fed staff could no doubt concoct an alternative rule that \n     instructed the FOMC to set the fed-funds rate close to zero \n     today, and the committee could pretend it was using that \n     rule. That's transparency?\n       But there is a deeper problem. The Fed has not used the \n     fed-funds rate as its principal monetary policy instrument \n     since it hit (almost) zero in December 2008. Instead, its two \n     main policy instruments have been ``quantitative easing,'' \n     which is now ending, and ``forward guidance,'' which means \n     guiding markets by using words to describe future policy \n     intentions. If words are the Fed's main policy instrument, \n     how is the FOMC supposed to set them according to a rule? And \n     how can the GAO determine whether that rule resembles the \n     ``Reference Policy Rule''?\n       The Taylor rule probably would give the Fed sensible \n     instructions in normal times. But what about when the world \n     is far from normal? The Fed claimed to be using Friedman's \n     money growth rule during the tumultuous disinflation of 1979-\n     82--with miserable results. Luckily for all of us, the Taylor \n     rule wasn't tried during the 2008-09 financial crisis. That \n     could have been disastrous, effectively tying the Fed's hands \n     just when extraordinary monetary stimulus was most needed. \n     Should we now bet the ranch that the world will remain placid \n     forever?\n       Conservatives distrust concentrated government power--an \n     idea embraced by our Constitution. They worry that human \n     beings, who are fallible and maybe not even trustworthy, will \n     make poor policy choices. Yes, to err is human. But humans \n     can often recognize extraordinary events and try to adapt. \n     Mechanical rules can't.\n       There is another conservative principle in which I've \n     always believed: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Monetary \n     policy is one of the few things in today's Washington that \n     ``ain't broke.'' The mischievous FRAT wouldn't fix it.\n\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, this bill would \nsignificantly undermine the Federal Reserve's independence by requiring \nthe Fed to adopt a rules-based approach to monetary policy. While it is \ntrue that this bill doesn't force, by law, the Fed to follow a \nparticular formula for interest rates, it does attempt to bully the Fed \ninto following the Republicans' preferred monetary policy by hauling \nthe Fed Chair up to testify in front of Congress every time the Fed \ndeviates from the monetary policy rule dictated by this statute. This \nwould have a significant chilling and killing effect on the Fed's \ndeliberations over interest rates and inappropriately interferes with \nthe Federal Reserve's independence.\n  Let's also remember that the Taylor rule, which this bill would \ncodify, would have performed disastrously in the financial crisis that \nwe are still suffering from. Federal Reserve Chair Yellen testified \nthat, during the crisis, the Taylor rule ``would have performed just \nmiserably'' and would have led to a ``dreadful'' economic recovery.\n  But this is not the only troubling provision in this bill. Section 4 \nof the bill also needlessly overhauls the membership of the Federal \nOpen Market Committee, or FOMC. The current makeup of the FOMC, which \nis responsible for setting monetary policy, has served this country \nwell for the past 100 years. So if it isn't broken, don't try to fix \nit, and in this case, don't make it worse.\n  The New York Fed is responsible for implementing monetary policy; and \nthis special role gives the New York Fed a unique understanding of \nmonetary policy, of how markets will react to changes, and what actions \nare both feasible and effective.\n  I think that it is important to remember why the regional Fed \npresident, with responsibility for implementing monetary policy, serves \nas the Vice Chairman of the FOMC.\n  Mr. Chairman, monetary policy does not end when the FOMC announces a \ntarget interest rate. Short-term interest rates do not magically move \nto the FOMC's desired level. It is not that easy. Someone has to \nimplement monetary policy by pushing short-term interest rates toward \nthe official target rate, and that someone is the New York Fed.\n  As Richmond Fed President Jeff Lacker said just last week, raising \ninterest rates is ``pretty clear. You just write the statement and you \nmust send it to'' the New York Fed in New York. The New York Fed does \nthis primarily by buying and selling Treasury securities in the \nmarkets, which influences the supply of money in the system. Because \nthe interest rate is a function of the supply and demand for money, the \nNew York Fed controls short-term interest rates by influencing the \nsupply of money in the system. This is an incredibly important job.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield the \ngentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. The Fed's ability to control \nshort-term interest rates is what allows the Fed to set monetary \npolicy. If the markets didn't believe that the Fed had the ability to \ncontrol short-term interest rates, then the FOMC's statement about \nraising or lowering interest rates would be viewed as merely wishful \nthinking rather than an actual monetary policy.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is why the New York Fed president serves as the \nVice Chair of the FOMC, and I see no reason why this should change. So \nit is unclear what this problem is trying to fix, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this bill.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), the chairman of our Capital Markets and \nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GARRETT. I thank the chairman and I thank the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Huizenga) for all of their hard work to bring greater \ntransparency to one of the most secretive agencies in the government, \nthe Federal Reserve.\n  Mr. Chairman, earlier this year, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said: ``The \nFederal Reserve is already one of the most transparent central banks \naround the globe.''\n  Really? If that were the case, why is it we have seen the following \nheadlines in the last few years: March of last year, Forbes, ``Fed on \nTarget to Raise Interest Rates in Spring of 2015''; then in October, \n``Two Fed Officials Say Interest Rates to Rise in Mid-2015''; then in \nThe Wall Street Journal just last month, ``Fed Doubts Grow on 2015 Rate \nHike''; and then just 2 weeks later in The Wall Street Journal, ``Fed \nKeeps December Rate Hike in Play.''\n  So which is it? Mr. Chairman, a simple Google search on the subject \npulls up a range of headlines on this topic all pointing to one fact: \nThere is a great deal of confusion and uncertainty as to\n\n[[Page H8327]]\n\nhow the Federal Reserve actually conducts its own monetary policy.\n  So the bottom line is the Fed needs to follow a rule when conducting \nmonetary policy, and this bill, H.R. 3189, gives the Fed that \nflexibility to develop and implement its own rule as it sees fit and \nthen simply to report to Congress and the public, should it find the \nneed to deviate from it.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  And this will then do what? It will give us greater economic \ncertainty and moves us away from what we have seen, a Fed guessing game \nthat we have all become too used to.\n  More troubling than all this, more troubling than the monetary \npolicy, however, is the lack of transparency and accountability and \nopenness surrounding their regulatory function. Despite the Fed's \nfailure to prevent the crisis in 2008, despite their failure to even \nsee it coming, the Dodd-Frank Act bestowed upon the Fed tremendous new \nregulatory authority, authority that it is now using to try and \nregulate huge swaths of the financial system, and what they are really \ntrying to do is to stamp out all risk taking, if you will, in our \ncapital markets.\n  The Fed fails to conduct any cost-benefit analysis of the rulemaking \nin that, and it has conspired, if you will, with various secretive \ninternational bodies, like the FSB, the Financial Stability Board, in \nso doing to try to rewrite the rules, if you will, to the detriment of \nwho? Well, the American capital markets.\n  So before us today is the FORM Act, which would do what? It would \nshine the light of day, if you will, on the Fed's regulatory \noperations, so that all of us, the American public, can see actually \nwhat the powers are up to. So now more than ever we need transparency \nand accountability in the Federal Reserve.\n  I thank the chairman, and I thank the sponsor of the bill for moving \nthe underlying bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade on the Financial Services \nCommittee.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, as the ranking member of the Monetary Policy \nand Trade Subcommittee, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3189.\n  Sometimes you can disagree on a bill, and it doesn't really make much \ndifference. But this bill is extremely dangerous for many reasons. I \nwant to focus on just two provisions--my time is limited--that would be \nabsolutely disastrous for the U.S. economy:\n  One is the political audits of the Federal Reserve.\n  And, second, the computer model monetary policy, so-called Taylor \nrule.\n  Now, people think, well, what is wrong with auditing the Fed? The Fed \nis already audited, including an external audit, which all Americans \ncan review online. This bill creates a mechanism for political audits \nof the Fed. Injecting politics into monetary policy and undermining the \nindependence of the Central Bank would be an absolute disaster.\n  I am thinking just recently of the transportation bill that we passed \nout of here--and I voted for it, hoping that it can be fixed in \nconference--where the Fed is required to provide $60 billion--that is \nbillion with a B, Mr. Chairman--and then is not being allowed to \nreplenish its money supply. This is more than just tinkering in our \neconomy.\n  There is overwhelming evidence and academic research that \ndemonstrated an independent central bank anywhere in the world making \neconomic decisions and not political decisions delivers lower \ninflation, higher employment, and better economic results.\n  Currently, the U.S. enjoys low borrowing costs, and our debt is \nconsidered the gold standard. The U.S. dollar is literally the reserve \ncurrency of countries around the world.\n  If adopted, this bill would potentially undermine the exalted status \nof U.S. debt.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hardy). The time of the gentlewoman has \nexpired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. MOORE. Does anyone in America think that Congress is going to be \nmore confident at conducting monetary policy than an independent \ncentral bank?\n  Let me remind you, under the stewardship of the Republican leadership \nof this House, we have seen government shutdowns, U.S. debt default \nthreats, and fiscal austerity measures that hamper the economic \nrecovery.\n  As to this Taylor rule, I doubt that anybody over there can explain \nthe Taylor rule to you. But I tell you, had we had the Taylor rule in \nplace in the 1980s when Volcker was here, he would not have been able \nto stop the rampant inflation that we experienced. The assumptions that \nit is based on have not accounted for Volcker's inflation fighting or \nBernanke's aggressive recovery status. They couldn't have done it under \nthis Taylor rule.\n  And, furthermore, banks, Wall Street, all the investors, would set \ntheir models to the Fed commuter model, and then it would set up all \nkinds of economic disruptions if the Fed would ever deviate from the \nmodel. It would take the discretion away from the Fed.\n  I strongly oppose the bill, and I urge my colleagues to reject this \ndangerous legislation.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds to, once \nagain, encourage my colleagues to actually read the bill.\n  The Taylor rule is not mandated for the Federal Reserve. But had the \nFederal Reserve followed the Taylor rule in the first place, we would \nnot have had a financial crisis because the real estate bubble would \nnot have been inflated by the Fed keeping money too loose, too long.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the \nchairman of our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairman yielding.\n  I want to thank Chairman Huizenga for his good work on the FORM Act. \nI think this is a commonsense set of reforms that make the Federal \nReserve more accountable to the American people, which means they are \nmore accountable to the United States Congress.\n  I would ask my colleagues across the aisle and my good friend from \nWisconsin (Ms. Moore), who says that the FORM Act is one that would \nprovide for the Congress to set monetary policy, where in the FORM Act \ndoes it say that? Just because we ask for oversight, just because we \nwant to have the Federal Reserve accountable to the Congress and to the \nAmerican people, doesn't mean that Congress is taking the role of \nsetting monetary policy. Again, that is just setting up a straw man and \ntrying to knock it down in the argument.\n  This is important stuff. There is a distinct difference between the \ntwo sides of the aisle. We do think there should be accountability and \ntransparency. But my friends across the aisle will continue to advocate \nfor very powerful government institutions empowering bureaucrats that \nare not elected and that are not accountable to the American people to \nmake decisions that have huge impacts on the American people.\n  What we say on our side of the aisle is, in our form of government, \nthe people have a right to have a say in their government, which means \nyou need to empower the Congress and the Senate to have oversight over \nthese very powerful organizations.\n  That is the great debate that we are having here. We want oversight \nand transparency. We don't want to set monetary policy.\n  I chair the Committee on Oversight, and we have asked the Federal \nReserve for documents that we are entitled to in regard to an FOMC \nleak. The Federal Reserve has basically said:\n  Yes, you are entitled to these documents. But, guess what, we are not \ngoing to give them to you.\n  What is the reason, Madam Chair?\n  I don't have a really good reason. Some people asked me not to give \nthem to you. I know you are entitled, but I am not going to send them \nover to you.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield the gentleman from Wisconsin 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DUFFY. We had to go to extreme measures to get the Federal \nReserve to comply with our subpoenas to provide\n\n[[Page H8328]]\n\nus the documents that this institution is entitled to. That shows how \narrogant this institution--the Fed--really is.\n  A rules-based approach makes sense. An audit of the Fed taking a look \nback that is not political, but a retrospective look at the Fed's \nmonetary policy, makes absolute sense.\n  And to think that we are going to talk about the blackout period at \nthe Fed that, yes, you can have a blackout for monetary policy, but you \ncan't use that blackout when we are talking about the supervisory and \nprudential functions of the Federal Reserve.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I cringe at the thought that the documents from the FOMC meeting of \n2012 would be released to the Members of Congress. They would cause \nsome volatility in the markets and shake up this country and cause such \nharm that everybody ought to be alarmed at the thought.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), a \nmember of the Committee on Financial Services.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the legislation designed \nto chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve. The Federal \nReserve's objectives of maximum employment and stable prices have and \nwill remain moving targets. The legislation attacks the independent \njudgment of the Fed in a number of ways by intrusive and dangerous \nmeddling in the guise of Congressional oversight.\n  This legislation also suggests that this complex task could somehow \nbe reduced to a function of two variables. Now, I am a physicist and, \nas Albert Einstein said: ``Everything should be made as simple as \npossible but not simpler.'' In reality, economics is a field of study \nthat is constrained by numbers, but within those constraints, there lie \nlarge psychological variables and many external, often international, \nand often random variables.\n  It is obvious that any two-variable rule is far too simple to guide \nthe monetary policy of a $17 trillion national economy interconnected \nwith the economies in every part of the world.\n  It is also clear from the incoherent and counterfactual tirades that \nwe listen to in our committee after the Republican financial collapse \nof 2007, that we want to keep politics as far away as possible from \nFederal Reserve monetary policy.\n  The truth is that Federal monetary policy is already guided, but not \ndetermined, by a number of complex, macroeconomic models. It is very \nfar from ad hoc. In fact, at the heart of many of these models lies a \nvariance of what is called the Cobb-Douglas production function. And \nthe Douglas in that name is Senator Paul Douglas, an economist from the \nUniversity of Chicago before he became a Senator and the author of some \nof the most influential papers in economics. My mother worked for \nSenator Paul Douglas when he was a Senator back in the 1950s, and when \nI see the level to which economic debate has fallen in this country \nfrom Senator Paul Douglas to what we see today, it breaks my heart.\n  Now, I agree that our markets and economies have changed since the \nFederal Reserve was formed. And the system deserves study, but this \nbill is not about studying the Federal Reserve. It is about subjecting \nit to the politics and the backseat driving that it often needs to \novercome to meet its dual mandate.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill chips away at the independence of the Federal \nReserve, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, over the last 6 years, Americans have \nwatched as the Federal Reserve has embarked on an interventionist \nmonetary policy to an unprecedented degree.\n  The Fed's quantitative easing marked a dramatic departure from \ntraditional monetary policy in the United States, and it resulted in a \nmassive expansion of the Fed's balance sheet to some $4.5 trillion. To \nput this number in perspective, that is almost five times the size of \nthe Fed's balance sheet before the financial crisis when it stood at \n$800 billion. It also represents one-quarter of the total size of the \nU.S. economy.\n  Unfortunately, despite this enormous expansion and influence over the \neconomy, the Fed has persistently failed to implement measures to \nincrease transparency as to its decisionmaking.\n  Americans continue to face a sluggish economy that has fallen far \nshort of its potential, and they want to know the reasoning behind the \nFed's actions or lack thereof. This is particularly important for those \nwho have saved money for their retirement, especially grandparents on \nfixed incomes, who are being directly harmed by the Fed's decision to \nkeep rates at near zero. They want transparency and answers from their \ngovernment.\n  I suggest also our citizens should understand why the Federal Reserve \nwould take an unprecedented action to explode its balance sheet by more \nthan 400 percent over 5 years. No one--no one--knows how this \nexperiment will end up turning out.\n  The legislation that we are considering today would implement \nimportant reforms to address these issues. To start, by requiring the \nFed to explain the differences between its monetary policy decisions \nand a rigorously studied reference rule, the legislation would go far \nto improve the American public's understanding of monetary policy and \nhow it impacts their lives.\n  Similarly, by requiring a cost-benefit analysis for any regulation \nthat the Fed chooses to promulgate, it will ensure that all relevant \ncosts are properly taken into account and that the Fed considers the \nfull consequences of its actions in an open and understandable fashion.\n  To be clear, these reforms are about increasing transparency and \nimproving how the Fed communicates its policy decisions to the American \npublic. Contrary to what some claim, the legislation does not--does \nnot--mandate any particular policy decisions, nor does it impact or \nthreaten the Fed's independence in setting monetary policy. In fact, \nfew have made a better case for these sorts of reforms than Chair \nYellen herself, who stated: ``Transparency concerning Federal Reserve's \nconduct of monetary policy is desirable because better public \nunderstanding enhances the effectiveness of policy.''\n  Mr. Chairman, transparency and openness serve to strengthen a \ndemocratic republic like ours. That is what this legislation is all \nabout.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I inquire as to \nwhether or not the chairman has more speakers.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, we have at least three to four more \nspeakers.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Messer).\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3189, the \nFed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act.\n  We all recognize the importance of the Federal Reserve's independence \nwhen making monetary policy decisions. However, the American people \nrightly expect the Federal Reserve to be held accountable, too. They \ndeserve to know exactly what the Federal Reserve does and to know that \nits rulemaking process is transparent and subjected to appropriate \ncongressional oversight.\n  As a Member who represents 19 rural and suburban Indiana counties, I \nknow middle America is still struggling to get back on its feet after \nthe 2008 financial crisis. Hardworking Hoosiers know they didn't cause \nthe financial collapse, but they are frustrated because the folks who \ndid cause the crisis--bad actors in private industry and ineffective \nFederal banking regulators--haven't been held accountable at all.\n  The status quo is unacceptable. The Fed should be accountable and \ntransparent in its decisionmaking, and H.R. 3189 is an important step \ntowards that goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n\n[[Page H8329]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer).\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the \nmuch-needed Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act.\n  Minnesotans, like Robert from Becker and Kevin from Elk River, are \ncorrect in that the Fed is an ineffective and isolated government \nbureaucracy that is out of touch with the common man and the long-term \nneeds of the American people.\n  Yes, quantitative easing may have been a boon for a few. However, \nthree rounds of this reckless tactic have inflated the Fed's balance \nsheet to more than $4.5 trillion, threatening the economic stability of \nour Nation and the American Dream for many.\n  Equally problematic is the secrecy surrounding the Fed's discount \nwindow operations, open market operations, and agreements with foreign \ngovernments, which prevent market actors from knowing the information \nthey need in order to prudently invest in the future.\n  In the past, Congressman Ron Paul led the charge against the Fed with \nhis Audit the Fed bill. Today we are building upon his legacy \nlegislation. I would like to thank my colleague, Congressman Huizenga, \nfor introducing the Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act.\n  Not only does this new legislation include Audit the Fed, but it also \nrequires the Fed establish a monetary policy rule that will enable us \nto have a better idea of where the Fed is likely to move monetary \npolicy. Additionally, the bill limits taxpayers' exposure to bailouts \nby responsibly tightening the Fed's emergency lending authority.\n  Furthermore, this bill requires the Fed, before implementing any \nrule, to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. This will give the American \npeople a true sense of the economic impact any Fed proposal will have. \nIt would also mandate the Fed, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \nand Treasury to disclose any positions they plan to take at \ninternational regulatory negotiations, enabling the American people and \nCongress to weigh in on international regulations that often adversely \nimpact American business.\n  Finally, this legislation would clarify the Federal Open Market \nCommittee blackout period, mandate the Fed to disclose employees' \nsalaries, require the Chair of the Fed to participate in congressional \nhearings quarterly, and give more power to local district Fed Bank \npresidents over open market operations.\n  I understand that many of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle may be skeptical about reforming the Fed. However, it is \nimportant to remember that this legislation only enhances oversight, \ncommunication, and transparency. This legislation will in no way take \naway the Federal Reserve's control of monetary policy, but it will \nprovide us the tools to ensure that sound policies are enacted.\n  Mr. Chairman, again I thank Mr. Huizenga and Chairman Hensarling for \ntheir work on this bill. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining on both sides?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentlewoman from California has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Huizenga), the author of the FORM Act.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I am taking this second \nopportunity to rise because I think we have heard a lot of \nmisinformation out there, and there is a lot of fog that has been \ngetting thrown up into the air.\n  This is about transparency. This is about accountability. This is not \nabout Congress' coming in and dictating to the Fed how to do business. \nThey, the Fed, will set a benchmark that they will then be measured \nagainst. It is not we. It is not Congress saying what they will or will \nnot do. It is they, themselves. That seems pretty reasonable.\n  It also seems very reasonable to me that, if we are ever finding \nourselves in a position in which there are these massive bank bailouts \nthat some would claim need to be done again, we would have a belt and \nsuspenders way to approach it in that we would say not just two or \nthree or four people are going to decide whether that is going to \nhappen, but that we would actually get the regional Fed Bank Governors \ninvolved in that as well. We would say that 9 of the 12 of them have to \nagree with the decisions that are being made.\n  We make sure that there is a redundancy, that we are not just rushing \nand plunging headlong. Ultimately, the goal is to make sure that we \nnever have that situation happen again so that we never find ourselves \nin that situation of having to even have the discussion about whether \nwe would have massive bank bailouts, which is what happened in 2009 \nunder this administration.\n  Again, I appreciate the effort that has been put into this. There are \na lot of small details to it, but there are a lot of broad themes to \nit. At the end of the day, we know that this is the best thing not only \nfor Congress, not only for the Fed, but, ultimately, for the American \npeople as they are demanding us to hold an organization accountable \nthat we in Congress created not in an unreasonable fashion, but in a \nway that is balanced, transparent, and that ultimately helps the \nstability of the U.S. economy.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the \nbalance of my time.\n\n  I am going to take the unusual step of reading a letter from Janet \nYellen, the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nBank. I take this unusual step because the letter is so well written \nand explains in such a profound way why the bill that is before us is \ndangerous and problematic.\n  ``Dear Mr. Speaker and Madam Leader: I am writing regarding the House \nof Representatives' consideration of H.R. 3189, the Fed Oversight \nReform and Modernization Act''--known as the FORM Act--``The FORM Act \nwould severely impair the Federal Reserve's ability to carry out its \ncongressional mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices \nand would undermine our ability to implement policies that are in the \nbest interest of American businesses and consumers. This legislation \nwould severely damage the U.S. economy were it to become law.\n  ``There are a number of harmful provisions in the FORM Act, but the \nprovisions concerning the conduct of monetary policy are especially \ntroubling. Section 2 of the bill would require the Federal Reserve to \nestablish a mathematical formula or `directive policy rule' that would \ndictate how the Federal Open Market Committee adjusts the stance of \nmonetary policy at every FOMC meeting. The Government Accountability \nOffice (GAO) would be responsible for determining whether the rule \nadopted by the FOMC met all the criteria in the legislation. Any time \nthe FOMC was judged not to be in compliance with the GAO-approved rule, \nthe GAO would be required to conduct a full review of monetary policy \nand submit a report to the Congress. Moreover, the GAO would also be \nrequired to conduct a full review of monetary policy and report to the \nCongress any time the FOMC changed its policy rule.\n  ``These provisions are significantly flawed for a number of reasons. \nMost importantly, the provisions effectively cast aside the bipartisan \napproach toward monetary policy oversight developed by the Congress in \nthe late 1970s. Under that approach, the Congress establishes the long-\nrun objectives for monetary policy but affords the Federal Reserve a \nconsiderable degree of independence in how it goes about achieving \nthose statutory goals, thus ensuring that the conduct of monetary \npolicy is insulated from political influence. This framework is now \nrecognized as a fundamental principle of central banking around the \nworld. The provisions of the FORM Act, in contrast, would effectively \nput the Congress and the GAO squarely in the role of reviewing short-\nrun monetary policy decisions and in a position to, in real time, \ninfluence the monetary policy deliberations leading to those decisions.\n  ``Conducting monetary policy by strictly adhering to the \nprescriptions of a simple rule would lead to poor economic outcomes. \nThere is no consensus among economists or policymakers\n\n[[Page H8330]]\n\nabout a simple policy rule that is best suited to cover a wide range of \nscenarios. For example, even during the period known as the Great \nModeration, in the 1980s and 1990s, when a simple rule might have been \nexpected to work well, the actual level of the Federal funds rate often \ndiverged substantially from the level prescribed by the reference rule \nincluded in the FORM Act. Indeed, for much of this period, monetary \npolicy was actually tighter than what would have been the case under \nthat rule.\n  ``Even more tellingly, no simple policy rule has yet been devised \nthat would adequately address the effective lower bound on the policy \nrate--a constraint that has been binding in the United States since \nlate 2008. Had the FOMC been compelled to operate under a simple policy \nrule for the past six and a half years, the unemployment experience of \nthat period would have been substantially more painful than it already \nwas, and inflation would be even further below the FOMC's 2 percent \nobjective. Indeed, a recent study by the Federal Reserve economists \nsuggests that the current unemployment rate would still be above 6 \npercent and inflation would now be running somewhat below zero, if the \nFOMC had not taken the actions it did but rather had followed the \nreference rule and made it clear that it would do so in the future. In \nother words, millions of Americans would have suffered unnecessary \nspells of joblessness over this period, generating enormous amounts of \npersonal and collective damage that could have been avoided--and, in \nfact, was avoided because we had the latitude to use our available \ntools responsibly and forcefully.\n  ``In addition to allowing the GAO to conduct a review specifically \nrelated to the `directive policy rule,' Section 13 of the FORM Act also \nallows GAO to more broadly review and analyze the monetary policy \ndecisions of the Federal Reserve at any time. This provision would \npoliticize monetary policy and bring short-term political pressures \ninto the deliberations of the FOMC by putting into place real-time \nsecond guessing of policy decisions. Such action would undermine the \nindependence of the Federal Reserve and likely lead to an increase in \ninflation fears and market interest rates, a diminished status of the \ndollar in global financial markets, and reduced economic and financial \nstability.\n  ``The provision is based on a false premise--that the Federal Reserve \nis not subject to an audit. To the contrary, under existing law, the \nfinancial statements of the Federal Reserve System are audited annually \nby an independent accounting firm under the supervision of the \nInspector General for the Board.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  ``These audited financial statements are made publicly available and \nprovided to Congress annually. The GAO may also conduct an audit of the \nBoard's financial statements and of transactions that the Federal \nReserve conducts in the course of its lending and other activities. In \naddition, each week, the Federal Reserve publishes its balance sheet \nand charts of recent balance sheet trends as well as every security the \nFederal Reserve holds along with each security's CUSIP number. \nMoreover, as specified in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act, the Federal Reserve now releases detailed \ntransaction level information for all open market operations and \ndiscount window with a 2-year lag.\n  ``I am concerned about other provisions in the FORM Act as well, \nincluding the debilitating restrictions on the Federal Reserve's \nemergency lending authorities. In the face of a future crisis--where \ncollapse of the financial system is on the scale of the Great \nDepression or the recent financial crisis--I believe it is essential \nthat the Federal Reserve have the emergency lending powers necessary in \nthose circumstances to support the flow of credit to households and \nbusinesses and mitigate harm to the U.S. economy. The FORM Act would \nessentially repeal the Federal Reserve's remaining ability to act in a \ncrisis. I am also deeply troubled by provisions related to the Federal \nReserve's supervisory responsibilities, particularly those that would \nundermine the strength and effectiveness our stress tests and impede \nour ability to advocate internationally for standards that are in the \nbest interest of U.S. businesses and consumers.\n  ``Throughout my career and certainly during my many years working \nwith the Federal Reserve System, I have been an advocate for greater \nopenness and transparency. As Chair, I remain committed to these \nimportant issues. Accountability and transparency of public \ninstitutions are critical in a democratic society. Unfortunately, the \nFORM Act attempts to increase transparency and accountability through \nmisguided provisions that would expose the Federal Reserve to short-\nterm political pressures. For these reasons, I urge the House not to \nadopt the FORM Act. The bill would severely impair the Federal \nReserve's ability to carry out its congressional mandate and would be a \ngrave mistake, detrimental to the economy and the American people.''\n  I don't think it could be better stated. I think the letter that I \njust read from Janet Yellen tells it all. It simply warns us about the \ndanger of this bill. It not only warns us. It does it in such a way \nthat everybody can understand it and would not want to put this economy \nand this country at such a risky position. I am hopeful that the \nMembers will hear this. We will make copies available to everyone. Vote \nagainst this bill.\n  Furthermore, there is a Statement of Administration Policy from the \nExecutive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget:\n  ``H.R. 3189 would establish requirements for policy rules, codify \nblackout periods of the Federal Open Market Committee, establish a \ncost-benefit requirement for other rulemakings by the Federal Reserve \nBoard, and establish numerous, burdensome reporting requirements for \nthe Federal Reserve Board and its members. The Administration therefore \nstrongly opposes H.R. 3189.\n  ``The Federal Reserve is an independent entity designed to be free \nfrom political pressures, and its independence is key to its \ncredibility and its ability to act in the long-term interest of the \nNation's economic health. One of the most problematic provisions in the \nbill would require the Comptroller General to audit the conduct of \nmonetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open \nMarket Committee. The operations of the Federal Reserve are already \nsubject to numerous audit requirements that ensure it is accountable to \nthe Congress and the American people. The only aspect of the Federal \nReserve's operations not subject to audit is its monetary policy \ndecisionmaking, and for good reason. Subjecting the Federal Reserve's \nexercise of monetary policy authority to audits based on political \nwhims of Members of the Congress--of either party--threatens one of the \ncentral pillars of the Nation's financial system and economy, and would \nalmost certainly have negative impacts on the Federal Reserve's work to \npromote price stability and full employment.\n  ``H.R. 3189 also would impose numerous, burdensome requirements for \nthe Federal Reserve Board rulemaking authorities, including the \nimposition of a duplicative requirement that the Federal Reserve Board \nundertake a proscriptive cost-benefit analysis and a post-adoption \nimpact assessment when promulgating rules. When a Federal agency, \nincluding an independent agency such as the Federal Reserve, \npromulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust \nsubstantive and procedural requirements of Federal law, including the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the \nPaperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act, among other \nstatutes. Additionally, Executive Order 13579 encourages independent \nregulatory agencies to conduct reasoned cost-benefit analysis, engage \nin public participation to the extent feasible, and conduct a \nsystematic retrospective review of regulations.''\n  I can't read it all, but if the President was presented with H.R. \n3189, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, the ranking member for the last 13 \nminutes has let us know that the President and his bureaucratic \nappointees don't want any more transparency and accountability. I don't \nparticularly find a news flash in that.\n\n[[Page H8331]]\n\n  I have the greatest amount of respect for Chair Yellen. I both like \nand respect her. I have never encountered a bureaucrat who didn't want \nmore money, more power, less transparency, and less accountability. She \nis no different. The Dodd-Frank Act has vastly expanded the powers of \nthe Federal Reserve.\n  Mr. Chairman, for all intents and purposes, they have the ability to \nactually come in and de facto manage any large financial institution in \nAmerica. The government has that power. It is a frightening power that \nhas been given by Dodd-Frank, and transparency and accountability is \ndemanded.\n  In addition, we have a Federal Reserve taking monetary policy and \ntools to a place it has never been before. At a bare minimum, it owes \nthe people's elected Representatives, the Congress, some transparency \non why it is doing what it is doing.\n  I would, yet again, encourage all Members to actually read the bill \nbefore they claim to know what is in the bill. The Federal Reserve \nmaintains its monetary policy independence, as it should. But it must \nexplain to the rest of us what that is and why they choose to deviate \nfrom it if they believe economic circumstances warrant. Again, if they \nwant to base monetary policy on the Taylor rule, so be it. If they want \nto base it on a rousing game of rock, paper, and scissors, so be it. \nThe American people demand answers because this economy is still \nunderperforming. It is not working for working people. This has to \nchange.\n  We have had the largest economic monetary policy stimulus in our \nNation's history, but yet it does not work for working people, and the \npoor continue to follow behind.\n  All this bill by the gentleman of Michigan does is bring about needed \ntransparency and accountability to the most powerful economic agency in \ngovernment today. It is demanded by the vast increases in power by the \nDodd-Frank Act. The American people deserve answers. We should enact \nit.\n  I encourage all Members to vote for H.R. 3189, the FORM Act.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Committee on Financial Services, printed in the bill, an amendment \nin the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee \nPrint 114-35, modified by the amendment printed in the part B of House \nReport 114-341, is adopted.

ESTABLISHMENT OF A CENTENNIAL MONETARY COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Centennial Monetary Commission Act of 2015''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Constitution endows Congress with the power ``to \n     coin money, regulate the value thereof''.\n       (2) Following the financial crisis known as the Panic of \n     1907, Congress established the National Monetary Commission \n     to provide recommendations for the reform of the financial \n     and monetary systems of the United States.\n       (3) Incorporating several of the recommendations of the \n     National Monetary Commission, Congress created the Federal \n     Reserve System in 1913. As currently organized, the Federal \n     Reserve System consists of the Board of Governors in \n     Washington, District of Columbia, and the Federal Reserve \n     Banks organized into 12 districts around the United States. \n     The stockholders of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks include \n     national and certain State-chartered commercial banks, which \n     operate on a fractional reserve basis.\n       (4) Originally, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System a \n     monetary mandate to provide an elastic currency, within the \n     context of a gold standard, in response to seasonal \n     fluctuations in the demand for currency.\n       (5) Congress also gave the Federal Reserve System a \n     financial stability mandate to serve as the lender of last \n     resort to solvent but illiquid banks during a financial \n     crisis.\n       (6) In 1977, Congress changed the monetary mandate of the \n     Federal Reserve System to a dual mandate for maximum \n     employment and stable prices.\n       (7) Empirical studies and historical evidence, both within \n     the United States and in other countries, demonstrate that \n     price stability is desirable because both inflation and \n     deflation damage the economy.\n       (8) The economic challenge of recent years--most notably \n     the bursting of the housing bubble, the financial crisis of \n     2008, and the ensuing anemic recovery--have occurred at great \n     cost in terms of lost jobs and output.\n       (9) Policymakers are reexamining the structure and \n     functioning of financial institutions and markets to \n     determine what, if any, changes need to be made to place the \n     financial system on a stronger, more sustainable path going \n     forward.\n       (10) The Federal Reserve System has taken extraordinary \n     actions in response to the recent economic challenges.\n       (11) The Federal Open Market Committee has engaged in \n     multiple rounds of quantitative easing, providing \n     unprecedented liquidity to financial markets, while \n     committing to holding short-term interest rates low for a \n     seemingly indefinite period, and pursuing a policy of credit \n     allocation by purchasing Federal agency debt and mortgage-\n     backed securities.\n       (12) In the wake of the recent extraordinary actions of the \n     Federal Reserve System, Congress--consistent with its \n     constitutional responsibilities and as it has done \n     periodically throughout the history of the United States--has \n     once again renewed its examination of monetary policy.\n       (13) Central in such examination has been a renewed look at \n     what is the most proper mandate for the Federal Reserve \n     System to conduct monetary policy in the 21st century.\n       (c) Establishment of a Centennial Monetary Commission.--\n     There is established a commission to be known as the \n     ``Centennial Monetary Commission'' (in this section referred \n     to as the ``Commission'').\n       (d) Study and Report on Monetary Policy.--\n       (1) Study.--The Commission shall--\n       (A) examine how United States monetary policy since the \n     creation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System in 1913 has affected the performance of the United \n     States economy in terms of output, employment, prices, and \n     financial stability over time;\n       (B) evaluate various operational regimes under which the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the \n     Federal Open Market Committee may conduct monetary policy in \n     terms achieving the maximum sustainable level of output and \n     employment and price stability over the long term, \n     including--\n       (i) discretion in determining monetary policy without an \n     operational regime;\n       (ii) price level targeting;\n       (iii) inflation rate targeting;\n       (iv) nominal gross domestic product targeting (both level \n     and growth rate);\n       (v) the use of monetary policy rules; and\n       (vi) the gold standard;\n       (C) evaluate the use of macro-prudential supervision and \n     regulation as a tool of monetary policy in terms of achieving \n     the maximum sustainable level of output and employment and \n     price stability over the long term;\n       (D) evaluate the use of the lender-of-last-resort function \n     of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as a \n     tool of monetary policy in terms of achieving the maximum \n     sustainable level of output and employment and price \n     stability over the long term;

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in part C of House Report 114-341.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, line 8, strike ``Not''.\n       Page 5, line 9, insert the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Not''.\n       Page 5, after line 15, insert the following:\n       ``(2) Exception.--The requirements of paragraph (1) shall \n     not apply if the Federal Open Market Committee determines at \n     the end of a meeting that the current conditions represent a \n     significant divergence from the goals of maximum employment \n     and stable prices described in section 2A.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 529, the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Heck) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Thus far, this has been an interesting debate that seems to have \nmostly revolved around a philosophical point. On the one hand, you have \narguments for increased transparency and accountability. On the other \nhand, you have arguments against increased political interference by \nthis institution. I have always proceeded with the assumption that \nphilosophical debates are irreconcilable in a lot of regards because \nyou have to presume that the other side has a point of view.\n  This is not why I oppose the underlying bill. Although I hasten to \nadd, why anybody would ever want to give more authority and control \nover the levers of the economy to this institution, with its track \nrecord in the last several years, including government shutdowns and \nthe like, is beyond me. Again, it is a philosophical debate.\n  Here is what is not debatable: what is proposed in this bill doesn't \nwork. It does not work. Let's back up. Essentially, color it any way \nyou want, this bill argues for the adoption of the so-called Taylor \nrule. What is that?\n  The Taylor rule was devised by Professor Taylor of Stanford in the \n1990s, looking back at the experience of the economy and what the Fed \nhad done using a mixture of GDP, GDP potential and inflation, and he \nderived a formula. The problem is, again, it does not work. That is why \nI have offered this amendment, which would provide the Fed the ability \nto opt out, if we get to a stressful situation where clearly the \napplication of the Taylor rule wasn't working.\n  Here is the deal. I can prove to you that the Taylor rule wouldn't \nwork. Let me show you. We have had a couple of instances in recent \nhistory in which we can test the application of the Taylor rule, both \nagainst the Fed's mission to achieve price stability as well as achieve \nfull employment.\n  This chart tracks the years 1979 to 1983. The red line is what the \nchair of the Fed, Mr. Volcker, utilized in the way of the actual Fed \nfund rates. The blue line is the Taylor rule. You can see that for many \nyears, Mr. Volcker opted for a 5-percent increase over what the Taylor \nrule would have been. You can also see that Mr. Volcker was right, that \nhe broke inflation.\n  Now, unless we want to return to 12 to 14 percent home mortgages and \na 17 to 18 percent inflation rate, we should----\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  Quickly, here is the chart for the most recent economic crisis. The \nred\n\n[[Page H8338]]\n\nline is what the Fed did. The Taylor rule is the blue line. This is \nunemployment.\n  The Taylor rule would have provided, beginning back in 2010, \nsubstantially higher interest rates when unemployment rates were still \nunacceptably high. The Taylor rule doesn't work. Adopt my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to the \namendment. The gentleman has clearly stated he doesn't like the \nunderlying bill, so his amendment simply guts the underlying bill and \nallows the Fed to opt out of the underlying bill.\n  I have listened carefully to the gentleman's interest and what he \nrecited about the Taylor rule, but again I would encourage him to read \nthe bill because he would then know, as I suspect that he does, that \nthe Federal Reserve under the FORM Act is not mandated to follow the \nTaylor rule. It is simply a comparison. So, if the Taylor rule is as \nbad as the gentleman claims it will be, then the FORM Act will reveal \nthat to all the world. All the world will know this.\n  However, I think if we study economic history carefully, what we will \ndiscover is that, when the Fed used a more predictable, rules-based \nmonetary policy to where investors and businesses actually had some \nidea of what interest rates would be, the economy would flourish, as it \ndid during the great moderation.\n  So again, the FORM Act allows the Fed to use any monetary policy it \nwishes, to change the policy, to deviate from the policy, but it has to \ncommunicate that to the rest. That is essentially what the FORM Act \nsays. It is about communication. It doesn't tell them how to conduct \nthe policy. It does tell them how to communicate the policy to the \nAmerican people, who deserve to know this from the single most \nimportant economic agency of government today.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman, the author of the FORM Act.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. I appreciate the chairman yielding to me on \nthis.\n  Exactly what you were talking about is the case. This is merely a \nbenchmark guideline to measure against. In fact, in committee, when \nChair Yellen was testifying in front of our committee, I suggested \nthat, if they saw problems, that they would then put a floor or put a \nceiling on any movement that could happen within that timeframe. I \nthought I gave a very helpful suggestion that we call it the Yellen \nrule at that point, and she can claim credit for doing exactly what is \nbeing discussed.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Well, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on \nthis.\n  Again, I have portions of the act in front of me. The bill \nstipulates: ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to require.'' That \nis what the act says on a formal policy directive. ``If the Federal \nOpen Market Committee determines that such plans cannot or should not \nbe achieved due to changing market conditions.''\n  Again this is about communication. When we have an economy that is \nunderperforming, where had we only had the average recovery in the \npost-war era every man, woman, and child in America would have $6,000 \nmore, millions would be back to work, I think the American people \ndeserve to ask some hard questions.\n  This is such an incredible red herring with this argument on \nindependence. Mr. Chairman, the Board of Governors have 14-year terms--\nsecond only to lifetime appointments to the bench--14-year terms, \nindependent funding of the congressional appropriations process. And so \nnow we don't want them to answer some questions.\n  Will their feelings get hurt if they are asked some tough questions \nby Members of Congress? Are they that delicate that they can't conduct \nmonetary policy if in an open committee hearing they have to answer \nquestions? I think the American people, Mr. Chairman, are saying: Give \nme a break.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Where is it? Bring it. If it is not the Taylor rule, it is some other \nrule that is going to work magically to achieve price stability and \nfull employment, you think it exists somewhere?\n  The Taylor rule is what is essentially referenced in the bill. You \nsay: But it isn't required.\n  Okay. There is a better rule? Show your hand. It is time to lay your \ncards down. If there is actually some kind of mathematical magic \nformula that can always trump human judgment and changing economic \ncircumstances, lay it on the table. But you haven't done it.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. I would be glad to yield to the gentleman \nfrom Texas out of my extreme respect for both you and the prime sponsor \nof the bill.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Whether you call it a rule or a method or approach, \nthe Fed is already doing something. They are looking at variables, and \nthey are making decisions. All we are asking is that they communicate \nthat to the rest of the American people. Ask them what their rule is. \nWe would like to know. That is what the FORM Act is all about.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Their rule is to break the back of inflation. \nTheir rule is to achieve increased employment. That is the rule they \nuse. Exercising, yes, judgment based upon ever-changing economic \ncircumstances.\n  But to suggest that you can arbitrarily apply a formula without being \nwilling to advance the formula, you want disclosure, you want \ntransparency? Start with you. Put your rule on the table.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Again, it is up to the Fed. You can't argue this both \nways. The FORM Act is not imposing a rule. The Fed says that it is data \ndependent. What is the data? What is the reaction function? Tell us \nwhat you are doing. If you decide tomorrow morning you want to do it \ndifferently, that is fine. Just tell the rest of us.\n  In this economy that continues to underperform, an economy that \ncontinues to suffer, monetary policy ought to be made clear and \ntransparent to the American people. That is what the FORM Act demands.\n  I yield the remaining 15 seconds to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nHuizenga).\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I don't trust Congress enough \nfor us to come up with the rule, which is why I wrote into the bill \nthat the Fed develops the rule, the guideline, the benchmark that they \nput forward. We know they do this already. They look at the Taylor \nrule, they look at a number of other models, and they then go advance \nforward with the best policy that they think is the right thing. We are \njust asking them to communicate that to Congress and the American \npeople.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I urge a rejection of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to my \nfriend from Michigan, you didn't put the formula in the bill because it \ndoesn't exist. If it did, you would have put it in. If there would have \nbeen an absolute magic formula that would keep this economy at full \nemployment and price stability, we would have it on the table, but no \nsuch formula exists. That is why you didn't put it in the bill. It \ndoesn't exist.\n  Adopt the amendment. Allow the Fed to do the job to achieve price \nstability and full employment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Woodall). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Heck of Washington\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part C of House Report 114-341.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page H8339]]\n\n\n  \n\n       Page 6, line 25, strike ``and''.\n       Page 7, line 3, strike the period at the end and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       Page 7, after line 3, insert the following:\n       ``(9) include a plan to use the most accurate data, subject \n     to all historical revisions, for inputs into the Directive \n     Policy Rule and the Reference Policy Rule.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 529, the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Heck) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is to ask the Fed to \nbuild a time machine because, frankly, that is the only way that this \nbill works.\n  You see, the fact of the matter is that, when Mr. Taylor, Professor \nTaylor, devised his study, which was groundbreaking, was important, he \ndid so in the 1990s, looking back over the previous 10 years which, as \nI indicated earlier, was an unusually fairly stable period of time, \nunusually fairly stable, not an exceptional performance, good or bad, \nin the economy.\n  He did so with the benefit of data that had been updated over time, \nbecause, you see, the Bureau of Economic Analysis doesn't just do one \nfixed number that people get to rely on. In fact, in the first year \nthey put out not one, not two, but three updates, called the advanced \nestimate, the preliminary estimate, and the final estimate.\n  But wait, there is more, to quote the Ronco ad. The next year they \nupdate again. That is called the annual reestimate. But wait, there is \nmore. Every 5 years they do a benchmark reestimate. That is the data \nthat Professor Taylor had the advantage of.\n  In essence, to ask the Fed to utilize or apply the Taylor rule or any \nsuch thing like it, which does not exist, is to ask them to have the \nbenefit of data which is not final.\n  I don't know about you, but every month when the unemployment numbers \ncome out, I have begun to view them pretty skeptically over the years. \nWe all know the reason for that: because they get revised so much--so \nmuch.\n  At the beginning of President Obama's first term, when he indicated, \nas is often cited, that he would act to get unemployment no higher than \n8 percent, he was doing so on the basis of the first estimate, which \nsaid it was 6.7 percent or something like that. The revision was 7.8 \npercent 3 months later.\n  So the fact of the matter is the Taylor rule or anything like it has \nthe advantage of hindsight, which no rule can fully incorporate.\n  The purpose of this amendment--vote for it, vote against it--is if \nyou want to do this, build yourself a time machine, because that is the \nonly way you can reasonably, with any sense of scholarship and solid \nresearch, be able to devise a formula that would work because we don't \nknow the conditions until quite sometime later.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, just to throw my friend and colleague a \ncurve ball, I will support his amendment. Although, I must admit, I am \nsomewhat surprised and shocked, given the debate of the last, that he \nwould want to interfere in the independence of the Fed and require them \nto use fully revised data.\n  I will, nonetheless, support the amendment, notwithstanding the \nintrusion upon their independence.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I am not often speechless in \nthe face of my friend from Texas' remarks.\n  Look, we cannot perform a calculation without accurate data. If you \nare going to join me and throw in with H. G. Wells and a great heritage \nof both literature and cinema history regarding time travel, then I can \ndo nothing but shockingly accept your gracious support of this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part C of House Report 114-341.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 44, line 25, insert ``annually'' after ``shall''.\n       Page 45, line 7, strike ``the audit'' and insert ``each \n     audit''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 529, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Grayson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would simply make the one-\ntime audit required by section 13 of this bill an annual audit. A 2011 \nGAO audit of the Fed, the only independent Fed audit in its 102-year \nhistory, detailed how the United States provided at least $16 trillion \nin loans to bail out American and foreign banks and businesses.\n  With an annual audit, Congress is at a great advantage in how to \navoid waste, fraud, and abuse at the Fed. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from \nFlorida for his amendment. I rise in support of the amendment.\n  The FORM Act provides for GAO audits of the Federal Reserve but is \nsilent as to the frequency of when audits should occur. I think the \ngentleman makes a compelling case.\n  This will clarify that GAO should audit the Fed on an annual basis, \nand it will serve to help inform Congress and the American people with \nregular updates on the Fed's activities. It will promote greater \ntransparency and accountability, which is the objective of the bill.\n  I urge all Members to adopt the amendment. I thank the gentleman for \nhis leadership here.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

AMENDMENT TO FEDERAL RESERVE DISTRICTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2 of the Federal Reserve Act, (12 \n     U.S.C. 222 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``twelve'' each place such term appears and \n     inserting ``fifteen'';\n       (2) by inserting after the fourth sentence the following: \n     ``One such Federal reserve districts shall be for Northern \n     California (located in San Francisco), one such district \n     shall be for Southern California (located in Los Angeles), \n     and one such district shall be for Florida (located in \n     Orlando). The border between the two California districts \n     shall be drawn so that the districts are contiguous and \n     compact, the population of the districts is approximately \n     equal, and the districts do not divide any California county \n     border as in existence on the date of enactment of this \n     sentence.''\n\n[[Page H8340]]\n\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 16 of such Act is \n     amended by striking ``twelve'' and inserting ``fifteen''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 529, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Grayson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase the number of \nFederal Reserve Districts from 12 to 15. The three new districts would \nbe for northern California, southern California, and Florida; based in \nSan Francisco, Los Angeles, and Orlando. No current Federal Reserve \nbanks would be relocated as a result.\n  Take a look at the map to my right and you will see a map that is \nover a century old. The Federal Reserve Districts have not been updated \nsignificantly since they were first established in 1913--102 years ago. \nIt is time to bring our Federal Reserve Districts into the 21st \ncentury.\n  Right now, for instance, one district represents everywhere from Utah \nto the Pacific Ocean, including Alaska and Hawaii. The three new \ndistricts would be centered in three of the fastest growing regions of \nour country in terms of both population and economic growth.\n  In 1913, the 12th district, based in San Francisco, had only 6 \npercent of the population of the United States. In 2000, it had 19 \npercent, or 65 million Americans.\n  As you can see from the next chart, districts designed originally a \ncentury ago to have equal population have reached the point where one \ndistrict has 10 times the population of another district.\n  In the case of the Western district, it now includes a total of nine \nStates jumbled together, California and eight surrounding States. \nSimilarly, the district including Florida and the neighboring States \nhas grown to 45 million Americans--twice the average. It combines \nFlorida and five neighboring States. It is time for the Fed to \nrecognize this change in where Americans live.\n  A similar change has been made in the court systems over the year. \nThe tenth circuit was taken out of the eighth circuit when the \npopulation increased to the point where it was no longer sustainable as \na single circuit court.\n  Similarly, the 11th circuit--my circuit--was carved out of the fifth \ncircuit for exactly the same reason. But the Fed districts have \nremained static now for a century.\n  I am proud to introduce this amendment to modernize the Federal \nService to more accurately reflect who we are as Americans and where we \nlive and where we work.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters).\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, while I appreciate the \nspirit of the amendment, which seeks to ensure that the most populous \nregions of the country have adequate representation within the Federal \nReserve system, I am concerned that the amendment does not fully \ncontemplate the implications of adding the additional reserve \ndistricts.\n  For example, the amendment would add a Federal Reserve District \nheadquartered in San Francisco, a city which is already home to a \nFederal Reserve bank. Furthermore, the current Federal Reserve Bank of \nSan Francisco has a number of branches located throughout the West, \nincluding one in Los Angeles, a city which would be home to another \nFederal Reserve Bank under the gentleman from Florida's amendment.\n  The amendment also does not address how the new Reserve Banks would \nparticipate in the current rotation on the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, a matter which is prescribed by law under section 12(a) of \nthe Federal Reserve Act.\n  Rather than add an additional Reserve Bank or additional Reserve \nBanks to the Federal Reserve system, I respectfully submit that the \ndesired effects of this amendment to provide greater diverse range of \nviews across our country could more usefully be achieved without \nincreasing the number of regional Reserve Banks and within the confines \nof the current system.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Florida has expired.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I want to--I guess to put it civilly--\ngently oppose the amendment from the gentleman from Florida.\n  I think the gentleman from Florida does make some good points. These \nFederal Reserve Districts, in some respects, are anachronistic. They \nwere derived from our early 20th century history. I do believe that it \nis a subject that needs to be looked at. I am just not prepared to say \ntoday that the gentleman has necessarily gotten it right.\n  There is probably something very humorous today about siting a \nFederal Reserve Bank in the same city as Disney World. I will refrain \nfrom making any such humorous references.\n  But, again, I think the gentleman makes a good point. I would like \nthis issue to go through regular order. I believe it is a matter that \nChairman Huizenga and the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee of our \nfull committee will be taking a look at: Are these appropriate cities \nfor the Federal Reserve Banks to be sited?\n  So, again, I thank the gentleman for bringing the matter to the \nHouse's attention, I thank him for bringing it to my attention, but I \nam not prepared to say that San Francisco, L.A., or Orlando are \nnecessarily the places that Federal Reserve Banks ought to end up, \nwithout going through regular order.\n  So I want to look at the matter, but I would otherwise encourage \nMembers at this time to reject the amendment of the gentleman from \nFlorida. I would ask the House to reject the amendment at this time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. King of Iowa\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part C of House Report 114-341.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end the following:\n\n     SEC. 17. PUBLIC TRANSCRIPTS OF FOMC MEETINGS.\n\n       Section 12A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 263), as \n     amended by this Act, is further amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(e) Public Transcripts of Meetings.--The Committee \n     shall--\n       ``(1) record all meetings of the Committee; and\n       ``(2) make the full transcript of such meetings available \n     to the public.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 529, the gentleman \nfrom Iowa (Mr. King) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, amendment No. 6 is an amendment that \naddresses the transparency that we have heard much dialogue about in \nthe debate here on the floor, especially from members of the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  It is an amendment that requires that the records of the Federal Open \nMarket Committee be recorded, in the same fashion that our committee \nmeetings are recorded, and made public.\n  The FOMC sets the monetary policy for the U.S. economy, but there is \nno law that compels the Fed to release FOMC meeting transcripts to the \npublic. The details of the meetings are crucial for an accurate \nunderstanding of how the Fed views the state of the economy and the \nreasoning behind Fed policy and actions. That has also been a \nsignificant part of our debate here with the underlying bill.\n  So, my amendment directs them to keep a transcript, keep a record, \nand make that record public. It compels those transcripts to be made \npublic so that those of us here in the United States Congress, but also \npeople in households and businesses across the country, can have a look \ninto the decisions that are made and especially the rationale behind \nthose decisions of the full proceedings of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee.\n\n[[Page H8341]]\n\n  Every congressional hearing makes these transcripts publicly \navailable. That is what my amendment does. It requires the FOMC to do \nthe same. And I would urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition \nto the gentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia). The gentlewoman is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, the amendment would, at \nbest, duplicate the Federal Reserve's current policy regarding the \ndisclosure of transcripts and, at worst, falsely imply that the Federal \nReserve would be prohibited from exercising its discretion in \ndetermining when to release FOMC meeting transcripts in accordance with \nprudent monetary policy. After all, communication in and of itself is a \nkey monetary policy tool, and it would be unwise to tie the Fed's hands \nwhen it comes to using it.\n  Furthermore, any failure to allow the Federal Reserve to strike the \nappropriate balance between transparency and the disclosure of \npotentially market-moving information, particularly at a time of \nfinancial stress, would have significant adverse impacts on our economy \nand could, in turn, have a chilling effect on monetary policy \ndeliberations.\n  To underscore the fact that this potentially harmful amendment is \ncompletely unnecessary, I think it is also worth pointing out that the \nFederal Reserve is already a leader among central banks in advanced \neconomies when it comes to making its transcripts available to the \npublic.\n  While the Federal Reserve releases transcripts with a 5-year lag, \nother advanced economies have adopted requirements to release \ntranscripts after much longer periods. Japan's Central Bank releases \ntranscripts to the public after 10 years, and the European Union \nreleases transcripts after 20 years.\n  In addition to releasing transcripts to the public, the Federal \nReserve employs a range of additional measures to enhance the public's \nunderstanding of the Federal Open Market Committee's views and \nexpectations. For example, the Federal Reserve issues a statement \nfollowing the conclusion of each of its meetings that includes the \nFederal Reserve's policy decisions and its rationale, includes the vote \nof each FOMC member, and provides a short summary of any dissenting \nviews.\n  The Federal Reserve also releases detailed minutes that are released \non a 3-week lag following each FOMC meeting. The minutes contain a \ndetailed discussion of the policy deliberations and the range of views \nthat were presented and includes votes on each policy action taken by \neach FOMC member.\n  Since 2011, the Chair of the Federal Reserve gives a press conference \nfollowing each FOMC meeting for which a summary of economic projections \nis prepared, amounting to four press conferences each year. This \nprovides the opportunity for the Chair to explain her views and respond \nto questions from the financial press.\n  In January 2012, the Federal Open Market Committee also published a \nstatement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy in which it \noutlined how it would assess its compliance with statutory mandates to \npromote full employment and price stability. Subsequently, in September \n2014, the Federal Reserve published a statement outlining its policy, \nnormalization principles, and plans.\n  Finally, the Federal Reserve, as it is required by law, regularly \ntestifies before the House and Senate on monetary policy matters on no \nless than two occasions a year. Chairman Yellen has made herself \navailable to testify on regulatory matters at the request of Congress.\n  So, all of this is to say that claims that the Federal Reserve lacks \ntransparency or doesn't communicate its thinking to the public just \ndon't hold up to the facts.\n  I urge Members to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n      Modification to Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. King of Iowa\n\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment with the form I have placed at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n  Modification to amendment No. 6 offered by Mr. King of Iowa:\n       Add at the end the following:\n       Page 53, line 4, strike ``and''.\n       Page 53, line 11, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 53, after line 11, insert the following:\n       (F) consider the effects of the GDP output and employment \n     targets of the ``dual mandate'' (both from the creation of \n     the dual mandate in 1977 until the present time and estimates \n     of the future effect of the dual mandate ) on--\n       (i) United States economic activity;\n       (ii) Federal Reserve actions; and\n       (iii) Federal debt.\n       Page 53, line 18, add at the end the following: ``In making \n     such report, the Commission shall specifically report on the \n     considerations required under paragraph (1)(F).''.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Iowa?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is modified.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member \nfor her cooperation and opportunity to have this debate, and I will \njust address it briefly.\n  In 1977, Congress established what is known as the dual mandate. The \ndual mandate set the goals of the Federal Reserve System and the \nFederal Open Market Committee to include goals of maximum employment \nand stable prices.\n  There has been a lot of debate about whether the tension of those two \nissues has brought about decisions of the Fed that might have otherwise \nbeen different, and so this amendment requires a study to be done in \norder to take a look at the effects of the dual mandate. It is pretty \nsimple that way, and I urge its support and adoption.\n  I circle back then to the transcripts. And in response to the \ngentlewoman's comments, I would just remind Members of Congress that we \ndo keep records in all of our proceedings. There is a transcript taking \nplace right now of these proceedings, of each of our committees and \nsubcommittees. They are available to the public, and, in fact, we are \non C-SPAN with almost all of our subcommittees and committees today.\n  We are open. We are open records, and there is much sunlight on what \nwe do. And yet, many of the decisions that we make here have far less \nimpact on the American citizen than the decisions made by the Fed.\n  So, again, I urge the adoption of this modified amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, continuing time in \nopposition, first, the notion that the Federal Reserve's large-scale \nasset purchases did not help the economy and job growth is simply \nfalse. The forceful and sustained actions that the Federal Reserve took \nin recent years to bring us out of a recession and into recovery are \nwell-documented and cannot be overlooked.\n  For instance, the November jobs report showed the economy added a \nwhopping 271,000 jobs in October, pushing the unemployment rate down \nand, even further, to 5 percent and bringing the total number of \nprivate sector jobs created to more than 13.3 million over the past 68 \nmonths.\n  Second, the amendment's implication that the Federal Reserve's \nmonetary policy has added to the U.S. national debt is also \ndemonstrably false. Although raising revenue is not the purpose of \nmonetary policy, as a consequence of the Federal Reserve's actions in \nrecent years, it has generated substantial sums in the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars which has returned to the Treasury. These sums have \nreduced the deficit, not contributed to it.\n  Rather than relentlessly attacking the Federal Reserve and taking \nsteps to undermine their independence, all of us really should be \nthanking them for what they have done to get our economy back on track.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume \nto the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n\n[[Page H8342]]\n\n  I want to urge all Members of the House to adopt his amendment. With \nrespect to full transcripts of the FOMC meetings, all this is doing is \nsimply codifying a current practice. It is simply to make sure that \nthere is a transparency, at least this level of transparency, that the \nFed doesn't backslide.\n  With respect to the dual mandate, the truth is the Fed has many \nmandates and they all ought to be examined. The Fed has been around for \n100 years. It is time to poke under the hood. That is why we are having \nthe Centennial Monetary Commission, and I think it is important that we \ntake a good look to see if, at times, these are working at cross \npurposes.\n  So I thank the gentleman from Iowa for his leadership. I urge all \nMembers to adopt his amendment.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, \noffered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).\n  The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule, \nthe Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nWalker) having assumed the chair, Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia, Acting \nChair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, \nreported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill \n(H.R. 3189) to amend the Federal Reserve Act to establish requirements \nfor policy rules and blackout periods of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, to establish requirements for certain activities of the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and to amend title \n31, United States Code, to reform the manner in which the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System is audited, and for other \npurposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 529, he reported the bill \nback to the House with sundry further amendments adopted in the \nCommittee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from \nthe Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further \nconsideration of H.R. 3189 is postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8342-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE AURORA REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n  (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FOSTER.

Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New \nJersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) is recognized for 60 minutes as the \ndesignee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, last week, after many of us had \nreturned to our homes across the country, while our constituents were \nenjoying the beginning of their weekend, Paris fell victim to one of \nthe most violent terrorist attacks in recent memory.\n  Nohemi Gonzalez, an American student studying architecture abroad, \nwas among those killed.\n  A day earlier, in Beirut, dozens of innocent lives were cut short in \na coordinated attack on that city.\n  Earlier this year, an attack at Garissa University in Kenya left 147 \ndead.\n  And just yesterday, a suicide bomber killed 34 people in Yola, \nNigeria. That attack was followed by two more today, driving the number \nof lives lost there to 49.\n  Before we go any further, Mr. Speaker, I would ask for a moment of \nsilence to remember the lives of those who have been lost.\n  Mr. Speaker, the world is facing an incredible wave of violence with \nthe single purpose of stoking fear. It is the kind of fear that keeps \nus from solving problems and that paralyzes us into inaction. It is the \nkind of fear that we are hearing in the calls to block refugees from \nseeking shelter here in the United States, violating all of our values \nbecause of an immediate emotional reaction.\n  The individuals who committed these atrocious acts of violence are \ncounting on us to fall into that kind of fear, and that is why it is so \nimportant not to.\n  We must stand with our allies in Paris. We must stand with the \ninnocent in Beirut and Garissa and Nigeria. We must stand firm in our \nrole as world leaders and as part of an international coalition \ndedicated to bringing down ISIS.\n  We must stand for the values that have always been paramount in the \nUnited States, and one of those values is opening our doors to those \nseeking safety.\n  We cannot turn our backs to the humanitarian crisis facing the \nSyrians refugees. They are fleeing a conflict they are not responsible \nfor and want no part in. They have lost their homes, their jobs, and \nmembers of their families. The only thing that many of them are seeking \nis a chance to start over. The vast majority of these refugees are \nwomen and children.\n  Even more importantly, agencies involved with allowing them to enter \nwill prioritize survivors of violence and torture and those with severe \nillnesses.\n  If we can do it safely, verifying the identities and backgrounds of \nthose seeking safety here in the United States, and developing systems \nto ensure that we don't let in anyone seeking to harm us, then we must \nhelp these refugees. It is not just our responsibility as a world \nleader; it is the right thing to do as a nation of immigrants.\n  While we can't remove every risk, we do have an intensive screening \nprocess in place, and refugees receive the greatest scrutiny of any \nindividual coming here. The FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Department of State, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the National Counterterrorism Center are all \ninvolved in the process of clearing these people.\n  As recent events have shown us, the threat of ISIS is real. The \nterror that they spread across the world, the violence they perpetrate, \nand their disregard for innocent human life are all despicable.\n  We have a chance right now to build something positive from these \ntragedies. We must unify as a global community against the evil of ISIS \nand in support of peace and freedom and humanity.\n  The only goal of ISIS is to destroy life. By giving refugees the \nopportunity to escape, we can save them.\n\n[[Page H8343]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I know that I join all of my colleagues in prayer for \nthe lives that were lost in Paris and elsewhere and for the hundreds \nmore that were injured in the attacks. I pray for solace for those who \nhave lost their loved ones and friends. I pray for peace around the \nworld. I pray for the good that we can do, as a country, that will \nbuild consensus with coalitions and partners around the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Watson Coleman \nfor her leadership in tonight's special order as we grapple with the \nhorrendous terrorist attacks in Paris and Beruit as well as today's \nattack in Nigeria, claimed by Boko Haram.\n  In the past week alone, we have seen lives lost in Nigeria, France \nand Beruit.\n  Our prayers are with the victims and their families.\n  The Paris, France attacks last Friday, November 13, which claimed 128 \nlives and many more injured, as we know was claimed by ISIS.\n  There were also 43 killed during a suicide bombing in Beruit, Lebanon \nwith over 200 injured.\n  Just today in Yola, Adamawa State, Nigeria, authorities inform us \nthat an 11 year old suicide bomber targeted a market and detonated a \nbomb killing her, 30 others and injuring over 70 market goers.\n  The terrorist group Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the attacks \nas retaliation for President Buhari's commitment for combatting violent \nextremism in Nigeria.\n  The recent events underscore that we cannot let fear rule us but \nrather we must fight back against those who threaten our well being and \nsecurity.\n  At the same time, we must work on creating resources for victims of \nterror and those who have been displaced as a result of conflict and \nsectarian violence.\n  This is why I introduced H. Res. 528, legislation that enjoyed \nbipartisan support of my colleagues including Representatives Chu from \nCalifornia, Dold from Illinois, Hahn from California, Kelly from \nIllinois, Fudge from Ohio, Watson Coleman from New Jersey, Sewell from \nAlabama, Bernie Thompson from Mississippi and my good friend Ms. Wilson \nof course from Florida.\n  My resolution seeks to create a Victims of Terror Protection Fund for \nthe displaced refugees, migrants and victims of Boko Haram's terror in \nthe region.\n  It is our American value to fight for those who are seeking refuge \nand needing protection.\n  As founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional Nigerian Caucus, I have \nbeen spending a lot of time on this issue since the Chibok incident.\n  The past week has been a very trying time for the world family as we \ngrapple with the reality of terrorists wreaking havoc in our world.\n  One only needs to look at the current news events across the globe to \nappreciate the imperative of countering violent extremism, empowering \nand protecting victims of terror, refugees and displaced persons.\n  In the past three months alone, ISIS has claimed responsibility for \ncrimes, atrocities and terroristic attacks, claiming lives in Saudi \nArabia, Yemen, Egypt, Beirut and Paris.\n  Daesh-ISIL also known as ISIS and other terrorist networks that have \npled allegiance to ISIS such as Boko Haram today pose the gravest \nextremist threat faced by our generation and those of our children.\n  But we must not be moved by their evil ways, for eventually, the arc \nof the moral universe always tips on the side of justice, of peace, of \nequity of the rule of law.\n  This is why I remain steadfast in my commitment to combatting violent \nextremism and protecting victims.\n  As a result of terrorism in the region and Boko Haram in particular \nin Nigeria, recent reports inform us that Nigeria has the highest \nnumber of displaced persons in Africa and the third largest in the \nworld following Syria and Columbia.\n  The recent coordinated attacks in Paris, following military \ninterventions by at least two United Nations Security Council permanent \nmembers: Russia and France, highlights the fact that we are dealing \nwith an enemy of humanity and compels us to launch an international and \ncoordinated strategy to diminish ISIS to protect our children and our \nchildren's children.\n  The recent events underscore the importance of a Comprehensive \nConvention on International Terrorism to degrade and permanently \ndestroy ISIS and its vitriolic ideology that is inflicting pain on \ninnocent people.\n  The humanitarian crises triggered by sectarian and ideological \nviolence has plagued our world at a disheartening rate, comparable to \nor surpassing the numbers from World War II according to some \nestimates.\n  According to one United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \n(UNHCR's) annual Global Trends report, which is based on data compiled \nby governments and non-governmental partner organizations, and from the \norganization's own records, over 60 million people have been forcibly \ndisplaced across the globe.\n  Moreover, according to a report by the International Displacement \nMonitor Center, an estimated 3,300,000 persons have been displaced and \n5,500 killed as a result of the violence wreaked by Boko Haram.\n  One United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) report asserts that as \nthe most populous nation in Africa with 174,000,000 persons, 1,500,000 \npeople have fled their homes to escape Boko Haram.\n  In April, 2014, 276 girls were terrorized and kidnapped from their \ndormitories in Chibok by Boko Haram.\n  In addition to the still missing Chibok girls, approximately \n3,300,000 persons are displaced in the Lake Chad Basin which sits on \nthe edge of the Sahara which encompasses Chad, Cameroon, Niger and \nNigeria.\n  We must not forget these girls, refugees and displaced persons and \nmust work to provide the support they will need to recover from the \ntrauma they have suffered.\n  The victims will be in dire need of humanitarian assistance which the \nVictims of Terror Protection Fund can provide.\n  The Victims of Terror Protection Fund should be modeled after the \ncases of Khazistan and Equatorial Guinea where prior kleptocracy \ninitiatives have been created to benefit communities and victims in \nneed of support.\n  A kleptocracy is when a government in power exploits or steals \nnational resources, which unfortunately has happened all too often \nacross the globe.\n  The United States Department of Justice through its Kleptocracy Asset \nRecovery Initiative has identified the forfeited ``Abacha loot,'' funds \nstolen by former Nigerian dictator Sanni Abacha.\n  As we understand it the ``Abacha loot'' is the largest kleptocracy \nforfeiture action ever brought in the United States resulting in a \n$450,000,000 judgment of the forfeited assets facilitated by Justice's \nremarkable Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.\n  The Abacha Administration embezzled Nigerian public funds under among \nother false claims, that the Administration was investing in national \nsecurity measures to protect Nigeria and the Nigerian people.\n  As we all see now, as a result of or in part because of the Abacha \nAdministration's failure to invest in and implement security measures, \nthe security in Nigeria and the region is tenuous, with the country and \nregion currently under continuous threat by the ISIS affiliated group \nBoko Haram.\n  Boko Haram and other sectarian terrorists have trafficked, kidnapped, \nmurdered and caused the displacement of millions of children, women and \nmen.\n  Recovered victims displaced by terrorist activity as well as \nrefugees, migrants and internally displaced persons fleeing for their \nlives will be in dire need of protection and support.\n  A Victim of Terror Protection Fund can supply health aid, educational \nsupport, employment training, economic empowerment, dignity and overall \nimproved social welfare of these victims.\n  I continue to have a deep appreciation of the patriotism, resilience, \nand commitment of the Nigerian people under the leadership of their \nnewly democratically elected President Muhammadu Buhari.\n  As an emerging democracy, Nigeria is a country that has faced its set \nof challenges, conflicts, and contradictions analogous to the human \ncondition itself.\n  Boko Haram and ISIS are existential threats to the human rights, well \nbeing and security of the Nigerian people, their regional neighbors and \nthe global community in general with their penchant to commit genocide.\n  Part of the strategy to help address the scourge of Boko Haram's \natrocity would be through the creation of a Victim of Terror Protection \nFund and accessibility of military technical assistance to Nigeria and \nits regional neighbors pursuant to the UN Security Council and \nneighboring African countries call for accelerated military \ncollaboration to combat this extremist group.\n  I commend the U.S. Administration's announcement that it is deploying \n300 U.S. troops to Africa to set up a drone base to track fighters from \nBoko Haram, which continues to seek to destabilize Nigeria and \nneighboring countries during its blood thirsty assault on innocent \npeople.\n  The U.S. forces' presence will be critical to combatting Boko Haram, \nwhich now appears to continue to wage its vicious insurgency in Nigeria \nand now spilling into neighboring Cameroon, Chad and Niger and leaving \nan estimated 20,000 people dead.\n  Our global strategy for ending the suffering, preventing displacement \nand creating durable solutions for refugees and displaced persons in \nAfrica requires a multi-pronged strategy\n\n[[Page H8344]]\n\nwhich would involve a sustained humanitarian response, government and \ncivil society capacity building, and the creation of resilient \npolitical and security infrastructures and landscapes.\n  My proposed Victims of Terror Protection Fund is one of the \nstrategies for addressing the growing African migrant and refugee \ncrisis.\n  I commend President Obama's and President Buhari's commitment to \nNigerian security and their collective efforts to tighten vigilance in \nvulnerable places.\n  I hope the United States continues to build a stronger alliance with \nPresident Buhari and Nigeria.\n  To succeed, at all our objectives to protect victims and combat \nviolent extremism, in Nigeria, Syria and around the world, we must have \ncontinued U.S. support in protecting victims of terror, technical \ntraining, logistical and infrastructural capabilities and \nprofessionalizing its military force to battle Boko Haram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8344-1",

     POVERTY IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) \nis recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the \nminority leader.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey for talking about Ms. Gonzalez, who was \nfrom our area. She actually was from a city called El Monte, \nCalifornia, and that is where my first cousin, Norma Macias, is a \ncouncilwoman there at that city.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Right now, as we are speaking, they are holding a vigil for her, a \nmemorial for her. She was a young lady on a semester abroad wanting to \nchange the world by good design and using green products, et cetera. So \nthank you for mentioning her. I am sure the Gonzalez family will be \nvery touched.\n  And, of course, thank you for mentioning the whole issue of the \nrefugees because we are a beacon. We are a shining beacon of the world. \nThese are people who are fleeing these types of terrorist attacks.\n  So I hope that we do have a good resolution to allow these refugees \nto go to all the countries until we figure out what is going on in the \nMiddle East and they can return home. Home is where they really want to \nbe. Thank you. I thank my great colleague from New Jersey.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to address an issue that unfortunately \nreaches into households in each and every State, every city, and every \nneighborhood in this great Nation. It is the issue of poverty.\n  Poverty is a plague that weighs on a central tenet that our Nation \nwas built on, and that is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  I received a letter just this last month from our Democratic whip, \nSteny Hoyer, discussing a recent report released by the U.S. Census \nBureau that found that 46.7 million Americans--15 percent of \nAmericans--are living in poverty. How can we tell a family to pursue \nhappiness when the rug is constantly being pulled out from under them?\n  Mr. Speaker, 15 percent, 46.7 million, is more than all the \nCalifornians and Arizonans put together. We cannot allow that to \ncontinue. We know that the effects of poverty hit every aspect of one's \nlife.\n  It hits minorities disproportionately. Poverty affects minorities. 26 \npercent of African Americans live below the poverty line, and 23 \npercent of Latinos live below the poverty line.\n  We also see those types of percentages when we look at lower \neducational attainment and lower overall wages. As the number of first- \nand second-generation children rises, so does the amount of these \nchildren affected and born into poverty.\n  Nearly one in three children in the schools in my district are \naffected by poverty. It is hard to learn when you haven't had a meal. \nIt is hard to learn when you don't have a roof over your head. It is \nhard where you are sharing a house with 15 or 16 people, most of them \nnot related to you.\n  There are social programs such as SNAP and the Community Supplemental \nFood program. There are ways in which we can combat the effects of \npoverty. I don't believe that families who are benefiting from those \nprograms are looking for a free handout.\n  There are Members of both Chambers who at one time or another \nreceived public assistance in times of need. One of them was a single \nmother of not one, but two, children while working and attending \ncollege. I think it goes without saying that these individuals are not \nlazy or looking for handouts.\n  Now, we shouldn't shame or judge other individuals in our society, \nbut there is a negative stigma about being enrolled in welfare \nprograms. We shame families who don't have the means to lift themselves \nout of the cycle of poverty. But then we don't want to give them that \nhelping hand, that aid, that they need in order to do that.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, I think the real shame--the real shame--is that we \nare a nation of unbridled wealth, bountiful wealth, and still over 46 \nmillion people are in poverty.\n  With the rising costs of housing and food, families in the United \nStates are stretching each dollar more and more. Many find it difficult \nto save money at the end of the month, and saving for their son's or \ndaughter's education is, quite frankly, an unattainable dream.\n  When I was growing up, I was told that, if I worked hard, if I did \nwell in school, and if I saved my money, it was possible to be \nsuccessful in America.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, every day these days it gets harder and harder to \nbe successful in America. Those in poverty find themselves working \nhard, planning for the future, and doing everything that we tell them \nto do, and still they fall short, unable to attain the pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  There should be absolutely no reason, if a person puts in hard work \n40 hours a week, that they should be living in poverty. How can we \nexpect families working minimum wage--and I will add that is not a \nliveable wage--to afford child care and save for their children's \ncollege education?\n  Honestly, it is nearly impossible. Yet, I see so many examples in my \ndistrict of people who overcome all of the hurdles and the barriers \nthat we are placing in front of them.\n  We can alleviate, we can remove, those barriers. We can have an \nimpact on the poverty of our communities. Last month, during National \nWork and Family Month, Democratic leadership led a Working Families Day \nof Action to highlight important legislation to improve the living \nconditions for all families here in America.\n  I joined 113 of my colleagues in cosponsoring a resolution which \ncalled for this House to address some of the issues important to some \nof the most disadvantaged demographics of people in our Nation. This \nresolution addressed commonsense measures, such as sensible working \naccommodations for pregnant women, equal protections for workers in the \nworkplace, and increasing the minimum wage to a liveable wage.\n  You see, Mr. Speaker, when we talk about the 46 million Americans \nliving in poverty, we are talking about people from all walks of life. \nWe are talking about the homeless. We are talking about children in our \nschools. We are talking about our senior citizens. We are talking about \nsingle parents, blue collar workers. We are talking about our \nimmigrants.\n  All of these groups are stuck--stuck--in a vicious cycle of poverty \nand disadvantaged situations. These aren't radical ideas. These are \nsensible, American ideas where hard work is rewarded with equal \ncompensation and protections. I believe that, as lawmakers--but, more \nimportantly, as Americans--we owe it to the families of this Nation to \nenact legislation in which each and every person has a means to \nsucceed.\n  Tonight I am going to go over some of the statistics that we have \nwith respect to poverty in America. As I said before, Mr. Speaker, 46.7 \nmillion people are living in poverty.\n  The poverty rate was established in the 1960s, and it is based solely \non an individual's cash earnings. It sets the poverty threshold at \n$24,250 for a family of four. However, that rate does not take into \nconsideration the cost of living in different regions of America. Try \nliving in my region on $24,250 for four people.\n  The Census Bureau recently established a new measure on which to \ngauge actual poverty rates. The Supplemental Poverty Measure \nestablishes a new poverty rate by incorporating\n\n[[Page H8345]]\n\nexpenditures on basic necessities, such as food, housing, and \nutilities.\n  California's poverty rate is 16.5 percent, slightly higher than the \n14.9 percent rate for the United States. However, this statistic can be \ndeceiving because of the high cost of living throughout the State.\n  So you could be above the $24,250 a year for a family of four, and \nyou are not in poverty according to the national rate. But the \nreality--the reality--is, when it costs $1,800 for a one-bedroom \napartment, you have eaten up about 90 percent of that $25,000.\n  If we use the updated measurement system, California leads the Nation \nwith 23.4 percent of residents living in poverty. Of course, once \nagain, this hits the disadvantaged more than anyone else.\n  When using the Supplemental Poverty System, nearly 20 percent of \nseniors, one-quarter of our children, 31 percent of Latinos, and 20 \npercent of African Americans live in poverty. Let's put that in \nperspective.\n  The average rent in Orange County is $1,648. Orange County that I \nrepresent is the seventh priciest metropolitan area in the United \nStates. This brings the total cost to rent a modest--and when I am \ntelling you a modest apartment in California, we are talking $20,000 a \nyear.\n  For a family of four living at or below the outdated poverty \nthreshold, this leaves a whopping $4,250 for the entire year. That \nleaves about $354 per month to feed and clothe a family of four.\n  How, Mr. Speaker, can a family of four live on $354 a month? How do \nyou save for a college education? How do you save for a home? How do \nyou buy a car? What can you do when you get sick?\n  I recently held a bipartisan briefing about home ownership as a \nvehicle for economic mobility for Latinos and African Americans. Latino \nfamilies are struggling to rebuild the equity they lost in this last \nGreat Recession because, between 2008 and 2010, in those 3 or 4 years \nof the recession, two-thirds of the wealth in the Latino families \nacross the Nation was lost--was lost--just wiped out, done away with, \nbecause they lost their homes.\n  The home is always the first rung onto the wealth-creation ladder. \nTwo-thirds because of foreclosure. And even though home values have \nrebounded in recent years, the fact of the matter is that those people \nwho lost their homes are renting at probably twice the cost of what \ntheir mortgage payment was, probably something less than what they were \nliving in, and not building any equity.\n  They are renters, and they are stuck. Even if you gained back on the \nmarket, it doesn't keep pace with the returns in the stock market. So \nthe Hispanic household has a slower recovery than the rest of our \nNation.\n  According to the Pew Hispanic Center, 28 percent of Hispanic \nhomeowners say they owe more on their homes today than they can sell it \nfor in 2011.\n  This topic of home ownership is more than a roof over your head. It \nis a source of pride. It is a source of pride. It is the American \nDream, and it is a place that you can call your own. It is a part of \nowning America, and we want people to own a piece of America.\n  A recent Joint Economic Committee study report finds that White \nhouseholds typically have 150 times more wealth than Hispanic \nhouseholds. In 2013, the median net worth of Hispanic households was \nonly $14,000 compared to about $142,000 for Anglo households, a \ndifference of $128,000.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  And the wealth divide has increased since the Great Recession.\n  The median net worth of Hispanic households fell by over 40 percent \nbetween 2005 to 2013, compared to 26 percent for Anglo households.\n  Latinos are less likely to be financially prepared for retirement \nthan any other households because of their disparity in employment, in \nearnings, and in wealth.\n  Only 12 percent of Latino households have access to the defined \nbenefit pensions, for example, that guarantee a lifetime income, half \nthe rate of Anglos and African American households.\n  Sixty-nine percent of working-age Latino households do not own assets \nin a retirement account--69 percent do not--compared to 37 percent of \nAnglos who do not.\n  Let's talk about my district, in one of the wealthiest counties of \nour Nation. I just told you that housing is seventh in the Nation with \nrespect to what it cost you to live there.\n  Twenty percent of the people are living in poverty in my district, \nhigher than the State and the national average.\n  Thirty percent of the kids, the children, in my district are living \nin poverty, higher than the State and higher than the national average.\n  Eighteen percent of women are living in poverty in my district, \nhigher than the State and the national average.\n  Between 2011 and 2013, in those 3 years, 23,000 households within my \ndistrict benefited from SNAP assistance--food stamps. Eighty-six \npercent of those households had children under the age of 18. Oh, and \nby the way, 78 percent of those households were Latino. Forty-three \npercent of those families that received SNAP benefits recorded having \nat least two or more workers in the workforce in the past 12 months.\n  What does this tell you? It tells you that families have not just one \nbut two breadwinners in the family, and still they cannot afford to \npurchase basic food supplies.\n  Mr. Speaker, if hunger doesn't affect us directly, we often overlook \nthe immense stress that comes with struggling to put food on the table. \nIf you don't have a meal, you are not good in school and you can't \nstudy because you are constantly hungry. How does a kid do his \nmathematics, his geometry, when he is wondering where is his next meal \ncoming from?\n  The Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as the limited \nor uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods.\n  In 2014, 48 million adult Americans lived in food-insecure \nhouseholds, including 32.8 million adults, and 15.3 million children. \nAnd of those 48 million Americans, 19 percent of the households were \nwith children, 35 percent of the households with children headed by \nsingle women, 26 percent African American households, 22 percent Latino \nhouseholds. How do we do that?\n  A recent report published by the Department of Agriculture found that \nerror rates for awarding SNAP benefits are at an all-time low. Over 99 \npercent of SNAP benefits are issued to eligible households.\n  Mr. Speaker, you would think that a government program, any \ngovernment program, with a 99 percent efficiency rating, with a proven \nrecord of lifting families out of poverty would be applauded and \npromoted by both sides of the aisle, but that is not always the case.\n  The most recent farm bill cut $8 billion from SNAP, affecting 850,000 \nfamilies in our Nation.\n  The assistance provided by SNAP is an economic booster, with every \ndollar in SNAP benefits resulting in $1.80 in total economic activity.\n  Mr. Speaker, food is the most basic necessity for a person.\n  In ending, I would like to highlight a few of the excellent \norganizations in my district that make it their mission, their passion, \nto aid those in need.\n  The Lestonnac Free Clinic, founded by Sister Marie Therese in 1979, \nit is devoted to providing free--free--comprehensive medical care to \nthe poorest of the poor in Orange County, California, as well as dental \ncare to its established patients. This organization, this clinic, is a \nnonprofit, primarily volunteers--volunteer doctors, volunteer \neverything--working with pharmaceutical companies and local hospitals \nto meet the healthcare needs of low- and no-income families in our \ncommunity. And the clinic has stayed true to its mission of providing \nfree medical and dental care, and is only one of the few clinics in \nOrange County that does not charge--does not charge--for its services.\n  And collaborations were made with organizations, including Target \nstore pharmacy, to provide low-cost medications. And over 100 volunteer \ndoctors and medical staff have generously donated their time to help \nthose in need.\n  The Lestonnac Free Clinic also contains a food bank and provides food \nto several hundred people each month. Over 20,000 patients have been \ntreated in over 180,000 visits.\n  Or there is the Orange County Food Bank, which operates the Commodity\n\n[[Page H8346]]\n\nSupplemental Food Program, and it distributes 23,000 food boxes monthly \ncountywide to low-income seniors 60 and older. It operates a community \ndonated food bank with enrollment of over 350 local charities that make \nfood available to those that are at the risk of hunger. This vulnerable \npopulation includes the disabled, seniors, families with children, \nveterans--I see veterans in those lines coming to pick up boxes of \nfood--the unemployed and the homeless.\n  The foods department operates the SNAP program, and this program has \nincreased enrollment to over 400,000 qualified individuals in Orange \nCounty, California, who are at the risk of hunger.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are a great country, and we have great Americans--\nthose who have served in our military, those who have served in public \nservice, those who teach our children, those who nurse us when we are \nsick, those who build our roads, invent new gadgets for us to \ncommunicate. We are a great country of innovation. We are a great \ncountry of beauty from sea to shining sea. And yet, in this great \ncountry of ours, in today's day, there are over 46 million Americans \nliving in poverty, many of them going to sleep tonight hungry, hungry, \nhungry. As the Congress, as the conscience of America, as the people's \nHouse, we need to work together to eliminate poverty in America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8346-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8346-H8350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE PEOPLE'S NIGHT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing us to engage in what \nwe call People's Night 2. The House has been working diligently for the \ncitizens of our districts. We have passed solid legislation that is \ngood for the economy, that protects life, that helps small businesses, \nveterans, bills that reduce taxes. I would guess that maybe not all of \nour citizens are even aware that the House has actually passed a \nbalanced budget. In fact, there are over 300 pieces of legislation that \nhave been passed through the House but have been stalled in the Senate.\n  Tonight, we want to highlight some of the legislation, but also, and \nwith all due respect, we are calling on Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \nto get moving on these bills. I am joined by several colleagues this \nevening to share why we believe it is time to move on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  Our first Member, colleague and friend, from Pennsylvania, Mr. Ryan \nCostello. Mr. Costello is a freshman, along with myself, our shortstop \non the baseball team, and a strong voice speaking out on those who \nsometimes cannot speak for themselves, and that is our veterans. We \npromise that we would go to Congress and work hard for the men and \nwomen who depend on us to get the Veterans Administration correct.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nCostello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend \nfrom North Carolina for yielding. Mr. Walker has really been a leader \nin no time on so many issues. It is nice to be his hall mate and also \nhis teammate on the baseball field, and I appreciate him putting \ntogether this Special Order to raise a number of issues that we have \ngotten through the House here and that we are respectfully calling upon \nthe Senate to take up.\n  I am here to speak about the crying need for change and increased \naccountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs that can be \nfacilitated by the immediate passage of H.R. 1994, the VA \nAccountability Act of 2015. This is a bill that myself and many others \nhave cosponsored under the leadership of Chairman Jeff Miller, and it \nis a bill that I am requesting that the Senate take up and pass with \nbipartisan support here in the House in July.\n  It gives the Secretary of the VA the additional tools he needs to \naccelerate the badly-needed culture change at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. It gives the Secretary of the VA what he needs to \nrebuild the trust between the VA and this Congress, taxpayers, and, \nmost importantly, the veterans of this country.\n  H.R. 1994 includes many provisions to fix the broken personnel system \nat the Department. But, most importantly, this bill authorizes the \nSecretary to remove or demote any employee for poor performance or \nmisconduct while also increasing protections for whistleblowers who \nhave been, and continue to be, very important in the oversight role of \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Many of you know the Philadelphia Regional Office has seen scandal \nafter scandal. It has experienced a gross lapse in management, \nmishandling of claims, the administration of improper payments, and \nfabricated data. On top of that, the hostile work environment and \nwhistleblower retaliation occurred on a nearly daily basis.\n  This bill brings accountability to the managers at the Philly VA \nresponsible for these actions, as well as those across the country in \nthe VA, who have acted improperly.\n  I believe a majority of VA's employees--as we all do here in \nCongress--this is an important point to make--most people that work at \nthe VA are hard-working public servants who are dedicated to providing \nquality health care and timely benefits for veterans.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  I am sure the majority of these employees are just as frustrated in \nthat most of us see that the VA problem employees continue to be moved \nto new positions as opposed to being removed from the payroll. We have \nseen time and again how poor performance can spread like a cancer \nthrough a workforce and how the presence of bad employees only leads to \npoor customer service and is an impediment to the quality of service \nour veterans have earned.\n  Our veterans deserve nothing less than the highest quality of care, \nand it is our job as Members of Congress to do everything in our power \nto ensure that their care is placed before the interests of entrenched \nbureaucrats and poor performance. If we want what is best for our \nveterans, then the status quo at the VA is not acceptable. It is not \nworking. It is failing the mission of the Department, and it is failing \nthe veterans the VA is supposed to serve.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we do not give the Secretary the tools that he or she \nneeds to hold VA employees accountable, then we are just as culpable \nfor any future VA failures. The antiquated civil service laws that have \nfostered the VA's cultural mess need to go. That is what the VA \nAccountability Act does. That is why we are calling on the Senate to \ntake it up.\n  After the largest scandal in VA's history--and, in my home State, the \ncontinued problems at the Philadelphia VA--the VA has only successfully \nfired three employees for wait time manipulation even though over 100 \nhospitals have been identified as having gamed the appointment system. \nThat is simply unacceptable. H.R. 1994 would give the Secretary the \ntools he needs to hold more employees accountable faster than can be \ndone now under existing civil service rules.\n  As Mr. Walker will continue to do this evening in pointing out a \nnumber of bills that have been ushered through the House--reform bills \nthat improve the welfare of this country and that reform various \nbureaucracies--H.R. 1994 does just that. I urge the Senate to take \naction and push for accountability just as we have done here in the \nHouse on behalf of this country's veterans.\n  I thank the gentleman for organizing this Special Order tonight.\n  Mr. WALKER. I thank Representative Costello. His hard work on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee is duly noted.\n  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, these bills are not making it to the \nPresident's desk. We are tired of the argument that the President will \nmost likely veto these legislative bills or of the filibustering that \nwe hear about sometimes in the Senate. We hear the word \n``reconciliation'' a great deal. Reconciliation is a simple majority \nvote. Fifty-one votes in the Senate is what is needed to get it to the \nPresident's desk under reconciliation.\n  If we think back, this is how Harry Reid shoved ObamaCare into the \nculture and fabric of the American people--by reconciliation, by a \nsimple majority. In fact, it has been Mr. Reid\n\n[[Page H8347]]\n\nwho has blocked, filibustered, and sat on legislation to protect the \nPresident. That is why the American people elected Republican \nmajorities in the House and the Senate. It was to clean up Washington \nand to stand against President Obama's far-left agenda.\n  One of the ladies I have been able to meet who has worked hard and \nwho has been a voice is a nurse, a small-business woman, and a former \neducator. I specifically like the nurse part, being married to one for \n23 years. She is the middle daughter of working class, Great \nDepression-era parents. Having had 40 years of experience in working in \nthe healthcare field, she is uniquely positioned as a credible and \neffective leader on healthcare policy in Congress. She is a strong \nleader on fiscal and budget reforms, but her voice for life in these \nhalls is one that is heard throughout the country.\n  From Tennessee's Sixth District, Congresswoman Diane Black is that \nvoice, and I would like for her to share a little bit more on her \nspecific piece of legislation.\n  Mrs. BLACK. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina, my good \nfriend, Congressman Walker, for bringing us together for this very \nimportant conversation.\n  Mr. Speaker, a lot of Americans worked very hard to deliver these \nhistoric majorities to Congress, but, today, there is a feeling that \nthe more things change, the more they stay the same. We billed this as \nthe ``New American Congress.'' Yet, like last year and the year before \nand the year before that, too many House-passed bills remain trapped in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  The House passed the REINS Act in July, which would prevent the Obama \nadministration from legislating in the form of government rule and \nwould give Congress the final say over the major Federal regulations \njust like our Founding Fathers intended. But where is it today? Nearly \n4 months later, it continues to languish in the upper Chamber, awaiting \nfor a chance for debate.\n  More recently, the House passed the Justice for Victims of Iranian \nTerrorism Act, requiring Iran to make good on its $43 billion of \ndelinquent payments to the victims of its state-sponsored terrorism. \nOnce again, this good and decent bill is collecting dust in the Senate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I understand the challenges that our Senate leadership \nfaces. The do-nothing Senate majority of the last Congress is now the \ndo-nothing Senate minority of this Congress. They are filibustering \ncountless House-passed bills and bringing the wheels of government to a \ngrinding halt, but we cannot let that stop us from bringing up these \nbills for full debate in the light of day and putting our priorities in \nfront of the American people.\n  While we are at it, it is time to change the rules of engagement in \nthe upper Chamber. In a body of 100 people, a majority is 51. It really \nis that simple. The cloture rule is nowhere to be found in the U.S. \nConstitution. It is an antiquated Senate rule that is not effectively \nserving the institution today. I call on the Senate leaders to turn the \npage and break the logjam so that we can put the American people's \npriorities on the President's desk.\n  I don't doubt that the President will veto many of these measures. \nFor goodness sake, he vetoed a bill to fund our troops, so I put \nnothing past him. Let's put him on record. Let's ensure that President \nObama is required to accept or to reject our ideas and to defend that \ndecision to the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this: The American people delivered \nus this majority, and they expect us to use it.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from North Carolina.\n  Mr. WALKER. I thank Representative Black and appreciate her heartfelt \nwords.\n  Mr. Speaker, in nearly a year of holding the majority, the President \nhas only vetoed three of our bills. In fact, only once, I believe, he \nhas had to do that in the last 8 months.\n  Politico, back in February, published this prediction: ``Though \nObama's three vetoes are thus far a record low...experts expect Obama's \nfinal 2 years to be packed with high-profile veto showdowns.''\n  That hasn't happened.\n  My next friend and colleague who would like to share a little bit of \nhis heart is someone I have grown to admire and respect. I am \nprivileged to serve with him on the Homeland Security Committee where \njust a few months ago, I heard one of the more powerful 5- or 6-minute \ntalks that I have heard since I have been here in Congress in which he \nwas willing to stand up for the Family Research Council and Tony \nPerkins against the tax from the Southern Poverty Law Center--\nspecifically the President--who had put them on a hate list.\n\n  In fact, I am going to yield him a little bit of leeway so he may \nshare some things that may be a little bit in context but that may be a \nlittle bit off as well. It is my privilege to introduce and to hear \nfrom a great Congressman from South Carolina, Representative Jeff \nDuncan.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I \nthank him for having this People's Night 2, so as to take the \nopportunity to speak to the American people about, really, what have \nbecome a lot of frustrations since they elected a Republican House and \na Republican Senate.\n  In fact, I did a tele-townhall last night, and a number of comments \nand questions that I had was: Why can't you guys get more bills to the \nPresident's desk? I had to explain that there is a 60-vote filibuster, \nthe modern filibuster--a 60-vote threshold--over in the Senate. I had \nto explain what a modern filibuster rule is in the Senate.\n  A Senator from the great State of South Carolina actually \nfilibustered on the floor. He spoke for 48 hours without stopping, \nwithout sitting down. He held the floor of the Senate to make a point \nfor 48 hours. That is the traditional filibuster that you hear about. \nToday, in the 21st century, when we hear that a Senator has filed a \nfilibuster and that there is a 60-vote threshold to get over, what that \nmeans is a Senator has just put his name on a bill, and he doesn't have \nto go down and utter a single word, and he doesn't have to stand on the \nfloor for a single minute. In fact, he can go to Charlie Palmer's and \nhave a steak and call it a ``filibuster.'' America, this is wrong.\n  I had a conversation with some Senate staff today because I think \nthey ought to change their Senate rules.\n  They said: Well, the Senator--and he is a Senator I respect a lot--\ndisagrees with your position. They pointed out that the Senate \nfilibuster rule, the 60-vote threshold, has helped Republicans in the \npast to stop bad legislation. They said it stopped amnesty.\n  I said: Well, hold on right there. Amnesty, actually, passed. The \nGang of Eight bill passed, and we failed to bring it up in the House. \nWe stopped it on the House side.\n  They said: Well, it stopped gun control and a lot of other things.\n  I said: Yes, but it is keeping right now a lot of good things from \nmaking it to the President's desk.\n  America gave us this majority, and they really expect us to pass \nbills out that reflect the Republican principles, morals, values, and \nconvictions of the electorate that sent us here and gave us this \nmajority. They expect us to pass bills out of the Congress and to send \nthem to the President's desk. Then the President can do whatever he \nwants with those bills, but I think, if he vetoes them, then America \nwill see the dichotomy between the Republican governance and a Democrat \nPresident.\n  Now the Senate rules. They are not in this book. This is the United \nStates Constitution. It is a pocket copy that I carry with me. You \ncan't find the Senate rules in this. It does say that both bodies--the \nHouse and the Senate--make their own rules to govern what goes on here, \nbut they are not spelled out in this document. It is time for Mitch \nMcConnell and the Republicans over in the Senate to actually have a \n``come to Jesus'' meeting and really talk about what is stifling the \nRepublican work when the Republican electorate in this country has \ngiven us the majority and expects us to do the work.\n  I want to shift gears for just a minute because this is the People's \nNight, and I want to talk about something that is on the minds of the \nAmerican people--the safety and security of our Nation and the national \nsecurity issues in the wake of the Paris attacks, in the wake of the \nLebanon bombing, in the wake of a lot of things that we are seeing with \nstabbings and other things that are going on by ISIS, primarily, but \nyou can throw Boko Haram\n\n[[Page H8348]]\n\nand some others who are committing acts of terror into the mix as well. \nAmericans are concerned about the safety and security of our Nation.\n  I chair the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. Just this afternoon, it was revealed that the Honduran \npolice stopped five Syrians who were carrying falsified Greek \npassports, and they had flown all over Latin America before they had \ngotten to Honduras. They were headed north to the Guatemalan border. If \nthey were headed north to the Guatemalan border, it tells me they were \ngoing to take advantage of our porous southern border, like many others \nhave, to enter into this country. We don't know why. What we do know is \nfive Syrians traveled to Honduras on fake Greek passports, and they \nwere apprehended by the police.\n  People are criticizing the Republicans for wanting to hit ``pause'' \non the Syrian refugee program, and they are saying, ``You don't have \ncompassion.'' Let me tell you that you don't lock the door because you \nhate the people on the outside. You lock the door because you love the \npeople on the inside.\n  We have to protect America. That is what we are charged to do. When \nwe raise our hands and swear an oath to the Constitution--to uphold it \nand to defend this great country--we are charged as Members of Congress \nto protect this great Nation, first and foremost.\n  I thank the gentleman for some leniency. I will continue to speak on \nbehalf of the American people. It is time for Mitch to get moving on \nsome bills that are Republican bills over in the Senate.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Mr. WALKER. Historically, I would like to put this inaction in some \nkind of perspective. We actually have to go back to James Garfield in \nthe 1800s to find such a low number of vetoes. James Garfield only \nserved 7 months, or about 200 days. President Obama has been in office \nnearly 7 years. Compared to other Presidents--for example, President \nKennedy, though obviously never completing his term, however--he used a \ntotal of veto 21 times. Ronald Reagan used a total of 78.\n  Why is this so important? Well, the answer is simple. This is not \npolitical theater. It is the process that exposes the President's \ncontinued desire to rely on government and not the private sector, \nwhich may explain the national debt skyrocketing from $10 trillion to \nnearly $20 trillion that is predicted by the end of his term next year. \nWe need to end covering for the President or for other Members on these \ntough votes.\n  When the President vetoes legislation, he has the obligation to \nexplain to the country the reasons that he is against such bills that \nhelp the American worker and protect families and small businesses. It \nis one of the only measures that our Founding Fathers provided to \nCongress in holding the President accountable.\n  It is a privilege to introduce a friend from Georgia's 10th \nCongressional District, a fellow freshman who is passionate about the \ncause of the American people, someone that is authentic, someone who \nfounded the Cultures and Values Network and was the host of his own \nradio talk program. He has become a dear and close friend of mine. I \nwould like for the American people to hear from Representative Jody \nHice from Georgia's 10th Congressional District.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina for hosting this People's Night for this Special Order. \nI appreciate all that you do, and I appreciate your leadership and your \nfriendship. It is good to have another minister on the grounds. I am \nhonored to serve with you.\n  Like has already been discussed by so many tonight, I likewise \nexperience a great deal of frustration. I have had conversations, as \nhave others here, with individuals in the Senate frustrated over that \n60-vote threshold to even debate an issue over there.\n  Like others, I have been told that they have protected our country \nfrom so many other horrible pieces of legislation or that, ultimately, \nit is irrelevant because the bill would probably be vetoed anyway. \nThere are excuses after excuses.\n  The fact of the matter is that the American people sent us here to do \na job, to represent them to the best of our ability. I am honored to be \nhere with my colleagues here tonight.\n  I am proud of the fact that, over the 10 months or so that I have \nbeen here, we have passed probably hundreds of bills, meaningful \nlegislation, legislation that would protect the American people, \nlegislation that would strengthen our national security, that would \ncare for veterans and provide the kind of care that they deserve, \nlegislation that would empower American businesses and small \nbusinesses, legislation that would increase transparency and \naccountability within government agencies.\n  For example, in order to protect the American citizens, as we all are \nso concerned about these days, we passed H.R. 3009, the Sanctuary \nCities Act, that would not allow any State or local government to \ncontinue to receive funding if they harbor illegal alien criminals. \nCities like San Francisco and many others would no longer be able to \nhave a government-bankrolled sanctuary to provide such a thing for \nillegal alien lawbreakers.\n  In addition, as the Representative from South Carolina just referred \nto moments ago, the threat of ISIS and the authentic threat against the \nWest from terror attacks is real. We are living with that reality \ntoday.\n  So we passed in this body H.R. 237, which would provide the Secretary \nof State with the authority to revoke or deny passports to individuals \nwho are aligned with foreign terrorist groups.\n  It would also provide critical assistance to law enforcement and \nintelligence service personnel to make it easier for them to flag \nsuspects when they are traveling internationally.\n  Perhaps most importantly, that bill would help prevent turned \nAmericans who are now fighting alongside of ISIS from coming back to \nthe United States undetected. Again, these bills and many others like \nthese have not even received a hearing on the other side of the \nCapitol.\n  This body has passed the VA Accountability Act, which would allow the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Secretary new authority to fire bad \nemployees in order to assure that our veterans are receiving the care \nthat they deserve.\n  Additionally, this body has passed the Death Tax Repeal Act, which \nwould eliminate a tax which is unfairly imposed on family estates after \na loved one has passed. That bill would ensure that farmers and small-\nbusiness owners would not be taxed for the success of their loved one \nwho has passed away. It would help keep small businesses and farm doors \nopen.\n  This body has passed multiple pieces of legislation that would \nincrease government transparency and accountability, which our \nconstituents deserve. To that end, we have passed the IRS Email \nTransparency Act. We also passed the Prevent Targeting at the IRS Act. \nThe list goes on and on and on, is my point.\n  I am proud to stand here tonight. I am proud to state that we, this \nentire body, have successfully passed real and meaningful legislation \nthat would vastly improve the lives of our constituents and our Nation.\n  However, the reality is that, without a fully engaged and willing \npartner on the other side of the Capitol, all this work that we have \ndone equates to nothing more than a vacant parking lot. It amounts to a \nwicked limbo of immobility or lethargic stasis. Quite frankly, the \nAmerican people deserve more than this.\n  I urge our friends on the other side of the Capitol to start taking \nup some of the legislation that this body has passed and to do so with \na sense of urgency.\n  I realize that they are described as the most deliberative body in \nthe world, but, frankly, it feels as though they are helping create an \nenvironment of absolute dysfunction.\n  I encourage them to take up bills and to move them forward so that, \nworking together, we can become the most decisive body in the world.\n  The clock is ticking. The American people are excellent timekeepers.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Hice for those \npassionate comments.\n  You know, in life, sometimes you run across people who are authentic, \nwho truly have a servant spirit. One of those people I have been \nprivileged to meet is right here in the Halls of Congress.\n\n[[Page H8349]]\n\n  He is a Representative from Arizona's Eighth Congressional District. \nHe is a Reagan conservative in his seventh term. He has one of the most \npowerful and passionate voices, a huge heart, but a strong voice for \nlife. It is a privilege for him to be a part of our People's Night 2.\n  I yield to my friend, my colleague, and the great Representative from \nArizona, Representative Trent Franks.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, if I could, let me express \nsincere gratitude to Congressman Walker for leading this effort \ntonight.\n\n  The people of North Carolina did a very wise thing to send this man \nto Congress. He has represented them faithfully. He is a Valley Forge \nAmerican that I wish there were more of in the United States Congress.\n  Madam Speaker, the direction of America and the world under the \nleadership of Barack Obama is alarming to any reasonable observer. To \nthose outside the beltway, Republicans seem weak and unwilling to \neffectively respond.\n  One of the hidden-in-plain-sight reasons for this false perception is \nthe rules and present practices in the United States Senate controlling \nthe parliamentarian instrument of the ``motion to proceed to \nconsider.'' This is the mechanism that allows the filibuster in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  Mr. Speaker, just very briefly, it takes 60 votes to allow a bill to \ncome to the floor for debate in the United States Senate. It takes \nanother vote of 60 votes to allow that bill to be actually voted upon.\n  The truth is that, with 54 Republicans, it takes 6 Democrats to help \nallow either debate or a vote to occur in the United States Senate.\n  Unfortunately, regardless of the nature of the bills, in recent \nyears, this simply has not been allowed to occur. Mr. Speaker, this has \nbecome a boot on the throat of the Constitution and a stalemate to this \nRepublic.\n  I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that, if we don't change it, the \npeople of this country are going to become so wearied of this process, \nso convinced that we will remain in gridlock forever, that they will \nsimply wash their hands of the American Government. If they do that, \nthen the Founding Fathers' dream itself could die in this generation. \nIt must not be allowed to happen.\n  To put this in practical terms, Mr. Speaker, the House of \nRepresentatives passed some months ago the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. The only thing that we did, using our \narticle I powers of the purse, was to say that we would not fund the \nPresident's illegal, unconstitutional executive order on immigration.\n  That bill then went over to the Senate, fully funding the Department \nof Homeland Security. Democrats in the Senate said: No. We are not \nvoting on the bill. You guys are shutting the government down.\n  Democrats want very much to shut this government down because they \nknow that the left-wing media will make sure that Republicans are fully \nblamed for that reality. That is what they want. It is not a deterrent \nto them. It is an inducement.\n  Mr. Speaker, the choice for House leadership is either to dumb the \nbill down so the Democrats will support it and thereby completely make \nthe Republican base heartbroken or allow the government to be shut \ndown. No one is accountable under this scenario, and it has to change, \nMr. Speaker.\n  For my Republican friends that say, well, what if we are in the \nminority, well, we have been in the minority and ObamaCare passed and \nall of these other things passed because, unfortunately, the \nwillingness of the Senate Democrats today to abuse this filibuster is \nso prevalent that it stops anything of consequence that matters to this \ncountry. Mr. Speaker, that has to change.\n  Under the current rules and practices, the balance between the \nreasonable opportunity to deliberate or debate and the ability to \nactually make a timely decision in the U.S. Senate no longer exists. \nThe technical remedy to fix this is to adopt a change in the rules that \nwill satisfy both the majority and the minority, prevent gridlock, and \nallow for consensus and the spirit of bipartisanship to return.\n  Tomorrow, Mr. Speaker, I will be introducing a resolution calling \nupon the Senate to adjust their rules to prevent this mindless \nstalemate and the practice of the current rules as written.\n  The goal, Mr. Speaker, is not to do away with the Senate filibuster, \nbut to maintain the ability of the minority to have leveraged objection \nto either majority overreach or deeply contested legislation while \nrestoring the accountability and deliberation to what is called the \nworld's most deliberative body.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have one last example. Almost 2 months ago this House \npassed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. We have passed \nmany bills that have never gotten to see the light of day in the Senate \nbecause of the Senate filibuster.\n  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act required that babies \nsurviving an abortion be given the same treatment and care that would \nbe given to any child born naturally premature at the same age.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  This bill now languishes in the Senate. It is uncertain if it will \neven be allowed a fair and honest debate up or down. These are born-\nalive children, Mr. Speaker--born alive--and no one can obscure the \nhumanity and personhood of born-alive babies or claim that there is a \nconflict that exists between now separate interests of the mother and \nthe child. Nor can they take refuge within the schizophrenic paradox \nRoe v. Wade has subjected this country to for now more than four \ndecades.\n  Mr. Speaker, protecting born-alive survivors of abortion is not a \nRepublican issue. It is not a Democratic issue. It is a test of our \nbasic humanity and who we are as a human family. Before my colleagues \nin the Senate vote against this bill or, far worse, do as they have \ndone so often and use the Senate rules to filibuster and avoid a vote \nand to deprive this bill of an honest debate and a fair vote, I would \nimplore each one of them to ask themselves two questions in the \nstillness of their own heart.\n  First, is turning our backs on the most helpless of our born-alive \nchildren truly who the United States of America has become? Second, is \nvoting against or filibustering against a bill to protect born-alive \nhuman babies from agonizing dismemberment and death who they have \nbecome as a Senate and what they want to be remembered for?\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time that we recognize that there are certain \nbills that are worth a vote, bills like protecting this country from a \npotential Iranian nuclear option and bills like protecting this country \nfrom allowing its little born-alive children to be killed \nindiscriminately. Mr. Speaker, that time has come.\n  I thank the gentleman for his kindness.\n  Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Representative Franks. I think America just \nsaw some of the eloquence as well as the passion with which you speak \nfor America's unborn.\n  As we have talked tonight about the many pieces of legislation that \nthe House has worked on diligently over the last 10, 11 months, here is \njust a partial list that I hold in my hands: legislation that is good \nfor the American family, a balanced budget, reduction of taxes, taking \ncare of our veterans. Tonight, with all due respect, we are calling \nupon Mitch McConnell and the Senate to move, to move diligently and to \nmove urgently. It is past time.\n  Tonight before my closing comments, I yield to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania's 12th District, Representative Keith Rothfus. It is maybe \njust a bit off topic, but something that is very important about what \nhas been going on over the last week.\n\n\n                            syrian refugees\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his \nleadership in organizing this Special Order. I thank him for allowing \nme to take a few moments to again take a look at what has been going on \nacross the world and the troubling news that we have from abroad.\n  I rise tonight, Mr. Speaker, to call for a moratorium on the entry of \nrefugees into the United States from Syria and all other countries that \nhave been infiltrated by ISIS and other terrorist groups until security \nconcerns can be adequately addressed.\n  In the wake of the recent attacks in Paris, in Beirut, and on a \nRussian plane flying over the Sinai, my first\n\n[[Page H8350]]\n\nand foremost concern is for the safety and security of my constituents \nin western Pennsylvania.\n  To put it simply, the safety and security of the American people are \nnonnegotiable. Right now we simply do not have the mechanisms in place \nto ensure that the 10,000 Syrian refugees that the President would have \ncome into this country over the next year and other refugees from \nterrorist-controlled areas are properly vetted.\n  FBI Director James Comey has said as much: ``If someone has never \nmade a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their \nidentity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our \ndatabase until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up \nbecause we have no record of them.''\n  The Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity have said the same. It is both reasonable and prudent to \ninsist that we know exactly who these individuals are before they \nsettle into our towns and cities.\n  Currently, we have neither the capability nor the capacity to do \nthis. The recent attacks have awakened us to the reality that Islamic \nState terrorists have the worst of intentions not only for Christians \nand other religious minorities in their own region, but for the entire \nWestern world. They are not, as the President has claimed, merely a \nsetback. They are acts of war by a terrorist scourge against decency \nand humanity and freedom and everything that we as Americans stand for.\n  It comes as no surprise, then, that ISIS has already stated it \nintends to attack the heart of the United States here in Washington, \nD.C., and it is not impossible that ISIS terrorists could enter the \ncountry by posing as Syrian refugees. In fact, reports indicate that a \nSyrian passport was found next to the body of 25-year-old Ahmad al-\nMohammad, one of the suicide bombers in Paris. He was born in Idlib, a \ncity in northwest Syria, and the Paris prosecutor's office said his \nfingerprints matched those of a person who traveled through Greece last \nmonth.\n  So the security concerns that the American people are raising are \nnot, as the President and others have suggested, without merit. They \nare completely legitimate, especially as the number of refugees is set \nto increase to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017, a significant \nincrease from the average 70,000 per year over the past several years.\n  The truth is that the American people are an incredibly compassionate \nand generous people. We have a rich history of assisting people in \nother nations around the globe when they are suffering from a \nhumanitarian crisis, poverty, oppression, or war. Since September 11, \n2001, the United States has resettled 748,000 refugees from around the \nworld. The American people have also assisted innocent Syrian refugees \nfleeing from violence in search of a better life, providing $4.5 \nbillion in humanitarian aid since the start of the crisis in Syria to \nhelp them relocate in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and other \nnations.\n  While we desire to assist those who need help around the globe, we \nhave a solemn duty to protect our citizens. The bottom line is we need \nto put the safety and security of Americans first. The solution I am \nproposing today is indefinite, but not necessarily permanent. It is the \nonly responsible thing to do under these circumstances.\n  We need time to review and implement policies that will ensure that \nthose who seek refuge in the United States are properly vetted.\n  I also urge my colleagues in the Senate to act boldly and promptly to \nensure the security concerns of the American people are addressed.\n  Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Representative Rothfus.\n  Our second People's Night was scheduled weeks ago before the \nterrorists struck Paris.\n  I believe it is appropriate this evening to send out our sincerest \nthoughts and prayers to the Parisian families and others whose lives \nhave been changed forever by these cowardly attacks. Though my heart is \nheavy, my discontentment with this administration has reached a new \nlevel of frustration.\n  Last year President Obama stated that ISIS was not a serious threat. \nIn fact, many of us remember him referring to them as the JV squad. \nJust hours before this barbaric attack, the President emphatically \nexpressed that ISIS had been contained and they were no longer \nexpanding.\n\n  As a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I couldn't \ndisagree more. According to the FBI, there are more than 1,000 open \ninvestigations that are ISIS or terrorist related. ISIS is a clear and \npresent danger to the American people.\n  Earlier today, in a joint hearing with the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs and the Committee on Homeland Security, General Jack Keane \nshared these words:\n\n       ISIS is the most successful terrorist organization of our \n     time. The world does not believe that our country is serious \n     about taking on ISIS.\n\n  The general added:\n\n       ISIS is not contained, and they are at war with us, but we \n     are not at war with them.\n\n  While President Obama plays down the threat, other world leaders are \nleading and exhibiting and showing strength. Even the Pope has been \nwarning us that these attacks and others could be the beginning of \nworld war III.\n  After reviewing the evidence and testimony, I am convinced that it is \nonly by the grace of God and the diligent work of our local, State, and \nnational law enforcement that we haven't been hurt in the same manner \nthat played out just last weekend in Paris. Sadly, President Obama has \nyet to offer any plan, any strategy, or any solution to slow down these \nsons from hell.\n  There is more evidence, continuing evidence of the disastrous Obama \ndoctrine. The words of the President this past weekend sounded more \nlike a spokesperson for the United Nations than America's Commander in \nChief.\n  This is more of the same flawed foreign policy that we have \nexperienced, just like we did in the recent Iran deal. May I remind us \nthat 25 Democrats stood with Republicans, rebuking such a deal. Even \nmore are calling on the President to speak with clarity and with \nboldness. The American people have grown weary of the constant swag and \ncondescending responses.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much longer can we afford to wait on a President who \nstubbornly refuses to identify these devils as radical Islamist \nextremists? I would hope and pray that all Members of this House would \nband together, demanding the President deliver a definitive course of \naction. It is time, Mr. Speaker, for the President to settle up.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8350-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4038, AMERICAN \n              SECURITY AGAINST FOREIGN ENEMIES ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia (during the Special Order of Mr. Walker), from \nthe Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.

Hice of Georgia). Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, Will and Ariel Durant, perhaps the most \nrenowned recorders of the history of mankind, wrote shortly after their \nlandmark 40-year multivolume work was completed:\n  ``Civilization is not inherited; it has to be learned and earned by \neach generation anew; if the transmission should be interrupted . . . \ncivilization would die, and we should be savages again.''\n  It is a warning we must heed. For all of our advancement in self-\ngovernance, the rule of law, and the betterment of people's lives, the \nworld stands in crisis. Our actions toward evil, twisted brands of \nmilitant Islamic jihadism in the coming months will determine how \nhumanity navigates the coming century. As Will Durant correctly \npredicts, we must either prevent the death of civilized life or become \nsavages again.\n\n[[Page H8351]]\n\n  Responding to the Paris attacks, French President Francois Hollande \nis correct in saying enough is enough. The coalition of willing \ndefenders of humanity is immense. The world looks toward America for \nour leadership.\n  ``Why? Why does it have to be us?'' people ask. It is for the same \nreason we ask a trusted colleague for counsel, for the same reason a \nresident asks a neighbor to help him with a heavy lift, for the same \nreason a parishioner asks his pastor for guidance in times of crisis, \nfor the same reason a citizen asks a policeman for assistance in times \nof trouble, and for the same reason those attacked ask a soldier to \ndefend them. For the sake of civilization, we must provide it.\n  American accommodation of ISIS savagery through lethargy must end. \nShould America remain dispassionate and disconnected, she is at risk of \nlosing her moral compass. Are we really an America today that no longer \ncan be moved by any action, by beheadings, immolations, crucifixions, \nsexual enslavement, and human suffering in the lands that these savages \nhave forcibly taken? Are we so self-indulged that we somehow think that \nleaving ISIS alone is a legitimate option for the good of the world?\n  The President has suggested that ISIS' actions are acts of genocide. \nOn that, we absolutely agree.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Yazidis have been targeted by ISIS in their genocidal fanaticism. One \ncity overrun saw ISIS lining up all males 12 and above in a gymnasium, \nseparated them into groups, and systematically exterminated them.\n  Young Yazidi girls, whose only crime was being born, have been forced \ninto sodomistic, sexual slavery by a Godless, evil, twisted brand of \nIslamist jihadist ideology that also conveniently fits rape and child \nmolestation into a twisted, sinister form of ethics.\n  In Mosul and Palmyra, Christians have been singled out for \ndestruction of life and property by marking their structures with an \nArabic N.\n  Across Iraq and Syria, Chaldean and Assyrian Christians have been \nslaughtered while we in Congress thump our chest about refugees as \nAmericans call on us to turn a blind eye toward these Syrian refugees \nthat the United Nations has tried to place with willing churches and \nsponsors here at home.\n  Have we forgotten that it is the statue of Lady Justice that is \nblindfolded as she holds up a balanced scale, not the Statue of Liberty \nwho holds the torch?\n  Lady Liberty is inscribed on our shores with these words:\n  Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp, cries she with silent lips. \nGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe \nfree, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the \nhomeless, tempest-tossed, to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door.\n  In the last 3 weeks, more than 400 people have died in three separate \nattacks as a Russian airliner has been blown from the sky, Lebanese \nworshippers were blown to bits, and youthful French citizens and \ntourists were massacred as they ate at cafes and watched a concert.\n  As the world watched in horror, it has also looked to the United \nStates. Where America leads, nations stand shoulder to shoulder. Where \nAmerica is absent, tyranny takes it chances and rears its ugly head. \nBut who would have thought America, through constant inaction and \nlistless response, would allow barbarity to prosper?\n  Since last year, the President has been unable to articulate his \nstrategy to aid our allies in Iraq, Jordan, Turkey, and Israel, as they \nreact to the disintegration of Syria on their borders. More broadly, \nthe President has been unable and possibly unwilling to form the \nnecessary multinational coalitions in the Middle East and elsewhere \nthat are essential to curb barbarism and provide stability within the \nSunni Arab populations of Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has filled the \nvoid.\n  As a combat veteran of Iraq and other places, this has been difficult \nfor me personally to process. In service past, we sacrificed to turn \nthe country around. I watched my American and Iraqi friends die, \nhandled the flesh and blood of infantry combat, performed brutal \npersonal combat to take human life, and watched with agony as the good \npeople of Iraq suffer in absence of effective government.\n  It is personal because I have lived among the Sunni Arab. I have \ncelebrated their victories, their weddings, their birthdays, and their \naccomplishments. I have broken bread with them and eaten at their \ncommunal bowls. I have mourned as close Sunni Arab friends have died to \nacts of terror, mourned when Sunni Arab educated, intelligent, and free \npeople have been expunged by ISIS. They do not want this. They have no \nplace to go.\n  When I lived among them, we told them with conviction and honesty \nthat we would be there for them. They believed us. Then the President \nordered us out.\n  We soldiers and servicemembers who have sacrificed so much in Iraq \nweep. We defeated Saddam's army, toppled the Baathist Government, \ncaptured and brought a world tyrant to justice, fought an insurgency \nand stood shoulder to shoulder with disenfranchised Sunni Arabs and \nSunni Kurds to restore control to Iraq's government. We turned the \ncountry around together with a military pause.\n  Instead of the United States nurturing a nascent Iraqi \ninfrastructure, as we have done in the Philippines, Germany, Japan, and \nSouth Korea, to give them a future, the President used that pause for \nabandonment, both militarily and diplomatically.\n  Worse, he then used that for political expediency. Where we \nsacrificed, he quit. When America became absent, radical, evil Islamic \njihadists filled that gap with cruelty, fear, and barbarity before, a \nnascent government and population had the strength to build trust and \nhold firm.\n  Whatever the President's political advantage, whatever the supposed \ncost saving, whatever the heartfelt conviction of why some believed \nabandonment was the optimum course of action, it has instead created a \npolitical nightmare, transcending nations, and has bled more treasures \nand lives than any estimates our continued presence might have caused.\n  Moreover, it has sickened the hearts of world humanity to see \ncivilization taking such punishment from savages when a quiver of \noptions have been available to shoot at the heart of the problem.\n  America has the capacity, the intelligence, and the goodwill to rally \nnations, but it cannot be a unitary effort. It must be collective. It \ncannot be a defensive effort. It must be offensive to blunt further \nattack.\n  As President Hollande of France was saying enough is enough, \nPresident Obama proceeded to tell America and the world what the \nattacks on Paris were not and what our actions would not be.\n  Mr. Speaker, this Congress and the American people need rather to \nhear from our President what the attack was and what our actions will \nbe to make them stop.\n  The President, distracted by his ideological efforts, though sincere, \non climate, has failed to see that the world is on fire. The people of \nour great Republic have not failed to see it. They are calling on us to \nstand with France and say enough is enough.\n  What should be our immediate action? How about some of this? Cripple \nRaqqa. It is clear it is the symbolic center of ISIS power. The \nPresident's cabinet says: We are worried about collateral damage and \ncivilian casualties.\n  News flash. The most humane thing we can do to end suffering of \nhundreds of thousands of people is to cripple what ISIS draws its \nstrength from. Destroy their infrastructure. Hammer their electricity \ncapacity. Drop their transmission lines. Eliminate their cell towers \nwhere they draw their communications capacity. Destroy the bridges on \ntheir roads of ingress and egress. Hammer their oil refining \ninstallations they possess and fund themselves with. We have the \nability to rebuild them later, but ISIS would be diminished financially \nby their loss.\n  Put a different way, the most humane thing we can do to protect \ncivilians is to disrupt ISIS' immediate ability to advance and recruit. \nIf the U.S. leads, others will stand shoulder to shoulder. We need our \nPresident to be that man.\n  To do these immediate actions on Raqqa, we also need to take the \nhandcuffs off of our military that has already deployed. Weeks to get \napproval\n\n[[Page H8352]]\n\nand missed targets, allowing freedom of movement for ISIS is not a way \nto win anything.\n  It is not enough for the Secretary of Defense to merely endorse plans \nput before him by our military experts. Endorse? That type of \nequivocation tells our military leaders: We don't have your back.\n  We need the Secretary of Defense to lead. Don't endorse. Approve \nthem. The Secretary must take the handcuffs off our pilots and special \noperations forces that are already deployed. Our warriors know what to \nhit. They can't throw punches with handcuffs.\n  Another action we can take. World opinion and goodwill is on our \nside. France has the support of all civilized countries. They will \nlikely have the support of a U.N.-sanctioned effort. They may ask for \narticle V protections under NATO and would likely get it.\n  So what will America do? Lead. Let's build that coalition. NATO \nspecial operations forces, combined with Kurds and Sunni Arabs, can \nprovide the immediate ground capacity. Safe zones where Assad cannot \nreach them with airstrikes and barrel bombs will give them \ndeterminations and hope. Modern civilized allies can provide airpower, \nlogistics, the wealth, and the commitment.\n  Russia has opened the door with statements from Foreign Minister \nLavarov that a stabilized Syrian Government cannot include Assad. We \nshould walk through that door. That solves having to build new \ngovernance.\n  Syria has survived civil wars before. She can again. Old structures \ncan have new leaders with new coalitions that provide voice to all \nSyrians once ISIS is expunged.\n  In Iraq, we must find a place for the Sunni Arab and Sunni Kurd to \nhave self-determination without having to turn to ISIS. The fighters \nexist. But they won't fight to be enslaved by draconian Shia Arab \ngovernance in Baghdad. That gives them no future. With Raqqa squeezed \nin Syria, we must build the coalition to restore Mosul and Baiji.\n  Then the disenfranchised Sunni Arab and Sunni Kurd must have a place \nat the table both in Syria and Iraq in post-conflict rebuilding. This \nwill not be possible while savages run free and civilized nations do \nnothing.\n  America needs to build the coalition on an ISIS-first policy. Then we \ncan settle into the less barbaric and less threatening future. We have \na window. Do we have a President that will lead?\n  Here are some immediate short-term measures.\n  Launch cyberattacks on ISIS recruiting Web sites. While interceptive \ncommunications is important and we want to track their movements and \nintentions, we cannot confuse that with allowing ISIS propaganda to \nreach into our free communities to turn misguided youth into \nneighborhood attackers.\n  Intercept what we must, but attack what draws recruitment and copycat \nactions in the first place. We cannot be just defensive in this area. \nPart of reducing homegrown terrorists is to cut off the juice from ISIS \nabroad. They should not have a free hand in our free speech.\n  Now let's talk about counter-messaging. Here is what every American \ncan do to help. American news stations and newsprint can join the fight \nby not putting ISIS-produced videos and imagery on networks as B-roll \non our newscasts and in articles in our newspapers. Why should we \npromote their propaganda?\n  Replace it rather with cross-hairs and explosions of their defeat or \nshow rather the world their acts of barbarity and the human suffering \nthey have created for their own people. Use that for B-roll.\n  America must stop aiding and abetting these evil savages that use our \nfree press, our laws, and our protections to destroy ours. Americans, \nwrite your local stations and ask them to please stop.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to shift my focus now to the refugee crisis.\n  While I have tried to focus my comments on actions that we should \ntake to eliminate ISIS, one action we should not take is to become like \nthem. America is a lamp that lights the horizon of civilized and free \nmankind.\n  The Statue of Liberty cannot have a stiff arm. Her arm must continue \nto keep the torch burning brightly. If we use our passions, anger, and \nfear to snuff out her flame by xenophobic and knee-jerk policy, the \nenemy wins. We have played into their hands, period.\n  Here are some Syrian refugee facts you may not know. Despite a long-\nestablished, multilayered system to vet and bring refugees into the \nUnited States--I have worked with the International Organization for \nMigration on deployed battlefields, and I have worked with the UNHCR in \ntheir efforts to help place refugees--despite a long-established \nsystem, despite biometric and biographic screening, despite \nintelligence vetting with the National Counterterrorism Center, the \nFBI's Terrorist Screening Center, and the Departments of State, \nDefense, and Homeland Security, added to the fact that Syrian refugees \nreceive additional screening to national security concerns--and most of \nthem are women and children--coupled with the fact that only a total of \n1,900 Syrians have entered this country in the last 4 years, most of \nthem women and children, Americans across the country now are calling \non Lady Liberty to drop her torch and give the stiff arm, with perhaps \neven another gesture.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  I want you to listen carefully to these statements by Members of \nCongress in response to a refugee bill--not an illegal immigration bill \nor permanent residents, but refugees, a refugee bill. Listen to these \ncomments by Members of Congress about people fleeing for their lives.\n  Fighting immigration is ``the best vote-getting argument . . . The \npolitician can beat his breast and proclaim his loyalty to America.''\n  ``He can tell the unemployed man that he is out of work because some \nalien has a job.''\n  Here is another one:\n  Congress must ``protect the youth of America from this foreign \ninvasion.''\n  And how about this one?\n  ``American children have first claim to America's charity.''\n  There are many more, but these quotes were from 1939. The refugee \nbill was not for Muslim and Christian Syrians or Iraqi Muslims, \nChristians and Yazidis; it was for German Jews. While it was true that \nGermany was, indeed, a threat, the refugees were not. They were 20,000 \nchildren.\n  Not only did that bill of 1939 not pass, but that Congress, with the \nsame speech and rhetoric that I have been hearing in recent days in \nthis august Chamber, Mr. Speaker, passed hurdle after hurdle in 1939 to \nmake it more difficult for refugees to enter. They were, unfortunately, \nsuccessful.\n  Mr. Speaker, America protects her liberty and defends her shores not \nby punishing those who would be free; she does it by guarding liberty \nwith her life.\n  Americans need to sacrifice and wake up. We must not become them. \nThey win if we give up who we are, and even more so, without a fight.\n  We guard our way of life by vigilance. We must be watchful. We have \nto have each others' back and be alert to dangers around us. We must \nspeak up when we see something unusual. By maintaining who we are \namidst the threat, amidst the hatred, amidst the trials, we win.\n  Patrick Henry did not say, ``Give me safety or give me death,'' but, \nrather, ``Give me liberty,'' implying that he was willing to lose his \nlife to defend that liberty.\n  We have defended our way of life, Mr. Speaker, for 240 years. Now we \nas Americans must defend it again.\n  We must defend it when the critic sitting on the couch in his \nunderwear eating his bag of cheese puffs is pecking out hatred and \nvitriol on some social media.\n  We must defend it and have courage when voters are caught up with \nsincere passion, demanding security that also might kill our liberty.\n  We must defend it with our warriors who have worked hard to keep the \nfight off our shores by being vigilant and aware at home and while \nlooking after their families who don't have them to protect them.\n  We will always have threats, but liberty, when lost, takes \ngenerations, if ever, to regain.\n  I am asking all Americans tonight to pray for our President. How much \ntime, really, have we spent on our knees at home for our leaders? How \nmuch counsel have we sought from the Almighty?\n\n[[Page H8353]]\n\n  It is God who has given us the spark of freedom. It is He we must \nturn to. He will take us and guide us in times of crisis, if we only \nask Him and humble ourselves and seek His face as a nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, we would not even have that nation without the aid of \nFrance. Lady Liberty would not even stand on our shores without the \ngenerosity of France. And now, as civilization faces peril and trial, \nwe must stand the test, shoulder to shoulder with France, this \nCongress, our people, our way of life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/house-section/article/H8353-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The Speaker announced his signature to an enrolled bill of the Senate \nof the following title:\n\n       S. 799.
