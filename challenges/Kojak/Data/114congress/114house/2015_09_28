The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last week I joined a fact-finding \ndelegation to Honduras led by WOLA, the Washington Office on Latin \nAmerica. We looked at the problem of violence and the lack of \nopportunity in order to understand why families and young people \ncontinue to flee the country. We wanted to learn what the Honduran \nGovernment and people were doing in response to the problems that \nconfront their country and how the United States might help. We met \nwith families, young people, and community leaders in several marginal \nand violent communities, including those who benefit from programs at \nCasa Alianza.\n  The delegation also visited an innovative USAID-sponsored violence \nprevention program. It not only offers programs for young people in a \npoor and dangerous neighborhood, but brings together community leaders \nand local institutions to tackle local problems. By strengthening local \nleaders and groups and working with trained and vetted local police, \ncrime levels have dropped and new opportunities for youth have been \ncreated. These are hopeful results for a community that 1 year ago was \nunder siege by violent criminal actors.\n  We also met with many NGOs, human rights defenders, and international \norganizations to understand the intertwined problems of human rights, \nDemocratic governance, and corruption. We had substantial conversations \nwith Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and met with our \nAmbassador, James Nealon, and his team, and I am grateful for how \ngenerous they were with their time.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues a few thoughts and \nconclusions from this trip.\n  First, I have no doubt that violence or lack of opportunity are \ndriving families and young people to flee Honduras. I saw the marginal \ncommunities and heard the stories from families about the problems \nyoung people face. The best thing we can do is support efforts that \nbreak the cycle of violence and help build opportunities for youth in \nHonduras and elsewhere in Central America. At Casa Alianza and the \nUSAID project, we saw the kind of programs that actually make a \ndifference. That is where we should be directing our assistance.\n  Additionally, I also heard how long-term drought is exacerbating \nhunger, malnutrition, and the loss of livelihoods in rural central \nHonduras and igniting a new wave of migration.\n  Second, I heard from returned migrants and the families of migrants, \nincluding those whose loved ones have disappeared and never been heard \nfrom again. Migrants face abuse as they travel. They are extorted by \nauthorities in Mexico and sometimes Guatemala and robbed or kidnapped \nand held for ransom by criminal groups. Young women run the risk of \nbeing trafficked and forced into prostitution.\n  We heard from returned migrants, especially those who had been \nstopped in Mexico, about the return journey and the lack of services at \nthe El Corinto border crossing. We met migrants who had fled gang \nviolence only to be forced to return to the same dangers.\n  I was moved by many of these stories. Migrants, even those traveling \nwithout legal documents, have basic rights, and we should be working \nwith the Governments of Mexico and Honduras to ensure that they get \ndecent treatment, access to needed services, and the protection they \ndeserve.\n  Third, human rights abuses continue to be a serious problem in \nHonduras. Longtime human rights defenders, journalists, and gay, \nlesbian, and transgender activists described ongoing threats, attacks, \nand even assassinations, and the response by the police and the \nattorney general has not improved. In fact, a U.S.-supported special \ninvestigative unit that was supposed to focus on attacks on the LGBT \ncommunity, journalists, and others has investigated even fewer cases \nthis year than last.\n  I am troubled by the government's focus on special military police \nunits, whose human rights record isn't good. I support the U.S. \ndecision not to provide aid to the military police. Instead, the \nHonduran Government needs to\n\n[[Page H6264]]\n\nclean up and strengthen civilian police and the Attorney General's \nOffice.\n  My trip to Honduras was both challenging and inspiring. I saw \ntroubling problems of poverty and violence, heard painful stories about \nmigrant abuses and disappearances, and saw major problems in the area \nof human rights and the protection of human rights defenders and \nactivists.\n  But I also saw hope. I met with young people who dream of bright \nfutures for themselves in Honduras, with student and youth leaders who \nare campaigning selflessly and courageously to build mechanisms to \ntackle corruption, and with LGBT activists, human rights defenders, and \njournalists who are standing up to threats. I saw community-led \nprojects to combat violence and poverty that are making a real \ndifference.\n  Mr. Speaker, last week our Nation was graced by the presence of Pope \nFrancis. I was deeply moved by his call for us to welcome the stranger, \nto help the most vulnerable among us, and to work together for the \ncommon good. I believe each of those calls to action apply to the case \nof Honduras, both in how we respond to Hondurans fleeing to the United \nStates to find safe haven and a new life and how we help Hondurans \nrespond to their own problems inside their country.\n  I look forward, Mr. Speaker, to working with my colleagues to help \nthe Honduran people deal successfully with these challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6264-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DKI APCSS 20TH ANNIVERSARY VIDEO MESSAGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nHawaii (Mr. Takai) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 20th \nanniversary of the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, located in \nWaikiki, Hawaii. I want to extend my congratulations to the Center on \nreaching this important milestone.\n  For the last 20 years, the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies \nhas made significant strides in educating, connecting, and empowering \nsecurity practitioners. I would like to thank the Center for their \nleadership. I am pleased to see the APCSS renamed as the Daniel K. \nInouye Center, honoring the legacy of the late Senator who advocated \nstrongly for peace and stability around the world.\n  As the United States shifts its focus to the Asia-Pacific region, the \nDaniel K. Inouye Center will be uniquely situated to play a critical \nrole in driving our Nation's security policy.\n  The U.S. rebalance to Asia will rely heavily on Hawaii's location and \nrelationship with our partner nations in the region.\n  I can think of no better venue than the Inouye Center for bringing \ntogether representatives from different countries to discuss joint \ncooperation on important issues.\n  As I have witnessed firsthand, the Center is focused on producing \nresults. This will be crucial as we continue to move forward with the \nrebalance and begin to tackle some of the most pressing security-\nrelated issues.\n  Once again, I want to extend my congratulations on 20 years of \nservice and my warmest thanks--mahalo--for the tremendous work being \ndone there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6264-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, this week the House Armed \nServices Committee, led by Chairman Mac Thornberry, marks Cyber Week, a \nweek that highlights the importance of cyber to our families and to our \nmilitary. This week of hearings, with witnesses from private \ncorporations and the Department of Defense, is a fitting start as we \nalso recognize Cyber Security Awareness Month during October.\n  Recent cyber attacks, like the devastating attack on the Office of \nPersonnel Management, have made it clear that cyber is the new domain \nof attacks on American families. Personal data, such as Social Security \nnumbers, financial information, and security clearance documents, were \nstolen, putting the personal and financial security of our citizens at \nrisk. The attack underscores the increased reports of cyber attacks \nagainst our military Web sites, government data, and businesses.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, \nwith dedicated staff members like Pete Villano, Kevin Gates, and Nevada \nSchadler, I look forward to Cyber Week's focus to protect American \nfamilies.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6264-8", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6264-H6265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GOP GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, almost unbelievably here we are just 2 days \naway from another GOP government shutdown. Republicans, who control \nboth Houses of Congress, have yet to bring a budget agreement, just a \ncouple of days before the government shuts down, that would keep \ngovernment open. Democrats stand ready to negotiate, to talk, to come \nup with an agreement that can move this country forward, that can keep \ngovernment open, at the very least.\n  We just can't afford another government shutdown. The last time this \nhappened, it cost the economy billions of dollars and people lost their \njobs. Shutting this government down, allowing the government to be shut \ndown over a partisan ideological point, is reckless, and it ought to be \navoided at all costs.\n  You don't have to look very far in the headlines to see that the \nRepublican Conference is in some disarray. I understand that. The \npolitics of that are just going to have to work themselves out.\n  Meanwhile, the business of the American people has to be attended to. \nWe have got to get this country back to work. If we don't do that, we \nwill not be doing the jobs that people sent us here to do.\n\n[[Page H6265]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6265-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n               THE CITY OF CARPINTERIA'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. CAPPS.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCardenas) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on H.R. 1624.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The bipartisan bill before us today is a much-needed fix for small-\nbusiness owners and employees struggling to comply with the healthcare \nlaw. H.R. 1624 is a bill to amend the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act and the Public Health Service Act to revise the definition of \nsmall employer. The bill would allow the States to continue defining \nthe small group health insurance market as employers with 1 to 50 \nemployees.\n  Section 1304 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nchanged the Federal definition of the small group market to include \nemployers with 1 to 100 employees. The States, however, have been \nallowed to continue defining the small group market as employers with 1 \nto 50 employees until January 1, 2016.\n  But beginning on or after January 1, 2016, plans sold or renewed for \nemployers with 51 to 100 employees will be subject to the various small \ngroup health plan regulations established by PPACA. These more \nrestrictive rating rules will increase health insurance premiums for \nthese employers and reduce flexibility in benefit design.\n  The new requirements could also lead some employers with 51 to 100 \nemployees to self-insure to avoid higher premiums. If that happens, \nthis could result in adverse selection in the small group pool and \nhigher premiums for employers with 1 to 50 employees.\n  Unless this current law is reversed, the disruption in the \nmarketplace will be significant. For example, it is estimated that, \nunder current law, more than 3 million employees will experience a \ndouble-digit percent increase in their healthcare premiums.\n  Ultimately, cost increases for small employers will change their \nchoices regarding offering coverage, could change their business model, \nand will ultimately be felt by millions of workers.\n  Because the impact of current law will vary by State, defining the \nsmall group market should be left to the States, which is a policy \nenvisioned in H.R. 1624.\n  I am pleased to say there is considerable support for this \nlegislation in the House and the Senate.\n  The flexibility that would be given to States with immediate passage \nof H.R. 1624 would help ensure stable, small group health insurance \nmarkets that reflect the unique characteristics in each of the States.\n  If Congress passes H.R. 1624, premiums will be lower and allow \nmillions of employees and employers to keep the plan they have and \nlike. This is a\n\n[[Page H6266]]\n\ncommonsense policy that deserves our bipartisan support.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1624.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, at this point, I reserve the balance of my \ntime so that Congressman Guthrie can speak first.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the vice chair of the Health Subcommittee on \nEnergy and Commerce.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1624, the Protecting Affordable Coverage \nfor Employees Act. This bill, which I introduced along with my friend \nfrom California (Mr. Cardenas), Congressman Markwayne Mullin of \nOklahoma, and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona will protect smaller employers \nfrom increased healthcare costs and will prevent their employees from \nbeing forced out of their current healthcare plans.\n  The small group market is currently defined as 1 to 50 employees, but \na provision in the healthcare law will expand the group's size from 1 \nto 100 on January 1. With this expansion comes more onerous regulations \nand the expectation of dramatic rate hikes.\n  One estimate by Oliver Wyman predicts that those in the 51 to 100 \ngroup will see an average of an 18 percent premium increase in 2016 \nbased on the new rating rules alone. H.R. 1624 stops the mandated \nexpansion of the small group market that will occur on January 1 and \nallows States to define their own market.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have heard from many Kentuckians who would be impacted \nby this change, and their concerns are real. Small businesses are \nafraid to expand, and mid-sized businesses have no idea what the costs \nwould be or how they can plan for this new change.\n  This issue has widespread support, with over half the House as \ncosponsors and nearly a third of the Senate as cosponsors. Members on \nboth sides of the aisle agree that we must act now to stop this new \nmandate.\n  It has been a great pleasure working with the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Cardenas). It is an issue that we see is happening in \nWashington, that is happening out in our districts, out across to the \nbusinesses.\n  Both sides of the aisle have come together to say: Let's change the \nlaw. Let's make sure that the small businesses and medium-sized \nbusinesses are not affected, and let's move forward.\n  It wasn't just that we signed our names as cosponsors. There was a \nlot of hard work that I know the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCardenas) did to bring more and more cosponsors to this bill. This is a \nsignificant change. It is significant for the people who live in our \ndistricts. I encourage support.\n  I appreciate Mr. Cardenas, Ms. Sinema, and Mr. Mullin.\n  Mr. CARDENAS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to first thank my colleague from Kentucky \n(Mr. Guthrie). It has been a pleasure and honor to serve with him on \nthis bill.\n  It is really important for us to understand how monumental this \nmoment is. This isn't the biggest bill in the world. But, yet, at the \nsame time, if you are a small business in the United States of America \nand you have 1 to 50 employees or now even 1 to 100 employees, this \nbill hopefully will help affect your business and your employees in a \nway that is better.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1624. I truly appreciate the willingness to \nwork on a bipartisan bill, as demonstrated today, which is going to \npositively impact so many communities across the country through the \nsmall businesses it will affect.\n  H.R. 1624, the Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees Act, \nintroduced by my colleagues, once again, Mr. Guthrie, Mr. Mullin, Ms. \nSinema, and myself--two Republicans and two Democrats is a true \nbipartisan effort--would stop a potential health insurance rate shock \nby allowing States to determine the appropriate size of their small \ngroup market.\n  As a former small-business owner myself, I recognize the struggle \nthere is to live out the American Dream. I know how difficult it can be \nwhen a specific sector of small business is affected by regulations and \nlaws created by local, State, or Federal governments.\n\n  I have seen the impact in neighborhoods throughout my district when a \nsmall local business opens their doors or closes their doors. Their \nsupply chain is local. Their employees have a vested interest in their \nsuccess. Their customers treasure the connection a small hometown \nbusiness brings.\n  I know I echo the view of the entire U.S. House of Representatives \nwhen I applaud these small businesses, the risks that they have taken, \nand the celebration of their successes.\n  The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. By no means is the Affordable \nCare Act perfect. But I am grateful for all the benefits that the law \nhas provided since its enactment.\n  Today more than 16 million Americans have gained access to affordable \nhealth insurance that did not have it before enacting the act. My \ndistrict is one of only two districts in the United States to see a \ndouble-digit increase in insured residents since the implementation of \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  The Affordable Care Act is the biggest change to American health care \nin the past 70 years. It brings down costs, covering more Americans and \nmaking dozens of other crucial changes to how our Nation views health \ncare. However, no law is perfect.\n  When it was first created, Social Security didn't cover agricultural \nand domestic workers. Medicaid didn't begin to cover mammograms until \n1991. Even with these fundamental programs of our Nation's safety net, \nimprovement and compromise was necessary to lead to more perfect laws.\n  While certain States, like California, have decided to move forward \nwith the expansion, this bill still provides States the flexibility to \nensure market stability for small businesses across the country.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan effort to bring this bill to the floor. I \nlook forward to advancing the PACE Act and continuing to build on a \nrecord of working together in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I was just sharing a moment with my colleague from Kentucky, \nCongressman Guthrie, in talking about how proud I am of this moment and \nhow much I appreciate his willingness to reach across the aisle and \nwork with us to make sure that we bring a fix--not the biggest fix, but \na fix--that will help American businesses and American workers across \nthis country.\n  It is an opportunity for us to work together. But, more importantly, \nit is an opportunity for us to do the job that we were elected to do: \nto put aside partisan bickering, to make sure that we look at what is \nbest for America, try our best to bring a bill to the floor through \nboth houses, and, hopefully, get the signature of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Again, it was due to this bipartisan effort that I think that what I \njust described is going to happen. Come January of 2016, it is going to \nbe a better place for all of us--for our businesses and our workers--\nbecause we were willing to work together.\n  Once again, it is not the easiest thing to do, but it is something \nthat, unfortunately, is far too rare. I hope that this is the \nbeginning, the beginning of many of us working together and making good \nthings happen for America and its Territories.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1624.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It is an important bill. \nIt is a bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. \n1624.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, since the passage of the Affordable Care \nAct, 17.6 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage and \nare no longer one accident, injury, or diagnosis away from financial \nruin. This is the largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades.\n  The ACA has increased access and reduced financial barriers to \nimportant preventive services, such as cancer screenings and well-woman \nvisits by requiring their coverage with no cost sharing. The law also \nstopped insurers from discriminating based on preexisting conditions or \nplacing annual limits on how much health care they will cover.\n  Though the ACA is already helping millions nationwide, no law is \nperfect, and there are certainly ways we can improve the ACA and build \nupon its successes. Given the political theatre that tends to surround \nthe ACA, I am pleased to see that my Republican colleagues\n\n[[Page H6267]]\n\nare ready to work together on bipartisan proposals such as H.R. 1624 \nwith the goal of strengthening the law. Unfortunately, though, I do not \nagree with the approach this bill takes.\n  H.R. 1624 would permanently change the law to make the small group \nexpansion currently required under the ACA optional for states and \nallow states to ``opt in'' if they choose. Research tells us that some \nstates simply are not ready to expand their small group market and that \nexpansion in these states could result in higher costs for certain \nconsumers. However, the small group expansion was included in the ACA \nfor good reason. The benefits of expansion such as added consumer \nprotections and increased stability for small employers are important \nand achievable goals. States like Washington are already experiencing \nthe benefits of an expanded small group market.\n  I am concerned that H.R. 1624 is premature, and I would instead \nprefer a few year transitional delay of the small group expansion or an \n``opt out'' option for states instead. I believe these alternatives \nwould ensure that states continue to work towards the goal of \nexpansion, rather than disregarding the provision altogether.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am also disappointed that this bill was not considered \nunder regular order. Such an important issue deserves thoughtful \ndiscussion and opportunities for amendments. I had hoped to offer an \namendment that would allow states to ``opt out'' of the expansion. \nSince I was unable to discuss this amendment and other potential \nchanges to the bill with my colleagues in a committee markup, I remain \nuncertain that this legislation is the best course of action.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1624, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6267-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6267-H6268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1515\n                     GOLD STAR FATHERS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. WALBERG.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 136, the Gold Star Fathers \nAct of 2015. This important piece of legislation supports fathers of \npermanently disabled or deceased veterans in their search for \nemployment with the Federal Government.\n  Mr. Speaker, under current law, mothers of certain permanently \ndisabled or deceased veterans receive preference in hiring for civil \nservice positions in recognition of their sacrifice. That preference \napplies when the mother is widowed, divorced, or separated, or if their \nhusband is totally or permanently disabled.\n  The Gold Star Fathers Act of 2015 extends this same benefit to \nfathers. The bill also grants preference in hiring to parents who never \nmarried along with those that are widowed, divorced, or legally \nseparated.\n  I thank Senators Wyden, Brown, and Collins for their work over \nseveral Congresses on this important issue, and Congresswoman Esty for \nsponsoring the House companion bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude to our veterans and to the \nmothers and fathers of our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 136, the Gold Star \nFathers Act of 2015, bipartisan legislation introduced by my colleague, \nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, last January and cosponsored by Senators \nSherrod Brown of Rhode Island and Susan Collins of Maine. This bill \npassed the United States Senate by unanimous consent in May of this \nyear and was favorably reported out of the House Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee in July.\n  This legislation also has bipartisan support in the House in the form \nof identical legislation, H.R. 1222, introduced by my colleague, \nRepresentative Elizabeth Esty, of Connecticut.\n  In appreciation of the sacrifices that Gold Star families have made \non behalf of our grateful Nation, the Gold Star Fathers Act would \nextend the 10-point hiring preference for Federal civilian jobs to the \nfathers of servicemembers who have been permanently disabled or who \nlost their lives while serving on Active Duty. This would be identical \nto the Federal hiring preference that has been available to our Gold \nStar Mothers since 1948.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is reflective of the immense gratitude \nthat we hold as a nation for the parents of our fallen and disabled \nheroes. It also recognizes the profound sacrifice that our Gold Star \nfamilies continue to endure every day. It is a burden that is \nshouldered by the very few on behalf of the entire Nation.\n  Back in South Boston, my mother-in-law, Helen Shaughnessy, originally \nHelen Bailey, is a Gold Star sister. She lost her brother, Arnie \nBailey, in April of 1944 on his first jump over the Rhine close to the \nend of the Second World War in Europe. I know that their family \ncontinues to carry that pain and that burden each and every day.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support Ms. Esty \nin her efforts, along with Senator Wyden and others in the Senate, to \nsupport S. 136.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman \nfrom Connecticut (Ms. Esty). I would like to introduce and welcome her \nremarks. She is the lead sponsor of this bill in the House and has been \na true champion on behalf of veterans all over this country.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 136, the Senate \ncompanion to my bill in the House, the Gold Star Fathers Act of 2015.\n  I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings for \ntheir support of our Gold Star families and for prioritizing this \nbipartisan bill that would bring equity to the treatment of all Gold \nStar families, and I want to thank my friends Mr. Walberg and Mr. Lynch \nfor their support today.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Memorial Day last year, I met with Gold Star families \nin Waterbury, Connecticut, and I heard the stories of how deeply they \nfeel the loss of their loved ones, whether that loss was a year ago, 20 \nyears ago, or 40 years ago. I heard from mothers and I heard from \nfathers about the difficulty of continuing on without a member of their \nfamily that they held so dear.\n\n[[Page H6268]]\n\n  Those willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country \ndeserve to know that we will support and care for their loved ones they \nleave behind. After talking with these families, I knew that we needed \nto do more for these grieving families and we needed to do more to \nrecognize the sacrifice of their loved ones. That is why I introduced \nthe House bill companion of the Gold Star Fathers Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, our country has long recognized that mothers who have \nlost a child in military service or are caring for their son or \ndaughter who was permanently disabled in the military deserve a hand \nwhen seeking Federal employment. Currently, qualifying mothers of \ncertain disabled or deceased veterans are eligible to receive the \nveterans hiring preference that will no longer be used by their loved \none when applying for certain Federal service jobs.\n  However, mothers are not the only ones who grieve. The loss of a \nchild is felt just as strongly by our veterans' fathers as by their \nmothers. It is time to ensure equal treatment of and respect for all \nparents of deceased or disabled veterans. That is why the Gold Star \nFathers Act would extend this hiring preference to fathers as well.\n  In many cases, not only have the parents undergone significant trauma \nemotionally, but they have lost a working-age member of their family; \nand in the case of a permanently disabled child, they may have mounting \nmedical bills to deal with as well. It is time to establish equality in \nour Nation's treatment of the parents of deceased and disabled \nveterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senators Wyden, Collins, and Brown for \ntheir leadership on the Gold Star Fathers Act in the Senate, and I want \nto thank my former colleague Representative Tim Bishop for his past \nleadership on this issue as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call on all of my colleagues to join us in honoring \nour Gold Star families. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto vote in favor of this bipartisan, unanimously supported Gold Star \nFathers Act.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense bill. It is more \nthan common sense. We talk about family values a lot. These are family \nvalues. These are highest family values of parents that have raised \nyoung people who are willing to step forward for our country without \nconsideration of their own lives or their futures in most cases. So I \napplaud my colleagues' efforts on this behalf, and I support and ask \nthat this bill be supported fully by this body.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 313, the Wounded \nWarriors Federal Leave Act of 2015, sponsored by my colleague, \nCongressman Stephen Lynch. This important piece of legislation supports \nwounded warriors newly hired in the Federal Government.\n  The Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act of 2015 supports our disabled \nveterans transitioning to civilian careers by providing sick leave for \nmedical treatments and appointments that are related to their service-\nconnected disability.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation provides immediate access to \nsick leave for any new Federal employee who is a veteran with a \nservice-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more for the \npurposes of undergoing medical treatment for such disability.\n  Because Federal employees begin with a zero sick leave balance and \naccrue sick leave over time, disabled veterans beginning civilian jobs \noften have insufficient sick leave to attend medical appointments \nrequired for treatment of their service-connected disabilities. This \nbill provides our newly hired disabled veterans with immediate access \nof up to 13 days for sick leave so that our disabled veterans do not \nhave to take unpaid leave to care for their service-connected injuries.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 313 is supported by a number of veterans and \nemployee organizations, including the American Legion, Veterans of \nForeign Wars, and Federal Managers Association.\n\n[[Page H6269]]\n\n  I commend Mr. Lynch for his leadership on this issue and for working \nwith Mr. Farenthold, Ranking Member Cummings, Mr. Connolly, and Ms. \nNorton to bring this bipartisan legislation before the committee. I \nalso want to acknowledge Senators Tester, Moran, and Toomey for their \nwork on the Senate companion bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 313, the Wounded \nWarriors Federal Leave Act of 2015.\n  I introduced this bipartisan legislation in January of this year, and \nI am proud that it has now gained the support of over 30 Democratic and \nRepublican Members of Congress.\n  I also want to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), for \nhis remarks and his support of this bill. At the outset, I would also \nlike to thank Chairman Jason Chaffetz and Ranking Member Elijah \nCummings along with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold) and the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) of the House Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee for their leadership in bringing H.R. 313 \nto the floor. I would also like to thank many of the veterans groups \nand Federal unions and workforce organizations that have joined \ntogether to endorse this legislation. They include the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the American Legion, and the 31 unions and member \norganizations that make up the Federal Postal Coalition.\n  Let me also commend Jennifer Hemingway of the majority staff for the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee and Lena Chang of the \nDemocratic staff for our committee for their great work on this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act will address a \nproblem faced by many wounded warriors who are transitioning to \ncivilian life through new careers in the Federal workforce. Currently, \na first-year Federal employee will begin his or her career with zero \nsick leave in the event of a medical event. That is because under \ncurrent law, full-time Federal employees only earn 4 hours of paid sick \nleave for each pay period that they work.\n  Obviously, starting from the beginning, they will have zero balance \nin their sick leave bank--with a maximum of 104 hours of paid sick \nleave that is available per year. Nevertheless, new employees start \nwith zero. While Federal workers are able to carry over unused annual \nsick leave from year to year, they begin their first year on the job \nwith no sick leave whatsoever.\n  Now, this lack of initial leave for newly hired Federal workers is \nparticularly burdensome on those employees who are also wounded \nwarriors. These employees need to make regular visits to the VA to seek \nmedical treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain \ninjury, and other service-connected disabilities, and they are quickly \nforced to burn up any sick leave that they do accrue during their first \nyear at a Federal agency.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Several wounded warriors who have transitioned to the Federal \nworkforce following their tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nother assignments have highlighted this difficulty during discussions \nwith me and my staff.\n  These workers reported that, without sufficient leave during their \nfirst year on the job, they were routinely faced with the difficult \nchoice between having to take a day off work without pay or simply \nskipping their scheduled VA appointments altogether. Some wounded \nwarriors reported that the closest VA facility to their job was located \na 2- or 3-hour drive away.\n  As additionally noted by the Federal Managers Association: ``Young \nmen and women struggle with available leave as they attempt to keep \nservice-related, medically-necessary appointments, which puts undue \nstress on both managers and their Federal employees as they try to meet \ntheir Congressionally-mandated missions and goals.''\n  Mr. Speaker, we must afford our wounded warriors the flexibility to \nreceive medical care as they transition to serving our Nation in a new \ncapacity, through a Federal civilian job. The Wounded Warriors Federal \nLeave Act would do just that.\n  This bill will provide first-year Federal employees who have a VA \ndisability rating of 30 percent or greater with 104 hours of wounded \nwarrior leave from the moment they begin their Federal workforce \ncareers. This includes eligible new hires at our Nation's largest \nemployer of veterans--the Defense Department--as well as the United \nStates Postal Service.\n  H.R. 313 also recognizes that these dedicated Federal workers will \nhave accumulated up to 104 hours of traditional sick leave by the end \nof their first year on the job. That is why the bill also provides that \nany unused wounded warrior leave would not carry over beyond the second \nyear.\n  The Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act will also provide critical \nimportance, given that the most recent Federal data on veterans \nemployment indicates that Federal agencies are hiring a growing number \nof veterans each year. In fiscal year 2014, nearly 60,000, or 33.2 \npercent, of new hires at Federal agencies were veterans. That is an \nincrease of 9.2 percent over fiscal year 2009.\n  With the number of our young people who have served multiple tours of \nduty--three, four, five tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan--this is \nespecially important. Approximately 16,000 of newly Federal employees \nwere wounded warriors with a disability rating of 30 percent or \ngreater.\n  Again, I am thankful to Mr. Chaffetz, Mr. Walberg, Mr. Cummings, and \nMr. Connolly. And, also, I want to thank Mr. Tester. When we sent this \nbill over to the Senate looking for a cosponsor in the Senate, Senator \nTester was quick to step up and take on this fight in the Senate. I \nwant to thank him for his work on this bill in the Senate side.\n  In closing, I urge all our Members to vote in favor of H.R. 313.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I truly thank Congressman Lynch for his leadership on this issue. It \nis an issue not only whose time has come, but probably should have come \nlong before this. It is a great idea that deals with the reality of \nwhat we face in dealing with wounded warriors and their ongoing success \nthat this country--a grateful country--ought to be involved with \nencouraging.\n  I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 313.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6269-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6269-H6271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FEDERAL VEHICLE REPAIR COST SAVINGS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. WALBERG.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Vehicle Repair Cost \n     Savings Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that, in March 2013, the Government \n     Accountability Office issued a report that confirmed that--\n       (1) there are approximately 588,000 vehicles in the \n     civilian Federal fleet;\n       (2) Federal agencies spent approximately $975,000,000 on \n     repair and maintenance of the Federal fleet in 2011;\n       (3) remanufactured vehicle components, such as engines, \n     starters, alternators, steering racks, and clutches, tend to \n     be less expensive than comparable new replacement parts; and\n       (4) the United States Postal Service and the Department of \n     the Interior both informed the Government Accountability \n     Office that the respective agencies rely on the use of \n     remanufactured vehicle components to reduce costs.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n\n[[Page H6270]]\n\n       (1) the term ``Federal agency'' has the meaning given that \n     term in section 102 of title 40, United States Code; and\n       (2) the term ``remanufactured vehicle component'' means a \n     vehicle component (including an engine, transmission, \n     alternator, starter, turbocharger, steering, or suspension \n     component) that has been returned to same-as-new, or better, \n     condition and performance by a standardized industrial \n     process that incorporates technical specifications (including \n     engineering, quality, and testing standards) to yield fully \n     warranted products.\n\n     SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT TO USE REMANUFACTURED VEHICLE COMPONENTS.\n\n       The head of each Federal agency--\n       (1) shall encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle \n     components to maintain Federal vehicles, if using such \n     components reduces the cost of maintaining the Federal \n     vehicles while maintaining quality; and\n       (2) shall not encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle \n     components to maintain Federal vehicles, if using such \n     components--\n       (A) does not reduce the cost of maintaining Federal \n     vehicles;\n       (B) lowers the quality of vehicle performance, as \n     determined by the employee of the Federal agency responsible \n     for the repair decision; or\n       (C) delays the return to service of a vehicle.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of S. 565, the Federal Vehicle Repair Cost \nSavings Act of 2015. This bill is a bipartisan and bicameral effort \ndesigned to reduce the costs of maintenance for the Federal vehicle \nfleet.\n  The Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act encourages agencies to \nuse remanufactured vehicle components when doing so will reduce \nmaintenance costs while also maintain quality.\n  The term ``remanufactured vehicle components'' refers to components \nthat have been returned to same-as-new or better condition and \nperformance by a standardized industrial process that incorporates \ntechnical specifications.\n  In 2013, a Government Accountability Office report found that \nremanufactured vehicle components, such as engines, starters, \nalternators, steering racks, and clutches, tend to be less expensive \nthan comparable new parts.\n  In fact, a 2012 study by the U.S. International Trade Commission \nfound that remanufacturing parts can result in savings of 85 percent of \nthe energy and material used to manufacture equivalent new parts. \nFurther, this study found that remanufactured parts are, on average, 20 \nto 50 percent less expensive.\n  Requiring agency heads under this bill to encourage their Federal \nvehicle maintenance staff to use remanufactured components will reduce \nmaintenance costs, which totaled $975 million in 2011, for 588,000 \nvehicles.\n  This bill is also supported by the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers \nAssociation, which directly employs over 734,000 people in U.S. \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressmen Huizenga and Ashford for \ntheir work on the House companion bill. I also want to thank Senators \nPeters and Lankford for their work on this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan cost savings \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of S. 565, the Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings \nAct, introduced by Senator Peters of Michigan.\n  I would also like to recognize Representative Bill Huizenga of \nMichigan for his good work on this legislation.\n  S. 565 passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent last \nmonth. With today's House passage, it can go straight to the \nPresident's desk for his signature.\n  The Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act would require the head of \neach Federal agency to encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle \ncomponents if doing so would reduce costs while maintaining high \nquality. The intent behind this bill is to raise awareness of the \noption of using remanufactured parts and inform agency fleet managers \nof this cost-saving option.\n  I would note that the bill encourages the heads of Federal agencies \nto use remanufactured parts, but the decision ultimately to do so would \nremain at the discretion of fleet managers.\n  According to a March 2013 Government Accountability Office report, \nFederal agencies spent about $1 billion on vehicle repair and \nmaintenance in 2011. The report also found that remanufactured vehicle \ncomponents tend to be much less expensive. For example, the Postal \nService and the Department of Interior informed GAO that they rely on \nremanufactured vehicle components to reduce costs.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense piece of legislation that seeks to \nsave taxpayer dollars and better ensure that the Federal Government is \npurchasing high-quality products.\n  I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to vote for this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), my good friend and colleague.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee, especially my friend, Chairman Chaffetz, and my \nfriend, Mr. Walberg, here from Michigan, as well as Ranking Member \nCummings, for bringing this bipartisan, bicameral bill to the floor to \nsave taxpayer dollars and create jobs.\n  I often hear, like most of us do, from our constituents: Why can't \nCongress work together and get something done and eliminate wasteful \nspending and create jobs? Well, we have got it, folks. Here we go.\n  With the Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act, I teamed up with \nSenator Gary Peters, also of Michigan. We are going to save literally \nmillions of taxpayer dollars by reducing spending on Federal vehicle \nmaintenance and create good manufacturing jobs.\n  Our commonsense bill calls on Federal agencies to use remanufactured \ncomponents to repair and maintain the Federal vehicle fleet when using \nthose parts would lower costs, achieve higher safety standards, and \nmaintain quality and performance.\n  Remanufactured parts are less expensive than brand-new parts and have \nbeen returned to same-as-new condition. I know this from firsthand \nexperience, owning a small sand and gravel operation where we \noftentimes use remanufactured parts on our own trucks. The component \nmay be an engine, may be a transmission, may be a drivetrain, may be a \nrear end or an alternator. Each of those repairs presents an \nopportunity to be more fiscally responsible with taxpayer dollars.\n  In 2013, a GAO report found that the Federal Government owns a fleet \nof approximately 588,000 vehicles. The cost of maintaining that fleet \nhas ballooned to nearly $1 billion.\n  While it is clear there needs to be a fleet of these Federal vehicles \nto have access to a reliable motor pool, it is important that these \nvehicles be maintained efficiently and effectively to ensure that those \ntax dollars--our precious tax dollars--are used in the most effective \nway possible.\n  In addition to eliminating wasteful spending, this legislation serves \nas an important boost to good-paying jobs and remanufacturing \nsuppliers.\n  According to the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, \nremanufacturing of motor vehicle parts is responsible for over 30,000 \nfull-time jobs across the United States. For example, in my district, \nValley Truck Parts, headquartered in Wyoming, employs 250 Michiganders. \nIn Kentwood, Michigan, North America Fuel Systems Remanufacturing \nemploys more than 150 people.\n  These companies, among so many others across Michigan and so many \nother States, demonstrate how remanufacturing supports good-paying \nmiddle class jobs in States like Michigan and Ohio and North Carolina \nand Pennsylvania and so many others. It is\n\n[[Page H6271]]\n\ngoing to play an expanded role, I believe, in making this Federal \nGovernment even more efficient.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in this effort to save millions \nof taxpayer dollars, support good jobs, and make the Federal Government \nrun more efficiently.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, having heard the comments on this, I urge the adoption of \nthis commonsense bill that encourages also us doing an environmental \nthing as well in using resources that we have.\n  I ask that my colleagues support this commonsense bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 565.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6271-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6271-H6272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GRANTS OVERSIGHT AND NEW EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. WALBERG.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I introduced H.R. 3089, the Grants Oversight and New Efficiency, or \nGONE, Act, to bring much-needed accountability to the Federal grant-\nmaking process.\n  This bipartisan bill requires each agency to report to Congress on \nthe amount of expired and empty grant accounts that remain open on the \ngovernment's books.\n  Under the bill, the agencies must examine the 30 grants that have \nbeen expired for the longest period of time and explain why these \ngrants have not been closed.\n  One year after this initial report, these agencies will update \nCongress, reporting on which accounts previously identified have been \nclosed and which remain open. These reports will help Congress better \nunderstand why expired grant accounts remain open at taxpayer expense.\n  Mr. Speaker, in fiscal year 2014, Federal grant expenditures exceeded \n$529 billion, and that is real money. This enormous amount of money \ndemands strong financial management to protect taxpayer dollars from \nwaste.\n  In 2012, GAO released a report on the timeliness of grant closeouts \nby Federal agencies. The report found nearly $1 billion remaining in \nundisbursed funds within expired grant accounts.\n  Within one of the grant management systems GAO examined, there were \nalmost 1,000 accounts that had been expired for 5 years or more and \nstill had not been closed out.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  GAO found out that this same management system contained 28,000 \nexpired grant accounts with no funds in them. Mr. Speaker, expired \ngrant accounts create multiple levels of waste.\n  First, the undisbursed funds remaining in expired accounts could be \nbetter used for their appropriated purpose or returned to the Treasury \nto help bring down the deficit and mounting debt.\n  Second, agencies pay a monthly fee for each account that remains open \nwithin the Federal payment management system. As a result, agencies \ncould be spending roughly $2 million per year to maintain these 28,000 \naccounts with no funds in them, assuming they have not been closed. \nSurely we can find a better use for these taxpayer dollars rather than \nwasting funds maintaining expired accounts.\n  Finally, grants that are not properly closed out slow the grant-\nmaking agency from conducting the necessary oversight to ensure that \nfunds were properly spent and that taxpayer money is not being wasted. \nThe GONE Act is a response to these issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3089 utilizes the Department of Health and Human \nServices to coordinate with agencies to provide these reports to \nCongress. HHS was chosen for this role because of some of its \nsuccessful closeout efforts implemented in 2011. HHS's commendable work \non grant closeout is exactly\n\n[[Page H6272]]\n\nwhy we added a provision to this bill requiring HHS to coordinate with \nthe Office of Management and Budget in reporting to Congress on \nlegislative changes needed to improve the process of grants \nadministration.\n  H.R. 3089 strengthens oversight by asking the inspectors general of \nthe largest grant-making agencies to conduct a risk assessment of their \nagency's grant closeout processes.\n  I thank Senators Fischer and Manchin for their work on the Senate \ncompanion bill, S. 1115, including their work on the bill before the \nHouse today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to bring some commonsense steps to \nthe Federal grant-making process by supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the legislation under consideration, H.R. 3089, the \nGrant Oversight and New Efficiency Act, was introduced by my friend Mr. \nWalberg of Michigan in July of this year; and it was reported out of \nthe House Oversight Committee with the support of Mrs. Brenda Lawrence, \nalso of Michigan, this month. This bill would require one-time reports \nfrom Federal agencies on expired grants.\n  As noted earlier by Mr. Walberg, in a report by the Government \nAccountability Office, Federal agencies do not always close out expired \ngrants properly. In fact, GAO has found that in 2011, nearly $800 \nmillion in undisbursed balances remained in expired grant accounts. \nThat money could be returned to the Treasury and spent on any number of \npressing priorities here in the House and Senate.\n  In particular, Mr. Walberg's bill, H.R. 3089, would require agencies \nto report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Congress on \ngrants that have expired and whether they have undisbursed balances. \nThe bill would also require agencies to make recommendations on which \ngrants should be closed out immediately as well as explain why certain \ngrants were not properly closed out to begin with.\n  I commend the Representatives from Michigan, both Mr. Walberg, our \nlead sponsor on this bill, and Mrs. Lawrence, for their work on this \nbipartisan bill. This is a commonsense, good government measure that \nevery Member should support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his support and \nleadership on the floor. I thank the chairman and ranking member of our \ncommittee. Most importantly, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nMichigan, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, for her support and helpful \nadditions to this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3089, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6272-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6272-H6275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AIRPORT AND AIRWAY EXTENSION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. LoBIONDO.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on H.R. 3614.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, on September 30, 2015, the authorization for the Federal \nAviation Administration programs and taxes that fund those programs \nwill expire. H.R. 3614 is a clean, 6-month extension of all necessary \nauthorizations through March 31 of 2016.\n  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation, I believe it is \ncritical for Congress to come together in a bipartisan, long-term FAA \nreauthorization bill.\n  On the Aviation Subcommittee, Chairman Shuster and I have had great \nworking partnerships with Congressman DeFazio and Congressman Larsen. I \nwant to thank Congressman DeFazio and Congressman Larsen for their \nbipartisan cooperation in this very important area.\n  Without an extension, the FAA will not be able to spend funds from \nthe Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Therefore, airport construction \nprojects across the country will be halted, contractors that support \nFAA will not be paid, construction jobs will be lost, and thousands of \nFAA employees could be furloughed.\n  In my district in New Jersey, I have the privilege of representing \napproximately 4,000 FAA employees and contractors who work at the FAA's \npremier technical center in the Nation. They contribute an \nextraordinary amount of energy and dedication to making sure that \naviation continues to move forward. Without them, the state of aviation \nin our country would suffer, and we cannot afford them to be at home \nfor failing because we failed to do our work and pass an extension \nbill.\n  A lapse in the authorization will also result in the halt of \ncertification and registration of new aviation products, greatly \ndisrupting the aviation manufacturing industry and jeopardizing more \ngood paying jobs. The FAA's aircraft registry would close, delaying \ndeliveries of new aircraft. As many as 10,000 aircraft a month could be \ngrounded if registration cannot be renewed.\n  H.R. 3614 will allow us to continue developing a bipartisan, long-\nterm reauthorization bill which will improve, rebuild, and modernize \nour Nation's safe, yet highly antiquated, aviation system.\n  I urge support of H.R. 3614.\n  I reserve the balance of my time\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I agree with my good friend, the gentleman from New \nJersey, that it is essential that we pass H.R. 3614--the Senate passed \nit expeditiously--and it be signed by the President. We cannot afford \neven, you know, the thought of a shutdown of the FAA. We have actually \ngone down that road in the past.\n  Chairman Mica, in July of 2011, put some provisions into an FAA \nreauthorization that were objectionable to two very powerful Senators, \nand we actually went through a shutdown. What we lost was $400 million \nof revenue because the excise tax expired.\n  Now, one airline, to give them credit, did pass the savings through, \nthe excise tax, Alaska Airlines. All the other airlines kept the money, \nand we lost $400 million from the trust fund.\n  Capital programs ground to a halt. Airport construction ground to a \nhalt, threatening tens of thousands of jobs. Airport inspectors had to \nwork. They were essential employees. They weren't paid, and they \ncouldn't get government vouchers, so they had to use their personal \ncredit cards to purchase tickets to go to work to do their job, which \nthey weren't being paid for.\n  I mean, this was the ultimate of absurdity. I only go into some \ndetail on that because that is relevant to this extension.\n  This is a 6-month extension. That should give us more than ample time \nto agree upon a long-term FAA authorization. Much work has already been \ndone on major portions of the bill, but some disagreements remain over \nthe future of the air traffic organization.\n  My preference would be to insulate the entire FAA from future \nvicissitudes of Congress going off the rails with a shutdown and \nfurloughs and provisions that are unacceptable to the Senate that cause \na temporary lapse in authorization. You know, we can get there. We are \nvery close now. This year, all but 7 percent of the FAA's budget will \nbe paid for by user fees, excise taxes, and others, so we are quite \nclose.\n  We would like to reform procurement, to streamline it and make it \nwork better at the FAA. When I was a very young Member of Congress, I \ngot to witness the airport air traffic controller's workstation of the \nfuture. That was 1987. Well, it is 2015, and they don't have them yet.\n  The FAA is the only agency of government worse at procurement than \nthe Pentagon. Congress has tried to reform it; it didn't stick. We have \ngot to try something different to get it to be more agile to give us \nthe 21st century equipment and software that we need.\n  Then there are issues of the actual sort of shape of the FAA \nbureaucracy, a little bit like that in the middle. Congress, also back \nin 1986, gave the FAA license to reform personnel practices to deal \nwith some of that midlevel management bulge and streamline the agency \nand decisionmaking process, but that didn't take either.\n  So the three problems are the predictability of funding and the \nagency being able to look into the future without having to worry about \nshutdowns, furloughs--I don't know how much time they spent over the \nlast couple of weeks getting ready for this shutdown that everyone \nthought would come this week before Speaker Boehner announced his \nretirement; that has got to\n\n[[Page H6274]]\n\nbe dealt with--and then also the procurement reform and the personnel.\n  The chairman's solution is to separate only the air traffic \norganization from the FAA and insulate that from Congress and those \nsorts of problems and make it, you know, free of the procurement rules \nand a lot of the personnel rules. I would prefer to do that with the \nentire agency, because there are functions--we do have the best air \ntraffic control system in the world. We are busier in the U.S. with \nmore planes under instrument flight rules on a daily basis, about 20 \npercent more on an IFR average, than Canada, U.K., France, and Germany \ncombined.\n  So we know we have a safe system. We move massive amounts of air \ntraffic. We don't want to mess that up. And I understand, but I also \ndon't think we can isolate it from other decisionmakers in the agency \nand leave them subject to the vicissitudes of Congress.\n  The people who do the certifications, who do the inspections, who do \nthe safety, it seems to me it should all be moved; and I propose a 21st \ncentury constitutionally chartered corporation in order to accomplish \nthose goals and make it self-funding, self-sufficient, and not subject \nto appropriations or shutdowns or anything else that a future Congress \nmight imagine. So that is the hangup. We haven't agreed on that part \nyet, but I think we can.\n  We share common objectives, and 6 months should be more than ample \ntime. I am hopeful that early this fall the chairman and I can resolve \nthose issues with other members of the committee, and then we can go \nforward with our colleagues in the Senate and hopefully have, you know, \na bill on the President's desk early, early next year, if not by the \nend of this year, although December promises to be perhaps a bit \nchaotic around here.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  In any case, 6 months should be ample time. I do not anticipate \nmultiple short-term extensions. I don't want them, nor does the \nchairman, nor do, I believe, any other thoughtful members of the \ncommittee.\n  I see the gentleman from New Jersey shaking his head. We couldn't \nagree more. We have been down that road before, down that runway \nbefore. We don't want to go down that runway again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen).\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the \ntemporary measure to extend the authorization of the FAA today, but I \ndo so with great disappointment. We could be on the floor today to \nenact a longer term FAA reauthorization bill.\n  In the last 2 years, the Subcommittee on Aviation, led by my \ncolleague from New Jersey, Mr. LoBiondo, has held 16 hearings on a \nvariety of topics. We have heard from stakeholders that there is a long \nlist of things that we need to do to stay competitive with our economic \nrivals and keep our airspace the safest and most efficient in the \nworld:\n  We need to reform aircraft certification so that manufacturers can \nget the newest, safest equipment to market.\n  We need to set clear rules for unmanned aerial vehicles and \naccelerate efforts for their safe use.\n  We need to advance NextGen programs to move air traffic faster and \nmore efficiently.\n  Chairman Shuster, Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member DeFazio, and I \nhave achieved a bipartisan agreement on most of these major key issues \nthat we need to address. That bill is ready to go.\n  We didn't hear during these hearings that we needed to privatize air \ntraffic control. Now, some people want to privatize air traffic \ncontrol. I know that they want to do this in good faith. But we don't \nneed to do it, and it is preventing the things that we need to do from \ngetting done.\n  An entire bipartisan bill is being held up because we can't agree yet \non the details of what would be a very complex proposal. I fail to \nunderstand why at this juncture such a proposal is necessary, \nparticularly when it prevents significant and much-needed reform from \ntaking place.\n  There is no dispute that today we safely operate the most complex and \ncongested airspace in the world. Last year the Government \nAccountability Office asked 76 aviation stakeholders whether the FAA is \ncapable of operating an efficient air traffic control system. The \noverwhelming majority, 64 of those, said the FAA is, in fact, capable \nof doing so. Privatizing the current system is clearly not a pressing \nneed. It is a want.\n  I wish I could say today I am surprised that we find ourselves here \ntoday, but many people have been saying for a long time that this was \nthe situation that we would be facing on September 30. In fact, when we \nheld a hearing on air traffic privatization back in March, I predicted \nwe were headed down this road of multiple short-term reauthorizations.\n  The bipartisan portions of the bill that Chairman Shuster, Chairman \nLoBiondo, Ranking Member DeFazio, and I have agreed to would have \nimmediate benefits all over the country.\n  In my home State of Washington, it would protect and create American \njobs through airport construction and aerospace manufacturing; it would \nimprove aviation safety; it would improve the way the aircraft and \nparts are certified to get newer and safer technology to market; it \nwould build on the safety improvements that this body has made \nfollowing the tragic Colgan flight 3407 in 2009; it would improve the \nregulation and the development of unmanned aerial systems, which \ncontinue to proliferate in our airspace.\n  We need a strong regulatory system in place to safely grow the \nunmanned aircraft industry, and until we act, that system cannot be in \nplace. For every day of this extension, travelers and the aerospace \nindustry will not receive the improvements and protections that we have \ncrafted in the bipartisan portions of the bill that we are close to \nagreeing on. We will continue to fall behind other countries that are \nmaking similar improvements.\n  As many lawmakers and aviation stakeholders recall, the last FAA \nreauthorization bill came after a period of 5 years and 23 short-term \nextensions. I had hoped we would avoid serial extensions this time \naround, but today we start down that path.\n  Yes, it is with disappointment that I am here to support a temporary \nextension and strongly urge all my colleagues to make sure this is the \nonly temporary extension before enactment of a long-term bill.\n  We have a long list of things that we need to do today to improve our \nairspace. We should focus on those things instead of the things only \nthat we want to do.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, here we are with a short-term extension for \n6 months. I believe it is critical that we do this, obviously, as it is \nabout to expire. There are things that not only do we want to do, but \nwe need to do, to make sure that we have the safest airspace in the \nworld.\n  We also need to make sure it is the most efficient airspace in the \nworld. We can do that if we deploy the technology and the things we \nhave been talking about for almost 2 years now to transform the FAA \ninto something that can move quicker, that can deploy the technology \nthat is available to us.\n  When we look around the world, there are over 50 countries that have \ntaken the air traffic control organization out of government and have \nbeen able to maintain the highest levels of safety, but deploy \ntechnology that makes their airspace more efficient. That is the kind \nof thing we are looking at.\n  I think we are at a critical time. What we have been talking about is \nnot anything new. It is something that we have been talking about for \n20 years. In fact, the Clinton administration had a similar proposal, \nthe Bush administration had a similar proposal, and here we are today \ntalking about it. But I think that we have different groups that are \nlooking positively at this.\n  We are very close to putting something together that, as I said, will \ntransform the air traffic control system while keeping back in \ngovernment\n\n[[Page H6275]]\n\nthe safety and regulatory oversight to this agency to make sure that we \nare streamlining the certification process for our aviation industry \nthat is manufacturing everything from Boeings to Gulfstreams, to the \navionics, to the parts that go into these flying systems.\n  We have got to maintain our lead in the world. The way we do that is \nto streamline the certification process. The gentleman from Washington, \nwho has Boeing in his district, agrees with me on that issue. There is \na lot more in this that we need to do to move forward.\n  I think, as we get through September and into October, we are going \nto be able to see the bill that we have put forth that is going to \nhave, I believe, bipartisan support not only from Congress, but around \nthe country, around Washington, D.C., and, as I said, here in the \nHouse. In talking to the Senate, I am encouraged by what they have said \nabout what we are looking at proposing.\n  Again, I would encourage all Members to support this 6-month \nextension to give us the time to get our bill on and off the floor and \nlet the Senate work on it so we can truly do something that is bold, do \nsomething that is transformational, and do something that will be very, \nvery positive for aviation, not only travel, but for the manufacturing \nindustry in this country.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have requests to speak from Members who \naren't here.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to thank Mr. Shuster, \nMr. DeFazio, and Mr. Larsen. I urge all my colleagues to support the \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, with passage of H.R. 3614 today, the House \nwill ``kick the can down the road'' on a long-term FAA reauthorization \nfor another six months. I certainly recognize the dire need to keep our \nairports and air travel system functioning in the face of an expiration \nof the FAA's authorization in less than 72 hours. However, I'm very \ndisappointed that this bill does not contain any changes to current \npolicy regarding aircraft noise impacts on communities surrounding \nairports.\n  Over the last several months, constituents throughout my \nCongressional District have experienced an alarming increase in \naircraft noise due to the implementation of new flight paths under the \nFAA's Next Gen program. The new flight paths have caused certain \ncommunities to be hit especially hard by airplane noise, and other \nrural communities that have never experienced it are now being \nbombarded by noise. Many of these communities received little or no \nadvance notice or opportunity to comment on the flight path changes \nbefore they were implemented, and they were blindsided when the changes \nwent into effect earlier this year.\n  In July, I joined the Congressional Quiet Skies Caucus so that \ntogether we could make recommendations for the Transportation Committee \nto include in an FAA reauthorization bill. These recommendations \ninclude: ensuring that FAA completes a robust community engagement \nprocess before flight paths are changed; requiring the FAA to use a new \nmethod of measuring noise that captures the true levels of noise on the \nground; removing the categorical exclusion from full environmental \nreviews for flight path changes; and mandating independent research on \nthe health impacts of aviation noise. These important reforms would \nsubstantially improve the FAA's process of addressing and avoiding \nnoise impacts.\n  Once again, I wish to express my disappointment that the bill before \nus today simply reauthorizes the FAA for another six months with none \nof these important changes included. As the debate over a long-term FAA \nreauthorization continues, I hope these recommendations will be \ncarefully considered and ultimately included in the final legislation. \nThe ability to get a good night's sleep for thousands of my \nconstituents depends on it.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3614.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6275-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6275-H6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CARE AND HEALTH ACT\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2061 currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the EACH Act. This bill would expand the \nreligious liberty exemption to the individual mandate. Right now the \nexemption is minuscule. To qualify, you have to believe as a matter of \nfaith in giving up any private or public insurance, including Social \nSecurity. That includes the Amish, the Order of Mennonites, and that is \nabout it. That is way too strict.\n  Let's remember the reason for this mandate in the first place. The \nother side said that, if you get sick and you don't have insurance, the \nrest of us will have to pay for your health care. Well, we are talking \nabout people who do not use health care. So why should they have to be \nforced to buy insurance for health care that they don't use?\n  I don't think we should force anybody to buy health insurance against \ntheir will, for that matter, but I think it is especially wrong to \nforce people to buy insurance against their faith. This bill simply \nsays: If you, as a matter of faith, don't use health care, then you are \nexempt from the individual mandate.\n  I am glad we are working on this long overdue change today. I would \nnote that this came out of committee on a voice vote. I encourage \nMembers to support it.\n\n[[Page H6276]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The current religious exemption from ACA mirrors other religious \nexemptions used in the Internal Revenue Code. The EACH Act provides \nthat anyone who ``is a member of a religious sect that relies solely on \nreligious methods of healing and for whom medical care is inconsistent \nwith religious beliefs'' can claim a religious exemption from the \nindividual mandate requirement.\n  As a step to maintain a narrowly defined religious exemption and meet \nconcerns, this legislation is written more precisely than the previous \nbill that passed unanimously in this House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), the author of the EACH Act.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ryan for \nhis leadership on this issue. I really appreciate the Committee on Ways \nand Means allowing me, a noncommittee member, to be able to take this \nimportant piece of legislation to the floor today.\n  Today this Congress has an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to \npromote religious liberty and, frankly, Mr. Speaker, fairness. H.R. \n2061, the EACH Act, does this by modestly expanding the religious \nconscience exemption under the Affordable Care Act to include \nindividuals like Christian Scientists, who rely solely on religious \nmethods of healing.\n  The existing religious conscience exemption under the Affordable Care \nAct exclusively applies, as Chairman Ryan said, to a few certain sects \nof faith. As a result, many Americans--as I mentioned before, the \nChristian Scientists--are required to purchase medical health insurance \nthat does not cover the health care of their religious practice or \nchoice. Alternatively, they are forced to pay tax penalties for not \npurchasing such insurance.\n  A similar version of the EACH Act passed this House unanimously under \nthe suspension of the rules during the last Congress. In order to \nimprove the bill, as Mr. Levin, my colleague stated, modest changes to \nthis bill's language were made, with input from the Department of \nTreasury, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other key \nstakeholders.\n  Under this bill's new language, applicants must annually attest to \nthe exchange that they are a member of a religious group, that they \nrely solely on a religious method of healing, and that they have not \nreceived medical health services during the preceding taxable year.\n  Additionally, with the help of input from the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the bill now makes it clear that the legislation does not \npreempt any State laws requiring the provision of medical treatment for \nchildren. Further, if a parent needs to provide necessary medical \nservices to a child, doing so would not invalidate the individual's \nexemption.\n  The EACH Act is truly an example of bipartisan legislation with input \nfrom stakeholders to make it better. As of today, it has more than 100 \nRepublican and more than 60 Democratic cosponsors.\n  I am particularly proud to have worked with my friend and colleague, \nMr. Keating, on moving this legislation forward. He knows this issue \nwell. His home State of Massachusetts established a similar religious \nconscience exemption in State law, and it is working just as planned.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also represent Principia College in Elsah, Illinois. \nIt is a college for Christian Scientists. I am proud to stand up and \npromote their religious liberty and that of many others in this great \nNation.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on S. 139, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of S. 139, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials \nAct.\n  The National Institutes of Health says that there are 7,000 rare \ndiseases affecting people in the United States, and if we are going to \nfind cures for those diseases, the first thing we need to do is to get \npeople to participate in clinical trials. All too often, researchers \ncannot find enough participants because so few people have these \ndiseases in the first place.\n  Now--no surprise here--the government used to make it more difficult \nfor researchers to find people. Say you had a rare disease and you were \non public assistance, like SSI or Medicaid. If you got compensated for \nparticipating in one of these trials, you got smaller benefits. That is \nwhy, in 2010, we passed the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act.\n  For the past 5 years, this law has allowed people to collect up to \n$2,000 per year by participating in rare-disease clinical trials \nwithout threat of losing their SSI or Medicaid benefits. The GAO says \nthe law is working. Ever since we passed this law, more people on SSI \nhave been participating in clinical trials as a result of it.\n  The problem is this law expires next week, on October 5, so this bill \nwould simply extend current law. That way, more people can participate \nin clinical trials without any reason to worry or without any threat to \na loss of their benefits, and that way, we will continue to make \nstrides in fighting these diseases. CBO tells us this bill will cost \nvirtually nothing.\n  My friends, Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden, introduced this bill in \nthe Senate. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent. In the House, my \ncolleagues Mr. Doggett and Mr. Marino from Pennsylvania have introduced \nit along with 50 other cosponsors.\n  I will include in the Record a letter listing the many supporters of \nthis legislation. It is a list of over 70 organizations, including the \nCystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and the \nHuntington's Disease Society of America, just to name a few.\n\n\n[[Page H6277]]\n\n\n                                               September 22, 2015.\n     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Sander M. Levin,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Boustany, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on Ways \n         and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lloyd Doggett,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on \n         Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Ryan and Boustany and Ranking Members Levin \n     and Doggett: The undersigned organizations, representing \n     millions of Americans with rare and genetic diseases, \n     advocates, industry, and academic institutions, write to \n     express strong support for H.R. 209/S. 139, the Ensuring \n     Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015. This legislation will \n     permanently remove a barrier to clinical research and allow \n     Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid recipients to \n     participate in and benefit from clinical trials without fear \n     of losing vital benefits.\n       The Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015 \n     eliminates the sunset clause from the Improving Access to \n     Clinical Trials Act of 2009 (IACT), legislation signed into \n     law in 2010, making the IACT a permanent law. This will allow \n     patients with rare diseases to continue to receive up to \n     $2,000 in compensation for participating in clinical trials \n     without that compensation counting towards their income \n     eligibility limits for SSI and Medicaid.\n       Removing barriers to drug trial participation is \n     particularly important as recent advances in medical research \n     and technology allow for the development of new and promising \n     medications. Securing an adequate number of clinical trial \n     participants is vital for therapies that treat rare \n     conditions, but rare disease researchers in particular often \n     have difficulty recruiting drug trial participants, simply \n     because they have a smaller pool of patients.\n       Further, with the advent of precision medicine, therapies \n     are being customized to treat a patient's specific genetic \n     makeup. These types of trials often require clinical trial \n     participants bearing specific genetic mutations, which \n     necessarily creates an even more complex and exclusive \n     clinical trial recruitment process. Ensuring that all \n     patients with rare diseases are able to participate in \n     clinical trials can help open the door for the advancement of \n     new targeted therapies in many important areas of medicine, \n     including cancer and rare diseases like cystic fibrosis.\n       Now is the time to ensure that all patients have access to \n     clinical trials for potentially life-saving treatments. We \n     look forward to working with you to secure passage of this \n     bill to enable Social Security beneficiaries to participate \n     in clinical trials so that research into life-saving \n     treatments may continue to advance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Actavis\n     Adult CF Program--Northwestern University\n     Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease Research Foundation APBDRF\n     Alpha-1 Foundation\n     ALS Association\n     American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC)\n     American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association (AARDA)\n     Amyloidosis Support Groups Inc.\n     Ann & Robert H.

This is common sense, and I urge my colleagues \nto adopt this.\n  There is one more point I would like to make. Nick Gwyn, the minority \nstaff director of the Human Resources Subcommittee on Ways and Means, \nis retiring.\n  I would like to take a minute to recognize Nick Gwyn for his work on \nthis issue. He is leaving the staff of Ways and Means after serving on \nthe committee since 1998. This should be the last of many bills that he \nhas helped our colleagues manage on the floor.\n  During his time staffing the committee, Nick has worked on numerous \nlaws related to welfare, disability, and unemployment policy. He also \nworked closely with our staff to create bipartisan child welfare laws \nthat found more loving families for children in need.\n  We wish Nick well in the next stage of his career, and we thank him \nfor his service to the committee, the House, and the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I also wanted to honor Mr. Gwyn, and this \nis a good opportunity for us to do that.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan \n(Mr. Levin), the ranking Democrat on the committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Doggett and I will say a few words, when many, many \nare in order.\n  Nick Gwyn has been, as our chairman said, a more than valuable member \nof this staff and a more than dedicated member of this staff. He has \nbeen invaluable. His dedication has been endless.\n  Nick is leaving to pursue family and other needs. He knows he is \ngoing to leave us in need, in terms of his immense talents. His \ndedication to the subject matter that is, by definition, so directly \ninvolved with people is really beyond estimation.\n  The subcommittee's work deals, as I said, with the everyday \nchallenges that so many of the citizens in this country face day in and \nday out. It was only a few days ago that we heard from Pope Francis how \nimportant it is for this institution to focus on the individual needs \nof people, including those who are poor, some with handicaps, but \neverybody who is in need of a hand up, really, as much, if not more \nthan, a helping hand. And Nick has devoted over a dozen years to this \nvery purpose.\n  So, if I might say so, we have worked together with Nick, and we just \nwant to thank him for more than a job well done. We have been very \nproud to serve with him.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I will just add, Nick, that I know you have spent some 25 years here \non the\n\n[[Page H6278]]\n\nHill, 17 with our committee. Though I benefited from your good counsel \nbefore becoming the ranking Democrat on the Human Resources \nSubcommittee, I particularly appreciated your good counsel during the \nlast 3 years, whether it was working on child abuse and our successful \nwork with former Chair Dave Camp and getting a national commission or \ndealing with problems of the unemployed.\n  Just overall, the jurisdiction of our subcommittee is about children, \nchildren in need. Whether they are under this SSI program or child \nabuse or child care, they are children who should be able to rely on \nthe Temporary Assistance for Needy Family program for their needs.\n  Nick has been an able advocate for children and someone who did work \nwell, as Chairman Ryan said, with all members of our committee to \nadvance these purposes. We wish him well in his new endeavors, and we \nthank him for his service.\n  Mr. Speaker, if I might talk just a little bit about the Ensuring \nAccess to Clinical Trials Act, it is about getting new treatments \nquickly into the lives of patients that are suffering from dread \ndiseases across America, reauthorizing existing law.\n  Senator Ron Wyden led this effort successfully in the Senate with \nSenator Hatch. And here, my colleagues, Mr. Marino and Mr. Jim \nMcGovern, co-chairs of the Cystic Fibrosis Caucus, joined with me in \nthe introduction of this legislation in the House.\n  The National Organization for Rare Disorders, and over 75 other \norganizations, has been a strong supporter of this legislation, and I \nthank them for their work on behalf of the legislation.\n  This bill makes permanent a law that is due to expire that will allow \nfor individuals with certain debilitating conditions to exempt a small \namount of their income gained from participating in medical trials from \nSupplemental Security Income, or SSI, and for Medicaid eligibility \ndetermination.\n  This exemption removes an important barrier to participating in \nclinical trials. If it is allowed to expire, patients contributing to \nvital research could face the difficult decision of either dropping out \nof the trials altogether or losing their benefits.\n  If you have ever met with someone with cystic fibrosis or someone in \nyour family has it, you recognize how small the daily challenges that \nyou face are compared to theirs.\n  I think of Nicole Flores in Austin, who has two children battling \nwith rare diseases. She explained that patients shouldn't have to worry \nabout losing assistance when they are just working hard to stay alive.\n  Over the past several months, I have heard from a number of families \naffected by rare diseases. These are parents who shared with me how \nfar-reaching the modest relief this bill provides can provide for a \nnumber of people.\n  One couple recently sent me a picture of their 15-year-old son Mac \nRung, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at birth. Every morning \nand every evening, Mac undergoes chest therapy in order to clear his \nlungs and to avoid serious damage to help him get through the day. He \ntakes medications with every meal to help him absorb his food and gain \nweight. He is battling a disease that many Americans have never heard \nof at an age where he shouldn't have to worry about anything other than \nschool. And because this disease is progressive, they are really \nworking against the clock.\n  Because of the approval of two new drugs, they told me that they \nnever have had as much hope for Mac and his future as they do today. \nAnd while they are not a family that themselves rely on the bill that \nwe have today before us, as Chairman Ryan indicated, they, and anyone \nwith these rare diseases, stand to benefit if we have widespread \nparticipation in clinical trials on the approval of other new promising \ndrugs like the ones that are already helping Mac.\n  Financially penalizing vulnerable people for participating in \nresearch does nothing to advance that research. The National Institutes \nof Health--NIH, as we know it--estimates that 25 million Americans are \nsuffering because of rare disease.\n  I hope now that today, the House will join the Senate in approving \nthe Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act and that we continue this \nimportant effort to support patients across the country.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 209, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act, legislation that \nI have cosponsored.\n  We must continue to ensure barriers do not stall patients from \nparticipating in rare disease clinical trials. This bill will continue \nto encourage rare disease patients, even those receiving Social \nSecurity Income or Medicaid benefits, to participate in clinical trials \nwithout jeopardizing their eligibility for those benefits. All patients \nshould have access to these important and often lifesaving trials that \nwill advance medical research and work towards improving their health.\n  The Senate has taken the important step to pass this legislation, and \nI encourage my colleagues to advance this commonsense, bipartisan \ninitiative and send it to the President's desk for his signature. I \nthank the chairman and all those involved in the House for their work \non this.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ryan as well as Chairman \nUpton and Ranking Member Frank Pallone, who marked up this bill, and \nurge bipartisan approval of it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I also urge our colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support S. 139, the \nEnsuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015. This bill will ensure \ncurrent Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid recipients can \nmaintain those benefits while participating in clinical trials. Keeping \ntheir benefits will help them, but as a doctor I know that their \nparticipation in such trials stands to benefit countless others as well \nwho suffer from rare conditions, both in the U.S. and abroad. We should \nensure that public policy encourages that whenever we can, and that's \nwhat this bill does.\n  Under current law, the Social Security Administration excludes up to \n$2,000 annually in compensation received by individuals participating \nin rare disease clinical trials when determining their SSI and Medicaid \neligibility and benefits. But this provision, put in place by \nbipartisan legislation in 2010, is set to expire on October 5, 2015. \nAfter that date, all payments for participating in such clinical trials \nwould be counted as income for SSI and Medicaid recipients, reducing or \neven ending their eligibility for those benefits.\n  A number of people with rare diseases like Cystic Fibrosis receive \nSSI benefits. If this policy is not made permanent, an individual \nparticipating in a clinical trial for a new treatment for Cystic \nFibrosis could see a reduction or even the complete elimination of \nthose important benefits.\n  The reality is, most simply won't take that risk, and will avoid \nparticipating in such trials. As GAO found in a 2014 report, ``some \nstakeholders noted that compensation decreased participation in \nclinical trials in the past because individuals were concerned about \nits impact on their SSI eligibility and benefits.'' On the other hand, \n``financial incentives to participate in clinical trials have generally \nbeen found to encourage participation in trials. This is likely because \nof the time, inconvenience, and expense that may be involved.''\n  Ultimately, not continuing this policy could actually prevent \nclinical trials from occurring, since it would restrict the already \nsmall number of people able to participate in the trial in the first \nplace.\n  That's why the passage of S. 139 is so important, as it will remove \nthe sunset date for current law--October 5, 2015. Failing to do so \nwould force individuals to once again choose between maintaining their \ncurrent health and disability benefits and the chance to participate in \na clinical trial that could improve or even cure their condition, as \nwell as help others like them in the future.\n  This bill is simple and consistent with current SSI program \nexemptions. S. 139 strikes the October 5, 2015 sunset date on current \npolicy, permitting SSI and Medicaid recipients with rare diseases to \nparticipate in such trials that help to advance research into finding \ncures. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that S. 139 will \nresult in insignificant costs to the Federal government over the next \n10 years, meaning no offset for this legislation is required.\n  But its true value to people with rare diseases--and those who in the \nfuture might benefit by their participation in clinical trials \npermitted under this legislation--could be enormous. Let's pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by\n\n[[Page H6279]]\n\nthe gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 139.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6279-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6279-H6281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1630\n                 HIGHER EDUCATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan.

Pursuant to the \nrule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Pocan) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 3594.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume, and rise in support of the Higher Education Extension Act \nof 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week, several provisions of the Higher Education \nExtension Act are set to expire, including the Perkins Loan Program.\n  For several decades, the Perkins Loan Program has provided low-\ninterest-rate loans to college students with severe financial need. If \nwe allow this program to expire, it would be at a time when our \nNation's higher education system is failing many students trying to \nearn a college degree and a lifetime of opportunity and success.\n  College costs continue to soar, new rules and regulations discourage \ninnovation and deny access, and students are struggling to complete \ntheir education, not to mention find good-paying jobs.\n  This is a very bleak reality facing students from my home State of \nMichigan and across the country. The American people deserve better. \nStudents and families in my district and across the country deserve \nbetter, and my three children, who will one day in the not-so-distant \nfuture begin their college careers, deserve better. The reauthorization \nof the Higher Education Extension Act presents Congress an opportunity \nto strengthen higher education for students, families, and taxpayers.\n  My colleagues and I have already proposed a number of responsible \nreforms that promise to promote innovation, strengthen transparency, \nand help students complete their education. Members are also working to \nstreamline the confusing maze of financial programs so that students \ncan get the support they need.\n  As we continue our efforts to reauthorize the law, now is not the \ntime to turn our backs on the students who rely on the Perkins Loan \nProgram for their college education. Now is the time to help meet the \nimmediate need of students in Michigan and across our country, and the \nHigher Education Extension Act of 2015 will do just exactly that.\n  This bipartisan proposal will extend for 1 year the Perkins Loan \nProgram, allowing participating colleges and universities to continue \nto service their borrowers. It will also allow current Perkins \nrecipients who remain in the same academic program to be eligible to \nreceive those funds through March 2018. The legislation will also \nextend other provisions in the Higher Education Extension Act that aim \nto support students, institutions, and policymakers.\n  Finally, let me note for my colleagues and the American people, by \nreforming the Perkins Loan Program, we ensure that this legislation is \nfully paid for, at no additional cost to taxpayers.\n  I am proud to lead this bipartisan effort with the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Pocan), who shares my commitment to helping other \nstudents achieve their dream of a college education.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Higher \nEducation Extension Act of 2015.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 3594, the Higher Education Extension \nAct, and I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Bishop, as well as my \ncolleagues, Ms. Slaughter, Mr. Messer, and Ranking Member Scott, for \ntheir leadership on this issue.\n  This bill would extend the Perkins Loan Program for 1 year. Perkins \nloans are need-based loans which foster access to higher education for \nlow-income students by providing low-interest loans to students in \nneed. Colleges and universities tailor the program to best fit \nborrowers' and educational institutions' situations.\n  Perkins is a risk-sharing program, with institutions contributing \none-third of their students' awards. This ``ownership interest'' also \ncontributes to the successful management of this vital program.\n  We have only 2 days before the Perkins Loan Program is set to expire, \nso we must act immediately.\n  Since its inception in 1958, over $28 billion in loans have been made \nto students through almost 26 million aid awards. Perkins Loan \nborrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often \nthe first in their family to attend college.\n\n[[Page H6280]]\n\n  Perkins loans have a set interest rate of 5 percent, which begins to \naccrue 9 months after the borrower ceases to be a student. However, \nthis program has not been reauthorized since the 2009 fiscal year.\n  Besides making higher education accessible for lower income students, \nthis program serves as an incentive for people who wish to go into a \npublic service by offering targeted loan cancellations for specific \nprogression in areas of national need, including teaching, nursing, and \nlaw enforcement.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a bipartisan resolution in support of \nthe Perkins loans with Congressman Messer of Indiana, H. Res. 294, with \n56 cosponsors. My colleague Representative Louise Slaughter, a leader \non this issue, offered a letter with more than 90 bipartisan signatures \nin support of this important program. Over 33 groups and higher \neducational institutions have supported this bill's reauthorization.\n  Bottom line, the Perkins Loan Program has helped millions of students \nand families struggling to find a way to pay for college. I applaud my \ncolleague across the aisle, specifically, a thank-you to Mr. Bishop, \nfor helping to ensure students have access to Federal financial aid \nthat they need to make college affordable and accessible.\n\n  I urge support of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nOregon (Ms. Bonamici).\n  Ms. BONAMICI. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Bishop and Congressman Pocan for \nintroducing H.R. 3594, the Higher Education Extension Act.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott \nfor supporting a bipartisan effort to avoid the expiration of the \nFederal Perkins Loan Program, a program that helps make college \naffordable for low-income students across the country.\n  In my district in Oregon, across the State, and across the country, \ncolleges and universities use the Perkins Loan Program to expand access \nto higher education. For example, Linfield College and Pacific \nUniversity, in my district, award Perkins loans to hundreds of \nstudents; and University of Oregon and Oregon State University \ndistribute Perkins loans to thousands, providing a clear benefit to \nstudents who have significant financial need.\n  As Congress works to reauthorize the Higher Education Extension Act, \nit is important that we continue to increase access to affordable \nhigher education.\n  I commend my colleague for introducing the Higher Education Extension \nAct, and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbipartisan bill.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. DeSaulnier).\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for this \nbipartisan effort, and I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I rise today also in support of the Higher Education Extension Act.\n  The Perkins Loan Program provides low-interest loans to economically \ndisadvantaged students to help finance their postsecondary educations.\n  The Perkins Loan Program assisted nearly 540,000 American students \nnationwide in the 2013-2014 academic year by providing $1.2 billion in \nloans. More than 1,500 colleges and universities across the United \nStates participate in this popular program.\n  While the Perkins Loan Program is sometimes viewed as benefiting \nstudents predominately in the Northeast, California is the second \nlargest recipient. In California, more than 46,000 students received \nthese loans last year. These loans resulted in more than $105 million \nin the last year to California students.\n  Students from across the country who attend California schools, like \nSaint Mary's College in my district, are able to receive a top-notch \neducation through assistance programs like the Perkins Loan Program. \nIncreasing access and improving affordability translates to increased \nopportunities for students and improves the Nation's economy by \nensuring that today's students are tomorrow's highly trained workforce.\n  This bill is a necessary step to ensuring that our students continue \nto receive the assistance they need and deserve. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Ms. Slaughter), who has been a leader on this issue.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nam very grateful to Mr. Bishop and to Mr. Messer and Mr. Pocan and all \nothers who worked on this really important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Perkins Loan Program is 57 years old. It is the \nNation's longest running Federal student loan program. It is unlike any \nother Federal student aid program because this critical program is \nspecifically directed at helping low-income students afford the cost of \nhigher education. It helps the deserving students who would not be able \nto afford a college education otherwise, students that save up and work \nhard for every credit that they earn.\n  Without Perkins, 500,000 low-income students across the country, \nnearly 50,000 from the State of New York and over 6,000 in my district \nalone, would not have access to a critical safety net.\n  The Perkins Loan fills the gaps in student aid, and acts as a \nlifeline when unforeseen disruptions jeopardize a student's ability to \npay for college. They offer an affordable alternative to private \nstudent loans and, furthermore, they are self-sustaining, meaning that \nas graduated students pay back their loans, they fund the current \nstudents' loans.\n  This summer, 94 bipartisan colleagues joined me in a letter urging \nChairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott to ensure that the Perkins Loan \nProgram was not allowed to expire, and I am grateful for their help \nhere on this today.\n  I stood with students and the presidents of colleges and universities \nin my district, two of whom have received Perkins loans themselves, to \nvoice support for the continuation of the program. Among the people \nattending were three medical students from the University of Rochester. \nHeaven knows, we cannot afford to lose the services of three medical \nstudents.\n  I was also privileged to stand with my good friend Congressman Pocan \nand to hear from advocates and students who see and experience the \nbenefits of the Perkins loans every day.\n  While I strongly prefer a long-term reauthorization and look forward \nto working with my colleagues in the coming months to secure one, I am \npleased that the Higher Education Extension Act succeeds in keeping the \nprogram alive, ensures that next year's incoming class will be able to \naccess Perkins loans, and buys us some time to secure a lasting \nextension.\n  I urge passage of this bill for all those students whose education \ndreams depend on having the Perkins loans.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to again thank Representative Bishop for all your work on \nthis--thank you very much--and Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott. \nThis is, I think, a good example of how we can work together in a \ncommittee to make sure that higher educational needs are met.\n  I represent about 75,000 higher education students. With UW Madison \nas the flagship, about 45,000 students, we have other campuses for the \nUW system, Beloit College and other smaller private colleges, Madison \nCollege and others.\n  This is a really important program, not just back home in Wisconsin, \nbut across the country; and the fact that we are able to get this done \nin a bipartisan manner shows how I think Congress can work its very \nbest. So I urge my colleagues to support this.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Mr. Pocan as well \nand all those that have come to support the bill.\n\n[[Page H6281]]\n\n  Helping more individuals access and complete higher education is a \ngoal we all share. Research shows that students who earn a degree or \ncredential are more likely to succeed in today's global economy.\n  For example, those with an Associate Degree are expected to earn 27 \npercent more than those with a high school diploma over the course of a \nlifetime, underscoring the value of higher education.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Unfortunately, less than 60 percent of students complete their \nstudies within 6 years often because they can't afford to. Failure to \npass the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015 will only make it more \ndifficult for some students to access and complete their education.\n  Students across the country--including in my home State of Michigan--\ncount on the Perkins Loan Program to help afford a college education. \nBy supporting this responsible bipartisan legislation, we will deliver \ncertainty to students and institutions as we continue to work on the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3594.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, as we pass the Higher Education Extension \nAct of 2015, I would like to emphasize the importance of higher \neducation in assisting our young people in building the knowledge and \nskills that will allow them to succeed in the workforce and, \nultimately, help U.S. businesses and industry to compete in the global \nmarket.\n  Michigan is home to many outstanding colleges and universities and I \noften speak with families throughout the 14th District and the state \nabout the financial burden created by the increasing cost of higher \neducation. Like many Americans, I firmly believe that making higher \neducation more affordable and accessible should be among our foremost \npriorities. During a recent trip to my District, I spoke with a student \nwho held a full-time job while in school because her family could not \nafford her tuition. Although work can be extremely rewarding and helps \nto build a strong work-ethic, students who are forced to work long \nhours and attend school full-time often suffer diminished academic \nsuccess.\n  Since 1986, the Federal Perkins Loan Program has been an essential \npart of college financial aid packages because it provides a long-term \nand low-interest alternative to expensive private loans for students. \nExtending the Perkins Loan Program will provide lower income students \nwith the funding they need to attend college with their full focus on \ntheir education. Additionally, the cost of this extension is not borne \nby taxpayers. Rather, the Perkins Loan Program fully funds itself when \npast loan recipients pay-off the balance of their loan.\n  I am proud that our Chamber has taken this important step toward \nensuring all young people have the opportunity to benefit from a world \nclass education. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for supporting the fight to make higher education affordable and \naccessible for all Americans.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which \nwould extend the Perkins Loan program for one year, so that students \nwho have demonstrated exceptional financial need can complete their \nundergraduate or graduate education in order to become academically \nqualified to join our workforce.\n  Historically, Perkins loans have served our students well by offering \nlow-cost loans with flexible repayment terms and generous forgiveness \noptions. They are often the difference between whether or not our \nstudents can afford to attend college, including 12,000 students in \nTexas.\n  For the academic year 2013-2014, nearly 500,000 students who needed \nfinancial assistance were awarded nearly $1 billion in Perkins loans. \nAnd throughout its 57-year history, more than 30 million students with \nneed have benefited from this program.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the federal \ngovernment will reclaim nearly $5 billion in revenue from Perkins loans \nover the next ten years. That is $5 billion that should be returned to \nstudents to help keep college affordable for the most financially \nchallenged students. And that is $5 billion that would have been lost \nif the program is not extended.\n  Without Perkins loans, schools would lose the necessary flexibility \nto help students cover their expenses after federal grants and Stafford \nloans are applied or unforeseen circumstances jeopardize a student's \nability to pay for college.\n  If we want the United States of America to remain a global leader \nwith the competitive edge necessary to sustain economic growth and job \ncreation, we need the best, most highly trained workforce to sustain \nour advantages. The Perkins Loan program is a major part of helping our \nstudents develop, reach for and join that workforce.\n  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to extend the federal Perkins Loan program.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3594.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6281-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6281-H6284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AMERICAN SAMOA MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE POSTPONEMENT\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and \npass the bill (H.R. 2617) to amend the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 to \npostpone a scheduled increase in the minimum wage applicable to \nAmerican Samoa, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2617\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MINIMUM WAGE FOR AMERICAN SAMOA.\n\n       (a) Minimum Wage.--Paragraph (2) of section 8103(b) of the \n     Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 (29 U.S.C. 206 note) is amended \n     to read as follows:\n       ``(2) the minimum wage applicable to American Samoa under \n     section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) shall be--\n       ``(A) the applicable wage rate in effect for each industry \n     and classification as of September 29, 2015; and\n       ``(B) increased by $0.50 an hour (or such lesser amount as \n     may be necessary to equal the minimum wage under section \n     6(a)(1) of such Act), beginning on December 31, 2016, and on \n     December 31 of every third year thereafter, until the minimum \n     wage applicable to American Samoa under this paragraph is \n     equal to the minimum wage set forth in such section.''.\n       (b) GAO Reports.--Section 8104 of the Fair Minimum Wage Act \n     of 2007 (29 U.S.C. 206 note) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by striking ``September 1, 2011'' and inserting ``April \n     1, 2017''; and\n       (B) by striking the second sentence and inserting the \n     following: ``The Government Accountability Office shall \n     submit a subsequent report not later than April 1, 2020.'';\n       (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``the study under \n     subsection (a)'' and inserting ``any report under subsection \n     (a)''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Report on Alternative Methods of Increasing the \n     Minimum Wage in American Samoa.--Not later than 1 year after \n     the date of enactment of this subsection, the Government \n     Accountability Office shall transmit to Congress a report on \n     alternative ways of increasing the minimum wage in American \n     Samoa to keep pace with the cost of living in American Samoa \n     and to eventually equal the minimum wage set forth in section \n     6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n     206(a)(1)).''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from the Northern Mariana \nIslands (Mr. Sablan) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 2617.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2617. This legislation is simple and \nstraightforward. It would delay for 15 months a minimum wage increase \nthat will take effect in American Samoa in just 2 days. If this \nincrease takes effect, it will harm the very people it was intended to \nhelp, the hard-working men and women of American Samoa.\n  The reason we are here today is also quite simple. We are here \nbecause the local government in American Samoa is urging us to do this. \nWe are here because the employers in American Samoa, who are few and \nfar between, are urging us to do this. And, most importantly, we are \nhere because the\n\n[[Page H6282]]\n\nworkers in American Samoa are urging us to do this.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Those are the facts that have \nbeen reported by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. For \nyears, the territory has been plagued by a weak economy, fewer jobs, \nand higher inflation.\n  The tuna canning industry, an essential part of the American Samoa \neconomy, has been hit especially hard. According to our own independent \ngovernment watchdog, previous wage increases have forced employers to \ndelay expansion, limit overtime, and cut labor costs, which means that \nthey have ultimately had to lay off workers. Many fear these tough \nchallenges will only get worse if we fail to act now.\n  It should be noted that this isn't the first time we have had to take \nthis step. When our Democratic colleagues were in control a few years \nback, they passed legislation delaying the arbitrary wage increase they \nset in motion. That effort passed with strong bipartisan support, and I \nexpect today's legislation will as well.\n  I also want to note that the legislation will help us end a dangerous \npattern of uncertainty and last-minute delays. Under the bill, the \nGovernment Accountability Office is required to report on alternatives \nto setting the minimum wage in American Samoa.\n  No doubt there are a number of alternatives Congress could consider. \nFor example, local leaders have proposed bestowing upon them the \nresponsibility for setting wages in their local communities. While this \nis certainly an interesting idea, it is a debate for another day.\n  Today let's do the right thing by passing this important legislation.\n  In closing, I wish to thank my colleague from American Samoa, \nDelegate Amata Radewagen, for authoring this legislative proposal and \nfor her tireless leadership on behalf of her constituents.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to stand with the people of American \nSamoa and support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, reducing the income inequality between the people I \nrepresent in the Northern Mariana Islands and Americans in the rest of \nour Nation is one of my key goals as a Member of Congress.\n  Household median income in the Marianas was just $20,000 in the last \ncensus compared to $53,000 nationwide. For that reason, I have always \nsupported the decision made in the 110th Congress to raise the minimum \nwage in the Marianas to the U.S. level in a series of graduated steps.\n  When that decision was enacted in Public Law 110-28, the locally set \nminimum wage in the Mariana Islands was just $3.05 per hour and the \nminimum wage had been stuck at that level since the 1990s. Today the \nminimum wage has effectively doubled to $6.05 and will increase to \n$6.55 a year from now.\n  That doubling of the minimum wage has occurred during a period of \neconomic difficulty for the Mariana Islands. Gross domestic product was \ndropping by 8 percent, 12 percent, 19 percent in the first 3 years of \nminimum wage increase.\n  I should say, however, that these drops had nothing to do with the \nwage and everything to do with the loss of manufacturing because of the \nGeneral Agreement of Tariffs and Trade and because of a loss of \ntourism.\n  In the most recent year for which GDP data is available for our \nislands, we had economic growth of 4.4 percent, even as the minimum \nwage continued to rise.\n  The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis says that this economic growth \nreflects a growth in tourism, especially an increase in tourism from \nChina. But it also reflects a growth in consumption because workers who \nare paid more can spend more, and that is good for the economy.\n  So I look forward to next year's increase of another 50 cents in the \nminimum wage in the Mariana Islands. I look forward to reaching the \nnational minimum wage in 2019, and I support legislation raising the \nnational minimum wage because I have now seen in my district that \nincreasing wages can have a positive impact on economic activity and \nimprove people's lives.\n  At the same time, I recognize that there is such a thing as economic \nreality. Raising the minimum wage too quickly could have a detrimental \neffect, could cause employment to shrink. For that reason, over the \nlast 7 years that I have been in Congress, I worked with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle to tailor the minimum wage increases to the \nspecific economic realities in my district.\n  Instead of raising it by 50 cents every year, as the original law \nrequired, we skipped the increases in 2011, 2013, and this year, 2015. \nWe arrived at the decision to stretch out the time of the increases by \nlistening to employers on the island and to workers because workers \nalso understand that increasing wages too quickly could jeopardize \ntheir jobs. We also listened carefully to the Government Accountability \nOffice experts who look at the effect of these minimum wage increases \nperiodically and report back to Congress.\n  I think that, so far, as least, we have successfully walked the fine \nline. We have kept the minimum wage increasing--faster than prices, GAO \ntells us--without disrupting the economy.\n  I am very grateful to both Democrats here in Congress, who agreed to \nslow down the increases, and to Republicans, who agreed to let the \nminimum wage keep going up. They did so, I think, because of a \nrecognition that a relatively isolated island economy might need \nspecial consideration and because, when it comes to a decision that \nonly affects a Member's own district, there is a tradition of deference \nhere in Congress to the views of that Member.\n  This is a very long way around to saying that I support H.R. 2617, \nthe bill now under consideration.\n  The gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen) has made the \ndetermination that what is best for her constituents is to delay \nfurther increases in the minimum wage. She too represents a relatively \nisolated island economy. Her constituents too have incomes much below \nthe U.S. average. The specific economic factors in American Samoa are \nnot the same as in the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\n  So while a delay for American Samoa may be appropriate, I would not \nwant to imply a further delay for the Northern Marianas is called for \nat this time. But I do think that the same courtesy that the House has \nprovided to me, when it comes to making a judgment about the well-being \nof the people I represent, should be given to the Delegate from \nAmerican Samoa with respect to her own district.\n  For that reason, I urge Members to support passage of H.R. 2617.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen).\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to \nserve the people of American Samoa in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. My home district of American Samoa, an isolated group \nof islands, is 6 hours by plane south of Hawaii.\n  Sometimes we jokingly refer to our three main exports as canned tuna, \nmilitary personnel, and NFL players.\n  Today I would like to talk about the canned tuna, though. Due to an \noversight, the Fair Minimum Wage Act, which became law in 2007, \ncontained language that stipulated that American Samoa must raise its \nminimum wage by 50 cents every 3 years starting in 2009 until it meets \nthe Federal standard.\n  Since that time, Congress has graciously granted two waivers to \nAmerican Samoa which prevents them from having to institute the \nincrease, and wisely so. Had Congress not granted the waivers, the \neffects would have been absolutely devastating to our local economy, of \nwhich the tuna canneries comprise 80 percent.\n  When the Fair Minimum Wage Act was passed in 2007, American Samoa had \ntwo canneries on the island. As a direct result of the law and concern \nwith future wage increases, in 2009, the day after a deadly tsunami \nstruck our island, the cannery operated by Chicken of the Sea relocated \nto Thailand, causing thousands to instantly lose their jobs and \nhundreds shortly followed.\n  In Thailand, Chicken of the Sea now pays their workers a mere $1.25 \nan hour and are rumored to be cutting wages further in 2016, while the \nworkers in\n\n[[Page H6283]]\n\nAmerican Samoa are paid $4.76 an hour. While $4.76 may not seem like a \nlarge amount here in the States, one must realize that, in American \nSamoa, the cost of living is drastically different.\n  Due to how the lands are owned and managed in American Samoa, there \nis actually no such thing as rent or a mortgage, items that often \ncomprise up to one-half of a person's monthly expenses. Because our \npeople do not have an expense for housing, $4.76 an hour goes much \nfurther than it would here in the States.\n  While well-intended, the Fair Minimum Wage Act has placed the \neconomic well-being of American Samoa in great jeopardy. No one would \nlike to see the people of American Samoa prosper and have their wages \nincreased more than I.\n  However, this is neither the time nor mechanism for such a drastic \nincrease, as it would surely be the proverbial nail in the coffin for \nthe local economy, as the two canneries that are currently operating \nout of American Samoa have stated the strong possibility of having to \nleave our island because they simply would not be able to compete \nfinancially against their foreign competitors. One of these canneries \njust opened this year and is trying to establish a toehold in the \nregion. Without the extension, this will be very difficult for them.\n  Currently, due to many factors, the long-term continuity of the Pago \nPago-based canneries is now threatened by reduced tuna deliveries and \nsupply, which will negatively affect cannery production, impact cannery \nemployment and support services, and could possibly destroy American \nSamoa's economy altogether.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Past decisions by the United States Government have led to the \ncurrent dire situation.\n  In 2005, the U.S. Government agreed to reduce fishing opportunities \nby U.S. purse seine vessels on the high seas and within the U.S. EEZ. \nAt the same time, the U.S. purse seine fleet contracted from 49 vessels \nin 1994 to 11 in 2007.\n  This major shift in the management of the purse seine fishery should \nhave been recognized by the United States Government as significant in \nterms of fleet operations and the impact it would have on American \nSamoa. Unfortunately, it seems that the territory was not considered.\n  That same year, the U.S. allowed Taiwanese-built vessels to become \nU.S. flagged, thereby receiving the same benefits afforded under the \nSouth Pacific Tuna Treaty. These new vessels fish farther away from \nAmerican Samoa and predominantly offload their catch in Thailand.\n  In 2013, the U.S. Government agreed to pay a combined amount, from \nboth government and industry, of approximately $90 million, while \nagreeing to further reduce the United States fishing effort on the high \nseas.\n  After that, in 2014, the United States agreed to an inexcusable deal, \nto the detriment of American Samoa, reducing the amount of fishing days \navailable in Kiribati waters to the United States fleet from 4,313 to \njust 300 days in just 1 year. Kiribati waters are typically the most \nproductive purse seine fishing grounds in close proximity to Pago Pago. \nHowever, the American Samoa-based purse seine vessels are now forced to \ntravel great distances, making Pago Pago canneries less desirable and \nincreasing transshipping to foreign ports.\n  In addition, the expansion of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine \nNational Monument and the high seas effort limit have further reduce \nthe fishing grounds available to the American Samoa-based purse seine \nfleet, lending to the dire situation facing American Samoa's local \ncanneries. These are waters that have been fished by our people for \nmany centuries.\n  Like other small island developing states and territories in the \nPacific, American Samoa and the fishing industry it supports should be \nafforded special recognition, not crushed by the worst aspects of \ncapitalism--and I say this as a devout capitalist.\n  Until we begin to safeguard our fishery interests in the region, \nAmerican Samoa's tuna fisheries will continue to wither, creating \neconomic ruin in American Samoa, the other Pacific territories, and \neven Hawaii, leaving the United States as a passive observer in the \nworld's largest tuna fishery, leaving other nations such as China to \nrun roughshod over fisheries to the detriment of not only the people, \nbut the environment as well.\n  We must reverse some of the missteps the United States has taken over \nthe years which have left the American Samoa economy in this highly \nvulnerable position. The closing off of large swaths of ocean, under \nthe guise of national monuments, which cover thousands of square miles \nof traditional fishing grounds that our people have used for centuries, \nto the reduction in allotted fishing days that have gone from over \n4,000 to under 500 in just 1 year, this is certainly not the time to \nput further pressure on an industry that is seemingly under attack from \nall sides, a local industry that operates at a loss in comparison to \nits competitors when it comes to labor, due to their longstanding \nrelationship with the people of American Samoa, for which we are very \ngrateful.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have heard some concern about Congress continuing to \nkick the can down the road on this issue. To those, I extend willing \nand eager hands for cooperation and assistance in fixing the mechanism \nby which the wages are set in American Samoa. The playing fields \nbetween the United States and American Samoa are too drastically \ndifferent to place on the same wage scale, and to keep American Samoa \ntied to the current standard is dangerous and irresponsible. It is my \nplan to use the time granted in the extension to work on a new \nmechanism for setting the minimum wage rate in American Samoa, and I \nhappily encourage fellow Members to join me in this mission.\n  If there is ever any bill that I introduce that I wish I could vote \nagainst, this would be it. However, while it is difficult, I also know \nthat it must be done. Oftentimes, the things that are the most \ndifficult are also the most important, and currently, there is no issue \nmore important to the economic well-being of American Samoa than this.\n  I respectfully and wholeheartedly ask my colleagues in both the House \nand Senate to support this legislation that is so absolutely critical \nto the economic stability of American Samoa.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Without it, Mr. Speaker, I am afraid we will be back \nhere in just a few months trying to figure out a way to subsidize what \nis already the most economically challenged territory or State in our \nNation.\n  The tuna canning industry is all we have. There is no Coca-Cola or \nIBM. We have no Silicon Valley there to provide massive revenue and \nemployment opportunity to the territory. There aren't numerous military \nand government facilities that provide sources of economic growth. We \nare not surrounded by fellow States that enable us to expand to other \nmarkets. All we have is the tuna industry, and we are grateful for \nthem.\n  So again, I graciously ask my fellow colleagues to support this \nunfortunate, yet essential, piece of legislation. If you cannot support \nit, all I ask is that you do not block it, because it would be \nabsolutely devastating to our people.\n  I want to thank Chairman Kline, Ranking Member Scott, and the \ncommittee staff for their assistance in getting this measure to the \nfloor, as well as the numerous other staff and Members who put in many \nhours of hard work to get us here today.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I do urge my \ncolleagues to please support H.R. 2617.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I noted earlier, this effort is supported by local \nleaders in American Samoa. It is supported by employers in American \nSamoa, and, most importantly, it is supported by the working men and \nwomen of American Samoa.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2786, the Cross-Border \nRail Security Act of 2015.\n  First, I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela), the \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, for \nintroducing this thoughtful bill and working in a collaborative manner \nas this legislation moved through the committee process.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation requires the Commissioner of Customs \nand Border Protection to submit a report to Congress that outlines how \nand when high-risk rail shipments entering the United States are \nscanned for potential risks.\n  The impetus for this legislation was a recent inspector general \nreport that found CBP was inadequately targeting high-risk rail \nshipments arriving in the U.S. from Canada and Mexico. This bill will \nhelp Congress better understand the frequency and location of such \nhigh-risk shipments and detail the current state of radiation detection \nequipment on our international railways.\n  Mr. Speaker, as many of my colleagues who also live along the border \nknow, each year approximately 2.7 million containers enter the United \nStates by rail. While most of the commodities transferred by rail do \nnot pose significant homeland security threats, we must ensure that we \nare properly identifying and targeting those shipments which are high \nrisk and conduct physical scanning when necessary.\n  To ensure proper oversight, it is very important to understand the \ncapabilities of CBP, including the number, location, and type of \ndetection equipment used at each cross-border rail crossing. We also \nneed to understand what additional equipment and training is necessary \nto ensure our rail cargo system is secure.\n  As we know, proper training is an important force multiplier which \nwill help maximize effectiveness of our Customs and Border Protection \nOfficers, reducing wait times and increasing security.\n  Finally, H.R. 2786 requires the Government Accountability Office to \nperform a series of audits over CBP's targeting of cross-border rail \nshipments.\n  Mr. Speaker, rail cargo is expected to increase over the next 10 \nyears. This bill will ensure CBP adequately addresses this \nvulnerability and implements proper standards of screening and \ntargeting for rail cargo. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2786.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2786, the Cross-Border \nRail Security Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, in March of this year, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's inspector general released a report on high-risk cross-\nborder rail cargo. The report concluded that U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection, or CBP, did not always use the required radiation detection \nequipment to examine shipments it determined to be high risk. \nAdditionally, some ports of entry lacked the appropriate equipment to \nconduct these screenings, and training and oversight of targeting and \nexamining such shipments was lacking.\n  In response to these troubling findings, my bill would require the \nCBP Commissioner to submit to the relevant congressional committees \nwithin 180 days of enactment a report regarding high-risk cross-border \nrail cargo shipments entering the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, my bill would require the report to include information \non the number of high-risk shipments crossing the border by rail, \ndetails on the radiation detection units at rail crossings, an \nassessment of whether additional equipment is necessary, and a plan for \nensuring that all relevant CBP personnel receive appropriate training \nto appropriately target, examine, and record the disposition of such \nshipments. The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to \naudit periodically CBP operations at rail crossings to ensure rail \nshipments are being appropriately targeted, examined, and documented.\n  The community I represent has a vested interest in securing cross-\nborder rail cargo. This past August, I was proud to be a part of the \nopening of the West Rail Bypass International Bridge located in \nBrownsville, Texas, the first international new rail crossing between \nthe U.S. and Mexico in over a century.\n  Both of our land borders are dotted with these crossings, and, in \nfact, the majority of them are located on the northern border. The \ncargo that crosses by rail is destined for locations all over the \nUnited States, making the effective targeting and examining of high-\nrisk shipments a national concern.\n  Mr. Speaker, my committee colleagues unanimously supported this bill, \nand I urge all of my colleagues to help strengthen the cross-border \nrail security by supporting H.R. 2786.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2786.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 2786, the ``Cross-Border \nRail Security Act of 2015,'' which directs U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection (CBP) to report to Congress on its inspection of high-risk \nshipments entering the United States by rail.\n\n[[Page H6285]]\n\n  Specifically, H.R. 2786 requires the CBP to report on the following \nmatters related to homeland security:\n  the number of high-risk rail shipments annually entering the country;\n  the status of radiation detection units at each border rail crossing; \nand\n  an assessment of whether additional radiation detection equipment is \nnecessary.\n  The bill also requires CBP to develop a plan for ensuring that all \nrelevant CBP personnel receive adequate training and guidance on the \nproper use of CBP's Automated Targeting System for such shipments, and \nin the use of appropriate radiation detection equipment for shipment \nexamination, and requirements for recording examination results.\n  H.R. 2786 bill also requires the General Accountability Office to \nperiodically audit CBP operations at rail crossings on borders to \nensure rail shipments are targeted, examined, and the examination \nresults are well documented.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is good for our nation and for my \ncongressional district, which is centered in Houston, Texas.\n  Houston has been the hub of railroad hub of Texas since the 1880s and \nis known as the place ``where 17 railroads meet the sea.''\n  It is also the ``the energy capital of the world.''\n  Freight from the Houston area goes by railroad to destinations all \nover the United States, including Los Angeles, Long Beach, New York \nCity, Charleston, and Savannah.\n  Over 1 billion tons of freight travels through Houston area each \nyear; no other state comes close to the level of trade the metropolitan \nHouston region experiences.\n  One billion tons of freight leaves the Houston area each year, nearly \ntwo/ thirds of which (645 million tons) involve goods come from foreign \nsources.\n  The top foreign freight origination point for the City of Houston is \nMexico.\n  Mexico supplies over 50% of all international freight in the Houston \narea.\n  Europe and Canada are Houston's second largest foreign freight \ntrading partners, accounting for over 27% of international freight in \nthe Houston area.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting H.R. 2786 \nbecause the safety of rail transit is critical to the security of the \nhomeland and strength of our economy.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2786.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for \nVeterans\n\n[[Page H6286]]\n\nAct of 2015. This bill, which I introduced in June, seeks to increase \nthe hiring of military veterans for Customs and Border Protection \nofficer positions vital to our security here at home.\n  The Border Jobs for Veterans Act addresses two critical priorities: \nensuring full staffing at our ports of entry and helping separating \nservicemembers transition to civilian life.\n  My district includes over 80 miles of the U.S. border as well as \nseveral ports of entry. I visited our ports in Nogales and Douglas \nnumerous times to hear about their operations firsthand and have seen \nthe critical law enforcement duties carried out by CBP officers at \nthese ports, such as screening visitors, returning U.S. citizens, and \ncargo entering the United States.\n  In June, the Port Authority chair for the Mariposa port of entry in \nNogales, just outside my district, reported that, while staffing \nnumbers have grown nationally, ``staffing numbers at Nogales and the \nTucson Sector have remained essentially stagnant in recent memory while \ndemand continues to grow.''\n  The port also estimates that CBP's Tucson field office is currently \noperating at a 20-percent staffing deficit. While new hires have \noccurred since then, CBP estimates the Tucson field office still needs \nto fill roughly 200 officer positions.\n  In my conversations with CBP officers, they have repeatedly told me \nthat inadequate staffing levels hamper their ability to do their jobs. \nThey cite problems with recruiting and retention of new officers as \nwell as lengthy and cumbersome hiring process, including delays due to \nbacklogs of the necessary background checks. After a recent reduction \nin that process by roughly 50 percent, it still takes 180 days to hire \na new officer at ports where there is a strong need now.\n  These hurdles to hiring acts as an impediment to cross-border trade \nthat powers both Arizona and the Nation's economy. According to the \nArizona-Mexico Commission, more than 41.6 billion dollars' worth of \ntrade flows through Arizona's ports of entry, $16 billion of which is \nattributed to bilateral trade with Mexico.\n  But inadequate staffing at these ports of entry slows the flow of \ntrade coming across the border, costing businesses millions of dollars, \nand ultimately hurts our attractiveness as a transportation and trade \nhub, something we simply cannot afford.\n  Each year approximately 250,000 to 300,000 members of the Armed \nForces separate from military service. I recently visited the Veterans \nOne-Stop Center in Pima County in my district, which helps veterans \nfind employment after they leave the military, and I listened to their \nchallenges and their stories firsthand.\n  Who better to address this shortfall and help to secure our ports \nthan the highly trained patriotic Americans who just recently separated \nfrom the Armed Forces?\n  That is why H.R. 2835 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nwork with the Department of Defense to enhance our efforts to recruit \nmembers of the military who are separating to serve as Customs and \nBorder Protection officers.\n  These efforts must include participation in relevant job fairs, \ntransition programs, partnerships between CBP field offices and local \nmilitary bases, and the identification of ways to streamline the \ntransfer of background checks and security clearances.\n  This bill offers the men and women of our military another \nopportunity to serve the Nation. All DHS has to do is make sure that \nthey are aware of the opportunities available at our Nation's 329 ports \nof entry.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Flake, McCain, Johnson, and \nSchumer, and their staffs for working on the Senate companion \nlegislation and their help on the text of this bill.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Thornberry and his staff for working \nwith us to move this bill forward.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting the Border Jobs for \nVeterans Act of 2015.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                      Committee on Armed Services,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2015.\n     Hon.

I appreciate your support in bringing this \n     legislation before the House of Representatives, and \n     accordingly, understand that the House Armed Services \n     Committee will forego action on the bill.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual \n     understanding that the language in the bill reflects the \n     negotiations between our staffs and that by foregoing \n     consideration of this bill at this time, the House Armed \n     Services Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation \n     in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill \n     be necessary, I would support your request to have the House \n     Armed Services Committee represented on the conference \n     committee.\n       I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional \n     Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. \n     I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T. McCaul,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for Veterans \nAct of 2015.\n  First of all, I would like to thank my colleague, Congresswoman \nMcSally, for introducing this wonderful piece of legislation. It not \nonly helps us expedite the flow of traffic in trade at our borders, but \nit also helps and assists with our veterans we all represent.\n  H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015, would require \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to consider expediting the hiring of \nqualified veterans to serve as U.S. Customs and Border Protection \nofficers.\n  The bill also authorizes DHS to enhance its efforts to recruit \nmembers of the Armed Forces who are separating from military service to \nserve as CBP officers and requires DHS to report to Congress on its \nefforts.\n  Through their service, our Nation's veterans have demonstrated their \nunwavering commitment to our country and its security. CBP would \nbenefit greatly from their service within the agency's ranks.\n  At the same time, expediting the hiring of qualified veterans could \nhelp alleviate the continued shortage of CBP officers at our ports of \nentry, helping to better secure our borders while facilitating \nlegitimate trade and travel.\n  With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. \n2835, to facilitate the recruitment and hiring of America's military \nveterans for new careers serving our country as U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection officers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2835.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border \nand Maritime Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2835, ``Border \nJobs for Veterans Act of 2015.'' which would guarantee more jobs for \nour many deserving veterans.\n  This bill requires the Homeland Security Department to prioritize the \nhiring of U.S. veterans as Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officers.\n\n[[Page H6287]]\n\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate for \nour veterans is 7.2%, which is roughly 573,000 unemployed veterans \nnationally.\n  A study commissioned by the Department of Commerce's International \nTrade Administration found that in 2008, delays at POEs at the U.S.-\nMexico border cost the U.S. economy 26,000 jobs, $600 million in lost \ntax revenue, and $5.8 billion in lost economic output.\n  According to CBP, 2,000 additional CBPOs will lead to the creation of \napproximately 66,000 new jobs and increase the Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP) of the U.S. by up to $4 billion.\n  The bill will ensure that:\n  CBP officials will be at recruiting events and jobs fairs for armed \nservice members;\n  Partnerships are fostered between military bases in regions where CBP \nOfficers work;\n  Opportunities for the expedited hiring of certain service members \nwith qualifications needed by CBP are prioritized; and\n  Transfers of relevant background investigations and security \nclearances are streamlined to facilitate transitions from military life \nto employment at the CBP.\n  Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 76, the ``Helping to Encourage Real \nOpportunity for Veterans Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace \nAct of 2015,'' the HEROS Act, which is very similar to spirit to the \nbill before the House.\n  Studies have shown that more than 80% of veterans transitioning from \nmilitary service to the civilian sector regard employer-provided \nVeterans support programs as ``critical'' or ``important'' to their \nsuccess.\n  The ``HERO Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act of 2014'' \naddressed these problems by providing strong incentives for employers \nto hire, retain, and employ veterans in positions that take maximum \nadvantage of their skills and experience.\n  Nearly 90% of veterans believe they have the general skills needed to \nland their ideal job such as problem solving, leadership, ethics, and \ntime management and most believe they possess specific marketable \nskills, such as information technology, health care, mechanical, and \naviation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2835, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Ms. McSally. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6287-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6287-H6290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MANDATORY PRICE REPORTING ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CONAWAY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2051, the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act \nof 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, on June 9, the House passed three individual bills: the \nMandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015; the United States Grain \nStandards Reauthorization Act of 2015; and the National Forest \nFoundation Reauthorization Act of 2015. For each of these, the \nCommittee on Agriculture held hearings and business meetings, and the \nHouse acted in a timely manner to ensure the continuation of these \ncritical programs.\n  I am proud of the fact that the House worked its will in a bipartisan \nmanner following regular order throughout. Just last week the other \nbody worked its will, combining these three bills into a single bill \nbefore us.\n  Though modifications were made that I do not agree with, it is \nimperative that the House pass this legislation in advance of the \nauthority for price reporting and grain inspection expiring on \nWednesday evening. Failure to enact this legislation today will have \ndevastating impacts on our Nation's meat industries and grain \nexporters.\n  I urge the House to adopt this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2051, a bill to \nreauthorize the Mandatory Price Reporting Act, the United States Grain \nStandards Act, and the National Forest Foundation Act. Legislative \nlanguage to reauthorize each of these was introduced, reported by the \nHouse Agriculture Committee, and passed by the House on voice vote as \nstandalone measures on June 10th of this year. The first two, the \nMandatory Price Reporting Act and the Grain Standards Act authorities \nare set to expire in just a few days.\n  As passed by the House, each of these measures enjoyed wide \nbipartisan support from Members as well as support from each of the \nimpacted industries. Unfortunately, after passing through the other \nchamber, we are left with bill language that is somewhat less than \nideal, but at least maintains these critical program authorities for 5 \nmore years.\n  In the development of the Mandatory Price Reporting Act and with each \nof its subsequent reauthorizations, we have asked the impacted \nindustries to work together in a cooperative spirit to develop their \nlegislative proposals and submit only those that are unanimously \nsupported. The meat and livestock industries did just that this past \nspring. Those proposals were reviewed in a hearing in the Subcommittee \non Livestock and Foreign Agriculture on April 22nd, bill language was \nintroduced in the House, a business meeting was held, and the House \nunanimously passed the bill. Unfortunately, a demand was made in the \nother body that the bill be modified to remove language of critical \nimportance to our constituents. Thus, we have before us today a bill \nthat is less than what our constituents requested. Yet if we fail to \nact, a program of critical importance to the meat and livestock \nindustries would expire leaving these industries in a quandary. It is a \nshame that politics must interfere with policy on even the simplest \nmeasures, but we must move forward.\n  The United States Grain Standards Act reauthorization faced similar \nchallenges in the other body. As my colleagues will recall, last summer \namid an ongoing labor dispute, the Washington State Department of \nAgriculture (WSDA) discontinued mandatory grain weighing and grading \nservices.\n  In statements issued at the time, WSDA acknowledged that they \nwithheld inspection services because of their belief that the \n``continued provision of inspections services appears to have been \nunhelpful in leading to any foreseeable resolution'' of the labor \ndispute.\n  Instead of fulfilling their statutory obligation, the leadership of \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture politicized this situation when the \nagency declined to fulfill its statutory responsibility to resume \ninspection and weighing services. Services were eventually restored, \nbut not before significant costs accrued to all parties involved.\n  We have worked hard to gain access to overseas markets. We are \nshooting ourselves in the foot when we cannot ship our products to \nthese markets because State and Federal agencies are unable or \nunwilling to comply with their obligations. To not be able to ship our \ngrain because there are no inspectors at a facility does a disservice \nto our farmers, and it harms our economy.\n  To address this situation, the House could have been punitive. In \nfact, there were some in the industry that would have preferred that. \nBut that is not what we were interested in doing. We simply wanted to \ndevelop a safeguard mechanism to avoid this situation being repeated. \nTo do that, we worked with the Washington State delegation, the \nWashington State Department of Agriculture, labor unions, industry and \neven the USDA. What we developed was bipartisan consensus on a workable \nsafeguard provision. Nevertheless, the bill as adopted in the other \nbody provides little safeguard against future abuses of discretion. I \ncannot emphasize this enough--it is imperative that these inspection \nand weighing services are provided in a reliable, uninterrupted, \nconsistent and cost-effective manner. To ensure that we fulfill this \nobligation, we must learn the lessons of history or it is doomed to \nrepeat itself.\n  To this end, the Secretary of Agriculture is instructed to take \nprompt action to provide for restoration of official grain inspection \nservice as soon as he receives notice or otherwise learns about the \nimpending disruption from a delegated State agency. In this regard, as \na way of not allowing the Secretary to sit on his hands after learning \nthat a disruption in official service was imminent, the Secretary is \nrequired to:\n\n[[Page H6290]]\n\n  1. Immediately take such actions as are necessary to address the \ndisruption and resume inspection and weighing services; and\n  2. Not later than 24 hours after receiving notice or otherwise \nlearning of the impending disruption of such inspection or weighing, or \nafter the start of such disruption in official service, whichever is \nearlier, submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry of the Senate a report that describes the disruptions and any \nactions necessary to address the concerns of the Secretary relating to \nthe disruption so that inspections or weighings may resume.\n  On a positive note, another critical element of the House bill was \nretained wherein the Secretary will be obligated to waive official \nweighing and inspection requirements in both cases of emergency as well \nas other circumstances as long as the waiver does not impair the \nunderlying objectives of the statute and the buyers and sellers agree \nand provide documentation of the agreement to the Secretary. This \nwaiver requirement is intended to provide certainty to trading partners \nas well as U.S. suppliers.\n  Since its charter in 1993, the National Forest Foundation provides \nthe ability to leverage private and federal dollars to support our \nNation's great forests in a variety of ways. In recent years, the \nFoundation has leveraged funds at over a 4 to 1 ratio and plans to \ncontinue on this success to raise at least $125 million for forest \nrestoration activities. Simply put, the National Forest Foundation \nworks, and this is a common-sense reauthorization.\n  While I recognize that concessions were made resulting in less than \nideal bill text, at the end of the day, H.R. 2051 provides certainty to \nAmerican agriculture, and I would urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2051. This bipartisan \nlegislation reauthorizes the Mandatory Price Reporting Act, the \nNational Forest Foundation Act, and the U.S. Grain Standards Act. This \nbill continues the tradition of bipartisan, bicameral work done by the \nAgriculture Committees.\n  Important livestock price reporting programs will be continued under \nthe bill's mandatory price reporting provisions. Producers rely on \naccess to transparent, accurate, and timely market information, and \nH.R. 2051 will provide that certainty.\n  The National Forest Foundation Act is the type of public-private \ncollaboration we should all be able to support, giving private groups \nand stakeholders a chance to help in the stewardship and management of \nour national forests and grasslands. H.R. 2051 will ensure that this \npartnership can continue.\n  Finally, the U.S. Grain Standards Reauthorization Act will allow the \nFederal Grain Inspection Service to continue official weighing and \ninspection services. Both grain buyers and sellers rely on a gold \nstandard quality assurance, backed by the Federal Government, when \nconducting business.\n  Again, this is good, commonsense legislation, a bipartisan bill. I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my colleague, my ranking member, \nCollin Peterson. Throughout this work, he and all the Members on both \nsides of the aisle of the committee worked well together. It is a \ntribute to the way bipartisan work ought to be done in the House, and I \nam proud of the work the Agriculture Committee has done.\n  I urge Members to join me in support of this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) that the House suspend the rules and \nconcur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2051.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6290-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

This award, which was created by the American Institute for \nPublic Service, honors ordinary people who do extraordinary things \nwithout expectation of recognition.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that Rick and Diane are more than worthy of \nrecognition for their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6292-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  JEB BUSH SHOULD CONSIDER THE POPE'S CALL TO PRESERVE OUR ENVIRONMENT\n\n  (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have continually reminded us that they are not scientists. We \nhave also heard this from several of the Republican candidates seeking \nour Nation's highest office.\n  As a scientist myself, I appreciate their candor. But what I don't as \nmuch appreciate is when they use this mantra of ``I am not a \nscientist'' to preface statements that are factually wrong. Facts are \nstubborn things, and they don't only apply to those in the scientific \ncommunity.\n  Last week Pope Francis challenged us to take courageous steps to \ncombat climate change, a call to action that made many Republicans \nuncomfortable. When asked about the Pope's statement, Governor Jeb Bush \ndismissed it, saying that Pope Francis is ``not a scientist, he's a \nreligious leader.'' In fact, Pope Francis is a former chemist, and, as \nsuch, he has more scientific training than many of our elected \nofficials.\n  I was hoping that, when the Pope addressed Congress in his remarks, \nhe would have explained to my Republican colleagues the effect of the \ninfrared absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide on the radiation balance \nand equilibrium temperature of the Earth, but time did not permit.\n  I encourage Jeb and my colleagues in Congress to consider the Pope's \ncall to preserve our environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6292-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING OUR FALLEN FIREFIGHTERS\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, our Nation's firefighters sign up for the \njob knowing the dangers they will often face in order to keep their \ncommunities safe. Tragically, we have seen these first responders give \ntheir lives in service to others.\n  This past Sunday the 2015 Minnesota Fallen Firefighter Memorial \nService took place on the State Capitol grounds to honor the 9 \nMinnesota firefighters--and 216 nationwide--that have passed away in \nthe line of duty this year.\n  The event honors the sacrifice that these firefighters have made and \nalso provides support for their families who are coping with a profound \nloss.\n  As policymakers, it is important that we recognize what our first \nresponders go through on a daily basis and support them. Earlier this \nyear Congress passed my legislation, which is now law, that ensures \nthat survivor benefits for families of those killed in the line of duty \nare not taxed.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are blessed that so many men and women sign up to put \nthemselves in harm's way to keep others safe. For those that give their \nlife, we must not forget their sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6292-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of September as \nProstate Cancer Awareness Month and as a proud cosponsor of the \nNational Prostate Cancer Plan Act, H.R. 2730.\n  As the most common cancer in men, prostate cancer is a national \nepidemic. This year alone one in seven men will be diagnosed and 28,000 \nmen will die from prostate cancer.\n  Last week, while hosting a community conversation in my district in \nWhitehall, Ohio, I met with two constituents, Linda and Ray Hoetger, an \ninspiring husband and wife team who tirelessly dedicate themselves to \nraising awareness about prostate cancer.\n  Linda and Ray are members of the national organization ZERO, the End \nof Prostate Cancer, and are spearheading a campaign to raise awareness \nof prostate cancer throughout Ohio.\n  I stand here today to commend their work. As Ray and Linda remind us, \nmany of us have either been personally affected by this disease or have \nlost a loved one.\n  So during this Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, let us reaffirm our \ncommitment to increase the quality of care in order to eliminate the \npain and suffering once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6292-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6292-H6293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING SPEAKER BOEHNER\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise out of respect and admiration \nfor our tremendous Speaker, the incredible leader of our Republican \nConference and my friend, John Boehner.\n  He has stayed true to his home State of Ohio for well over 20 years, \nserving his constituents with pride and integrity. His distinguished \ncareer was marked by an honest pursuit of what is best for the American \npeople as well as the inclusion of more folks under the big tent of our \nGOP.\n  He has worked in a bipartisan manner to help create jobs and restore \nAmerica's leadership, all the while maintaining a hard line on the \nCastros' despotic rule in Cuba, being supportive of our strong \nrelations with Israel, as well as remaining a tough opponent of the \nweak and dangerous Iran nuclear deal.\n  John's decorum, grace, and patience are his hallmarks, and they will \nbe greatly missed in our Nation's Capitol. Only in America can the son \nof a barkeep rise to make a lasting positive contribution to our \nhistory as Speaker of the people's House.\n  I wish John, Debbie, the entire Boehner family, including his new \ngranddaughter Alistair, all the best. Godspeed, Mr. Speaker.\n\n[[Page H6293]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6293-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1915\n                             PUGET SOS ACT\n\n  (Mr. HECK of Washington asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, to explain the significance of \nthe Puget Sound in 1 minute is impossible. But I will tell you this: \nWith every 60 seconds that goes by, the Puget Sound is being damaged \nmore than it is being fixed. With every minute that goes by that we \nfail to collectively do something, we are all losing money.\n  Puget Sound is a resource, but it is more than that. It is an \nAmerican treasure. Puget Sound is a body of water that deserves \nnational recognition.\n  Congressman Kilmer and I have brought together numerous stakeholders \nthat agree on very few things to agree on this: We need to do more. The \nFederal Government needs to step up to the plate to get recovery \nmoving.\n  The Puget SOS Act is that plan. We do it for the Great Lakes. We do \nit for the Chesapeake Bay. Now is the time to bring forth this effort \nfor our Puget Sound, the largest estuary in America. Let's clean the \nPuget Sound up.\n  Join us in cosponsoring this bill, along with Mr. Reichert, Mr. \nNewhouse, Mr. McDermott, Mr. Rick Larsen, Mr. Adam Smith, and Ms. \nDelBene.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember an American hero, \nDr. Sidney Phillips, Jr., who passed away in Mobile over the weekend at \nthe age of 91.\n  Dr. Phillips was a veteran of World War II, where he served in the \nMarine Corps. At the young age of 18, Sid Phillips took part in the \nfamous battle of Guadalcanal in the Pacific.\n  Dr. Phillips was one of the most well-known and respected veterans in \nAlabama. His career was profiled in Ken Burns' PBS documentary ``The \nWar'' and Steven Spielberg's HBO series ``The Pacific.''\n  To many of us from the Mobile area, we remember Sid Phillips as a \nlocal family doctor, a patriotic family man, and a strong advocate for \nour Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all of my constituents in Southwest \nAlabama, I want to share my condolences with Sid Phillips' family and \nfriends. He embodied the American spirit, and he will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6293-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PUGET SOS ACT\n\n  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and cofounder of \nthe Puget Sound Recovery Caucus, Representative Heck, for his \npartnership on the Puget SOS Act.\n  As you heard from him, the Puget Sound is truly a gift that we need \nto restore and protect. Generations have enjoyed the ability to swim, \nfish, and dig for clams in this iconic body of water. They have built \nlives and made livelihoods on the Puget Sound.\n  But for the millions of residents that call Puget Sound home and for \nfuture generations, we absolutely have to take action to fight for the \nSound.\n  That is why I invite my colleagues to sponsor the Puget SOS Act. This \nbill raises the profile of Puget Sound by naming it a nationally \nsignificant body of water. It enhances the Federal Government's \ncoordination in addressing these issues. It respects tribal treaty \nrights. This bill is an important step.\n  I look forward to continued work for Puget Sound. Our kids, including \nmy two little girls, are counting on us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6293-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING TROOPER J.D.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. I am very \nprivileged tonight to lead the Special Order of the Members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus.\n  Let me thank our chairman, Chairman G.K. Butterfield, for continuing \nthis tradition and for his continued leadership, encouragement, and \navocation for Members and for the stories of those who have been such \nleaders in our Nation and such major issues that we have been able to \ncontribute to for the understanding of our colleagues.\n  Let me also make mention of my colleagues, Congresswoman Kelly and \nCongressman Payne, who have led us on this Special Order for the \nCongressional Black Caucus. I thank them for their leadership and \nservice.\n  A very special thanks to those of you who are watching at home and \nhave often watched at home and have followed the Congressional Black \nCaucus through social media, social network, and also know that our \nmajor issues of criminal justice reform, civil rights, the restoration \nof the Voting Rights Act, and many others have been to speak to the \nvulnerable. Tonight we again speak to you, but we speak of those heroes \nthat we have lost over the last couple of months.\n  Tonight we pay tribute to Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou \nStokes, and, of course, Julian Bond. Our Nation was built on the values \nof dealing with the issues of freedom, justice and equality, values and \nprinciples that were perfectly embodied by the service and sacrifices \nof these three leaders.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the last week we have watched the Pope make his way \nthrough a number of American cities and use words that are music to the \nears of Members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me take just one \nof many citations that I will utilize to characterize these three \nindividuals:\n  ``The complexities of history,'' said Pope Francis, ``and the reality \nof human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for all their \nmany differences and limitations, were able, by hard work and self-\nsacrifice, some at the cost of their lives, to build a better future.''\n  I would offer to say that Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou \nStokes, and Julian Bond, through the sacrifice of their individual \nfamilies and their lives, were able to make a better future for us.\n  We know the civil rights activist Amelia Boynton Robinson, 1965, was \na leader of the Bloody Sunday march and personified the optimism, \ndetermination, and courage that are at the heart of the American \nspirit. She truly made our lives better.\n  Known as the matriarch of our Nation's civil rights movement, Ms. \nBoynton Robinson fought courageously to ensure that every American \ncitizen had the right to vote. Her drive to secure universal voting \nrights was amazing, and certainly she risked her life when she crossed \nthe Edmund Pettus Bridge. In her words, her son said civil rights was \nher entire life.\n\n[[Page H6294]]\n\n  We now understand that Congressman Lou Stokes made an amazing and \nimpactful statement legislatively and throughout his life. He was a \nconsummate public servant, a trailblazer who broke down barriers for \ngenerations of African Americans.\n  He was the first African American Congressman from Ohio who served 30 \nyears. Representing a portion of Cleveland, he prioritized the \nadvancement of our Nation's most vulnerable populations.\n  He advocated for more funding of education, housing, development \nprojects, access to health care. He was one of the fiercest advocates \nfor public housing.\n  Mr. Stokes was a major proponent and leader that asked the Housing \nand Urban Development to assess the poor, deleterious, horrible \nconditions that children were living in as housing impacted their \nhealth.\n  In fact, just recently I presented my housing authority a lead \npoisoning grant which was instigated, was encouraged, was advocated for \nby Congressman Lou Stokes. He has saved thousands upon thousands of \nlives.\n  I thank him for organizing the Congressional Black Caucus Health \nBraintrust, and I want to thank him personally for allowing me work for \nhim as a staff member of the Select Committee on Assassinations, which \nhe ultimately chaired. We thank him for his amazing service.\n  He once said, ``I am going to keep on denouncing the inequities of \nthis system, but I am going to work within it. To go outside the system \nwould be to deny myself, to deny my own existence. I have beaten the \nsystem. I have proved it can be done. So have a lot of others.'' This \nis, of course, the kind of leader that Lou Stokes was.\n  Our friend, Julian Bond, was a civil rights icon. He was a leader in \nthe fight for equality, freedom, and equal justice and opportunity. He \ninspired generations of Americans to build a better future for all \npeople.\n  Julian Bond was considered the young one in the movement with Dr. \nMartin Luther King. He stood as not only an original, but a fierce \nadvocate of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the \nfounding president of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n  Elected to office, of course, he himself fought against \ndiscrimination. He was discriminated himself. When he was refused a \nseat in the Georgia State Legislature, it did not in any way demean or \nundermine his courage or inspiration. He went on to be seated and to do \ngreat things.\n  Tonight we are privileged to be able to honor and pay tribute to \nthese three heroes. We are called to follow the example they set, to \nfight to ensure that all Americans have access to equal opportunity so \nthey will have a fair shot at economic prosperity, have the right to \nvote, be free from mass incarceration, and do the things that America \nbestows upon them.\n  Again, these individuals, at the cost of their lives or their own \nfutures, built a better future for us.\n  With that, I am delighted to yield to the chair of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus, Mr. G.K. Butterfield, a former high superior court \njudge--I am calling him all kinds of names--but, in any event, a \ndynamic leader of the Congressional Black Caucus. Again, I yield to the \ngentleman from North Carolina.\n\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson \nLee for her friendship, for her leadership, and I certainly thank her \nfor yielding time tonight.\n  Let me also thank the other Members who are on the floor this evening \nto help in honoring the lives of Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, \nand Julian Bond.\n  These three are icons, absolute icons, of the civil rights movement, \nwho in their own way paved the way for so many. I had the high honor of \ncalling Lou Stokes and Julian Bond personal friends.\n  As the first African American to represent Ohio in Congress, \nRepresentative Lou Stokes was a pioneer in public service. He broke \ndown numerous barriers for African Americans during his extraordinary \ncareer as an elected official on the local, State, and Federal levels.\n  First elected to Congress in 1969 and serving for 30 long years in \nthe U.S. House, he was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus and \nthe first African American to serve on the House Appropriations \nCommittee. He was the founder of the CBC Health Braintrust, which \nremains active today in protecting health, equity, and reducing health \ndisparities.\n  Congressman Stokes was the embodiment of a public servant. He \nselflessly used his elected positions to increase opportunities for \nmillions of African Americans.\n  We will miss our dear friend Lou Stokes. But the impact of his legacy \nof service and commitment to his constituents and to the African \nAmerican community will be remembered for generations.\n  Often referred to as the matriarch of the movement, Amelia Boynton \nRobinson's role in Bloody Sunday, as you have already heard, and the \nmarch from Selma to Montgomery is immortalized in the Oscar-nominated \nfilm ``Selma.''\n  She also made history in 1964 by becoming the first African American \nwoman from Alabama to run for Congress. In her congressional election \nthat year, Mrs. Boynton Robinson garnered 10 percent of the vote \ndespite the fact that African Americans only made up 1 percent of the \nvoting population in Alabama's Seventh Congressional District.\n  Forty-six years later the CBC's very own representative, Terri \nSewell, whom we will hear from in just a few moments, now holds that \nseat here in Congress.\n  This year, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965, we remember the selfless actions of individuals like \nAmelia Boynton Robinson who fought against systems of injustice so that \nfuture generations would have opportunities that were not possible to \ngenerations past. Tonight we honor Mrs. Boynton Robinson for her legacy \nwhich continues in each of us.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, tonight we honor Julian Bond, a forefather of \nAmerica's civil rights movement and one of our country's greatest \nadvocates for freedom and equality and equitable treatment for all \npeople.\n  From his work as a student leader during the 1960s to his service in \nthe Georgia House of Representatives and the State Senate, Julian Bond \nwas a leader in the fight against racism and segregation.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  I first met Julian Bond at the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr., in 1968. As the founding president of the Southern Poverty Law \nCenter and chairman of the board of the NAACP, Julian Bond continued \nhis work educating citizens around the world of the struggles of \nAfrican Americans and the history of civil rights here in America.\n  Julian Bond spent his lifetime in public service, calling for equal \ncivil and human rights not only for African Americans, but for every \nAmerican. Until his untimely death, he was an advocate, activist, and \ndedicated champion who fought for the most vulnerable individuals and \ncommunities among us. We celebrate his life and his lasting legacy.\n  I want to thank Ms. Jackson Lee for her leadership and thank her for \nyielding. I thank the Members for coming to the floor this evening.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for his very \nthoughtful statement and for leading us off today and setting the tone \nfor the Congressional Black Caucus that we will never forget our icons, \nbut we also know that to pay tribute is the highest honor for all of us \nbecause we are here because of all of them. I thank Mr. Butterfield for \nhis leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege now to yield to Representative \nCharles Rangel, who does not need a long introduction. It is important \nto note that he has led on so many issues. He was not only the chairman \nof the Committee on Ways and Means, but also a dear friend of \nCongressman Lou Stokes and one of the founders of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus. If Congressman Rangel had not done what he did, we would \nnot be here today. I am delighted to yield to him at this time.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for \npulling together this tribute. It is moving and emotional that we do \nthis after the visit to these Chambers by the Pope, who made it \nabundantly clear how all of us, no matter how ordinary we are,\n\n[[Page H6295]]\n\ncan do extraordinary things when we make a commitment to do the right \nthing.\n  As some of the older Members know, it is almost unbelievable how \npeople that you know on an everyday basis that go through life with \ntheir own problems still can find the time to try to improve the \nquality of life for so many people.\n  I feel almost awkward looking at the Representative from Selma, \nAlabama, this evening because, after Bloody Sunday, there was a call \nall over the world for people to come to Selma. I was one of those \ncalled, and I was one of those that did not think that me going to \nSelma with my bad feet could make a contribution to anything, and this \nis especially so after seeing what happened on Bloody Sunday.\n  But I did go down because of John Lewis and Andrew Young and Martin \nLuther King and Ralph Bunche, because they said that if I could just \ncome down for the press conference, it would be appreciated. So I \ndressed up and I went down for the press conference. I had a round trip \nticket back to New York. I was dressed pretty well, not ever thinking \nthat I would be going any further than Selma.\n  It started to rain, and I felt that this would be the appropriate \ntime for me to get a cab and to go to the airport. When I saw these \nolder people like Amelia Robinson putting plastic on their shoes and \nstarting to sing and starting to march, I said, well, maybe I could go \na couple of blocks. I did that, except I found out in Selma there \nweren't any couple of blocks.\n  There were no television cameras. There was no one that recognized me \ndown there. I marched 54 miles, cussing every step of the way, trying \nto figure out what the devil I was doing in Selma.\n  Congresswoman Sewell, it just proves that if you attempt just to do \nthe right thing, God can push you to do the rest.\n  I never did believe, like John Lewis, that that Supreme Court would \ngive us the voting rights and the civil rights. I never thought that \nPresident Johnson would ever support these things. Today I tell this \nvery embarrassing story because you don't have to be a hero to be \ncounted on if you just try to start to do the right thing, and just \nmaybe God will push you to go further.\n  Certainly when a woman like Amelia Boynton Robinson is beaten \nunconscious and someone like John Lewis, who constantly put his life on \nthe line, and of course the late Dr. Martin Luther King, who gave up \nhis life, and God doesn't ask us to do these extraordinary things, but \nI do believe that the courage that these people have, that each of us \nhave just a grain of it that would allow us to contribute, as the Pope \nsaid, to show our respect for God, allowing us to inherit this great \nEarth to try to make the quality of life better.\n  Of course, when it comes to a young guy going to Morehouse, as Julian \nBond did, dropping out of school, coming from a professional family \nwhere education had a higher standard than some of us from the inner \ncities, it must have broken their heart to know that he was joining a \ngroup that would then provide the leadership for our country for people \nBlack and White.\n  There is nothing that my heart would allow me to say about Lou \nStokes. I came to Congress not knowing that in the Congress was a giant \nof a man from Cleveland, Lou Stokes, who motivated the 13 of us, who \nled us to form the Congressional Black Caucus. I have walked in the \nshadows of his giant footsteps since I have been privileged to serve in \nthis House.\n  Ms. Jackson Lee and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, it is \nreally extraordinary how God has given us the opportunity to say thank \nyou for the blessings that we have, and I do hope that maybe on both \nsides of the aisle people can talk about those who allowed this country \nto be so great, the sacrifices that so many people have made, and you \njust don't have to be a giant to appreciate the fact that God has \nblessed us all.\n  I thank her for her effort at bringing us together, not just tonight, \nbut on every committee, on every bill, and this floor. Sheila Jackson \nLee is here to continue to inspire all of us. I thank her for that.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we are so grateful for the special \nwisdom and insight that Mr. Rangel brings to all of what we do. I know \nthat the late Lou Stokes, the late Amelia Boynton Robinson, and the \nlate Julian Bond are grateful that they knew him and that he is here to \ntell his story. Even if he considers it embarrassing, I think it is a \nwonderful testimony for anybody who has said, ``I can't do it.'' We \nwant him to keep telling us that wonderful statement over and over \nagain. I thank him so very much for what he provides to the \nCongressional Black Caucus. I thank him for the kind words he mentioned \nof Representative Terri Sewell.\n  I just say to Ms. Sewell, I don't know what kind of phone message \nthat she had to the Vatican, but I repeat now the words of Pope \nFrancis, as I yield to her. This is Pope Francis, as he spoke just a \nfew days ago at that very podium:\n\n       Here, too, I think of the march which Martin Luther King \n     led from Selma to Montgomery 50 years ago as part of the \n     campaign to fulfill his dream of full civil rights and \n     political rights for African Americans.\n\n  Representative Sewell, let me thank you for bringing and infusing \nlife into the wonderful city of Selma, all the wonderful people there, \nincluding your dearly beloved mother and father, and having us walk \nwith you every step of the way.\n  As I yield to her, let me say that we should make a commitment right \nhere today, as we make changes in leadership, that we commit ourselves \nto the restoration of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which she is \nleading on. It is my delight to yield to her at this time.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I thank our leader of the CBC, \nCongressman Butterfield, so much for his exemplary leadership and the \ncourage that he exemplifies every day in fighting for the causes that \nwe all hold so dear.\n  I want to thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for those wonderful words. \nSheila Jackson Lee has not only been an amazing Member of Congress, but \nshe has been a great mentor to me. I want to thank her for all she does \nfor so many of us and the mentoring she continues to provide the \nyounger generation.\n  What can I say to Charlie Rangel? To even have him know my name is an \nhonor. I know that, but for the remarkable lives of the three people \nthat we celebrate their lives and their legacies today, I would not be \nin this auspicious Chamber, and but for his leadership and his courage, \nI would not know how to behave in this Chamber. I thank him for doing \nsuch a great job and continuing to serve the great people of Harlem and \nNew York, but also the great people of America--black, white, green, \nyellow, all of us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my CBC colleagues in paying \ntribute to the life and legacy of three great giants in American \nhistory: Representative Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and \nJulian Bond. Our Nation collectively mourns the loss of each of these \ntrailblazing figures who departed from us way too soon this summer. \nTheir journeys paved the way for myself and so many others serving in \nthis august body. While our hearts are heavy today, we honor them for \ntheir historic and notable contributions to this Nation.\n  Congressman Louis Stokes was the first African American to represent \nthe State of Ohio in Congress, where he served for more than 30 years. \nHe rose to prominence by breaking numerous barriers as the first in so \nmany areas. This included being named the first African American to \nserve as chairman of the prestigious House Permanent Select Committee \non Intelligence. As an African American who now sits on that committee, \nI am deeply honored to follow in Louis Stokes' footsteps.\n  During his tenure on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \nhe stepped into the national spotlight as a vocal critic of the Reagan \nadministration's foreign policy. He spoke boldly on issues of national \nsecurity and created a legacy of being a fierce advocate for the \nhomeland. In honoring his memory, we must also commit ourselves \ncollectively to continue the fight to promote diversity within the \nintelligence community. We must also be committed to supporting \npolicies that promote our national security in the face of growing \nthreats. It was Congressman Lou Stokes who taught us that our Nation \ndeserves nothing less.\n\n[[Page H6296]]\n\n  Today we also honor an American treasure and one of my personal \nheroes, the courageous Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson. Mrs. Robinson \npassed away on August 26, 2015, at the age of 110--yes, 110, Mr. \nSpeaker. Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson was a key figure in the voting \nrights movement in Selma, Alabama. She is often remembered for her \ncritical role in Bloody Sunday.\n  On that solemn day on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Robinson was savagely \nbeaten. A photo taken of her shortly after she was attacked and posted \nin The New York Times became a powerful symbol of the injustices \nsuffered by those who were attempting simply to vote. Yet this \ntireless, fearless foot soldier continued her work as a leader on the \nfront lines of securing the right to vote for all Americans.\n  Amelia is best known as the matriarch of the voting rights movement, \nand it was her courage, along with John Lewis and so many other known \nand unknown foot soldiers which led to the passage of the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965. Amelia was such an integral part of the process that the \ncontents of the bill, the voting rights bill, were drafted on her \nkitchen table in Selma, Alabama, in 1965.\n  Ms. Boynton not only trailblazed as a voting rights advocate, she put \nher money where her mouth was and she, herself, ran for Congress. On \nMay 5, 1964, Amelia Boynton broke yet another barrier, when she became \nthe first woman in the State of Alabama and the first African American \nwoman in the State of Alabama to run for Congress. In 1964, she \ngarnered 10.7 percent of the vote during a time when very few Blacks \nwere registered to vote. Actually, only 1 percent of the registered \nvoters were African Americans at that time.\n  Her historic run further solidified her impact on the movement for \nhuman rights and voting rights in Alabama and in this Nation. Without \nher courageous campaign for the Seventh Congressional District of \nAlabama in 1964, I know that my election to this seat in 2010, some 50 \nyears later, would not have been possible.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Her sacrifices paved the way for me to walk the Halls of Congress, \nand I will carry my love and admiration for her in my heart each and \nevery day, for I get to do what she could not, and that is vote on \nbehalf of the members of the Seventh Congressional District of Alabama. \nFor that, I am eternally grateful.\n  In fact, one of my most memorable moments in this Chamber is the \nnight that she served as my special guest at the State of the Union on \nJanuary 20, 2015, this past year. I am grateful for the memories of her \ngreeting President Obama that night. I am so blessed to not only have \ncalled her my constituent, but a beloved mentor and friend. As she is \nremembered, and she reminds us every day by her life, there is still \nmuch work to be done.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to remember the shining \nlegacy of yet another giant figure in the fight for civil and human \nrights: Mr. Julian Bond. This courageous voice held several titles over \nthe course of his impactful life, but he is most remembered for his \nservice as the NAACP chairman and the cofounder of the Southern Poverty \nLaw Center. He was also one of the original leaders of the Student \nNonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC, while he was a student at \nMorehouse College. He later served in the Georgia General Assembly for \nmore than 20 years.\n  He was first elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965. \nHowever, because of his longstanding legacy of fighting White \nsupremacy, White statehouse members tried unsuccessfully to block him \nfrom taking his seat. This brave spirit was undeterred. He spearheaded \nefforts to draft landmark legislation that spoke to the need of Blacks \nin the State of Georgia.\n  In addition to his time as an eloquent speaker, he was a celebrated \nwriter, poet, television commentator, community advocate, as well as a \ncommunication specialist. He did so much for the Southern Poverty Law \nCenter to set it on its course and so much for the lives of so many.\n  All three of these wonderful giants tell a story, a story of how \nordinary people can do extraordinary things. Working collectively, we \nas a nation can achieve amazing heights, even if we don't think so. As \nCongressman Rangel's story best exemplified, if we just take one step, \nhopefully the Lord will give us the strength to take many, many more \ntowards that fight for justice and equality.\n  In closing, I am reminded of what Amelia Boynton would often say when \nI and others would come up to her and say: ``We stand on your \nshoulders. We stand on your shoulders.'' Well, Ms. Amelia Boynton was \nso infamously known for saying, after hearing it over and over again: \n``Get off my shoulders. There is plenty of work to be done.'' ``Do your \nown work,'' is what she said.\n  And so I say to my colleagues gathered here tonight, my colleagues in \nthis wonderful body called the House of Representatives: We have plenty \nof work to do. We have plenty of work to do. And while we walk in the \nfootsteps of giants such as Amelia Boynton and Louis Stokes and Julian \nBond, let us never forget that they, too, had to take a first step. And \nas we follow in their footsteps, let us all take many steps towards \nproviding justice and liberty for all Americans, especially those that \nare most vulnerable.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I think we can leave this evening with the words \nthat Congresswoman Sewell has just said, and we thank her so very much, \n``do our own work.'' That message should carry for whether we are \nRepublicans or Democrats or Independents.\n  Congresswoman Sewell, we look forward to doing our own work on the \nrestoration of the Voting Rights Act, section 5, which you are leading \nand all of us have signed onto. We thank you so much for that eloquent \nstatement and that statement of passion.\n  Speaking of passion, it is my privilege to introduce a Member who has \nher own storied civil rights history, someone who has served as the \nCommissioner on the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, \nand someone who has been in the trenches in civil rights, dealing with \nvoting rights cases, dealing with the right to vote in her own District \nof Columbia. I think she will be the Florence Nightingale, she will be \nthe champion battler; because I believe that this Delegate, \nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, will be successful as we fight for \nthe voting rights of the District through her leadership.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. \nNorton).\n  Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend, Representative Sheila Jackson \nLee, first, for her kind and generous words, but especially today for \nher leadership of this Special Order, which is characteristic of her \nleadership in this Congress. I am so pleased that our chair Rep. G.K. \nButterfield has been here and spoken and that we have heard from \nseveral other Members.\n  I just want to say a few words about this troika of African Americans \nwho have written their signatures across our time. You have heard their \nbiographies. I don't want to recount their extraordinary bios, because \nthat is not the only reason we are honoring them with this Special \nOrder. I just want to say something about what they meant to me.\n  Two of them I knew personally: Representative Louis Stokes, whose \nmany years in the Congress happened to overlap with my first years \nhere; and, of course, Julian Bond, whom I knew best.\n  I was not fortunate to know Amelia Boynton. She may have been the \nmost courageous woman in the movement of the 1960s, who insisted upon \nfacing death, if necessary, in that march from Selma to Montgomery, and \nnearly lost her life. I was privileged to be in her presence, as so \nmany Members of Congress were, when we went to Selma this past summer. \nThat was a privilege in and of itself.\n  I was fortunate to know Congressman Louis Stokes, who was a founder \nof the Congressional Black Caucus long before I served. This was a man \nof great accomplishment. Yes, he can speak about his firsts, and much \nmore.\n  He is the first African American to serve in Congress from his \nhometown of Cleveland, as one of the two famous Stokes brothers--his \nbrother, Carl, the first African American mayor. There is something \nabout the way those men were raised and showed themselves in public \nlife. But it is Rep. Stokes' career in Congress that stands out for me.\n\n[[Page H6297]]\n\n  I am not certain there has ever been a more distinguished Member of \nthis body. It looks as if when they were trying to ask somebody to do \nsomething hard, they looked to Louis Stokes.\n  He was the first African American to serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee. My heavens. And then look at the committees he has chaired--\nhard ones--the Ethics Committee, the House Permanent Select Committee \non Intelligence. Then they needed someone to do something else that was \ndifficult, and that was to serve on the Iran Contra Committee, and \nHouse Select Committee on Assassinations, nothing was more difficult \nthan that.\n  If you were looking for a Member whom the public would trust and who \nthis body would trust, who do you go to? They went to Louis Stokes. So \nif you are trying to find out how to serve, recall the life of \nRepresentative Louis Stokes.\n  In the District, we recall his life and his work. Much of his work \nwas done in the field of health. The Howard University Louis Stokes \nHealth Science Library is named for him here in the District of \nColumbia at Howard University. So we will never forget him.\n  Of the three, the one I knew best, of course, was my colleague and \nfriend in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, later a client \nof sorts, and then finally--for 25 years, a constituent.\n  I met Julian several years after he founded, along with a handful of \nother students, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. You have \ngot to understand that that group was as different from any student \ngroup since. They were not an offshoot of the civil rights movement. \nThey were a group that stood on its own.\n  I would go down in the summers. I was in law school. SNCC was the \nequivalent of major civil rights organizations, every single one, right \nalongside them. That is why John Lewis got to speak on the March on \nWashington.\n  The reason that SNCC stood out is the quality of its leadership in \nthose early years. Julian became the spokesman. The reason he was the \nspokesman was his way with words. He was a poet and a writer, and he \ncould explain what we were doing.\n  He served a most valuable role in these early years. So no one should \nbe surprised that he went after the zenith of the civil rights movement \nto serve in the Georgia House of Representatives. What you may be \nsurprised to learn is that when he moved on to the senate, the Georgia \nSenate, they refused to seat him because he had endorsed a SNCC \nstatement opposing the Vietnam war. Imagine denying a seat to a member \nduly elected because of a statement he had made on an issue of great \nmoment.\n  This case was taken all the way to the Supreme Court. At that point, \nI was a constitutional lawyer working for the American Civil Liberties \nUnion in New York. I got to write the amicus brief. We took very few \namicus briefs to the Supreme Court, but this one seemed to have the \nmakings of a landmark case. Indeed, it did become a landmark case. You \ndo not see anybody denying anyone else the right to sit in his seat--or \nher seat, today--because of that person's views. The Julian Bond case \nsettled the matter.\n  What was Julian Bond to do with the rest of his life? First of all, \nSNCC broke a fair number of people. And though they gave much to the \nmovement, you may not have heard about many of them since. What Julian \ndid was to give the rest of his life to the movement. For every single \nday of his life as a man, after he left public service in the Georgia \nLegislature, he was devoted to the civil rights movement he had entered \nas a very young man.\n  He moved to the District of Columbia with his wife, taught at \nAmerican University and the University of Virginia, and became--and \nthis is a matter that makes me chuckle--became the chairman of the \nNAACP.\n  At SNCC we thought the NAACP was way too conservative for us, the \nyoung and foolish. It tells you how Julian grew. He grew to be the \nlong-time and devoted chairman of the NAACP.\n  He carried out his devotion to civil rights magnificently. Throughout \nhis entire life, he remained a major spokesman for the civil rights \nmovement and for progressive causes, his entire life speaking all \naround the country, carrying the message.\n  When he moved here, I had a Black Caucus event with Julian and with \nJohn Lewis simply discussing their lives as young men in the civil \nrights movement. That was to be one of the most memorable moments since \nI have been in Congress.\n  Just last February, during Black History Month, I asked Julian to \ncome to Howard University, where he and I engaged in an \nintergenerational conversation with Howard students about the police \nshootings in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City and what they meant \nto this generation and how this generation had to have its own issues \nand move in its own direction.\n  One of the things we indicated was that for all of the work of the \nyouth of the civil rights movement of our day, we never touched racial \nprofiling. It remained alive and kicking for a new generation, which \nhas taken it on.\n  I am, finally, particularly grateful that when Julian moved to the \nDistrict of Columbia, he really became a part of this city, lending his \ncivil rights celebrity to the great cause of this city for full \ncitizenship, for D.C. voting rights, yes, and for statehood for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  If you came into the District by taxis a few years ago, there was an \nadvertisement. Julian was speaking in a cab, informing you that you \nwere coming to the District of Columbia, where the residents were \ntrying to get their full citizenship.\n  Wherever he was, he had a way of touching upon the issue of freedom \nof the day and of the people around him. I will always miss him. This \ncountry will always miss him. We are grateful for the life he led. We \nare grateful, especially, for this Congressional Black Caucus evening \ndevoted to his life and to the lives of two others, very divergent \nlives but, in other ways, very similar.\n  I thank my good friend, Representative Jackson Lee, again, for her \nleadership here.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank my good friend, Congresswoman Eleanor \nHolmes Norton, for giving these three legends the vitality and vibrance \nof a personal story.\n  And to just add to his coming to students at Howard University, I \nwant you to know that, at the University of Virginia, where he was, he \nwas the most popular professor with people standing in line because the \nstudents sensed his passion and commitment, but they sensed his \nrealness.\n  Thank you so very much for that very vibrant and informative \npresentation.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I introduce this next gentleman, who has his own \nhistory, let me quote, again, as I indicated, Pope Francis from last \nweek, which captures all of what we are saying tonight: to respond in a \nway which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a \ncommon temptation nowadays to disregard whatever proves troublesome. \nLet us remember the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them \ndo unto you.\n  The gentleman that I am going to yield to, Mr. Bobby Scott, is a \nformer chairman of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, now the \nranking member on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and has \nled his professional, at least his Congressional life, as I have known \nit, to be a champion for criminal justice reform, but, more \nimportantly, has been one who has said to us over and over again that: \nWe must do unto others as we would like them to do unto us. We must \nchange this criminal justice system to have it be a fair monitoring of \nhow we inspire and restore people's lives.\n  I yield now to the gentleman from Virginia, Congressman Bobby Scott.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in honor of the \nlives of three civil rights luminaries. I thank the gentlewoman from \nHouston for giving us this opportunity to honor their lives: \nCongressman Louis Stokes, statesman and educator Julian Bond, both of \nwhom I knew personally, and activist Amelia Robinson.\n  These champions of social and economic justice lived their lives just \nas Pope Francis challenged Members of Congress to do.\n  Specifically, the Pope reminded us of the Golden Rule--do unto others \nas you would have them do unto you--and that that rule points us in the \nright direction. He specifically reminded Congress that, if we want \nopportunities,\n\n[[Page H6298]]\n\nthen let us provide opportunities. The lives we honor today are the \npersonification of the Pope's call.\n  Congressman Stokes, the beloved son of the State of Ohio, was \naffectionately called ``Lou'' when I served with him in the House. His \nmotto was to aim high, which he did even before he was a Member of \nCongress when he argued the Supreme Court case challenging the abusive \nstop-and-frisk policies and practices in the Terry v. Ohio case.\n  Lou's integrity was why he was selected to serve on the House Select \nCommittee on Assassinations of President Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., and the House investigation of the illegal arm sales during \nthe Iran-contra affair and, of course, his service on the Ethics \nCommittee.\n  His strive for social and economic justice was on full display when \nhe became the first African American to serve on the House \nAppropriations Committee. There he directed Federal dollars to \neradicate injustice and inequities by funding programs such as \nhealthcare facilities for veterans, supporting the National Science \nFoundation, and creating the first office of minority health at the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  Statesman and educator Julian Bond dedicated his entire life to this \ncause of social justice and equity. As a founding member of the Student \nNonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, he led protests against \nsegregation.\n  In 1965, Julian Bond was elected to the Georgia House of \nRepresentatives, but was denied a seat at the State House because of \nhis opposition to the Vietnam war. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 \nthat the Georgia House's refusal to seat Julian Bond violated the \nUnited States Constitution.\n  He was subsequently elected for several terms, including service in \nthe Georgia Senate, despite efforts to redraw his district.\n  He was also the first African American nominated at a major-party \nconvention as a candidate for Vice President of the United States.\n  Beginning in the 1980s, Julian Bond taught at several universities, \nincluding Harvard, Drexel, University of Virginia, and American \nUniversity.\n  For more than 20 years at UVA and American University, he taught \nthousands of students about the role of the civil rights movement as a \nseminal part of America's history.\n  He stated that the ``humanity of all Americans is diminished when any \ngroup is denied rights granted to others.''\n  He served as chairman of the NAACP from 1998 to 2009. At the 2009 \ncommencement at Virginia State University, he told the graduates that, \n``We all hope that you do well, but I also hope that you do good.''\n  Activist Amelia Robinson was among the many foot soldiers who fought \nfor civil rights. As a girl, she championed the right to vote for \nwomen. As an adult, she opened her home to Martin Luther King and James \nBevel and members of SNCC and others to help organize and strategize \nfor civil rights and the right to vote.\n  Despite the brutal beating she endured during the march for voting \nrights in Selma, Alabama, 50 years ago, she was unwavering in her fight \nto end segregation and achieve full voting rights for all.\n  Reflecting on her life as an activist, she stated that, ``I have been \ncalled rabble-rouser, agitator. But because of my fighting, I was able \nto hand to the entire country the right for people to vote.''\n  These three American giants--the legislator, the educator, the \nactivist--were all driven to push towards a more just and equal \nsociety. I am honored to recognize their lives and the gifts they gave \nto our Nation.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Houston for organizing \nthis Special Order so that we could pay appropriate tribute to these \nfine Americans.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for citing, in \nparticular, the case law that Julian Bond particularly generated from \nthe horrific denial of his right to be seated.\n  Let me also indicate the importance of members of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus sharing the history of these icons, which I hope my \ncolleagues will appreciate these giants, for many times the history is \nnot remembered or it is not understood.\n  Certainly, it is my privilege to now yield to the gentlewoman from \nOhio, who has firsthand knowledge because she can say that she comes \nfrom the State of which Lou Stokes and Carl Stokes were native sons.\n  She is, of course, an inspirational leader for her district in \nColumbus, but, more importantly, someone who brings a wealth of \nexperience from her previous service in the Ohio State Legislature and \nsomeone who has a passion for the improvement of lives of all people. I \nbelieve, as Lou Stokes has said, she understands the value and \nimportance of improving the health of African Americans and all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from \nColumbus, Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).\n\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight the Congressional Black Caucus honors the life \nand legacy of three civil rights leaders, Congressman Lou Stokes, \nAmelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond, who dedicated their lives to \nmaking our Nation a better place.\n  Countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for \ncivil rights and voting rights today.\n  We have come to these chambers tonight, Mr. Speaker, to continue \ntheir work as members of the Congressional Black Caucus. We call on \nCongress to immediately pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. \nThe American people deserve to have real voting rights.\n  Thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, not only for your \nleadership tonight, but for being a leader, for walking in their shoes, \nand for hosting the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order honoring \nthree giants.\n  This year is the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. Leaders \nespoused words in 1965 that still hold true today, words because of the \nwork of these three giants, works like:\n\n       We have proved that great progress is possible. We know how \n     much still remains to be done. And if our efforts continue, \n     if our will is strong, if our hearts are right, and if \n     courage remains our constant companion, then my fellow \n     Americans, I am confident we shall overcome. Our objective \n     must be to assure that all Americans play by the same rules, \n     and all Americans play against the same odds. Who amongst us \n     would claim that that is true today?\n\n  Just last week His Holiness, Pope Francis, delivered a historic, \nprofound, provocative address to the Joint Session of Congress. This \naddress reminded us that the nation is ``considered great'' when ``it \nfosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all \ntheir brothers and sisters.''\n  At the White House, he quoted from Martin Luther King, to use a \ntelling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King: ``We can say that we \nhave defaulted on a promissory note, and now is the time to honor it.''\n  These three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to \nthis culture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving.\n  Tonight's roll call: Congressman Lou Stokes.\n  I am honored to be the third African American from Ohio to follow in \nhis footsteps, following my mentor and dear friend, Stephanie Tubbs \nJones, my colleague, mentor and friend, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, who \nsaid at his footsteps: I don't salute or get excited about a one hit \nwonder because Lou Stokes was far from that.\n  Lou Stokes loved people. He loved the law. He loved the legislative \nprocess. He loved his family. And he loved Cleveland, Ohio.\n  You have heard so much about him, I won't repeat it. I will submit it \nfor the Record, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, if that is okay.\n  But I will forever be grateful for his encouragement, his friendship, \nhis wisdom, and his leadership. I can't think of a time or a decision \nin my life that I didn't pick up the phone and call Lou Stokes.\n  Love you, Lou Stokes.\n  Let me just briefly say we also salute Amelia Boynton Robinson, and \nmuch has been said about her. I stand on her shoulders.\n  And then Julian Bond, another great civil rights icon, whose passion \nand dedication to equality and justice propelled him to the Georgia \nLegislature, the NAACP, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which he \nco-founded.\n\n[[Page H6299]]\n\n  His commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to \ninspire us, and his legacy will guide us and the next generation of \ncivil rights leaders and activists to greatness.\n  He, like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight, helped \nchange this country for the better.\n  Thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Thank you to all my \ncolleagues with the Congressional Black Caucus for capturing and \nreflecting on the lives of three great civil warriors as we took a walk \nin their footsteps of greatness.\n  Tonight the Congressional Black Caucus honors the life and legacy of \nthree Civil Rights leaders--Congressman Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton \nRobinson and Julian Bond who dedicated their lives to making our nation \na better place.\n  Countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for \ncivil rights and voting rights today.\n  We have come to these chambers to continue their work as Members of \nthe Congressional Black Caucus; we call on Congress to immediately pass \nthe Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015.\n  The American people deserve to have real voting rights now.\n  Thank you Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for hosting the CBC's \nSpecial Order Hour paying tribute to Congressman Louis Stokes, Amelia \nBoynton Robinson, and Julian Bond.\n  This year is the 50th Anniversary of Voting Rights Act. Leaders . . . \nespoused words in 1965 that still hold true today. Words like:\n\n       We have proved that great progress is possible. We know how \n     much still remains to be done. And if our efforts continue, \n     and if our will is strong, and if our hearts are right, and \n     if courage remains our constant companion, then my fellow \n     Americans, I am confident, we shall overcome.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. . . . we can say that we \nhave defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it.\n  The three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to this \nculture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving.\n\n\n                           Congressman Stokes\n\n  I am honored to be the third African-American from Ohio to follow \nCongressman Louis Stokes who served for 30 years in Congress. I am \nforever grateful for his encouragement, friendship, wisdom, and \nleadership.\n  He earned a seat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, the \nfirst person of color to ever do so, and focused on improving housing \nand urban development for veterans, seniors, and the poor.\n  In 1971, along with our esteemed Dean of the House, Congressman John \nConyers, Congressman Stokes helped found the Congressional Black Caucus \nto promote economic, educational, and social issues important to \nAfrican Americans: this is a purpose the CBC continues to fulfill to \nthis day, and a purpose I am honored to advance.\n  His indelible mark in history will continue to live on.\n\n\n                        Amelia Boynton Robinson\n\n  It is also an honor to pay tribute to Amelia Boynton Robinson--the \nmatriarch of the voting rights movement.\n  As an African-American female serving in the U.S. Congress, I stand \non the shoulders of Mrs. Boynton Robinson.\n  Mrs. Boynton Robinson helped organize the Selma-to-Montgomery \nmarches, and walked at the front of the line that fateful day on March \n7, 1965, which we now know as ``Bloody Sunday''.\n  On August 6, 1965, she was the guest of honor at the White House when \nPresident Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law.\n  I had the privilege to join Mrs. Boynton Robinson this past March, as \nthousands of Americans marched once again over the Edmund Pettus \nBridge, remembering the struggles and recommitting ourselves to \nrestoring voting rights protections, equality, and justice.\n\n\n                              Julian Bond\n\n  Julian Bond was a civil rights icon whose passion and dedication to \nequality and justice propelled him to the Georgia legislature, the \nNAACP, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which he co-founded.\n  His commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to \ninspire us and his legacy will guide the next generation of civil \nrights leaders and activists to greatness.\n  He, like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight, helped \nchanged this country for the better.\n  Thank you CBC for capturing and reflecting on the lives of three \ngreat civil rights warriors as we took a walk in their footsteps of \ngreatness.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Congresswoman Beatty, thank you for letting us know \nwhose footsteps we walk in and for that celebratory statement.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is certainly my pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman \nfrom the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), who has come with the \nexpertise of a renowned and trained lawyer, one who is a collaborator.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Thank you so much to my colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee. \nI want to thank you and the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special \nOrder Hour, a special tribute to the lives and legacy of Representative \nLouis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond.\n  Thank you, Ms. Jackson Lee, for your work here in Congress, your \ntireless efforts to raise awareness to issues which many Americans may \nhave forgotten or not given thought to.\n  Thank you for your mentorship to us younger members here and your \ntireless efforts to support not only the people of Houston, but the \npeople of America.\n  Thank you for allowing us this most important opportunity to pay \ntribute to these remarkable individuals.\n  Mr. Speaker, today we gather in reverence and in solemn reflection to \nhonor the lives and legacies of some exceptional people, some \nexceptional Americans, who we have lost in these recent months.\n  These were civil rights activists, statesmen and women, trailblazers, \nmembers of a great generation of individuals who gave so much of \nthemselves to the Civil Rights Movement and to the advancement of \nminorities in our country.\n  They are former Congressman Louis Stokes, former chairman of the \nNAACP and Georgia State Senator Julian Bond, and civil rights icon Mrs. \nAmelia Boynton Robinson.\n  A centenarian--Mrs. Robinson's 110 years of life, that in itself is a \ngreat honor--she was dedicated to education, fighting state-sanctioned \ndiscriminatory practices against African Americans, and voter \ndisenfranchisement.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  One can make the argument that her role in Selma's civil rights \ndemonstrations, including the infamous march on Bloody Sunday where she \nwas beaten unconscious by State police, paved the way, through the \nsubsequent passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, for both \nCongressman Stokes and State Representative Bond to serve in elected \noffice.\n  As the first African American elected to Congress from the State of \nOhio, Congressman Stokes was a founding member of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus and spent his 30-year career in Congress advocating issues \nof importance to Ohioans and to African Americans across the country.\n  Julian Bond, that great statesman from Georgia, was one of 11 African \nAmericans elected to the Georgia House of Representatives after the \npassage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of \n1965. Bond served 20 years in both legislative chambers in the State of \nGeorgia and served as the first president of the Southern Poverty Law \nCenter. He also served as chairman of the NAACP.\n  These individuals have impacted the lives of so many African \nAmericans and have undoubtedly advanced the rights and interests of \nminorities in both our States' and our Nation's governments.\n  Similarly, I would like to just take a moment to recognize two \nindividuals from my own home district of the Virgin Islands who, like \nCongressman Stokes, Julian Bond, and Amelia Robinson, have changed the \nlandscape of the Virgin Islands through their advocacy and education.\n  I would like to recognize a former judge and Lieutenant Governor of \nthe Virgin Islands, the late Julio A. Brady, who, like Julian Bond and \nCongressman Stokes, used his training as an attorney to contribute to \nhis community outside of the courtroom. As a U.S. attorney, judge, and \nattorney general, Judge Brady fought to remove barriers of injustice. \nHe was laid to rest this week. Like Congressman Stokes and\n\n[[Page H6300]]\n\nAmelia Robinson, Judge Brady's legacy of service will carry on.\n  Ursula Krigger was also a centenarian, like Amelia Robinson, and, at \nage 113 was the oldest living Virgin Islander until her passing this \nmonth. She was a griot, an educator whose longevity afforded a unique \nperspective of witnessing the modern advancement of our territory.\n  The lives and legacies of these individuals are etched in the annals \nof our history and their impact forever ingrained in the minds and \nhearts of the many lives they touched. I am a better person; and, \nindeed, we are a better nation through the work of these individuals.\n  I have listened to my colleagues tonight speak about Representative \nLouis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond and the personal \nimpact these individuals had on the work of my colleagues with whom \nthey served and have known personally.\n  Understand, that while many like myself may not have had the great \nhonor and pleasure of toiling and working with them shoulder to \nshoulder in the struggle for civil rights and the advancement of \nminorities in our country, Americans like myself understand and \nappreciate their sacrifice, and we understand the work that must still \nbe done. We will continue their legacy here today and in Congress in \nthe future.\n  Thank you so much, Congressional Black Caucus, for this time. And \nthank you again to my colleague from Texas, Sheila Jackson Lee, for the \ntime that I have been afforded to speak on behalf of these great \nAmericans.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Congresswoman Plaskett, thank you so very much for \nlaying the groundwork for those who now step into those footsteps, and \nyou have done so with such leadership and certainly such passion. Thank \nyou so very much.\n  Mr. Speaker, what is my time remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Russell). The gentlewoman from Texas has \n2 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me conclude by thanking the chairman of the \nCongressional Black Caucus and my colleagues. It is so important for \nthe Congressional Black Caucus to be able to talk to America--\nRepresentative Butterfield, Representative Rangel, Representative \nSewell, Delegate Holmes Norton, Representative Bobby Scott, \nRepresentative Joyce Beatty, and, of course, Congresswoman Plaskett--to \nbe able to give life to why we are here representing all of America. We \nhave those special people that, without our voices, would not be able \nto be heard.\n  I simply want to add these words of the Pope, again, to be able to \nremind everyone why these icons that we are speaking of tonight in the \nCongressional Black Caucus--46 of us, along with Senator Booker--have a \nvital role in this place. As the Pope indicated, I would encourage you \nto keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in the cycle \nof poverty. They, too, need to be given hope. The fight against poverty \nand hunger must be fought constantly on many fronts, especially in its \ncauses.\n  I know that Americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with \nthis problem. That is the essence of Julian Bond, who never stopped \ngiving; that is the essence of Amelia Boynton Robinson, who continued \nto fight for civil rights up until her death at the age of 104 on \nAugust 6, 2015; that is the essence of Congressman Lou Stokes, a \nlegislative giant, the chairman of an appropriations subcommittee, a \nperson who went to public housing and places where children were and \ntold America that your children are dying because they are living in \nsubstandard housing, lead poisoning was killing them, which gave me the \nopportunity, Mr. Speaker, as I said before, to give a grant to my \npublic housing just this past week on helping with lead poisoning.\n  I worked for Lou Stokes, and I am very glad to note that, working for \nhim, I can say, truly a gentleman, truly a leader.\n  To this Congress, I beg of you, let us look at these icons and \ncelebrate not only their lives, but commit to the passion and justice \nof their lives, and, as well, the words of Pope Francis that tell us to \ndo unto others as we would like them to do unto us.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to again thank the members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak in praise \nof Louis Stokes, one of the greatest and most respected Members ever to \nserve in this body, who died on Tuesday, August 18, 2015, at his home \nnear Cleveland, Ohio at the age of 90.\n  It is not unusual in these days for commentators and politicians to \ntalk of something called ``American Exceptionalism.''\n  But what is meant by the term?\n  Mr. Speaker, one way to understand the term: America is exceptional \nbecause it produces and finds persons like Louis Stokes and affords \nthem the opportunity to utilize their talents to the fullest in the \nservice of their community and their country.\n  Think about it: in what other nation does a little African American \nboy born in 1925 on the east side of Cleveland and raised in the \nOuthwaite Homes housing project by a mother who worked as a domestic go \non to become a lawyer who argues and wins a landmark criminal justice \nreform case (Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)) in the United States \nSupreme Court; become the first African American elected to Congress; \nis selected to chair the powerful Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, the \nSelect Committee on Assassinations, and an Appropriations Subcommittee \nresponsible for more than $90 billion annually in federal outlays?\n  Yes, America is an exceptional nation and Louis Stokes was an \nexceptional human being.\n  Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes was born on February 23, 1925, in \nCleveland, Ohio, to Charles and Louise Cinthy (nee Stone) Stokes.\n  When he was three years old, his father, who worked in a laundromat, \ndied leaving young Louis and his younger brother, Carl, to be raised by \ntheir mother, who worked as a domestic for affluent families in the \nwealthy Cleveland suburbs.\n  Louis Stokes' maternal grandmother played a critical role in his life \nbecause she took care of the Stokes boys while their mother was at work \nand instilled in them ``the idea that work with your hands is the hard \nway of doing things'' and encouraged them over and over ``to learn to \nuse their heads.''\n  Louis Stokes took the advice to heart so after attending Cleveland's \nCentral High School and serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, \nhe returned home to attend what is now Case Western Reserve University \non the G.I. Bill at night while working during the day for the Veterans \nAdministration and the Department of the Treasury.\n  After graduating from college in two years where he excelled as a \nstudent, Louis Stokes was accepted for admission to Cleveland Marshall \nSchool of Law, from which he graduated in 1953; three years later, his \nbrother Carl would also graduate from Cleveland Marshall School of Law \nand the two of them would go on to form the law firm of Stokes & Stokes \nspecializing in the areas of civil rights and criminal law.\n  In 1964, the Supreme Court decided the landmark case of Reynolds v. \nSims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), which established the principle of ``one \nperson, one vote'' governing the reapportionment of legislative \nboundaries.\n  The following year, working on behalf of the local branch of the \nNAACP, Louis Stokes led the legal challenge to the Ohio legislature's \ncongressional redistricting, which had the effect of diluting African \nAmerican voting strength in Cleveland.\n  The challenge was unsuccessful in the federal district court but \nundeterred, Louis Stokes, joined by Charles Lucas, an African American \nRepublican, successfully appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, which in an order handed down in 1967 ruled the redistricting \nplan unconstitutional and ordered it redrawn, resulting in the creation \nof Ohio's first majority-black district, the 21st Congressional \nDistrict of Ohio.\n  Ironically, Louis Stokes would defeat his one-time ally Charles Lucas \nto win that seat in November 1968, capturing 75% of the vote, the \nclosest of his 15 successful elections to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  For the next 30 years, from 1969 to 1999, Congressman Stokes \ntirelessly fought for his constituents in Cleveland and for the best \ninterests of the people of Ohio and the United States.\n  Louis Stokes, a founding member and Chair of the Congressional Black \nCaucus from 1972-74, was the epitome of a public servant.\n  In his second term in Congress, he won appointment to the powerful \nHouse Appropriations Committee, where he served for 28 years, later \nbecoming the second African American ``Cardinal'' in history when he \nwas selected to chair the VA, HUD, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.\n  Because of the esteem in which he was held by his colleagues and the \nleadership, Louis Stokes would also later be selected to Chair the \nHouse Permanent Select Committee\n\n[[Page H6301]]\n\non Intelligence and the Select Committee charged with investigating the \nassassinations of President Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr.\n  As Chairman of the House Ethics Committee and a person of \nunquestioned integrity, Louis Stokes oversaw the committee's \ninvestigation of the corruption scandal known as ABSCAM in 1979-80, \nwhich eventually led to convictions of a senator and six House members.\n  Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes perhaps is best known for the national \nattention he attracted in 1987 as a member of the House Select \nCommittee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran/(``Iran-\nContra''), the scandal involving the illegal sale of military weapons \nto the Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran to generate money to fund the illegal \ncontra war in Nicaragua.\n  In response to the claim by Colonel Oliver North that he acted out of \npatriotism in engineering the illegal weapons sales and diverting the \nproceeds to fund the contras, a stern Louis Stokes lectured the \nmisguided Colonel North on the rule of law, the true meaning of \npatriotism, and, in the process American exceptionalism:\n  ``I suppose that what has been most disturbing to me about your \ntestimony is the ugly part. In fact, it has been more than ugly. It has \nbeen chilling, and, in fact, frightening. I'm not just talking about \nyour part in this, but the entire scenario, about government officials \nwho plotted and conspired, who set up a straw man, a fall guy. \nOfficials who lied, misrepresented and deceived. Officials who planned \nto superimpose upon our government a layer outside of our government, \nshrouded in secrecy and only accountable to the conspirators.\n  ``Colonel, as I sit here this morning looking at you in your uniform, \nI cannot help but remember that I wore the uniform of this country in \nWorld War II in a segregated Army. I wore it as proudly as you do, even \nthough our government required black and white soldiers in the same \nArmy to live, sleep, eat and travel separate and apart, while fighting \nand dying for our country. But because of the rule of law, today's \nservicemen in America suffer no such indignity.\n  ``My mother, a widow, raised two boys. She had an eighth-grade \neducation. She was a domestic worker who scrubbed floors. One son \nbecame the first black mayor of a major American city. The other sits \ntoday as chairman of a House intelligence committee. Only in America, \nCol. North. Only in America. And while I admire your love for America, \nI hope that you will never forget that others too love America just as \nmuch as you do and that others will die for America, just as quick as \nyou will.''\n  Louis Stokes never wavered in his belief that America could fulfill \nthe promise of its Founders or his dedication to the principles of the \nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution, stating:\n  ``I'm going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system, but \nI'm going to work within it. To go outside the system would be to deny \nmyself--to deny my own existence. I've beaten the system. I've proved \nit can be done--so have a lot of others.\n  ``But the problem is that a black man has to be extra special to win \nin this system. Why should you have to be a super black to get \nsomeplace? That's what's wrong in the society. The ordinary black man \ndoesn't have the same chance as the ordinary white man does.''\n  Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes' commitment to fairness and equal treatment \nstarted long before he was elected to Congress.\n  As a lawyer for the NAACP, he brought anti-discrimination lawsuits, \nrepresented demonstrators arrested in antidiscrimination marches and \nsit-ins, and took the cases of poor persons charged with crimes.\n  One of those criminal cases he took is known to every lawyer in \nAmerica and appreciated by every person who cherishes the protections \nguaranteed by the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  I am speaking of the famous case of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968) \nwon by Louis Stokes in which the Supreme Court held that a police \nofficer could ``stop and frisk'' an individual only where he could \narticulate a reasonable basis that the person was, or was about to be, \nengaged in criminal activity.\n  As a result of Terry v. Ohio, a police officer has the right to stop, \nfrisk, and question an individual he reasonably suspects to be engaged \nin criminal activity, but cannot seize items from that person if the \npat down of the suspect's outer clothing does not reveal any weapons \nposing a threat to the officer's safety.\n  Because of Louis Stokes' exceptional advocacy in Terry v. Ohio, the \nright of every individual to secure from unreasonable searches and \nseizures was preserved while at the same not impeding the ability of \nlaw enforcement officers to perform their duties safely.\n  Mr. Speaker, every citizen benefits from this ruling and communities \nthat have a history of being harassed by law enforcement protected by \nthe Constitution from arbitrary and abusive treatment by law \nenforcement.\n  But the fight for a criminal justice system that respects the rights \nof all persons is not over.\n  That is why I am proud to be the Ranking Member of the House \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations and a leader in the effort to reform the criminal \njustice system so that all persons receive fair and equal treatment \nregardless of their race, gender, religion, or national origin.\n  Louis Stokes fought tirelessly to fulfill the promise of the 14th \nAmendment that ``no state shall make or enforce any law which shall \nabridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; \nnor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, \nwithout due process of law; nor deny to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.''\n  It is a fight I am proud to continue today.\n  Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes will be mourned by friends and colleagues \non both sides of the aisle who had the privilege to serve alongside \nhim.\n  He was a mentor to me and I will always remember his commanding \npresence and cherish the assistance he provided me and the example he \nset for new Members to follow.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his Jay, Louis' beloved wife of 55 \nyears; to his children, Shelly, Louis, Angela, and Lorene; his \ngrandchildren; and the untold thousands of persons who touched and \nwhose lives were touched by one of Cleveland's greatest sons.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory \nof Louis Stokes, an exceptional American, and the gentleman from Ohio \nwho served in this chamber for three decades with honor, integrity, and \ndistinction.\n\n                          [From cleveland.com]\n\n Lou Stokes Put Health Impacts of Substandard Housing on the National \n Agenda, and in Cleveland: Terry Allan, Dorr Dearborn and Dave Jacobs \n                               (Opinion)\n\n       In this file photo from 2012, Timothy Benner, then 8, looks \n     outside from his Maurice Avenuue home in Cleveland. After \n     Timothy and some of his siblings tested positive for lead \n     poisoning, traced to the soil around their home, their mother \n     restricted their outdoor play time. U.S. Rep. Lou Stokes, who \n     died earlier this month, championed national attention and \n     funding to address the problem of lead poisoning in inner-\n     city children.\n       Recent stories and opinion pieces have eulogized the many \n     accomplishments of the late U.S. Rep. Louis Stokes, from \n     civil-rights champion to accomplished litigator, statesman \n     and lawmaker. We believe that Louis Stokes should also be \n     recognized as a national leader who clearly understood the \n     connection between substandard housing and health, and acted \n     to address the problem, at a time when very few did.\n       Back in the 1980s, the scope and magnitude of the childhood \n     lead-poisoning problem and its impact on our nation's \n     children was not fully recognized or well understood.\n       Subsequent efforts to increase blood screening in early \n     childhood revealed that Greater Cleveland had among the \n     highest rates of lead poisoning in the country, adding to the \n     compounding disadvantages of children living in poverty in \n     our community and across the United States.\n       Some of us have vivid memories from 1991, when Congressman \n     Stokes held up a Newsweek magazine cover story on threats \n     posed to children by lead paint, passionately advocating for \n     the voiceless in our society while educating the community \n     about this silent epidemic. He wanted all of us to understand \n     the debilitating consequences of childhood lead exposure in \n     the home environment and its impact on the life trajectory of \n     these vulnerable kids.\n       Congressman Stokes turned that message into action, by \n     using his formidiable legislative acumen to establish the \n     first Healthy Homes program in the country within the U.S. \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n       When he recognized in 1998 that young infants in his \n     district were suffering from sometimes fatal lung bleeding \n     associated with water-damaged, moldy homes, he asked HUD to \n     address the impact of inner-city homes on children's health. \n     He understood that houses are systems, and that independently \n     addressing lead paint problems, moisture intrusion and mold, \n     injury risks and other housing hazards was inefficient and \n     costly. He also had the vision to recognize that treating \n     children at the hospital, only to release them back into the \n     same substandard home that made them sick, created a vicious \n     circle with major public health consequences. He knew these \n     homes needed to be fixed.\n       The HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control had shown interest in \n     applying the experience of lead-poisoning prevention to \n     include other health hazards in the home, such as plumbing \n     problems and leaky basements, but lacked the authority.\n       Through his vision, the Congressman invited us and others \n     to testify at the House Subcommittee on HUD appropriations to \n     see what could be done. Lou Stokes convinced his fellow \n     committee members to provide the very first appropriation of \n     $10 million to HUD for `Healthy Homes' prevention programs in \n     low-income housing. His legacy has resulted in millions of \n     homes that are safer and healthier as a direct result of that \n     investment in our children. Since that time,\n\n[[Page H6302]]\n\n     the HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has \n     provided more than $175 million in competitively awarded \n     grants to communities across the nation to investigate and \n     address health hazards in homes.\n       The asthma home-visit program in Cleveland that decreases \n     the hospitalization rate of children with asthma, highlighted \n     in The Plain Dealer in June, is a direct outgrowth of \n     Congressman Stokes' work.\n       In 2012, HUD created the Louis Stokes Healthy Homes Award \n     and presented the first one to him at the City Club of \n     Cleveland. When he received the award, he pointed out that \n     much has been achieved and that much more remains to be done. \n     He also said that he really didn't know what all the fuss was \n     about, as he was just a kid who grew up in public housing, \n     who wanted to do the right thing for our children.\n       He was an inspiration to us all.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak in praise \nof Julian Bond, one of the leading lights of the Civil Rights Movement, \nwho died on Saturday, August 15, 2015, at the age of 75.\n  While Julian lost his battle to the illness that claimed his life, it \nis the struggle for civil rights and human dignity he helped to win \nthat he will forever remembered and revered.\n  Horace Julian Bond was born January 14, 1940 in Nashville, Tennessee \nto Julia Agnes and Horace Mann Bond.\n  Julian's father was the first African-American President of Lincoln \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, the same institution attended by Thurgood \nMarshall and Langston Hughes who would both go on to make substantial \ncontributions to the Civil Rights Movement and the advancement of \nAfrican-Americans.\n  Julian's father later became president of Atlanta University and \nJulian decided to attend Morehouse College, one of the leading black \ncolleges in the nation.\n  Julian Bond, who came from a long line of educators, determined at an \nearly age to put his journalistic and organizing talents in service of \nthe cause of civil rights and racial equality.\n  While a student at Morehouse College, Julian helped found The \nPegasus, a literary magazine, and led nonviolent student protests \nagainst segregation in Atlanta parks, restaurants, and movie theaters.\n  Mr. Speaker, today it is difficult to imagine there once was a time \nin our country when blacks and whites could not eat together in public \nrestaurants, use the same public restrooms, stay at the same hotels, or \nattend the same schools.\n  Julian Bond answered the call to action and put his studies on hold \nto devote all of his energies and efforts to ending segregation and \nracial discrimination.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is not unusual these days for us to think of a \nchampion as someone who receives the highest accolades in sports.\n  Julian Bond was a champion of the people.\n  His success is measured not in the numbers of trophies, medals, \nribbons, and championship banners, but in the number of doors and \nopportunities he helped to open for those who had been neglected, \nmarginalized, and disenfranchised.\n  Julian Bond knew that to bring about non-violent social change it was \nnecessary to organize so he co-founded the Student Nonviolent \nCoordinating Committee (SNCC).\n  SNCC, which organized and mobilized the participation of students and \nyoung people in the Civil Rights Movement, conceived the Freedom Rides \nthat challenged the practice of racial segregation in interstate \ntransportation and the Mississippi Freedom Summer project that \nundertook the dangerous work of helping African Americans register to \nvote in the state most committed to maintaining White supremacy by any \nmeans necessary.\n  SNCC was not the first leadership role history and circumstance would \ncall upon Julian Bond to assume; nor would it be the last.\n  In 1965, after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, Julian Bond was elected to represent the residents \nof the 32nd district in Georgia House of Representatives.\n  But on January 10, 1966, his white colleagues in the Georgia House \nvoted 184-12 not to seat him because he had publicly expressed his \nopposition to the Vietnam War.\n  Julian Bond challenged the refusal of the Georgia House to seat him \nand took his case all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which \nruled in the unanimous decision of Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.S. 116 (1966), \nthat expressing opposition to the Vietnam War was speech protected by \nthe First Amendment and directed that he be seated as a duly elected \nmember of the state legislature.\n  Julian Bond would go on to serve three more terms in the George \nHouse, where he co-founded the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, and \nsix terms in the Georgia State Senate.\n  In 1971, Julian Bond co-founded and served as president of the \nSouthern Poverty Law Center that tracks the actions of hate groups to \nbetter inform and prepare communities about the dangers these groups \npose.\n  Julian Bond consistently identified issues of civil inequality and \nprovided solutions by gathering groups of community leaders, \nprofessionals, and educators to protect what the laws and policies \nwould not, our basic civil rights.\n  In 1998, Julian Bond's commitment to justice and equality led him to \nanswer the call to serve and accept the position of Chairman of the \nNAACP, a post he held until 2010.\n  Julian Bond was able to bring the earnest fight to achieve equality \ninto the modern era as he watched African-Americans achieve the highest \nawards in their professions and continued to break down barriers.\n  In November 2008, Julian Bond witnessed the election of the first \nAfrican American President of the United States, a feat thought \nimpossible just a decade earlier.\n  Mr. Speaker, because of trailblazers like Julian Bond millions of \nAmericans gained access to opportunities previously denied to members \nof their communities.\n  Julian Bond spent 5 years with SNCC, 8 years as president of the \nSouthern Poverty Law Center, 12 years as the president of NAACP, 20 \nyears as a state representative, and 75 years an unwavering champion of \ncivil rights for all people, including the LGBT community.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Julian's beloved wife Pamela, his \nchildren and grandchildren; and the untold millions of persons whose \nlives were touched by one of America's greatest sons.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory \nof Julian Bond, a tireless and eloquent voice for justice, equality, \nand human dignity who did so much to close the gap between the promise \nof America's founding ideals and the reality of people's lives.\n\n          Civil Rights Giant Julian Bond Never Stopped Giving\n\n           (Posted By Edna Kane-Williams on August 31, 2015)\n\n       President Obama described him as a ``hero'' who ``helped \n     changed this country for the better.'' The Rev. Jesse Jackson \n     called him a ``leader with strength, character.'' NAACP \n     Chairman Roslyn Brock said he ``inspired a generation of \n     civil rights leaders.'' Teresa Sullivan, president of the \n     University of Virginia, where he taught history for many \n     years, called him a beloved retired professor who ``shaped \n     the course of history through his life and work.''\n       How ever you choose to describe Julian Bond, one thing is \n     for sure: He taught us all how to stand for what we believe. \n     And he believed in freedom, justice and equality.\n       For me, one of the most remarkable attributes of this civil \n     rights giant is the fact that he never stopped giving. Even \n     at the time of his brief illness and death on Aug. 15 at the \n     age of 75, he was still serving faithfully as chairman \n     emeritus on the NAACP board. Even after he retired from the \n     professorship at the University of Virginia, he continued to \n     mentor and remained a role model for students and others.\n       A writer, poet, television commentator, lecturer and \n     college teacher--and as a former politician--Julian Bond was \n     one of those rare people whose work became legendary while he \n     was still doing it. In fact, the Library of Congress once \n     called him a ``living legend.''\n       And because of the magnitude of his work, he leaves many \n     treasures that will simply keep on giving. UVA, where his \n     papers are housed, has announced its goal to establish a \n     Julian Bond Professorship in Civil Rights and Social Justice, \n     which ``will continue Bond's scholarly legacy.'' There will \n     certainly be many more designations in honor of his life's \n     work.\n       And surely some will rise, seeking to follow in his \n     footsteps. Mr. Bond believed in young people's ability to \n     take the civil rights and social justice baton and run with \n     it. Earlier this year, he told a group of Howard University \n     students, ``I think you know what the problems are. You know \n     what the solutions are, and I'm sure we will be glad to help. \n     But don't depend on us to tell you what to do. Just go out \n     and do it.''\n       Well, he left an amazing road map. From his pioneering \n     civil rights work as a cofounder of the Student Nonviolent \n     Coordinating Committee to all of his work and contributions \n     thereafter, Julian Bond was a model for anyone who aims to \n     make an impact and leave the world a better place.\n       In that regard, he was a role model for us all. What a \n     life. What a legacy.\n\n  Amelia Boynton was born on August 18, 1911, in Savannah, Georgia. Her \nearly activism included holding black voter registration drives in \nSelma, Boynton spent her first two years of college at Georgia State \nCollege (now Savannah State University), then transferred to the \nTuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in Alabama. She graduated \nfrom Tuskegee with a home economics degree before further pursuing her \neducation at Tennessee State University, Virginia State University and \nTemple University.\n  In the 1930's, Boynton Robinson began her activist career by \nregistering African Americans to vote. In 1964, she ran for Congress to \nrepresent Alabama. She was the first woman to have run for this \nDemocratic seat, and although she did not win, she received 10% of\n\n[[Page H6303]]\n\nvotes. As the civil rights movement picked up, Boynton asked Martin \nLuther King Jr., who had witnessed her arrest in January 1965 for \nseeking to register Black voters, to visit Selma and empower the \ncommunity. King accepted, and joined Boynton Robinson and the Southern \nChristian Leadership Conference in planning the march from Selma to \nMontgomery on March 17th, 1965.\n  As approximately 600 marchers walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, \nthey were confronted by 200 state troopers and Alabama policemen, who \nshot teargas and beat the non-violent protesters. This horrific event \ncame to be known as Bloody Sunday.\n  At least 17 protesters were sent to the hospital, including Boynton \nRobinson. A picture of her unconscious body lying on the ground after \nan officer shot tear gas into her throat spread through every news \nmedia outlet across the globe, and quickly became a symbol for race \nrelations in the United States at the time.\n  The Selma to Montgomery march was a pivotal demonstration in the \ncivil rights movement, leading to future victories such as the Voting \nRights Acts of 1965 signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n  Amelia Boynton Robinson was an incredible activist, leader, and \nwoman, and is remembered for her courage and strength throughout the \ncivil rights movement. She worked for equality for all until her last \nday on this earth.\n\n                   [From the Two-Way, Aug. 26, 2015]\n\n                           (By Bill Chappell)\n\n   Amelia Boynton Robinson, Survivor of `Bloody Sunday,' Dies at 104\n\n       Amelia Boynton Robinson, who went from being beaten on a \n     bridge in Selma, Ala., in 1965 to being pushed across the \n     bridge in a wheelchair alongside the president of the United \n     States, has died at age 104.\n       Her daughter, Germaine Bowser, confirmed to Troy Public \n     Radio's Kyle Gassiott that Boynton Robinson died early \n     Wednesday morning. She had been hospitalized after suffering \n     several strokes this summer.\n       Born in Savannah, Ga., Boynton Robinson was a pioneer in \n     the voting rights movement who took part in the event that \n     came to be known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' when she and other \n     activists were attacked by state troopers as they tried to \n     march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.\n       Along with Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., Boynton Robinson held \n     hands with President Obama as the men walked across the \n     bridge this past March, marking the 50th anniversary of the \n     march in Selma.\n       The Montgomery Advertiser reports:\n       ``Boynton Robinson asked Martin Luther King Jr. to come to \n     Selma to mobilize the local community in the civil rights \n     movement.

She was a child suffragette, who alongside her mother, \nadvocated for the women's vote and then as a young woman fought for the \nright of blacks to have their say at the ballot box. After bold run to \nrepresent Alabama in Congress, Mrs. Robinson helped organize the Bloody \nSunday March from Selma to Montgomery. She was hospitalized after being \nknocked unconscious by a white officer on that perilous day, which left \nher undaunted and even more determined to fight for the African-\nAmerican vote. It was my honor to nominate her for a Congressional \nBlack Caucus Foundation Phoenix Award earlier this year, but sadly, she \ndied before I could present it to her. Thankfully, however, Mrs. \nRobinson was able to share enough stories about her courageous \nexperiences to fill a history book and resonate for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6303-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6303-H6305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHRISTIANS UNDER ATTACK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I come before this honorable House with an \nissue that has been rather heartbreaking for so many of us for so long \nnow:\n  In The Middle East, the cradle of Christianity, where it started \n2,000 years ago based on the Judeo principles from thousands of years \nbefore that, there has been a massive onslaught. Against Jews, it has \nbeen going on for some time; but especially in the last several years, \nit has become untenable for Christians.\n  In an article by Debra Heine, September 20, my sister's birthday, she \nwrote about ``2,000 Years of Christian Civilization Destroyed on \nObama's Watch.''\n  It says this in the article: ``The Islamic State has managed to \ndestroy two thousand years of Christian civilizations in the Middle \nEast in just a couple of years, Lt. Col. Ralph Peters noted on `The \nO'Reilly Factor' last week. And he placed the blame squarely on \nPresident Obama's . . . policy.\n  ``ISIS has been spreading across the Middle East like a plague of \nlocusts, and as they have spread, they have targeted religious \nminorities, particularly Christians, for destruction. In Syria, tens of \nthousands of Assyrian Christians have been attacked and displaced.\n  ``They are forgotten refugees.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I have met with Christians and Christian leaders from \nSyria, and the stories they tell and the horrors they talk about, the \ninhumanity to man that is being inflicted upon Christians in that area \nis just untenable. It is unconscionable. Women--talk about a war on \nwomen. If they are Christian women, it is absolutely horrendous.\n  I ran into the same problem in meeting with family members in Nigeria \nof girls that were kidnapped by radical Islamists, Boko Haram. That was \nin Nigeria.\n  I would be interested to talk to the President of Togo tomorrow. I \nhave been to his country before. I have seen the poverty, and I have \nseen the affliction.\n  But in the Middle East, Christians are not even allowed to be in the \narea where the Apostle Paul walked. The Apostle Paul planted churches \nwhere Christian missionaries were, along the times right after Jesus \nresurrected. Right in the early days of the church, churches were \nplanted. And now, while the United States is said to be the sole \nsuperpower, Christians are being persecuted in greater numbers around \nthe world than ever in history.\n  If there is a God who loves Christians, loves all people but has an \naffinity for Jews and Christians, then there would have to be a price \nfor any nation that allows this to go on.\n  This article goes on: A Catholic priest who visited Kurdish Iraq last \nfall described the wounded souls of the Christians who had taken refuge \nthere. They had been forced from their homes in northern Iraq in the \nsummer of 2014.\n  `` `Without question, we are talking about genocide here. Genocide is \nnot only when the people are killed, but also when the soul of a people \nis destroyed. And that is what is happening in Iraq now,' said Fr. \nAndrzej Halemba, head of Aid to the Church in Need's Middle East \nsection, said October 28. `It is the most tragic thing that I have ever \nexperienced.' ''\n  This is from the priest. The priest goes on: `` `I have seen people \nwho have been deeply wounded in their soul. In the various crises in \nthis world, I have often seen people who have lost everything. But in \nIraq, there are Christians who have had to leave everything and take \nflight three or four times. They can see no light at the end of the \ntunnel.'\n  ``Last spring, hundreds of Assyrian Christians fled to Lebanon after \nISIS jihadists stormed their villages in Syria's northeastern province \nof Hasakeh.\n  ``Members of Lebanon's Assyrian community did their best to welcome \nthe new refugees, but the displacement had left them traumatized.\n  `` `The villages of Khabur are empty now, there is no one left except \nsome fighters,' lamented Chorbishop Yatron Koliana, as he oversaw the \ndistribution at his diocese.''\n\n[[Page H6304]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this is tragic. Christian villages 2,000 years old, \ndestroyed. Nothing left but some people trying to fight for just the \nground that they are fighting on that once was their home.\n  `` `Our people have experienced a great tragedy in Syria' . . . `They \nare depressed. Some of them have chronic illnesses. Their lives are \ndifficult.'\n  `` `How can we be comfortable living on aid?' asked 50-year-old \nSimaan, who fled his village Tal Hormuz.\n  ``He railed against what he called international indifference to the \nplight of Assyrians under attack by ISIS in Syria and neighboring Iraq.\n  `` `The whole world, from the U.N. to the United States and Russia, \nis responsible' . . . `They' ''--talking about ISIS--`` `have destroyed \nour whole civilization . . . and the world is watching.' ''\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  We hear so many sad stories. Christians are being persecuted on our \nwatch, and we are not talking enough about it. The President certainly \nisn't. He tells us that we need to take tens or hundreds of thousands \nof more Muslim refugees. What about the Christians and the massive \nextermination of churches in the Middle East under this administration? \nWe get it. The Constitution gives the President wide authority and wide \nlatitude on foreign policy. Congress has some say because we can \nappropriate or defund what the President is doing--if we have \nleadership with courage to do that.\n  This article goes on: ``In July, 4,000 more Assyrian Christian \nfamilies were among the 120,000 people who fled Hasakah to escape ISIS \nforces who had entered the city looking to carry out a mass ethno-\nreligious slaughter.\n  ``Fleeing Muslim persecution, Christian refugees are often targeted \nand persecuted anew by fleeing Muslim refugees.''\n  The International Business Times reported: ``Italian police have \narrested 15 Muslim immigrants in Palermo, for allegedly having thrown \nChristian refugees off the rubber boat that was taking them to Italy \nafter a fight for `religious reasons,' according to media reports.\n  ``Those arrested--from Mali, Guinea and Ivory Coast--were part of a \ngroup of 100 that were rescued off the Libyan coast by the Italian \ncoast guard.\n  ``The Archbishop of Canterbury, recently warned British Prime \nMinister David Cameron that his government's refugee policy was \ndiscriminating against Christians because Christians are not among the \nrefugees being helped in U.N. camps. They are not in the U.N. camps \nbecause they fear persecution from radicalized Muslim refugees.\n  ``The Most Reverend Justin Welby reportedly met the Prime Minister \nearlier this month with concerns that Christians in Syria will be \nlargely excluded from the 20,000 refugees due to come to the U.K. over \nthe next 5 years.\n  ``The government, in line with European Union policy, is committed to \ntaking in refugees from U.N. camps in Syria and neighboring countries. \nIt cannot discriminate in favor of any one religious group. But the \nArchbishop has raised concerns that Christians have avoided refugee \ncamps because of fears of persecution from rogue Islamist groups \noperating inside refugee camps.\n  ``In a speech in the House of Lords last Monday, Archbishop Welby \nsaid that, `within the camps there is significant intimidation and \nradicalization, and many particularly of the Christian population who \nhave been forced to flee are unable to be in the camps.'\n  ``He went on: `What is the government's policy of reaching out to \nthose who are not actually in the camps?' ''\n  Lord Carey, who wrote in the Telegraph about his concern of the \nplight of Christians, wrote:\n  `` `The frustration for those of us who have been calling for \ncompassion for Syrian victims for many months is that the Christian \ncommunity is yet again left at the bottom of the heap.'\n  `` `Mr. Cameron's policy inadvertently discriminates against the very \nChristian communities most victimized by the inhuman butchers of the \nso-called Islamic State.'\n  `` `Christians are not to be found in the U.N. camps, because they \nhave been attacked and targeted by Islamists and driven from them. They \nare seeking refuge in private homes, church buildings, and with \nneighbors and family.'\n  ``Refugees who want to come to the United States will also be \nrequired to apply through the U.N.\n  `` `A combination of European cowardice and awful American foreign \npolicy has led to a mass Muslim migration that will affect the whole \nworld.' ''\n  ``Lt. Col. Ralph Peters disagreed somewhat with that assessment.''\n  He said, `` `I think you were much, much too soft on President Obama \nand a bit too hard on the E.U.' . . .`If America doesn't lead, it \ndoesn't happen.' ''\n  He went on to say: `` `Just look at a map of the Middle East . . . on \nGeorge W. Bush's last day in office. There is broad peace across the \nMiddle East and North Africa, Iraq was finally convalescing, and . . . \nObama promptly, to please his America-hating base, abandons Iraq, backs \nthe Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, gets rid of Qaddafi without a plan for \nwhat goes after, threatens Assad . . . then does nothing, doesn't \nlisten to the intelligence community when for years they are telling \nhim about the Islamic State coming--then tries to blame the \nintelligence community, and launches feckless airstrikes. The \ncombination of his fecklessness and cowardice, his rhetorical bravado \nand utter incompetence are responsible.' ''\n  He goes on: `` `No. Listen to this. Two thousand years of Christian \ncivilization destroyed on his watch . . . That's on Obama. When America \ndoesn't lead, nothing happens.' ''\n  Well, it is not just on President Obama. I am sure he is mainly \nresponsible for our foreign policy, but we need to stand up to the \nPresident. When Iran is out there saying, as they have in the last \ncouple of weeks, that with the $100 billion, $150 billion that \nPresident Obama is going to see to Iran getting quickly, and the \nhundreds of billions of dollars that will flow in subsequent years, \nthey were already announcing they are going to increase their support \nfor Hamas and Hezbollah as they kill Americans, continue to kill \nChristians, and continue to kill moderate Muslims who are not \nradicalized, at what point is Congress responsible for not standing up \nto the President?\n  Mr. Speaker, I would submit that one very important point has come, \nand right now it is up to the United States Senate to have a backbone \non behalf of the millions that stand to be persecuted and killed by the \nmoney that they are going to allow to go to Iran by failing to do what \nthey could to stop this world atrocity.\n  There is no question in reasonable, intelligent minds that the Iran \ndeal is a treaty. It is a treaty as anticipated by the Founders. It is \na treaty as referred to in the Constitution, article II, section 2, \nsecond paragraph, and it requires a vote of two-thirds of the Senate \npresent to go along with it in order for it to be effective.\n  Yes, the Corker bill tried to amend the Constitution. Legislation \ncan't amend the Constitution. Once it is clear--as it is--that the Iran \ndeal is a treaty, then we need desperately to have people in the Senate \nstand up--some of them have--make clear this is a treaty; it requires \ntwo-thirds in order to approve it or it is not ratified, it is not \neffective, and the President is not allowed to release the 100-plus \nbillion, $150 billion to Iran that will be used for atrocities, \nespecially toward America, toward Christians, toward moderate \nnonradicalized Muslims, toward Jews, and toward Israel. There is a real \nresponsibility here. It may take courage--I am sure it will--for the \nSenate to stand up and the Senate majority leader to stand up and say: \nSorry, Mr. President, the Iran deal is a treaty. We have listed in our \nletter to the majority leader in the Senate some of the bases, it is \nspelled out in our resolution that we filed and talked about here on \nthe floor, it is clearly a treaty.\n  The end of John Quincy Adams' oral argument that capped a couple of \ndays of oral argument in the case can be found online. He was afraid \nthat if he did not do an adequate job as a lawyer, those Africans that \nhe was representing that had been captured by other Africans and sold \ninto slavery, sent to the Caribbean, and then put on the Spanish ship \nthe Amistad, they were able to overtake and overpower the Spanish and \ntake charge of the ship. They landed in America. The lawsuit was over \nwhether or not they were free Africans or whether they were property of \nthe Spanish.\n\n[[Page H6305]]\n\n  I can understand the fear that John Quincy Adams must have had as he \nstood downstairs in the Old Supreme Court Chamber. One of the Justices \nhad died one night during oral argument, not while he was actually \narguing. That final day he knew if he didn't do an adequate job, his \nclients would wear chains and their children would wear chains all \nbecause he didn't do an adequate job as their lawyer.\n  So he finished his oral argument by calling the names of Justices of \nthe Supreme Court who had been on the Supreme Court but had passed \naway. Chief Justice, Justices, he knew them. He called their names: The \nJustice that started this case, where is he? Where are all these \nJustices? Where is the Solicitor General that argued before me?\n  This is around 1821. This is in the late 1830s. He is now arguing in \nthe Supreme Court in their Chamber downstairs.\n  After going through all the Supreme Court Justices that had passed \naway, he finishes basically by saying they have gone to meet their \nJudge, and the biggest question is when they met their Maker, their \nJudge, did they hear the words: ``Well done, good and faithful \nservant?''\n  It is very clear, send a message to the Supreme Court. Think about \nit, Justices. If you died tonight like the other Judge just died in the \nlast couple of nights and you go to meet your Maker, do you want the \nlast thing you did to be having sent wonderful African people out in \nchains that they would wear and their children would wear--possibly \ntheir children and their children--all because you didn't do the right \nthing as a judge? He won the case, as well he should.\n  I can't help but wonder if John Quincy Adams were here today arguing \non behalf of Christian communities all over the Middle East that have \nbeen destroyed, refugees that have been sent running, Jews that can no \nlonger populate the area because of threats and violence upon them, and \nhe saw that the United States that he had been President of and was in \nthe House of Representatives after having been President, if he would \nnot be mortified, if he would not challenge us today: Do we want to \nmeet our Maker, our Judge, and we saw and heard about the plight of \nChristians, Jews, and moderate Muslims around the Middle East and North \nAfrica just being slaughtered, women being raped and torn apart, \nbrutalized in unthinkable ways, and we turned a blind eye to that and \nsaid that we are going to bring in massive numbers of refugees who are \nMuslim, 72 percent of which are male, and we have been told by radicals \nthat they are going to make sure that there are people that want to \nkill and destroy more Christians, more Jews, more of America, and we \nare going to bring them in without proper vetting--because you can't \nvet them properly--all while Christians, Jews, and moderate Muslims are \nbeing slaughtered and overrun all through the Middle East as we are \ncredited with being the superpower in the world?\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Yet, also, these last few days, the U.N.--where we pay far more than \nanybody even comes close to in order to keep it going as they continue \nto become more and more anti-Semitic, anti-Israeli, and anti-American--\nthey entertain the largest supporter of terrorism in the world, the \nleader of Iran. And he says this in part, the leader of Iran, the \nPresident Rouhani:\n  If we did not have U.S. military invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and \nthe United States' unwarranted support for the inhumane actions of the \nZionist regime against the oppressed nation of Palestine, today the \nterrorists would not have an excuse for the justification of their \ncrimes.\n  I am taking this from an article by Julian Hattem, 9-28-15, which is \ninteresting. We have heard that throughout the United States, if we \njust hadn't gone into Iraq, if we hadn't gone into Afghanistan, if we \nhadn't gone into Afghanistan with the 300 Americans that we embedded--\nabout 300--we embedded and let the Afghans destroy the Taliban by \nFebruary of 2002, then we became an overwhelming occupying force in \nAfghanistan--but at least by February of 2002, if we hadn't gone in and \nhelped them, the Taliban would still be completely controlling \nAfghanistan. That is the way it is.\n  Now, we went astray when we became occupiers, and this President has \nonly tripled the number of deaths in Afghanistan, even though the war \nis supposedly over. Over tripled the number of American deaths, even \nthough the real war was during President Bush, because of this \nPresident's rules of engagement and disastrous foreign policy.\n  But think about it. This is the head, the President of Iran. He is \ntelling the UN and the world that, if it weren't for the United States' \ninvasion in Afghanistan and in Iraq, there wouldn't be any American \nterrorists.\n  Mr. Speaker, why in the world should the U.N. listen to a man that is \nthis big a liar or is this stupid? Because you don't have to be all \nthat bright to understand September 11 of 2001 happened before we sent \n300 or so into Afghanistan to help them destroy the Taliban and before \nwe went in and took out a brutal dictator in Iraq.\n  In fact, the planning of 9-11-2001 happened during the Clinton \nadministration on President Clinton's watch. And for people that are \nfools or liars like Rouhani and they don't know or are just lying about \nit, during the Clinton administration, President Clinton's policies \nwere to run and help persecuted Muslims whenever we found them around \nthe world.\n  And while we were busy helping Muslims, Western Asia, Eastern Europe, \nwherever we could help them, they were planning the attack on New York \nCity and Washington, D.C., and hoping to wipe out the entire American \ngovernment here in Washington, D.C. And but for the heroic act of \npeople on a plane that took it down in Pennsylvania, they may well \nhave.\n  We don't need to hear any of these lies about, oh, if America just \nhadn't invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, regardless of whether you agree \nwith what President Bush ordered with Iraq, the fact is 9/11 was a \nterrorist attack before and so was the attack on the USS Cole and so \nwere the attacks on our embassies around the world during the 1990s and \nso was the first World Trade Center attack in 1993 that apparently had \nsome planning back during the former President Bush's administration.\n  And that was an administration that stopped a brutal dictator, Saddam \nHussein, who had raided another Muslim country, and we went in and \nhelped Kuwait get their country back. We went to help the Muslims. And \nhow do they reward us? To plan an attack to try to take down the World \nTrade Centers in '93.\n  It is very clear Christianity, Judaism, Israel, all were under attack \nand so was America. And our enemies can't believe how stupid Americans \nare because we are going to reward the biggest supporter of terrorism \nin the world--Iran--with $100 to $150 billion that they are already \nsaying they are going to use to help Hamas and Hezbollah kill more \nChristians, more Jews, help wipe out Israel, help the attack against \nthe Great Satan, the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for people in the United States Government to \nstand up and help correct the wayward policies of this administration. \nWe start by having the United States Senate in one voice say the \nIranian deal is a treaty and we are taking a vote on it and cloture is \nset aside with 51 votes.\n  And they won't get the two-thirds to ratify it. It will not become \neffective against the United States. And thank God we will then have \nstopped the continued persecution of Christians, moderate Muslims, \nJews, Israelis, and the United States, instead of rewarding them and \nhelping them take us out.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds Members to avoid engaging \nin personalities toward the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6305-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6305-H6306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Hudson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today and the balance \nof the week on account of family reasons.\n  Ms. Kelly of Illinois (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today \nthrough October 1 on account of a family emergency.\n  Mr. Al Green of Texas (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on \naccount of unforeseen circumstances.\n\n[[Page H6306]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/house-section/article/H6306-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  The Speaker announced his signature to enrolled bills of the Senate \nof the following titles:\n\n       S. 261.
