YOUNG\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Flores) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Francis Michael Young \nof Waco, Texas, who passed away on May 1, 2016.\n  Mr. Young, better known as F.M., was a leading businessman and \nphilanthropist in Waco and central Texas. While he ran a successful \nbusiness and employed hundreds of central Texans, his lasting legacy \nare his family's charitable contributions to Waco institutions, such as \nBaylor University, the Waco Mammoth National Monument, and Providence \nHealth Center.\n  F.M. was born on January 13, 1930, in Tours, Texas. After a series of \nmoves, the Young family settled in Speegleville, Texas, where F.M. \nattended local schools and met Gloria Davis, who later became his \nloving wife of over 60 years.\n  F.M. went into business with his brothers, R.T. and B.W., building \nstorage tanks for local farmers with surplus military equipment. In \n1948, the Young brothers created Waco's first asphalt plant and would \nbegin winning and working on State highway contracts in 1950. Over the \nnext 20 years, F.M. expanded the company to be one of the top five \nhighway contractors in Texas.\n  F.M. spent countless hours serving his local community and central \nTexas in a multitude of ways. He served on the board of the Waco Boys \nClub, the Waco Chamber of Commerce, and the Baylor/Waco Foundation. He \nand Gloria also had a rich history of donating to Waco institutions. \nThe Youngs provided concrete for the scoreboard at Baylor's Floyd Casey \nStadium, created a marina on the Brazos River for the Governor Bill and \nVara Daniel Historic Village, and designed and built the Brazos Queen \nII, a riverboat tourist attraction along the Brazos River.\n  In 2007, Providence Hospital opened the F.M. and Gloria Young Tower. \nThis facility, which was underwritten by a financial contribution from \nF.M. and Gloria, includes a five-story addition that provides bed space \nwith state-of-the-art cardiac clinics and care centers. The Youngs also \nplayed a vital role in the opening of the Waco Mammoth site, an \neducational tourist attraction, which was recently designated a \nnational monument by the National Park Service.\n  Mr. Speaker, F.M. Young worked tirelessly to better our central Texas \nand Waco communities. He is loved by his city, and certainly left an \nenduring impression on central Texas. He will be forever remembered as \na great philanthropist, businessman, husband, father, grandfather, and \nfriend.\n  My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to \nthe Young family. We also lift up the family and friends of F.M. Young \nin our prayers.\n  Today I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the \nUnited States Capitol to honor the life and legacy of F.M. Young.\n  As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our \ncountry during these difficult times, for our military men and women \nwho protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who \nprotect us here at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2883-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2883-H2884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HELP FIND OUR MISSING VETS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday in Hanoi, under a giant bronze \nstatue of Ho Chi Minh, the President of the United States announced \nthat he was formally rescinding our country's decades-long prohibition \non the sale of military equipment to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n  Without input from Congress, in one grand, unilateral action, the \nPresident decided to reward Vietnam for its egregious record on human \nrights and its continuing crackdown on religious freedoms. But worse \nthan that, he has surrendered a diplomatic opportunity to find out what \nhappened to the 1,500 Americans still unaccounted for in Vietnam and \nSoutheast Asia.\n  It was unfortunate to see where this President's priorities lie, but \nthere is still time to correct that wrong.\n  Before he leaves Vietnam, I have a message to the President, a \nmessage from the Rolling Thunder vets, Chapter\n\n[[Page H2884]]\n\n1, of South Carolina. They asked me to ask him this: Instead of using \nthis opportunity to reward Vietnam or to apologize for what he sees as \npast American wrongs, please, please, please, Mr. President, use this \ntime instead to do something productive and positive and patriotic--\nhelp find our missing vets and help bring them home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2884-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, May is National Foster Care Month when we \nrecognize the individuals who help America's children and youth who are \nin foster care find permanent homes and connections.\n  In North Carolina, it is hard to match the dedication of Boone \nresidents Sheri and Roger Church, who recently retired as foster \nparents after 20 years of providing a loving home to children in need.\n  Since 1994, the Churches have fostered 91 children. They have been \nrecognized on numerous occasions, locally and statewide, for \noutstanding service to children in foster care.\n  In 2003, Sheri was given the State's Caring Spirit Award. In 2014, \nthe couple was named Watauga County's Volunteers of the Year by the \nlocal Adult Services Coalition.\n  The Churches have had a lasting impact on their community and on the \nchildren who were entrusted to their care.

Mr. Speaker, the families I represent in Flint, Michigan, \nare still suffering from an ongoing water crisis that left their water \ntainted with lead and unsafe to drink.\n  When Americans face a humanitarian crisis, we come together to act, \nto provide them help. That has been our tradition. Those are our \nvalues, and, in Congress, that is our job.\n  For too long, the Republican-led House has not allowed a hearing, let \nalone a vote, on legislation that would provide that basic humanitarian \nrelief to 100,000 people in Flint, Michigan, who still cannot drink \ntheir water, who are still suffering from the effect of lead poisoning \nin their water by acts of its own State government.\n  The Families of Flint Act, legislation that I introduced, has over \n155 cosponsors. This bill at least warrants a hearing. There have been \ncommittee hearings on this question. There has been a lot of finger-\npointing, a lot of argument, a lot of sympathy from Members of \nCongress, but no action. Congress needs to do its job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2884-8", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMUNICATION FROM DISTRICT OFFICE MANAGER, THE HONORABLE CHAKA FATTAH, \n                           MEMBER OF CONGRESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from Dolores Ridley, District Office Manager, the \nHonorable Chaka Fattah, Member of Congress:\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                                     May 16, 2016.\n     Hon.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Walden) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Imagine that your child is missing. You know that she was abducted \nfrom a parking lot, but you don't know where she is now or how to find \nher. Grasping for any possible lead, you ask her cell phone carrier to \nprovide the location--and just the location--of her cell phone, hoping \nthat it will lead you to her, but you are told they don't release that \ninformation. So you wait. You rely on others to search for your child \nby foot and by air, never knowing if your child is alive or if your \nchild is dead, safe, or in pain.\n  This nightmare came true for Missey and Greg Smith 9 years ago last \nweek when their beloved daughter went missing outside Kansas City, \nKansas. By all accounts, Kelsey Smith--pictured here--was a vibrant and \njoyful 18-year-old girl.\n  She was preparing to attend college in the fall where she planned to \njoin in the marching band. Kelsey loved to sing. She was the third of \nfive siblings. Tragically, her life was cut short when she was \nkidnapped from a Target parking lot in June of 2007 just 9 days after \nher high school graduation, a crime caught on the store's security \ncameras.\n  Her family and her friends spent 4 anguished days searching for her, \nknowing she was in danger but unable to find her. They used every \nmethod they could think of to help locate her, but the one tool that \nwould eventually lead to finding her body was not accessible.\n  Kelsey's parents contacted her cell phone provider on the day she \nwent missing and asked them to ping her cell phone in the hopes that it \nwould assist them in their search. Despite repeated requests from the \nfamily and from law enforcement, it took 4 days before the Smiths were \nable to obtain the location data of Kelsey's cell phone--4 days, Mr. \nSpeaker, nearly 100 hours of not knowing where their little girl had \ngone, where she had been taken, or if they would ever see her again. \nYet, within 45 minutes of receiving that location data, when they \nfinally got it, Kelsey's body was found. She was dead.\n  When her mother testified in front of the Subcommittee on \nCommunications and Technology, she spoke so bravely of the agony \nKelsey's family endured during that time. She described their ordeal in \npainful detail. What does a parent go through when a child is missing? \nYou do not eat because you do not know if your child is eating. You do \nnot sleep because you wonder if your child is sleeping. It is, to quote \nMissey, ``pure hell.''\n  Missey and Greg Smith have made it their mission to prevent this type \nof tragedy from ever happening again. They began facilitating safety \nawareness seminars for parents and for students. They also began to \npush for legislation to address the very problem of obtaining timely \ncell phone location data--only location data, that is all we are \ntalking about here--and only during life-threatening emergencies--just \nlife-and-death situations and only locational data.\n  The legislation we are considering today, which is named in honor of \ntheir daughter, is a major step toward that goal. The Kelsey Smith Act \nrequires cell phone providers to provide law enforcement with access to \ndevice location data in an emergency situation, when a victim is in \ndanger of death or serious harm or when the device has been used to \nplace a 911 emergency call requesting emergency assistance.\n  This changes current law. You see, current law already permits \ncarriers to provide the data, but it does not require them to. This \nplaces an unreasonable burden on wireless providers to determine what \nconstitutes an emergency and then live with the consequences of their \ndecisions, which they now must do in the case of Kelsey Smith.\n  When time is of the essence, do you want a lawyer in corporate \nheadquarters to agonize over the legal definition of an ``emergency'' \nor do you want the law enforcement officers, who dedicate their lives \nto keeping us safe, to make that call? I opt for those who can save \nlives.\n  To date, versions of the Kelsey Smith Act have been adopted in 23 \nStates, but a patchwork of laws that protect some and leave others \nvulnerable is not good for the companies that must comply with this law \nor, more importantly, for the American lives that this law can and will \nsave.\n  You see, Mr. Speaker, the committee believes we need a consistent \nFederal law that law enforcement across the country can use. Parents \nshouldn't have to forum-shop for the most favorable law when their \nchildren go missing. What if it were your child?\n  I have heard the privacy concerns that some say have been raised by \nthis bill. We have worked diligently to make the bill as targeted as \npossible to balance legitimate privacy concerns with the importance of \nsaving lives. By limiting the circumstances in which it can be used \nand, most importantly, by limiting the information that is available, \nwe can ensure that it is only used\n\n[[Page H2886]]\n\nin cases in which it is absolutely necessary.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have heard from law enforcement officers across the \ncountry that, when people are in emergency situations, every second \ncounts, and that delay can mean the difference between life and death. \nThe Kelsey Smith Act takes the burden of decisionmaking away from cell \nphone providers and places it with law enforcement, who are trained \nspecifically to make this kind of determination.\n  The Kelsey Smith Act has been successfully used in multiple States \nwhere it is already law. In fact, in Kansas, we have an infant here \nnamed Aubrey. Aubrey was innocently in her car seat in a car, in the \nbackseat of the vehicle, when somebody carjacked the car while her \nparents were standing near it, just feet away.\n  Can you imagine? Her parents are right there, and somebody jumps in \nthe car and drives off with it as you stand hopelessly, unable to do \nanything as their little daughter, Aubrey, was inside.\n  The local police department used the Kelsey Smith Act in Kansas to \ntrack the cell phone that was still in the car, and they were able to \nsuccessfully recover the baby, Aubrey, who was unharmed, in about 30 \nminutes.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Officer Dan Friesen credited the safe recovery to the Kelsey Smith \nAct, saying that the ``technology is very helpful to us and is made \npossible by the Kelsey Smith Law.''\n  Thanks to Kelsey and Greg and Missey Smith, little Aubrey is safe in \nthe arms of her family once again. In the words of her mother: ``We are \nso happy to have Aubrey home with us and can't picture life without our \nbaby girl.'' Because of the Kelsey Smith Act, they do not have to.\n  Mr. Speaker, this law goes beyond just kidnapping cases, however. The \nKansas Sheriffs' Association told us it has also been used in cases of \nadults with dementia and missing people who are in danger due to lack \nof life-sustaining medication, severe weather, or other life-\nthreatening circumstances.\n  I thank my friend from Kansas, Congressman Kevin Yoder. He has been \ntireless in his advocacy for this legislation. He first brought this \nbill to my attention last Congress and continued to push for its \npassage again this year. He has been an advocate for Kelsey and her \nfamily throughout the process, and this bill would not have advanced \nthis far without Congressman Yoder's work.\n  I also want to thank Greg and Missey Smith, who are in the gallery \ntoday, for their courage in the face of their tragedy. Because of their \nwillingness to speak about their daughter and what happened to her, we \nare here today with the opportunity to prevent tragedies like this one \nthat befell Kelsey Smith.\n  Now, I think it is important to note this legislation passed out of \nthe subcommittee after full hearings and through the full committee. In \nfact, it was voted unanimously out of the full committee. There were no \nvoices of objection.\n  This Wednesday, May 25, is National Missing Children's Day. According \nto the FBI, in 2015, there were more than 460,000 reports of missing \nchildren made to law enforcement in the U.S. How many of these missing \nchildren carry a cell phone? Even if the Kelsey Smith Act leads to the \nrecovery of only one of those missing children, isn't it worth it? As a \nparent, I can tell you that, for the families of missing children, it \ncertainly is.\n  We have the opportunity to equip law enforcement with another tool to \naid them in emergency situations, a tool that costs nothing and uses \ninformation that already exists. Let's seize this opportunity.\n  Now, I know there will be those who will argue that somehow we didn't \ngo far enough in privacy. Well, guess what. My State of Oregon passed \nan almost identical bill, unanimously, and it is a very blue State, Mr. \nSpeaker--full Democratic house, Democratic senate, Democratic Governor. \nNot a single member objected. That is what this version of the bill is \nbased on.\n  Multiple other States have different reporting requirements for \nmembers of their law enforcement community. We honor what the States \nhave done and can do. We don't take that away. We don't override that. \nThey can go farther if they want in terms of what they want their State \nlaw enforcement officers to do or not do. We simply address the issue \nrelated to the telephone carriers and what they must do when called \nupon in life-and-death situations to save the lives of little girls \nlike Aubrey and like Kelsey.\n  Let's honor Kelsey's memory by ensuring that her lasting legacy isn't \nthe story of her death but, rather, the story of how she continued to \nmake a difference to save lives.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 4889.\n  I do want to say the Democrats continue to support the intention \nbehind this bill. What happened to Kelsey Smith is clearly a tragedy \nthat should not be allowed to happen again. Her family, who have \nadvocated for these changes in the law, deserve our respect and are \ntrue heroes. But we cannot support this effort to force the bill \nthrough without including the commonsense consumer protections that \nresulted from strong bipartisan work in the last Congress.\n  In the 113th Congress, the Committee on Energy and Commerce passed a \nversion of the Kelsey Smith Act, a version that included specific \nprotections for consumers' privacy closer in line with what is required \nunder the Fourth Amendment. The legislation was a negotiated outcome \nthat carefully balanced the needs of law enforcement on one hand with \nthe rights of consumers and privacy concerns on the other hand. These \nprotections would not have in any way slowed law enforcement's ability \nto find people in an emergency. They would simply have made sure that \nconsumers are protected after a search takes place. This was a good \ndeal. Unfortunately, the path taken in the current Congress was \ndifferent.\n  This year's bill, the one that we are debating now, disregards the \nhard work that went into finding a bipartisan agreement on the Kelsey \nSmith Act in the last Congress. During markups in the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, Democrats offered amendments that would modify H.R. \n4889 back to what was agreed to in the last Congress. It would have \nkept the requirement that carriers provide the requested information to \nlaw enforcement, but the amendment would have provided a simple \nconsumer safeguard. It would have required that law enforcement seek a \ncourt order within 48 hours after it makes an emergency request. So it \nwould in no way have stood in the way of an emergency request; it would \nhave just required law enforcement to seek that court order after the \nemergency request.\n  Such modifications would address some of the concerns that have been \nraised regarding the potential abuse of H.R. 4889. It would not hamper \nlaw enforcement's ability to have quick access to lifesaving location \ndata when they are presented with an emergency situation.\n  We recognize that Chairman Walden was concerned that he could not \nsupport last year's deal, the version from last Congress, because it \nwas not completely consistent with the law in his home State. That is \nwhy our proposal added a provision to protect existing State laws. \nUnfortunately, our efforts were rebuffed.\n  We continue to stand ready to work together again, but I cannot \nsupport this bill in its current form without ensuring that additional \nprotections are in place.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Kansas (Mr. Yoder), the proponent of this legislation \nwho brought it before us.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of \nKelsey Ann Smith of Overland Park, Kansas. I rise today on behalf of \nKelsey's Army, people all across the country who have put themselves in \nthe shoes of Greg and Missey, who have also had children who have been \nabducted and understand that we need commonsense public safety laws \nlike this on the books to ensure that we can save lives and ensure that \nthese types of abductions and murders never happen again in our country \nwithout the ability to stop them as quickly as possible.\n  June 6, 2016, will mark 9 years since Kelsey Smith, an 18-year-old \nShawnee\n\n[[Page H2887]]\n\nMission West student, was kidnapped in broad daylight from a Target \nparking lot by a predator who would sexually assault and murder her \nsoon after. I remember it like it was yesterday. We all, in Kansas and \nin my community, felt immediately associated with the grief and pain \nthat Kelsey's parents were feeling. Parents worried about their own \nchildren. They understood what was happening, and they wanted to help.\n\n  So Kansans and people in my community helped search for Kelsey for \ndays. As Chairman Walden so eloquently spoke in favor of this bill, it \nis an anguish to have your child be missing and you cannot do anything \nabout it.\n  Kelsey's mother, Missey, says that when your child is missing, as a \nparent you don't eat and as a parent you don't sleep because you don't \nknow if your child is eating or sleeping. I am a father of two little \ngirls. I cannot imagine the pain and suffering Missey and her husband, \nGreg, who are with us here today, have endured from Kelsey's loss. No \nparent should have to.\n  So today we are going to hear different debates and arguments about \nhow the bill could be changed or improved or differences could be made, \nbut the reality is this law is not on the books in 28 States, and those \nchildren are not protected. We cannot, as a House, allow this to stand.\n  So I ask my colleagues to dig deep in their heart to think about \nputting themselves in their shoes and to not block this legislation, to \nlet this legislation come forward. I promise you it is popular in your \ndistrict. I promise you a majority of Americans will support this. \nOpposing this bill is simply wrong and shameful.\n  In the 9 years since Greg and Missey's daughter was taken from them, \nthey have dealt with this unspeakable, horrific experience with grace \nand determination. Rather than falling into the depths of despair, like \nanyone could imagine them to do, they channeled their grief into the \npassion to help others who find themselves in Kelsey's situation. They \ntraveled the United States fighting to pass State-level versions of the \nbill we are considering today, and they have done so with great \nsuccess, with 23 States having passed a version of the Kelsey Smith \nAct.\n  Today, this body will have the chance to honor Kelsey's memory and \nGreg and Missey's tireless advocacy by bringing the law to all 50 \nStates. In the words of Missey Smith, we have the rare opportunity to \n``save lives without it costing one cent.''\n  The Kelsey Smith Act creates a narrow exception for law enforcement \nofficers to gain access to limited call location information of an \nindividual's cell phone in the event of an emergency, like a \nkidnapping. In those cases, every second counts.\n  Unfortunately, in Kelsey's case, it took 4 excruciating days for law \nenforcement to finally obtain the location data from her cell provider. \nIt took 4 days while an entire community searched for Kelsey with no \nsuccess. It took 4 days because, under current law, providers are not \nrequired to provide location data. They are permitted to in an \nemergency situation, but it is up to their discretion.\n  So the question for this body is: Do you want to leave this up to a \ncell phone provider, for the lawyers and the executives there to \ndecide, or do you want trained law enforcement making this decision \nbased upon a reasonable belief of an exigent emergency circumstance?\n  It is analogous; I think we all would agree. I think the folks on the \nopposite side of the aisle would agree that there is certainly a Fourth \nAmendment right to protect your home and your dwelling, probably the \ngreatest Fourth Amendment protection right of all. And yet, if an \nofficer was driving by and saw an exigent circumstance, saw someone who \nwas in jeopardy of physical harm or emergency, they have the ability to \nbreak into that home to save that life.\n  This information is even less secure. It is much more in the public \ndomain. A cell phone provider already has the right to release it. We \nare saying that decision should be made by law enforcement.\n  What breaks my heart every time I recount Kelsey's story is, when \nfinally her cell phone location information was handed over, police \nfound Kelsey's body within 45 minutes. A search that floundered for 4 \ndays could have ended in 45 minutes. We know for a fact, as Chairman \nWalden articulated, that other lives have already been saved in States \nthat have adopted this law.\n  Mr. Speaker, a Federal framework is needed to save lives across the \nentire country, not just in a patchwork of States that have adopted \nthis bill. It is up to this body to set that framework, which would be \na ceiling for State legislatures to follow. If certain States feel that \nadditional privacy protections, such as suggested by my colleagues \nacross the aisle, must be put into place, they are well within their \njurisdiction to do so.\n  I believe any concerns articulated by others are overblown in this \nsituation. As someone who has spent my career in this body fighting for \nthe privacy rights of Americans--we just passed the Email Privacy Act \n419-0, and all of us supported that--and fought to modernize our Fourth \nAmendment rights with regard to email privacy, I feel comfortable in \nsaying this bill strikes the right balance. It does not give you the \ninformation on the phone. It does not give you content. It does not \ngive you anything other than the pings on the phone in the case of an \nemergency. It doesn't even give you GPS tracking. It does not infringe \nupon our constitutional rights. Any of us, as parents, would be \nthankful that we voted for this bill today, should something horrific \nhappen in our lives.\n  Mr. Speaker, this body often debates the merits of protecting \nAmericans from the threat of harm versus giving up certain civil \nliberties. In this case, we are blessed with modern technology that \naffords law enforcement with a tool to save lives without Americans \ngiving up any of their privacy.\n  Now, I thank my predecessor, Representative Dennis Moore, and my \nformer colleague, Todd Tiahrt of Kansas, who began this effort shortly \nafter Kelsey's death. I also thank Representatives Lynn Jenkins, Mike \nPompeo of Kansas, and my colleague from across the aisle, Emanuel \nCleaver of Missouri, who have worked with me in this fight. I also \nthank Chairman Upton and Chairman Walden for working swiftly over the \nlast month to move this important legislation forward.\n  Most of all, I would like to thank the two most important people in \nthis room, who advocated for this bill day after day, Greg and Missey \nSmith. But for their support and guidance, for their ability to share \ntheir tragedy with the world and channel it into goodness, for being \nhere today and throughout the entire legislative process as we moved \nthis bill forward, this movement would not be possible. So God bless \nyou, Greg and Missey, and God bless Kelsey.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill's passage \ntoday. I strongly urge the Senate to waste no time in following suit. \nLet's send Kelsey's law to the President's desk this year for his \nsignature so we can do something truly meaningful in a bipartisan way \nand so we can save lives.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, let me say again that Democrats strongly \nsupport the intention behind this bill, but we cannot support it as it \nis currently drafted. We believe that we can do better.\n  I urge Members to vote ``no'' on H.R. 4889.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am, of course, disappointed that the Democrats cannot support this \nin its present form.\n  The bill that we worked on last year, by the way, never made it to \nthe House floor, and this one did.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  The time is now to act. The time is now to help families find \nabducted children, parents suffering from dementia who are carrying the \ndevice and need help saving their lives.\n  This is very narrowly written. As my colleague from Kansas (Mr. \nYoder) said: Read the bill.\n  We have. It is very narrowly written. Location, emergency only, life \nand death. You dialed 911 seeking help. States still have the ability \nto talk about all these other provisions they may want. We do not \npreclude that. We honor the right of States, local legislatures to come \nand add restrictions if they want to do that for post-action reporting, \nsubpoenas, whatever they want to do.\n\n[[Page H2888]]\n\n  But in the meantime, can't we just save lives? Can't we just pass \nsomething that gives certainty to the telecommunications providers that \nwhen they get that law enforcement call, they have to provide that data \nof simply the location when everybody agrees that somebody's life is in \nthe balance?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 4889, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2888-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2888-H2890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         KARI'S LAW ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. WALDEN.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4167, the Kari's Law Act of \n2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, when I first heard of the tragic story of Kari Hunt, I \nwas in disbelief. In his testimony before the Subcommittee on \nCommunications and Technology, Kari's father, Hank, shared with us the \nway that his daughter was killed--stabbed by her estranged husband in a \nTexas hotel room while their children were in the room.\n  While that story is obviously horrifying enough, especially as a \nparent, my true shock came from the next part of the story. Kari's 9-\nyear-old daughter, doing as she had been taught from an early age, had \nrepeatedly tried to dial 911 from the hotel phone to get emergency \nhelp. Repeatedly her little fingers pushed the buttons 9-1-1, but \nbecause the phone required another 9 to get an outside line, she was \nnever able to reach the emergency assistance her mother so desperately \nneeded and she so desperately tried to access.\n  What her grandfather, Hank Hunt, told me next will stay with me \nforever. He said that as he sat with his granddaughter in the lobby of \nthe police department just hours after the death of his daughter, his \ngranddaughter looked at him and said: ``I tried 4 times, Papa, but it \ndidn't work.'' ``I tried 4 times, Papa, but it didn't work.''\n  Through this tragedy we learned the difficult truth that many \nmultiline telephone systems, like the kinds often found in hotels and \noffices and universities, require that users dial an additional digit \nto use an outside line, even when they are trying to call 911.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is simply unacceptable. In the heat of an \nemergency, every person in America deserves the peace of mind to know \nthat on any phone 911 actually means 911, period.\n  We teach our children from a very young age what to do in an \nemergency: dial 911. We all hope that they will never need to use that \nknowledge, but we want them to know what to do. I don't know too many \nparents who also teach their kids to think about dialing 9 or 8 or some \nother number to get an outside line.\n  H.R. 4167, known as Kari's Law, seeks to remedy this problem. The \nlegislation requires multiline telephone systems to be configured so \nthat dialing 911 directly connects to public safety. In addition, the \nlaw requires that a central point of contact for each system be \nnotified when someone calls for emergency assistance, a provision \nintended to help emergency responders access buildings and actually \nlocate the emergency caller.\n  Now, these fixes are simple changes to the system in most cases, \ncosting little, if any, money, and taking very little time, but \napparently without a legal requirement, there is no way to guarantee \nthat every MLTS will be configured for dialing 911 directly. Some \nbusinesses, including many hotels, have taken steps to fix this problem \nalready, and I applaud them for doing so voluntarily, but there needs \nto be consistency across our great land, Mr. Speaker. If you are a \ntraveler staying in a hotel, you shouldn't have to wonder during an \nemergency whether you are in one of the States or counties that have \nadopted Kari's Law when the time comes for emergency help. We need a \nFederal law to provide certainty\n\n[[Page H2889]]\n\nand protect emergency callers when they dial 911.\n  I would like to thank Representative Louie Gohmert from Texas. Mr. \nGohmert brought this issue to our attention. He is the sponsor of \nKari's Law, and his staff has done a terrific job working with us on \nthis legislation.\n  I would also like to thank my colleague, Ranking Member Eshoo, and \nher staff for working closely with us to make this bill an even better \none.\n  Reflecting the way that these systems work and making sure the \nrequirements are strong and effective, I would also like to thank Hank \nHunt for bringing this issue to our attention, for pushing for change \nin the face of his family's tragedy, and for coming to Washington, \nD.C., to share his story.\n  I will finish my remarks with something else that Hank said before \nour subcommittee: ``The inspiration for Kari's Law was a 9-year-old \nlittle girl that depended on her instruction from adults on how to \nhandle an emergency, and those adults let her down.''\n  Mr. Speaker, let's not let her down or any other child again. I urge \nmy colleagues to support Kari's Law, and in doing so, we can take one \nstep forward in ensuring that anyone, regardless of their age, who \ndials 911 will receive the emergency assistance they need.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in general support of H.R. 4167. I agree that it is important \nto make sure that consumers using multiline telephone systems, or \nMLTSs, can directly dial 911 without having to dial additional digits \nfirst. We are talking about the multiline phone systems that we use in \nlarge office buildings and hotels. Many of these systems require \nconsumers to dial an extra 9 to get an outside line. Most of us know \nthat, but too many people do not realize this applies to 911 also. If \nyou don't dial 9 first, you can't reach emergency services.\n  Such a requirement led to a tragedy in Texas several years ago. Kari \nDunn was killed while her 9-year-old daughter tried to call for help. \nShe did what she was told to do in an emergency--dial 911--but because \nthe system she was using required her to dial 9 first, she only heard \nsilence at the other end.\n\n  Building on the Herculean effort of Kari Dunn's family, we are one \nstep closer to fixing this problem once and for all. Kari's Law is an \nimportant step to making our systems work better in an emergency, but \nwe should not delay taking the next step, and that is providing \nlocation information to first responders.\n  These multiline systems often fail to deliver precise location \ninformation. That means that if someone calls 911 from this very \nbuilding, for instance, precious minutes would tick by as emergency \npersonnel struggle to figure out where the call came from in the \nCapitol. We should act immediately to correct this problem, too, \nbecause making sure the call goes through is only helpful if public \nsafety officials can find the caller.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why Democrats had hoped to include such a \nprovision in H.R. 4167 during markup. We are encouraged by the \ncommitment we received from Subcommittee Chairman Walden to work \ntogether on a separate bill to address this concern. We hope to get \nthis done soon. With that commitment, I urge Members to support H.R. \n4167.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), who has been such an advocate for \nthis family and for this change in law and has been terrific to work \nwith on this matter.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Greg Walden and also his \nstaff. They have been superb to work with, and it has been refreshing \nto see how thorough both he and his staff have been in researching this \nissue. I came prepared to talk about the event and actually how it \nhappened, but Chairman Walden did such a fantastic job that the emotion \nruns high at this point, and I am very grateful for the manner in which \nthis has been presented.\n  I also want to thank FCC Commissioner Pai, who in the early days \nstepped up and made this an issue to get people's attention, but no \ngreater thanks goes to anyone than to Kari's father, Hank Hunt.\n  It was December of 2013 in Marshall, Texas, which is normally known \nfor being a kind and helpful city. Police respond often in 1 or 2 \nminutes. Kari's 9-year-old daughter has not had her name mentioned \nanywhere, to my knowledge, and that is because this child did \neverything she could possibly do, everything she had been taught and \ntrained to do. What a phenomenal, quick-thinking child that she is.\n  After Kari's death received an outpouring of comments from \nconstituents and other Americans across the country expressing concern \nover the issue, every day this is an issue. Fortunately, every day \nsomeone does not pay the ultimate consequence of dying because it is an \nissue.\n  When we looked into this matter, multiline telephone systems can \neasily be configured or reconfigured to enable callers to reach \nemergency personnel by dialing 911 without having to dial a prefix at \nall. Most of the time these changes can be made at no cost, and we have \nhad programmers inform us that they have been doing it at no charge \nonce the issue was brought to their attention.\n  Some MLTS vendors have offered to upgrade or tune up their existing \nsystems for free also. Additionally, the American Hotel & Lodging \nAssociation has worked aggressively with its members across the country \nto swiftly ensure that their systems in place allow guests to directly \ndial 911 from guest rooms. Most of the American Hotel & Lodging \nAssociation's largest hotel member chains have activated 911 direct \ndial access at nearly all of their owned and managed properties. This \nbill gives 2 years for those who have not done so. And in view of the \nfact that this is so widely public, I anticipate people will move much, \nmuch more quickly than 2 years.\n  It is quite refreshing when both sides of the aisle can come together \non an issue that saves lives, does not cost anything from taxpayers, is \nnot a mandate that needs funding, and clearly involves interstate \ncommerce and the telecommunications industry. So anyone who dials 911 \nwould reach emergency personnel even if the phone normally requires the \nuser to dial a prefix. Many phones in hotels, offices, even schools \ndon't reach emergency personnel when a user dials 911 in a time of need \nbecause the person failed to dial a prefix. This bill changes that for \ngood.\n  I join Hank Hunt, and I thank full committee Ranking Member Pallone, \nMs. Eshoo, and, again, Chairman Walden, Chairman Upton, and the staffs \nfor the great work done here. We can avoid tragedy again, and it is \njust refreshing when we work together to make sure that happens.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4167, Kari's \nLaw, and, again, thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for his \nleadership on this issue and my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle for working with us on this.\n  I would encourage passage of the legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 4167, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a \nquorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n  The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.\n\n[[Page H2890]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2890-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2890-H2891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n              SECURING ACCESS TO NETWORKS IN DISASTERS ACT\n\n  Mr. WALDEN.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in late October of 2012, Superstorm Sandy, the largest \nAtlantic hurricane in recorded history, hit the Caribbean and \nNortheastern United States with devastating impact. Sandy caused an \nestimated $72 billion in damages in the United States and took 286 \nlives.\n  While the economic impact of the storm was massive in scope--homes \nand buildings damaged or destroyed, roads impassible or washed out \naltogether--the damage to power and communications infrastructure was \nparticularly severe.\n  Broadcasting, wireless and landline telephone services, broadband \nservices, cable services all suffered disruptions and outages that \nlasted long after the storm's fury had passed. At a time when families \nstruggled to find and reunite with loved ones, this only added to the \nconfusion and, frankly, the panic.\n  But beyond the impact on the personal communications that are needed \nto assuage the fears in the wake of a disaster, these outages also \nthreatened the delivery of public safety messages and emergency \nresponse services. This put even more lives at risk, including those of \nthe first responders--the men and women who race to save others--and \nmade recovery that much more difficult.\n  While our public safety and emergency response experts at all levels \nof government and the communications industry have implemented changes \nas a result of the lessons learned from Superstorm Sandy, there is more \nthat must be done.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the wireless industry--CTIA, together with \nAT, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon--announced the \nadoption of the Wireless Network Resiliency Cooperative Framework. This \nset of voluntary practices will provide consumers with access to \nwireless services even when their wireless provider's network goes \ndown, will improve preparedness, and will speed the restoration of \nservices.\n  I would like to thank Ranking Member Pallone of New Jersey, whose \ndistrict suffered so badly and so much from the effects of Sandy. His \nleadership and efforts led to the industry's voluntary adoption of this \nframework, and I commend the industry for its commitment and him for \nhis work.\n  The SANDy Act lets us build on that accomplishment, as there are some \nchanges that only the government can make. This legislation makes what \nI believe is a commonsense change to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \nRelief and Emergency Assistance Act to recognize not only wireline, but \nmobile telephone service and broadcast radio, broadcast television, \ncable service, and broadcast satellite service as essential services \nwhen we have an emergency.\n  This change will ensure that providers of these critical services are \nnot denied or impeded access to a disaster when they are trying to \nrestore service. Without question, these services are critical to \nensuring the safety and well-being of both those impacted by the \ndisaster, but also those who are responding to that very disaster.\n  In addition to expediting access for network restoration teams, this \nlegislation also directs the FCC to study making the telecommunications \nservice provider-owned WiFi access and other communications \ntechnologies operating on unlicensed spectrum available to access 911 \nservice when commercial mobile service is unavailable.\n  We have an abundance of communications tools in the modern \ninformation economy. We should be looking at ways to leverage all of \nthem during emergencies, and this report will do just that.\n  I thank the ranking member for his work on this legislation, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of \n           Representatives,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2016.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3998, Securing Access to \nNetworks in Disasters, or SANDy, Act.\n  Superstorm Sandy had a dramatic effect on my district back in New \nJersey. We saw firsthand the importance of communications networks \nduring an emergency.\n  Broadcast and cable networks provide critical information to help us \nstay out of harm's way, and telecommunications networks are what makes \nsure we can call for help and keep track of our loved ones.\n  Unfortunately, when Hurricane Sandy ripped through the Northeast, we \ncould not rely on several of these systems when we needed them most. \nFor instance, nearly one in four cell towers were knocked out. In some \nof the hardest hit areas of my State, as many as half of the towers \nwent down. Many of them stayed down for weeks.\n  That is why I have spent the past several years figuring out what \nwent right and what went wrong. We learned about issues that have \nplagued our networks for at least a decade--not just during Sandy, but \nduring Hurricane Katrina and other major disasters as well.\n  The SANDy Act will take another step toward making that right. \nSpecifically, the SANDy Act would recognize the important role that \nwireline and mobile telephone, Internet, radio and television \nbroadcasting, and cable and satellite services play during emergencies.\n  These communication providers need priority access to help them \nrepair and maintain their communications equipment during disasters. \nBut this bill is part of a larger effort to keep us safe in \nemergencies.\n  As part of the lead-up to today, I worked, as my colleague said, with \nthe Nation's largest wireless carriers and the Federal Communications \nCommission to pull together a voluntary framework to ensure the \nindustry complies with the wireless provisions that were originally set \nforth in the SANDy Act.\n  Most important, the framework makes sure that if one network goes \ndown, its customers can access another network that is still \noperational. Everyone should be able to call for help as long as any \nsignal is available.\n  Mr. Speaker, this agreement will save lives during major emergencies \nin the future. I would like to thank the wireless carriers and the FCC \nfor working with me to craft this comprehensive agreement, as well as \nChairman Walden. Having these networks operational can mean the \ndifference between life and death during an event like Superstorm \nSandy.\n  I urge all Members to support H.R. 3998, and I hope that once it \npasses the House today, the Senate will take up the measure and send it \nto the President.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a fine piece of legislation. It is important, in \nmoving ahead, to correct some things that need to be corrected, \nfrankly, in terms of emergency communications during super emergencies.\n  I urge passage of the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3998, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Walden) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Federal Communications Commission regulates an \nincredibly dynamic and innovative sector of the American economy. The \ncommunications technology sector directly impacts the lives of \nconsumers in meaningful ways. Consumers are able to map their ways to \nnew places like, frankly, I did this morning; find information and \nenriching content; and reach their loved ones who might live in the \nmost remote places.\n  Communications technology also enables other industries to reach \ntheir audiences in new and life-changing ways. Health care, finance, \nmanufacturing, agriculture: all of these industries are leveraging \ncommunication technologies in ways to better serve the American \nconsumer.\n  We can't afford to allow this functional sector of the economy to \nlanguish or fail under outdated regulations or a faulty regulatory \nprocess. That is why the Committee on Energy and Commerce has focused \non improving the process at the FCC so that it operates in an effective \nand more transparent manner.\n  This House passed a comprehensive FCC process reform bill back in \nNovember, H.R. 2583, but we continue to work on improving the FCC's \ncommunications with the public. Hence, H.R. 2589. This is one such \nimprovement.\n  Sponsored by my colleague, Representative Ellmers of North Carolina, \nthis bill is targeted at the FCC's struggle to make its newly adopted \nrules available to the public in a timely fashion. The bill requires \nthe FCC to show the public what it has just voted on by publishing the \ntext of the rules within 24 hours of the filing of the last dissenting \nstatement.\n  This should not be too difficult. Normally, the FCC does a reasonable \njob in\n\n[[Page H2892]]\n\npublishing its new rules fairly quickly after adoption. However, on \nmore controversial items, the documents are not available until much \nlater. For example, the Lifeline Order, adopted on March 31, was not \navailable for 27 days. That is nearly a month. The FCC should not be \ndelaying publication on controversial items. It should seek to add \ninformation and facts to the debate rather than appearing to hide the \nball.\n  At the same time, we recognize that the FCC must have the ability to \nrespond to dissenting statements that criticize its decisions. \nAccordingly, we worked with our colleagues across the aisle to ensure \nthat the Commission had a fair opportunity to address dissents to \ndissents and still make sure that new rules became available to the \npublic in a timely way. In other words, so the Commission can do its \nwork back and forth among Commissioners and finish their product. But \nonce they do, they need to make it available to the public. By the way, \nthat is who they work for.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their work, \nparticularly Representative Ellmers and Representative McNerney. I \nbelieve the bill strikes the right balance, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport Representative Ellmers' bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2589.\n  For the past several years, Republicans have been focused on changing \nprocedures at the Federal Communications Commission. The bill we are \nconsidering today demonstrates that Democrats are willing to work with \nRepublicans on these ideas when the proposals are reasonable.\n  The original bill had some issues. It would have required the FCC to \npost within 24 hours of adoption any final rules that were modified by \nthe Commission. Such a requirement was inconsistent with the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, which requires that any rule changes are \naccompanied by an explanatory text.\n  Additionally, the original bill failed to take into account the fact \nthat in many cases where there is a delay in the release of FCC \ndecisions, it is usually due to late receipt of dissenting statements \nfrom some Commissioners. To fix these issues, Democrats proposed an \namendment during markup to provide the FCC to post, in its entirety, \nthe text of any actions within 24 hours after dissenting Commissioners \nfile their statements. The improvements ensure that this bill will not \nforce the FCC to act in conflict with other laws, such as the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this fine piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Brooks of Alabama). The question is on \nthe motion offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) that the \nHouse suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2589, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a \nquorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n  The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2892-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2892-H2894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1500\n          ALABAMA HILLS NATIONAL SCENIC AREA ESTABLISHMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. COOK.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n\n[[Page H2894]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am the author of H.R. 469, which establishes the Alabama Hills \nNational Scenic Area, encompassing roughly 18,000 acres of Federal land \nin central California, to preserve recreational and other existing uses \nin the area.\n  The Alabama Hills are a range of hills and rock formations near the \neastern slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and are used for a variety \nof recreational activities.\n  The area has also served as a popular filming location for films and \ntelevision shows. ``The Gene Autry Show,'' ``The Lone Ranger,'' \n``Bonanza,'' and films including ``Tremors,'' ``Gladiator,'' and ``Iron \nMan'' were filmed, in part, in the Alabama Hills area.\n  The goal of this legislation is protecting this area from the \nindustrial-scale renewable energy development that is occurring in \nsurrounding areas while also protecting existing uses.\n  The Alabama Hills Stewardship Group as well as off-road groups, the \nlocal chamber of commerce, local and national conservation groups, and \nmany others coordinated for over 2 years to share ideas that ultimately \nformed the basis of H.R. 496.\n  In addition to the National Scenic Area designation, the bill \npreserves existing recreational and commercial uses of the area, \nincluding grazing, filming, hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, \nhunting, fishing, and authorized off-highway vehicle use.\n  This is a commonsense bill that will successfully balance a wide \nrange of Federal land uses within the National Scenic Area and has \nextensive local support.\n  This legislation is the culmination of the work of countless local \ngroups and individuals. I would especially like to thank Inyo County \nSupervisor Matt Kingsley and Kevin Mazzu of the Alabama Hills \nStewardship Group for their tireless efforts to make the Alabama Hills \nNational Scenic Area a reality.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Congressman Cook, a fellow \nMarine, for crafting this bill before us.\n  H.R. 496 establishes the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area on \napproximately 18,000 acres of Federal land in southern California.\n  Only a few hours' drive from Hollywood, Alabama Hills features a \nunique collection of rock formations which attracted filmmakers for a \ndecade, as the gentleman has told us. The area's unusual landscape has \nserved as the backdrop for famous television and movie scenes, \nincluding ``Bonanza'' and even now great movies like ``Iron Man.''\n  By incorporating the area into BLM's National Conservation Lands, the \nestablishment of the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area will promote \npermanent protection of the area and encourage tourism and recreational \nactivities.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill provides a model for responsible conservation \nthat we should seek to emulate across the country.\n  There are areas of Federal land throughout the United States that \ndeserve enhanced protection. I hope we can continue to work in a \nbipartisan manner to preserve them for future generations through \nlocally driven conservation initiatives.\n  For now, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I look forward to \nworking with the majority to identify additional opportunities to \nprotect public land.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.\n  I want to thank my colleague for the Marine tag team comment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Cook) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 496, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2894-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2894-H2896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN'S SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. COOK.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of S. 184, the Native American Children's \nSafety Act, which amends the Indian Child Protection and Family \nViolence Prevention Act.\n  The bill requires tribal Social Service agencies to perform character \nbackground investigations of all foster care parents and adults living \nin foster care homes prior to placement of an Indian child into a \nfoster home.\n  This bill creates a framework by which tribes must conduct thorough \nbackground checks of individuals who reside in or are employed by a \nfoster home or institution in which tribal foster placements are made.\n  The bill would protect Indian foster children from being placed if \nthe background check reveals a conviction by a Federal, State, or \ntribal court of felony child abuse, neglect, or crimes against \nchildren.\n  S. 184 is the companion to H.R. 1168, sponsored by the gentleman from \nNorth Dakota (Mr. Cramer). H.R. 1168 passed the House of \nRepresentatives by voice vote on June 1, 2015.\n  These bills are the culmination of years of work led by Mr. Cramer as \nhe and his colleagues in the North Dakota delegation worked to address \na very sad child abuse problem plaguing an Indian reservation in his \nState.\n  Passage of S. 184 is a critical first step toward ensuring that \nIndian children are placed in safe, secure, and loving homes within \ntheir tribal communities.\n  Again, I would like to thank my good friend, the gentleman from North \nDakota (Mr. Cramer), for his hard work on this important issue.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote on S. 184.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of the challenges that Native children \nface when it comes to their health, safety, and security. For example, \nNative children are 2.1 times more likely than other American children \nto end up in foster care. They are also 2.5 times more likely to become \nvictims of abuse or neglect.\n  The Native American Children's Safety Act will help to address these \ndisparities by strengthening background checks for prospective foster \ncare parents prior to placement. In addition, the legislation will \nensure that Federal and tribal agencies conduct these checks in a \nuniform manner.\n  The House previously passed an identical bill, H.R. 1168, introduced \nby our colleague from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), and it is critical \nthat we pass the Senate version as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are many troubling issues that we in Congress must \naddress in order to reverse the alarming trends that we see today in \nthe health, safety, and well-being of Native children.\n  These kids deserve far more of our time and our attention; yet, for \ntoo long their needs have been neglected by this body.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I call on Congress to reverse this pattern of \nneglect and to start passing legislation like the bill before us today \nthat will help protect and provide for our Native children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senators Hoeven and Tester for \nintroducing and moving the Native American Children's Safety Act \nthrough the Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with me in support of S. 184 and in \nsupport of our Native children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the author of the House \ncompanion bill.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank now my two favorite marines. That \nwas very nice. Thanks to both of them.\n  Last Congress, in the Natural Resources Committee, we actually had an \noversight hearing regarding the child protection crisis on the Spirit \nLake Indian Reservation in my State of North Dakota in response to \nnumerous child deaths and whistleblower reports detailing unsafe tribal \nplacement of almost 40 foster children in abusive homes, many of these \nhomes that were headed by convicted sex offenders.\n  In an effort to protect these children, I did introduce the Native \nAmerican Children's Safety Act in the House, which is a companion bill, \nas noted by previous speakers, that was introduced in the Senate by \nSenator Hoeven and Senator Tester.\n  Both bills passed their respective Chambers without objection. Today \nI am asking my colleagues here in the House to join me in passing the \nSenate bill so that we can get it to the President for his quick \nsignature.\n  As stated, the bill implements across-the-board minimum protections \nfor children placed in foster care at the direction of a tribal court. \nAnd, yes, the statistics are stark. Native American children are 2.5 \ntimes more likely to be victims of abuse or neglect than other American \nchildren.\n\n[[Page H2896]]\n\n  But, Mr. Speaker, children exposed to violence are also more likely \nto abuse drugs and alcohol. They are more likely to suffer from \ndepression and anxiety and other post-traumatic disorders.\n  The standards in this bill mirror existing national requirements for \nnon-tribal foster care placements, ensuring that tribal children \nreceive care at least equal to that in the protections afforded non-\ntribal children.\n  It is bipartisan, as you can tell. It is noncontroversial, as you can \ntell. It was reported out of the Natural Resources Committee by \nunanimous consent both this Congress and the last Congress.\n  But I want to add this word of thanks to other folks who were very \nhelpful. I want to thank the National Indian Child Welfare Association, \nthe National Congress of American Indians, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, and the Department of Health and Human Services, all of whom \nprovided insights and suggestions for this bill.\n  Their counsel proved valuable in providing the flexibility to the \ntribes without hampering, stepping on their sovereignty, so that they \ncould transition to these uniform standards and help save perhaps many, \nmany lives on our reservations.\n  I thank my colleagues. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Nunes) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes).\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous material on the bill, H.R. 5077.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Passing an annual intelligence authorization bill is the most \nimportant tool Congress has to conduct effective oversight of the \nintelligence activities of the U.S. Government. Today, Ranking Member \nSchiff and I are bringing the seventh consecutive intelligence\n\n[[Page H2902]]\n\nauthorization bill to the floor. I am pleased to say that, as in past \nyears, this bill is a bipartisan product that reflects the \ncontributions of all of the committee's members. It was reported out of \nthe committee by a unanimous voice vote.\n  Because most of the intelligence budget involves highly classified \nprograms, the bulk of the committee's schedule of authorization and \ndirection are found in the classified annex to the bill. The classified \nannex has been available in HVC-304 for all Members to review since \nFriday, April 29.\n  At the unclassified level, I can report that the overall funding \nauthorized by this bill is slightly above the President's budget \nrequest, but still below last year's enacted level. The overall funding \nis also consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Furthermore, \nthe bill funds the Military Intelligence Program in line with the \nlevels of the House-passed National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2017.\n  The bill funds high-priority initiatives not included in the \nPresident's request, trims requested increases that lack clear \njustifications, and reflects the committee's determinations of which \nprograms represent the best value for intelligence dollars in a \nchallenging budget environment.\n  Mr. Speaker, today the threat level facing America is higher than at \nany time since 9/11. ISIL has established safe havens in Syria, Iraq, \nand Libya, and the group hopes to create caliphates stretching from \nLebanon to Iraq, including Jordan and Israel. The goal of our \ncounterterrorism strategy should be to deny safe havens from which \nterrorists can plot attacks against the United States and our allies. \nRegrettably, we have not prevented ISIL from establishing a safe haven, \nand the group has become skilled at hiding from Western intelligence \nservices. ISIL members have used that breathing room to plan attacks in \nEurope, North Africa, and the Middle East, and they are undoubtedly \nplanning attacks against the homeland here in the United States.\n  This bill will ensure that the dedicated men and women of our \nintelligence community have the funding, authorities, and support they \nneed to carry out their mission and to keep us safe.\n  Before closing, I want to take a moment to thank the men and women of \nthis country who serve in our intelligence community. I am honored to \nget to know so many of them in the course of the committee's oversight \nwork.\n  I would like to thank all of the committee's members--majority and \nminority--for their contributions to our oversight over the past year, \nand especially our subcommittee chairmen and ranking members for their \nexpertise on the programs within their subcommittees' jurisdiction. The \nmany hearings, briefings, and oversight visits our members carry out \nduring the year provide the inputs for the authorization and direction \nin this annual bill.\n  I would also like to thank the staff of the committee for their hard \nwork on the bill and for their daily oversight of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  In particular, I would like to thank Shannon Stuart, Nick Ciarlante, \nScott Glabe, Bill Flanigan, Lisa Major, Geof Kahn, Chelsey Campbell, \nAndrew House, Doug Presley, Steve Keith, George Pappas, Jack Langer, \nCrystal Weeks, Jake Crisp, and Diane Rinaldo. I would also like to \nthank our two fellows from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Alex \nKent and Philip Tubesing. All of these staff members spent long hours \nworking on the legislative text and its classified annex, and the bill \nis stronger for it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 5077, as amended.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Homeland Security,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 2016.\n     Hon. Devin Nunes,\n     Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Nunes: I am writing to you concerning the \n     jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Homeland Security \n     in H.R. 5077, the ``Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2016.'' The bill includes provisions that fall within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security.\n       I recognize and appreciate the desire to bring this \n     legislation before the House of Representatives in an \n     expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on \n     Homeland Security will forego action on this bill. However, \n     this is conditional based on our mutual understanding that \n     foregoing consideration of H.R. 5077 at this time does not \n     prejudice this Committee with respect to the appointment of \n     conferees or any fixture jurisdictional claim over the \n     subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation.\n       This waiver is also given with the understanding that the \n     Committee on Homeland Security expressly reserves its \n     authority to seek conferees on any provision within its \n     jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference that may be \n     convened on this or any similar legislation, and requests \n     your support for such a request.\n       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding with respect to H.R. 5077, and ask that a \n     copy of this letter and your response be included in the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the \n     House floor. I look forward to working with the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence as this bill moves through \n     the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T. McCaul,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n         House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on \n           Intelligence, Washington, DC, May 23, 2016.\n     Hon. Michael McCaul,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 5077, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2017. As you noted, certain provisions of the bill are \n     related to the jurisdictional interests of the Committee on \n     Homeland Security. I agree that your letter in no way \n     diminishes or alters the jurisdiction of the Committee on the \n     Homeland Security with respect to the appointment of \n     conferees or any future jurisdictional claim over the subject \n     matters contained in the bill or any similar legislation.\n       I appreciate your willingness to assist in expediting this \n     legislation for floor consideration. I will include a copy of \n     your letter and this response in the Congressional Record \n     during consideration of the legislation on the House floor. \n     Thank you for your assistance with this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Devin Nunes,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, I would like to thank Chairman Nunes, who has once again \nproven an invaluable partner on the Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 is the fourth \nmajor piece of bipartisan legislation that we advanced together in less \nthan 18 months. That is no small feat. Working together, we have proven \nyet again what this body can achieve when the country's interests are \nput first: solving real problems for each and every American, as well \nas for people around the world; supporting the men and women of the \nlargest and most capable intelligence community--who work day and night \nto keep us safe--while ensuring strict oversight of even the most \nhighly classified activities.\n  Chairman Nunes and I do not agree on everything, nor should we. We \nhave different perspectives and speak for an even broader group of \nRepresentatives in the body as a whole. There are provisions I wish had \nbeen in this bill and some I wish were not in the bill. I know my \nmajority colleagues feel the same way about other provisions. I also \nbelieve we could have done this bill under a more open rule. But \nbecause we all rolled up our sleeves and worked together, the bill \nbefore us today is an exceptional work product, and I am very proud to \nsupport it.\n  It is also an honest bill. There are no budget gimmicks to evade \nspending commitments. While the bill contains a classified annex and \nschedule of authorizations, each and every page has been available, and \nwill remain available, to every Member for review.\n  This bill also reaffirms one of my core convictions, borne out by the \nother three bills our committee has passed: that privacy and security \ncan and must coexist.\n  The bill funds and authorizes vital programs and activities of the \nU.S. intelligence community, including the Department of Defense \nintelligence elements. At the same time, the IAA's several hundred \npages provide detailed guidance, strict authorization, and clear \nlimitations on the IC's activities.\n  Turning to more specifics, this year's IAA authorizes intelligence \nfunding nearly equivalent to the President's budget request, which is \nabout the same level as fiscal year 2016's enacted budget level. The \nbase budget authorization is nearly equal to the President's request, \nand the overseas contingency operations authorization is roughly 1.5 \npercent above the request.\n\n[[Page H2903]]\n\n  The bill trims some unnecessary funding and reprioritizes resource \nallocations, adds money to underfunded programs, and provides \ncongressional direction to ensure greater accountability, transparency, \nand efficiency within the IC. It also fences, or restricts the spending \nof, significant amounts of money to better ensure continuous IC \naccountability throughout the year.\n  The IAA also addresses the key strategic questions that we have been \nasking over the course of the year: First, are we focusing too much on \nthe threats of the day at the expense of the threats of tomorrow?\n  We do not have the luxury of choosing our challenges. Over the years, \nwe have spent significant resources on counterterrorism priorities in \nthe Middle East and South Asia, and, of course, we must continue to \nfocus on counterterrorism, particularly with the enduring threat of \nISIL.\n  But at the same time, we cannot disregard our near-peer competitors, \nsuch as China and Russia, whose increasing adventurism challenges our \ninterests and influence abroad and threatens our allies and partners. I \nam pleased this year's IAA strikes a better balance between the near-\nterm threats and longer term challenges that we face.\n  Second, are we sufficiently protecting what we currently have, \nwhether in space, at sea, or in the cyber realm?\n  Our space, cyber, and sea assets are the most advanced in the world, \nbut unless we are careful, they will become increasingly vulnerable. To \nbetter secure them, this bill wisely invests in cyber and supply chain \nsecurity, as well as in resilience and other means of protection.\n  Third, are we leveraging commercial products and services while, at \nthe same time, making investments in revolutionary technologies that do \nnot yet have commercial application?\n  We have the world's most productive and innovative private sector, \nparticularly when it comes to space. We must leverage and support it \nwherever we can, which I am pleased the IAA does. At the same time, \nthis bill recognizes that government must invest in the most advanced, \ngame-changing technologies that do not yet have a market.\n  Fourth, are we recruiting, training, and developing the most \neffective and diverse workforce, as well as leveraging foreign \nintelligence relationships and building foreign partner capacity?\n  The U.S. has the most advanced, capable, and reliable intelligence \ncommunity in the world. Wherever I travel, I am continually impressed \nand inspired when I meet these brave and talented women and men. This \nbill identifies ways to further support and improve the workforce by \nexpanding diversity in the IC, promoting travel, and supporting \nlanguage training. It also provides critical support to build the \ncapacity of foreign partner services and does so strategically, in a \nway that helps ensure the utmost professionalism and respect for the \nrule of law.\n  As is the case in nearly all legislation, as I mentioned at the \noutset, this bill is not perfect.\n  For years, I have pushed the administration and Congress to support \nthe publication of an annual report on the number of combatants and \nnoncombatants killed in lethal strikes. Despite our best efforts to \nensure to a near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured, \nsometimes strikes do result in civilian casualties, and it is important \nthat we acknowledge these accidents, learn from them, and be open about \nthem. At the same time, greater transparency can help narrow the \nperception gap between what really happens and what is reported or sent \nout as propaganda.\n  Soon, the administration will release the first accountability report \non noncombatant casualties and injuries. This is a good thing. But I \nalso believe that there is a value and a statutory requirement to make \nthis executive action permanent, ensuring that our commitment to \ntransparency extends beyond the term of the current administration. \nThis is an issue that I believe the IAA or NDAA should have addressed, \nand I will continue to work with my colleagues to push for this change \nto be codified into law.\n  As I said at the outset, this bill is truly bipartisan, carefully \nrefined, and an honest effort to secure our Nation while safeguarding \nprivacy and civil liberties. I am proud to support this year's \nIntelligence Authorization Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Once again, I want to thank Chairman Nunes and all of the members of \nHPSCI. I look forward to working with the Senate, the administration, \nand with all my colleagues throughout the remainder of this Congress to \nfurther improve the bill as it progresses to the President's desk.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Stewart).\n  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for allowing me to \nspeak in support of the Intelligence Authorization Act.\n  Fifteen years or so ago, I was piloting the B-1, which is one of the \nmost sophisticated aircraft or weapons systems ever developed. At the \ntime, I was preparing to take on the global threats that we were \ndealing with, but I was reminded that we live in a dangerous world and \nthat the fundamental responsibility of the Federal Government is to \nprotect Americans and to provide for our mutual defense.\n  In the many years since then, I would argue that our Nation faces \neven greater threats than those I faced during the times that I flew in \nthe Air Force.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Russia is, again, increasing its role in Eurasia through formulating \nstrategic partnerships, co-opting local officials, and utilizing its \nmilitary to establish strongholds in ways we really haven't seen since \nthe height of the cold war.\n  China has dramatically expanded its militaristic sphere in the South \nChina Sea and in other locations.\n  Rogue states like Iran and North Korea continue to develop and expand \ntheir weapons of mass destruction programs.\n  And, of course, there is always the Middle East, a thing that we \noften think about and that we spend so much time worrying about, that \nrequires so much of our resources.\n  It is only through the intelligence community that we are able to \nidentify and then respond to these threats. In fact, as we all know, \njust yesterday we learned of a U.S. air strike that killed Mullah \nMansoor, the head of the Taliban. Successful operations like this are \nmade possible because of the great work of our intelligence community.\n  That is why we must pass the Intelligence Authorization Act. This \nbill continues to authorize critical national security programs at a \ntime when we face the most significant threat levels since World War \nII.\n  In my travels around the world, I have this great blessing of working \nwith members from the intelligence community. I see what they do is \ndangerous. It is exhausting. It is the dirty work down in the trenches, \nbut it is critical to our national security.\n  That is why I ask my colleagues to join with me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Swalwell), who is one of our subcommittee ranking \nmembers.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank my esteemed \ncolleague, the ranking member from California, for yielding the time \ntoday, and for leading and presiding on our side over this bill.\n  I would also like to thank the staff on both sides for their hard \nwork on this year's Intelligence Authorization Act, or the IAA.\n  I also appreciate the opportunity to stand here in support of this \nyear's bipartisan IAA. We ask a lot of our intelligence community when \nit comes to collaboration. When they collaborate, they best keep us \nsafe. What we are doing today is we are sending to the floor a bill \nthat reflects our own collaboration and shows that what we expect of \nthem, we can also deliver to the House floor.\n  I am pleased that this bill promotes our national security around the \nglobe and, in particular, our human intelligence capabilities, which \nstill, I believe, remain at risk and could benefit from an even greater \nfocus within the IC.\n  I am also pleased that the IAA includes, as a stand-alone provision, \nthe\n\n[[Page H2904]]\n\nTracking Foreign Fighters in Terrorist Safe Havens Act that \nRepresentative LoBiondo and I brought to the floor earlier this year, \nwhich passed the House unanimously and helps track the foreign fighter \nflows to and from terrorist safe havens abroad, a growing problem in \ntoday's world.\n  This year's IAA committee report also includes a provision I added \nrequiring a report from the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence, analyzing the status of student loan forgiveness and debt \ncounseling programs across the IC and the viability of IC-wide \nprograms. As student debt continues to cripple this generation, we must \ndetermine the best incentive packages available to young intelligence \nofficers abroad and here at home in order to continue to recruit and \nretain the best, brightest, and most diverse to public service, \nregardless of their financial situation because they went to college.\n  I am also pleased that this bill calls for a report from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy on their \ncurrent utilization of national labs expertise, and opportunities for \nareas of expansion. My own congressional district is home to two of \nthese labs--Lawrence Livermore and Sandia. I have seen firsthand how \nthey work to strengthen our national security. Just as we must train \nand retain the best and brightest of the IC, we must continue to \nleverage the great talent found in our national labs.\n  I encourage all of our Members to support this year's collaborative \nbipartisan IAA.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Ms. Sewell), also one of our subcommittee ranking members.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this \nyear's Intelligence Authorization Act.\n  Our national security is truly a bipartisan issue, and this \nlegislation is a reflection of both parties' shared commitment to the \nsafety and security of all Americans. This bill helps provide our \nintelligence community with the necessary resources and capabilities to \ndefend our Nation against ongoing and emerging threats around the \nworld.\n  As a ranking member on the DOD Intelligence and Overhead Architecture \nSubcommittee, I am pleased that the language and direction in this bill \ncontinues to advance our capabilities on the ground and in space, and \nprovides necessary oversight of many critical DOD, NRO, and NGA \nprograms. Additionally, this legislation takes important steps towards \nenhancing thorough oversight of our surveillance capabilities while \ncontinuing to make calculated investments in critically important \nstrategic efforts.\n  In the IAA, we also invest in our greatest national resource--our \npeople. By accepting provisions that I drafted to promote diversity in \nthe IC workforce, we are now able to provide a summer internship \nprogram to students from the existing Centers of Academic Excellence. \nWe also now hold the IC more accountable for doing a better job of \ndeveloping a matrix to assess how minority fellowship and internship \nprograms actually achieve their desired results.\n\n  This past weekend I had the pleasure, along with Congressman Andre \nCarson, to attend and be honored at the 3rd Annual African American \nNational Security and Intelligence Leadership Summit. This annual event \nserves as a rare opportunity for African Americans in the IC to gain \nleadership insights from top national security officials. It was also a \ngreat occasion and further reaffirmed my commitment to helping ensure \nrobust diversity throughout the entire IC.\n  We were also successful in this year's IAA to include bipartisan \nlanguage that promotes accountability and transparency in all IC \nfederally funded academic programs by requiring agencies to report on \ntheir recruitment and retention efforts. Increasing diversity and \naccountability in the IC is a good governance issue and makes all of us \nbetter because it ensures unique and creative ways of problem-solving, \nwhich is increasingly necessary as we face more complex intelligence \nchallenges.\n  As a committee, I am extremely proud of the work we did. We took \ngreat pains to cut unnecessary funding while prioritizing the need to \nimprove upon processes and promote efficiencies in the IC. The reality \nis that we live in a world where potential threats to our Nation are \nconstantly developing and changing. As our military missions and \nintelligence objectives continue to evolve, we need an intelligence \ncommunity that is diverse, agile, and adequately funded.\n  I am proud to support this year's Intelligence Authorization Act. I \nwant to commend my chairman and ranking member and all of the staff for \nall of their hard work on this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critically important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Himes), also a subcommittee ranking member, and one of \nthe leaders on many issues in the committee but, in particular, on \nprivacy issues related to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \nBoard.\n  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking the \nchairman and the ranking member of the committee for the terrific, \nopen, and bipartisan process that led to the adoption of this bill in \ncommittee, and urge my colleagues here in this room to support it.\n  I would also like to add my plaudits and thanks to staff on both \nsides of the aisle without whom this would never have been possible.\n  I support this bill because, most importantly, it well funds the \nremarkable work of our intelligence community in all that they do \nagainst the ongoing and all-too-present threats of terrorism and all \nthat they do in keeping us apprised and keeping our options available \nto address the many threats that face, or could face, this Nation \ncoming out of places like Russia, North Korea, Iran, and plenty of \nother locales around the world.\n  At the same time, and critical for my own support, this bill is \nsupportive of the essential activities that the intelligence community \nand that we must do to preserve and defend the civil liberties that are \nso important to us and, even more importantly, the values, the values \nembodied in this country that, at the end of the day, are the \nqualitative difference between this country and our adversaries.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would note, in particular, some conversation came up, \nas the ranking member alluded to, with respect to the President's \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. In committee, I stressed \nthat this is one of a couple of groups that provide oversight for these \nterribly important activities. When you think about it, internally \nthere are the inspector generals and the checks within the executive \nagency; there are a couple of dozen Members and Senators of Congress \nwho provide some oversight; and then there is this outside group which \nproduces opinions, which have been cited in FISA court opinions, which \nhave been cited by the amicus that was set up as a result of the good \nwork of this body in doing the USA Freedom Act. I will continue to say \nthat it is an important part of the overall intelligence community.\n  Maintaining this balance between our national security, which is \ncritical, and, again, those values, which are the qualitative \ndifference that we have with our adversaries, is important. It is \nenshrined in this bill, and I am delighted to offer my support.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley), another one of the leaders on the committee.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to join the chorus in thanking the \nstaff on both sides of the aisle, and the ranking member and the \nchairman for their extraordinary work in support of the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act. Indeed, it is something of a model for how we can \nwork on a bipartisan basis.\n  This year's Intelligence Authorization Act provides funding and \noversight to vital collection and analysis programs. It also provides \nguidance of how best to support and leverage our partners and allies, \nwhich is critical in the world of shrinking budgets and ever-increasing \nthreats.\n  Specifically, I am pleased that the IAA continues to support security \nservices in Ukraine. I have long advocated\n\n[[Page H2905]]\n\nfor U.S. assistance to Ukraine given the strategic relationship and \nshared value between our two countries.\n  Russia remains a significant threat to its neighbors and to the U.S. \nBolstering our partners in Eastern Europe is one key way to check \nRussia's increasing adventurism.\n  Looking ahead, we must stay focused on this threat and continue to \nfocus on our national security programs at home. We cannot simply allow \nourselves to get lulled into a false sense of security simply because \nof lack of information about specific threats against soft targets like \nstadiums and airports.\n\n  Since 9/11, we have made significant and important enhancements to \nU.S. intelligence capabilities, but that was 15 years ago. We must \ncontinuously reassess our risks and take appropriate steps to stop \nterrorist attacks before they occur.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, to describe the world as dangerous is not an \noverstatement or a political statement--it is a reality.\n  Thankfully, we have the world's most talented, capable, and committed \nintelligence community to warn and defend us. From leaders like \nDirector Clapper, who has served this Nation exceptionally for more \nthan 5 decades, to those men and women just beginning their careers in \nintelligence; from case officers to analysts; support and logistics \npersonnel to inspectors general; from acquisition professionals to \nlawyers; seismologists to cryptologists; from mathematicians to \nlinguists; particle physicists to special forces; to all in the IC: You \nhave our most sincere thanks and admiration.\n  I again thank Chairman Nunes, for his leadership, his hard work, and \nhis commitment to bipartisanship.\n  To my majority and minority colleagues, I thank you for your \nunwavering commitment to conduct rigorous and continuous oversight of \nthe IC that helps protect our country as well as our privacy and civil \nliberties.\n  And I thank our excellent committee staff, including on the \nDemocratic side, Carly Blake, Linda Cohen, Bob Minehart, Amanda Rogers \nThorpe, Wells Bennett, Rheanne Wirkkala, Thomas Eager, as well as our \nshared staff, Kristin Jepson, Brandon Smith, and Kevin Klein. I also \nwant to thank my staff director, Michael Bahar, deputy staff director, \nTim Bergreen, and Patrick Boland.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critically important bipartisan \nbill, and I look forward to improving it further on its way to becoming \nlaw.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, I want to thank all of the members of our committee, and, \nagain, thank the staff from both the minority and the majority side.\n  As Mr. Quigley said, it would not be possible if it wasn't for the \nstrong Member involvement and engagement that makes a bipartisan work \nproduct like this, gives it the ability to come to the House floor, and \nto be passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. So I want to thank \nall of the members on my committee from both sides for their active \nparticipation. As the ranking member said, we will continue to try to \nmake this product better; we will work out our differences with the \nSenate; and hopefully by the end of the year, we will have a product \nthat we can all be proud of.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Nunes) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 5077, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2905-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2905-H2907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1545\n           S.A.F.E.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2121, the S.A.F.E. Transitional Licensing \nAct of 2015, introduced by the gentleman from Ohio. (Mr. Stivers).\n  H.R. 2121 would establish that a mortgage loan originator who is \nemployed by a federally insured depository institution and who leaves \nto join a State-licensed mortgage company would have temporary \nauthority to originate mortgages. The bill stipulates that, in order to \nqualify for this transitional license, the individual must have filed \nan application with the State to be a licensed loan originator.\n  More simply, this bill allows flexibility to workers who are looking \nto make a career change. This bill does not allow for unregulated, \nunlicensed mortgage originators to have a free pass.\n  The S.A.F.E. Transitional Licensing Act makes clear that the \ntemporary license--good for a maximum of 120 days--can apply only to a \nregistered loan originator.\n  Further, H.R. 2121 stipulates that the originator must be registered \nwith the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System, or NMLS, and be employed \nby a licensed and supervised mortgage lender, banker, or servicer.\n  H.R. 2121 includes other safeguards that are important to point out. \nThe bill makes clear that the temporary authority would automatically \nexpire should the originator withdraw his or her application or if the \nState denies the application.\n  This is a highly bipartisan bill that will ensure workers who \noriginate mortgages at depository institutions are able to move to non-\ndepository institutions with a minimal amount of work disruption.\n  At the end of the day, this bill is about jobs. It is about \nstreamlining the government processes to make sure that people can \ncontinue to put food on the table. Folks shouldn't be prevented from \nworking for months at a time simply because they want to change jobs or \nemployers. Our regulatory structure should foster not only consumer \nprotection, but job growth and efficient marketplaces. The current \nlicensing requirements do the exact opposite.\n  I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his hard work on this \nlegislation. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \ncommonsense, employee-friendly bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2121, the S.A.F.E. Transitional Licensing \nAct of 2015.\n  I am proud to serve as an original Democratic cosponsor of this \ncommonsense, yet critically important, legislation. I also applaud my \ncolleagues, led by Representative Stivers, for working in a bipartisan \nway to draft this legislation that we are considering here today.\n  Homeownership continues to be and remains a dream for millions of \nAmericans across the country. This legislation is an important step \ntowards helping to ensure that this dream becomes a reality. H.R. 2121 \nhelps to facilitate a loan originator's job mobility while ensuring \nthat State regulators continue to have the ability to protect consumers \nand the marketplace.\n  This legislation offers a narrowly tailored and pragmatic solution \nthat provides a transitional authority to originate mortgages for \nindividuals who move from a federally insured institution to a nonbank \nlender. During this transition, these individuals will also work to \nmeet the S.A.F.E. Act's licensing and testing requirements.\n  Over the past several years, State regulators, key industry \nstakeholders, and Members of Congress have been engaged in an extensive \ndialogue on ways to eliminate job barriers for loan originators as well \nas to help to promote homeownership for qualified buyers.\n  I am committed to continuing to ensure that our housing finance and \nmortgage system continues to deliver fair, sustainable, and responsible \nfinancing to meet the ever-changing needs of homeownership.\n  H.R. 2121 is truly a reflection of what can be achieved when we all \nwork together towards a unified and shared goal. I urge my colleagues \nto support this critically important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Stivers), a distinguished member of the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, \nand I thank him for all of the work that he has done as the chair of \nthe subcommittee.\n  It is work that is making a difference as it allows people to get \naccess to their own versions of the American Dream. This is a piece of \nthat, as the Representative told you. I thank Representative Sewell and \nRepresentative Beatty for all of their hard work.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill. This is a commonsense bill. \nThis is a jobs bill. This was a unanimous bill in the Financial \nServices Committee. It passed 56-0 on March 2, and I am so proud of \nthat.\n  The S.A.F.E. Act passed in 2008 as part of the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act, and it created two different sets of requirements for \nqualifications on mortgage loan originators, depending on whether they \nworked for a State-licensed nondepository or a federally regulated \ndepository.\n  The problem with that is it kept people captive working for the same \nkind of company that they worked for yesterday. If they try to change \nbetween the two, they don't have a license and they can't help people \nachieve their versions of the American Dream, of owning a home.\n\n  This will allow people to be more mobile in moving between depository \nand nondepository institutions. It is a jobs issue for that very \nreason. It will help make sure that the workforce can go where the jobs \nare and that they can help people get loans to own a home. We all \nbelieve in homeownership, and this is a small way we can be for it \ntoday.\n  Representatives Sewell and Beatty worked very hard with me with \nindustry stakeholders and with State regulators in getting the bill \nthat we have today, which, as I said, passed unanimously out of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  H.R. 2121, as amended, would foster an efficient marketplace of \ncompetition between banks and nonbanks and allow mortgage loan \noriginators to help all Americans achieve homeownership. It would \nprovide them with a transitional authority if you move from a \ndepository to a nondepository or the other way around.\n  Under the proposal, an individual who is employed by a financial \ninstitution that has been a registered loan originator under the \nS.A.F.E. Act for the preceding 12 months can originate loans after \nsubmitting a background check and credit information to his\n\n[[Page H2907]]\n\nState regulator until the application is either approved, denied, \nwithdrawn, or even if it is just deemed incomplete.\n  At that point, the transitional authority ceases, so he has to submit \na full application. Once he does that, he gets a chance to continue to \nwork under this transitional period.\n  Again, this is a jobs issue. It will help people move between the two \ntypes of institutions, which most Americans don't think about. They \njust want to make sure they get a mortgage. That is what we need to \nmake sure we facilitate here with commonsense rules.\n  Sadly, some States have had transitional license authority, but the \nCFPB does not allow them now to exercise that authority. That is why \nthis bill is necessary. I am really glad that we can allow for that now \nto make sure that all Americans can get access to homeownership.\n  I thank Representative Sewell, Representative Beatty, all of the \nmembers of the House Financial Services Committee, the gentleman from \nMissouri for his leadership, the gentleman from Texas--the chair of the \nfull committee--for his leadership, and the ranking member of the \ncommittee, the gentlewoman from California.\n  This is indeed a unanimous bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the sponsor of the bill, \nthe gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers), as well as Ms. Sewell and Mrs. \nBeatty from the other side for their fine work and their support. I \nappreciate all of the work that was done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express support for the \nSAFE Transitional Licensing Act, H.R. 2121 introduced by my good friend \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Stivers. This bipartisan bill provides much needed, \ncommon-sense regulatory relief for mortgage loan originators that \nlevels the playing field, creates job mobility and allows independent \nmortgage lenders to recruit a talented workforce.\n  The SAFE Transitional Licensing Act requires states to provide a \ntemporary, transitional license for registered loan originators that \nmove from a financial institution to a state-licensed non-bank \noriginator or move interstate to a state-licensed loan originator. \nThese individuals will be allowed to continue to work and originate \nloans in their new capacity for up to 120 days, while seeking the \nappropriate state licenses. This bill addresses the unintended \nconsequences of some of the provisions in the Secure and Fair \nEnforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, which created \ndifficulties when a mortgage loan officer decided to switch jobs from a \nbank to a non-bank lender, or when a mortgage loan officer decided to \nmove across state lines.\n  Under current law, mortgage loan originators are required to wait \nuntil they receive their new licenses before they can originate loans. \nOften times, mortgage loan originators are forced to wait weeks, even \nmonths, before their new licenses are approved. This unfairly inhibits \njob mobility for mortgage loan originators and puts independent \nmortgage lenders at a disadvantage in recruiting talented staff. The \nSAFE Transitional Licensing Act amends the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act \nto give relief to loan officers, while also allowing state regulators \nthe authority to continue to keep bad actors out of the industry and \nenforce applicable state laws.\n  The State of Ohio was the first state to enact a transitional license \nfor out-of-state licensed mortgage loan originators. Now, it is time \nfor Congress to follow Ohio's lead and provide regulatory relief that \nlevels the playing field, creates job mobility and allows independent \nmortgage lenders to recruit a talented workforce. I urge my colleagues \nto vote ``Yes'' for this common-sense piece of legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2121, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2907-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2907-H2910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FOSTERING INNOVATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 4139) to amend the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to provide \na temporary exemption for low-revenue issuers from certain auditor \nattestation requirements.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fostering Innovation Act of \n     2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TEMPORARY EXEMPTION FOR LOW-REVENUE ISSUERS.\n\n       Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. \n     7262) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Temporary Exemption for Low-Revenue Issuers.--\n       ``(1) Low-revenue exemption.--Subsection (b) shall not \n     apply with respect to an audit report prepared for an issuer \n     that--\n       ``(A) ceased to be an emerging growth company on the last \n     day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth \n     anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity \n     securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective \n     registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933;\n       ``(B) had average annual gross revenues of less than \n     $50,000,000 as of its most recently completed fiscal year; \n     and\n       ``(C) is not a large accelerated filer.\n       ``(2) Expiration of temporary exemption.--An issuer ceases \n     to be eligible for the exemption described under paragraph \n     (1) at the earliest of--\n       ``(A) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer \n     following the tenth anniversary of the date of the first sale \n     of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an \n     effective registration statement under the Securities Act of \n     1933;\n       ``(B) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during \n     which the average annual gross revenues of the issuer exceed \n     $50,000,000; or\n       ``(C) the date on which the issuer becomes a large \n     accelerated filer.\n       ``(3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection:\n       ``(A) Average annual gross revenues.--The term `average \n     annual gross revenues' means the total gross revenues of an \n     issuer over its most recently completed three fiscal years \n     divided by three.\n       ``(B) Emerging growth company.--The term `emerging growth \n     company' has the meaning given such term under section 3 of \n     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c).\n       ``(C) Large accelerated filer.--The term `large accelerated \n     filer' has the meaning given that term under section 240.12b-\n     2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor \n     thereto.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) and the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. \nSewell) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4139, the Fostering Innovation Act, \nintroduced by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) and the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).\n  H.R. 4139 extends a narrow exemption to comply with section 404(b) of \nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act for emerging growth companies that would \notherwise lose their exempt status at the end of a 5-year period \nallowed under current law.\n  As such, H.R. 4139 is consistent with the bipartisan aims of the JOBS \nAct to eliminate the one-size-fits-all regulatory structure for public \ncompanies.\n  Under Sarbanes-Oxley, or SOX, section 404(b) requires an independent \nand external assessment of a public company's internal controls over \nfinancial reporting.\n  While important, this translates into significant legal and \ncompliance costs, driving up an entity's accounting and auditing \nexpenses. In fact, the costs to comply with section 404(b) have far \nexceeded the original estimates done by the SEC, and even a 2011 SEC \nstudy found that the average costs for companies can exceed $1 million \nannually.\n  This burden disproportionately impacts small and emerging growth \ncompanies, such as biotech firms that are engaging in lifesaving \nresearch and development. My home State of Missouri alone has over \n1,300 biotech companies that employ over 28,000 people who conduct \ngroundbreaking research.\n  Section 404(b)'s costs divert the resources of emerging growth \ncompanies to regulatory compliance costs, which\n\n[[Page H2908]]\n\nharms the ability of those firms to compete in the global marketplace \nand to even invest in creating lifesaving treatments and technologies.\n  Brian Hahn, the chief financial officer of GlycoMimetics, which is a \nsmall, public biotech company, testified at a subcommittee hearing on \nH.R. 4139 on December 2, 2015, that section 404(b) ``provides little-\nto-no insight into the health of an emerging biotech company--but is \nextremely costly for a pre-revenue innovator to comply with.''\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Recognizing these issues, the JOBS Act created an exemption to these \nexternal control attestation requirements, which allows small companies \nto focus on growing their business, going public, and still comply with \nSOx's other provisions. Nevertheless, the smallest of public companies \nstill struggle to comply with the significant costs stemming from SOx \nsection 404(b).\n  Despite claims to the contrary, H.R. 4139 is narrowly tailored to \nprovide regulatory relief to the smallest of public companies, those \nwith less than $50 million in annual revenue. This legislation provides \nthose companies with an additional on-ramp for section 404(b) \ncompliance. As Mr. Hahn further testified in the Financial Services \nCommittee: ``Legislation like the Fostering Innovation Act will ensure \nthat growing companies have the opportunity to be successful on the \npublic market without being forced to siphon off innovation capital to \nspend on costly compliance burdens that do not inform emerging biotech \ninvestors.''\n  I thank Ms. Sinema and Mr. Fitzpatrick for their diligent work on the \nbill, which passed the Financial Services Committee by a broad \nbipartisan vote.\n  I encourage my colleagues to provide this badly needed regulatory \nrelief to our Nation's small innovative companies and join me in \nsupporting H.R. 4139.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today I rise in opposition to H.R. 4139, the Fostering Innovation \nAct. This bill permits certain public companies that would be valued at \nmore than half a billion dollars to avoid an independent audit required \nby the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for up to a decade.\n  While I support legislation that would enable emerging growth \ncompanies to use valuable resources to remain competitive, stable, and, \nultimately, successful, I believe that this bill, as currently drafted, \nis overly broad and would potentially undermine critical investor \nprotections and impede confidence in our capital markets.\n  Ultimately, these auditor reports on public companies provide \nsubstantial benefits to investors and to companies. They promote \nconfidence in the U.S. markets, strengthen internal controls, and, \nultimately, prevent fraud.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), who is a distinguished member of \nthe Financial Services Committee and chairs the Task Force to \nInvestigate Terrorism Financing.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Luetkemeyer for \nyielding time to highlight the importance of this bipartisan \nlegislation to assist the innovators and the job creators who drive our \neconomy and are those who continue to position the United States as a \nglobal leader in research and a global leader in development.\n  Mr. Speaker, during a previous Congress, the Financial Services \nCommittee heard testimony from one of my constituents, the CEO of a \nPhiladelphia-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology firm which, at the \ntime, employed around 55 individuals. For this firm and for many \nemerging growth companies focused on groundbreaking technologies, it \ncould take more than a decade to see a profit; but because of top-line \nnumbers, these companies are required to comply with costly regulations \nmeant to ensure that the largest corporations are playing by the rules.\n  While Congress has made some efforts to reduce some of these \nregulatory burdens in the past, like the JOBS Act of 2012, it created \nan effective yet one-size-fits-all approach to exempt certain companies \nfor up to 5 years from section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which, of \ncourse, as we heard, requires the hiring of an external auditor in some \ncases. Unfortunately, a small group of companies remain unprofitable \neven after this period of time.\n  This bipartisan Fostering Innovation Act works to address this \nshortcoming by providing targeted relief from these costly regulations \nand requirements, allowing our American firms to focus on what they do \nbest: innovation, breakthroughs, and curing diseases. By extending the \nwaiver period for smaller companies that meet specific requirements, \nWashington gets out of the way and allows these firms to better compete \nin critical research and development in an increasingly globalized and \ncompetitive world. That is it.\n  I want to applaud Chairman Hensarling and the rest of the committee, \nespecially my colleagues, Ms. Sinema of Arizona, who is the bill's \nsponsor, and Representative Delaney. We came together to find \nbipartisan solutions that address regulatory burdens for our emerging \ngrowth companies, and it is my hope that, with this spirit of \ncooperation, we will be able to find new issues to tackle and continue \nto show the American people that this House can govern and foster an \neconomy that works for everyone.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters \nof opposition from Americans for Financial Reform, Public Citizen, and \nthe SEC Investor Advocate.\n\n                               Americans for Financial Reform,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2016.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of Americans for Financial \n     Reform, we are writing to reiterate our opposition to H.R. \n     4139, the ``Fostering Innovation Act''\n       This legislation would double the length of the existing \n     exemption from compliance with Sarbanes Oxley Section 404(b) \n     for ``emerging growth companies'', from five years to ten \n     years. The exemption granted in H.R. 4139 applies to \n     companies with $50 million or less in annual gross revenues.\n       Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley requires the auditor of a \n     public company to attest to the accuracy of the company's \n     financial reporting. This requirement was passed in response \n     to the accounting scandals of the late 1990s, which revealed \n     widespread deception and fraud in financial reporting. More \n     recent research by the GAO has found that companies exempted \n     from auditor attestation requirements have a higher frequency \n     of accounting restatements, indicating that the financial \n     reporting at such companies is deficient. Such accounting \n     restatements are harmful both to investors and to the \n     companies themselves, by virtue of making it harder to raise \n     capital.\n       We believe that the five year exemption provided for in the \n     JOBS Act is already ample time for a publicly held company \n     with tens of millions of dollars in revenue to develop the \n     capacity to provide fully reliable and accurate financial \n     statements. Ten years is an excessively long exemption. This \n     is especially true given the significance to the public and \n     the financial markets of accurate financial reporting. \n     Congress should reject H.R. 4139.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Americans for Financial Reform.\n\n       Following are the Partners of Americans for Financial \n     Reform--All the organizations support the overall principles \n     of AFR and are working for an accountable, fair and secure \n     financial system.

This \n     bill would allow certain firms with up to $50 million in \n     revenue and $700 million in capital floats to escape critical \n     scrutiny in audits by doubling the length of their exemption \n     from the requirements set forth in 404(b) of the \n     SarbanesOxley law.\n       A firm where investors have trusted $700 million should be \n     willing to be scrutinized under a Section 404(b) audit. A \n     firm that does not want to withstand such scrutiny is the \n     very firm that likely needs such scrutiny to ensure its \n     financial reporting is not being doctored.\n       Already the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n     Protection Act provides relief for smaller companies from the \n     audit requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley. Capital markets thrive \n     when companies are held to reasonable standards. That works \n     both for investors as well as entrepreneurs who hope to avail \n     themselves of the capital markets. Extending firms' \n     exemptions from necessary oversight will only lead to less \n     compliance with standards, and more risk.\n       For questions, please contact Bartlett Naylor, financial \n     policy advocate, at bnaylor@citizen.org.\n           Sincerely,\n     Public Citizen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      United States Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: H.R. 4139, \n     cited as the ``Fostering Innovation Act of 2015,'' is ill-\n     advised, and I urge Members of Congress to vote against it. \n     The bill would allow smaller public companies to avoid the \n     auditor attestation requirement of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for \n     up to 10 years following an initial public offering.\n       In a small company, as in a large one, it is management's \n     job to maintain a system of internal controls to help ensure \n     that the financial statements are reliable. A key reform of \n     the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which followed on the heels of the \n     Enron implosion and other accounting scandals that wreaked \n     havoc on American investors, was to require that a company's \n     auditor attest to management's assessment of the \n     effectiveness of its internal control over financial \n     reporting. This ``second set of eyes'' helps to identify \n     potential risks of material misstatements and is designed to \n     prevent or detect fraud. Unfortunately, H.R. 4139 would chip \n     away further at the requirement for a second set of eyes, \n     even though auditor attestation enhances reliability of \n     financial reporting for investors, which has been shown to \n     reduce the cost of capital for businesses.\n       Credible empirical research has established that both \n     investors and companies benefit from having auditors attest \n     to the effectiveness of internal controls. For example, \n     institutional investors rely on the auditor's opinion. \n     Auditor testing uncovers more deficiencies than does \n     management's assessment alone. Moreover, there is a positive \n     correlation between a material weakness in internal control \n     and the future revelation of fraud. Indeed, companies with \n     more serious control problems tend to be smaller, less \n     mature, growing, or rapidly changing. All of this academic \n     research is described at length in the testimony of \n     University of Tennessee professor Joseph V. Carcello on this \n     bill before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and \n     Government Sponsored Enterprises of the House Financial \n     Services Committee. In addition, a 2011 study published by \n     the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fund \n     that companies that do not have an auditor attestation tend \n     to have significantly more material weaknesses in their \n     internal controls and more financial restatements.\n       Since the adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, \n     several steps have already been taken to significantly reduce \n     the burden on smaller companies from the auditor attestation \n     requirement in Section 404(b). In 2007, for example, the SEC \n     and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board took steps\n\n[[Page H2910]]\n\n     to reduce the costs of 404(b) compliance. Later, the Dodd-\n     Frank Act exempted approximately 60 percent of companies from \n     this requirement, and the JOBS Act waived the requirement for \n     emerging growth companies for up to five years. HR 4139 would \n     extend this exemption for up to 10 years for certain issuers, \n     and I believe it is a step too far.\n       Aside from weakening an important investor protection, H.R. \n     4139 further compounds the complexity of securities law \n     reporting requirements by creating yet another category of \n     issuers. The development of scaled reporting requirements has \n     resulted in multiple overlapping issuer categories, each \n     eligible for different rules, and that complexity itself adds \n     to the cost of raising capital.\n       In short, the independent audit of internal controls \n     provides important protections to investors and the companies \n     in which they invest. It strengthens internal controls, \n     prevents fraud, and promotes confidence in U.S. capital \n     markets. I oppose H.R. 4139 because it would further \n     deteriorate the benefits of Section 404, and I strongly \n     encourage you to oppose it as well. Please call me at if you \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Rick A Fleming,\n                                                Investor Advocate.\n\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Arizona (Ms. Sinema), a distinguished member of the Financial \nServices Committee and a sponsor of the bill.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling and Congressman \nFitzpatrick for working with me on this narrow, targeted exemption to \nprovide commonsense, regulatory relief for companies on the cutting \nedge of scientific and medical research.\n  I have heard from companies throughout my district that burdensome \nand unnecessary regulations continue to stifle their ability to grow \nand succeed. The Fostering Innovation Act allows certain emerging \ngrowth companies, including some biopharmaceutical companies, to spend \nvaluable resources on product research and development instead of \ncostly and unnecessary external audits.\n  Currently, EGCs are exempt from certain regulatory requirements for 5 \nyears after their initial public offering. One of the requirements that \nEGCs are exempt from is Sarbanes-Oxley section 404(b), which requires \npublic companies to obtain an external audit on the effectiveness of \ntheir internal controls for financial reporting. This reporting \nrequirement is costly and unnecessary because management is still \nrequired to assess internal controls, and these EGCs, by definition, \nhave very limited public exposure.\n  H.R. 4139 is a very narrow fix that temporarily extends the Sarbanes-\nOxley section 404(b) exemption for an additional 5 years for a small \nsubset of EGCs with an annual average revenue of less than $50 million \nand less than $700 million in public float. This will enable these EGCs \nto use valuable resources to remain competitive, stable, and, \nultimately, successful.\n  In the biopharma market, making it easier and less costly means \ngreater competition and results in potentially lower drug prices for \nconsumers. Further, nothing in this bill prohibits an external audit if \na company or a majority of its shareholders determine an audit is \nbeneficial\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in helping to ensure that costly \nregulations don't stand in the way of success for biopharmaceutical and \nother companies on the cutting edge of scientific and medical research.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Sinema and Mr. Fitzpatrick \nfor their fine work on this piece of legislation, which basically is a \ncommonsense piece of legislation to help a lot of our small, biotech \ncompanies to be able to do a better job of managing their own funds.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1762, as amended. This legislation \nwas sponsored by my good friend and colleague, Congressman Greg Walden \nof Oregon. It would designate the Department of Veterans Affairs \ncommunity-based outpatient clinic at The Dalles, Oregon, the Loren R. \nKaufman Memorial Veterans' Clinic.\n  Born and raised in The Dalles, Oregon, Sergeant First Class Loren \nKaufman answered the call to serve by enlisting in the United States \nArmy just 1 week after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He went on to serve \nin combat in both World War II and in Korea, until his death in action \non the 10th of February 1951.\n  Following his death, Sergeant First Class Kaufman was posthumously \nawarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in Korea in September of \n1950, when his company was attacked by an enemy battalion and his \nplatoon was ordered to reinforce the company.\n  According to the U.S. Army Center of Military History, during the \nbattle that followed, the ``dauntless courage and resolute intrepid \nleadership of Sergeant First Class Kaufman were directly responsible \nfor the success of his company in regaining its positions, reflecting \ndistinct credit upon himself and upholding the esteemed traditions of \nthe military service.''\n  In recognition of that, it is entirely fitting and appropriate that \nSergeant First Class Kaufman's life and service be memorialized by \nnaming the VA community-based outpatient clinic in his hometown after \nhim.\n  H.R. 1762, as amended, satisfies the committee's naming criteria. It \nis supported by the Oregon congressional delegation. It is supported by \nmany veterans service organizations, including the American Legion, the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the \nVietnam Veterans of America, and the Military Order of the Purple \nHeart. I understand that this bill is also supported by the Oregon \nCounty Veterans Service Officers Association and the American Red \nCross.\n  I am grateful to Congressman Walden for cosponsoring H.R. 1762, as \namended, to recognize a true American hero.\n  I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I support H.R. 1762, as amended, which names the new veterans clinic \nin The Dalles, Oregon, in honor of Loren R. Kaufman, a soldier in the \nUnited States Army during World War II and the Korean war.\n  Sergeant First Class Kaufman joined the Army the week after the \nattack on\n\n[[Page H2911]]\n\nPearl Harbor and served in North Africa and Europe during World War II. \nLater, during the Korean war, he earned the Medal of Honor for his \nquick counterattack on enemy combatants, which so surprised the enemy \nthat they retreated in confusion. At the age of 28 years old, while \nserving in Company G, 9th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Infantry Division, \nSergeant Kaufman was killed in action.\n  As stated in the citation for his Medal of Honor award, the \nleadership of Sergeant Kaufman was ``directly responsible for the \nsuccess of his company in regaining its positions, reflecting distinct \ncredit upon himself and upholding the esteemed traditions of the \nmilitary service.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from the Second District of Oregon (Mr. Walden), the sponsor \nof this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. He has done such an incredible job leading that \ncommittee and trying to make sure our veterans get both the recognition \nand the care that they have earned and so deserve. I thank the ranking \nmember for her support of this very timely and important piece of \nlegislation to name the VA clinic in The Dalles, Oregon, after Loren R. \nKaufman.\n  This is actually a photo of Mr. Kaufman.\n  Sergeant First Class Kaufman was a true American hero, as my \ncolleagues have said. He was born and raised in The Dalles. Sergeant \nKaufman served in the Army during World War II, and he also served in \nthe Korean war.\n  While in Korea, Sergeant Kaufman's company was attacked by the enemy. \nHis platoon was 2 miles away, protecting the battalion flank, and was \nordered to come and reinforce the company.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  On their way to their new location, they came under fire. Selflessly, \nSergeant Kaufman ran forward, engaged the enemy, and forced them to \nretreat in confusion.\n  Once Sergeant Kaufman's platoon rejoined their company, they found \nthe enemy had taken commanding ground and pinned the company down in a \ndraw. Without hesitation, Sergeant Kaufman again charged the enemy \nlines, firing his rifle, throwing grenades, using his bayonet, and \nseizing an unmanned machine gun. Because of his fast thinking and \nfearlessness, the enemy fled and the company regained their position.\n  It was for these actions and conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity \nabove and beyond the call that Sergeant Kaufman was awarded the Medal \nof Honor by President Harry S. Truman. In his citation it was written, \n``The dauntless courage and resolute intrepid leadership of Sergeant \nFirst Class Kaufman were directly responsible for the success of his \ncompany in regaining its positions, reflecting distinct credit upon \nhimself and upholding the esteemed traditions of the military \nservice.''\n  Tragically, though, Sergeant Kaufman received this incredible honor \nposthumously. He was killed in action on February 10, 1951, and was \nlaid to rest in Willamette National Cemetery, Portland, Oregon.\n  I strongly agreed with our local veterans and public officials that \nthe community should honor this native son's heroism by renaming the \nlocal VA clinic in his honor.\n  I want to thank the Veterans Ad Hoc Committee, Les Cochenour, the \nMid-Columbia Veterans Memorial Committee, and the Wasco County \nCommission for their efforts to support renaming this clinic. I also \nwant to thank the entire Oregon congressional delegation and the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs for their support.\n  Finally, I would like to offer a special thanks to Loren Kaufman's \nfamily from The Dalles, his cousin Gerald, Gerald's wife Marilyn, and \ntheir daughter Sharon. I am proud to help honor Loren Kaufman by \nworking to rename this clinic in his honor so he can be a continuing \ninspiration for the community and the country.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting H.R. 1762, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I again urge all Members to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Kinnard VA \nClinic.\n  Specialist Fourth Class Daniel L. Kinnard was born in October of 1949 \nin\n\n[[Page H2912]]\n\nMount Olive, Ohio. During the Vietnam war, Specialist Kinnard served \nwith distinction in the 101st Airborne, the famed Screaming Eagles.

As a Vietnam medic, he was awarded the Bronze Star for Valor in \n1968 for dodging enemy bullets to reach two wounded men and providing \nfirst aid while remaining exposed to enemy fire.\n  Specialist Kinnard died at the age of 18 in March 1968 while \nproviding care to fellow paratroopers. In addition to the Bronze Star, \nhe was awarded numerous other medals.\n  Specialist Kinnard made the ultimate sacrifice while serving his \ncountry in the Vietnam war.

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Galena, Ohio (Mr. Tiberi), the sponsor of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Miller and his \ncommittee members for supporting my bill, H.R. 960, to designate the VA \ncommunity-based outpatient clinic in Newark, Ohio, as the Daniel L. \nKinnard VA Clinic.\n  Born in Knox County and a resident of Newark, Specialist Daniel \nKinnard served bravely as a medic in the 101st Army Airborne Division, \nthe famed Screaming Eagles, during the Vietnam war.\n  On February 17, 1968, he rushed through hostile enemy fire to treat \nand rescue wounded soldiers. For his bravery, as was mentioned, and his \nheroism on that day, he was awarded the Bronze Star for Valor. Twenty-\none short days later, Specialist Kinnard was killed in action rendering \naid to his fellow paratroopers. He was just 18 years old.\n  Mr. Speaker, next Monday is Memorial Day, a time we pause to honor \nthose who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our great Nation. Today I \nurge my colleagues to support H.R. 960 to honor Specialist Kinnard and \nthose who served courageously beside him and rename this clinic in the \n12th District Ohio town of Newark, Ohio.\n  I appreciate the leadership of our chairman and the committee's work \non this.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to \nthank all of our Vietnam veterans. When they came home from the war, we \ndid not properly recognize them, as we should have, as a Nation. I want \nto say that we are very grateful for their service and their sacrifice.\n  When we hear that 22 veterans a day commit suicide, only three of \nfive of them are involved in the VA, and many of them are Vietnam \nveterans. At this time, I think that we all should soldier up, reach \nout to those Vietnam veterans, let them know that we appreciate their \nservice, and recommend that they get involved in the VA.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 960, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of H.R. 2460. The bill is \nsponsored by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, the Subcommittee on Economic \nOpportunity, and the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial \nAffairs. I am grateful to him for sponsoring this piece of legislation.\n  This bill actually directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nenter into an agreement or a contract with State\n\n[[Page H2913]]\n\nveterans homes to pay for adult day health care for a veteran eligible \nfor, but not receiving, nursing home care.\n  It would also stipulate that payment under each agreement or contract \nbetween the VA and a State home cover the cost of adult day care for \neligible veterans at a rate equal to 65 percent of the payment that the \nVA would otherwise pay to the State home if the veteran were receiving \nnursing home care.\n  Adult day health care programs provide veterans in need of skilled \nservices, case management, or assistance with activities of daily \nliving with valuable social activities, peer support, medical \nmonitoring, companionship, and recreation during the day and provide \ncaregivers with needed respite.\n  However, according to the National Association of State Veterans \nHomes, veterans face barriers accessing adult health care programs each \nday due to costs. This bill would help address those cost concerns and \nincrease the degree of access for veterans who are eligible for VA-paid \nnursing home care due to their 70 percent or higher service-connected \nrating.\n  As the veteran population ages, Mr. Speaker, it is increasingly \nimportant that the VA provide a wide variety of geriatric and long-term \ncare services and supports, and adult day health care programs can \nserve as an important component of that.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  According to the VA, adult day health care is a program which \nveterans can go to during the day for social activities, peer support, \ncompanionship, and recreation.\n  The program is for veterans who need skilled services, case \nmanagement, and help with activities of daily living. Examples include \nhelping with bathing, dressing, fixing meals, or taking medication.\n  This program is also for veterans who are isolated or their caregiver \nis experiencing burdens. Adult day health care can be used in \ncombination with other home and community-based services.\n  Health services such as care from nurses, therapists, social workers, \nand others may also be available. Adult day health care can provide \nrespite care for a family caregiver and also help veterans and their \ncaregivers gain skills to manage the veteran's care at home.\n  This legislation would authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs \nto enter into agreement with State veterans homes to provide adult \nhealth care for a veteran who is eligible for but does not receive \nnursing home care.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and urge its passage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from the First District of New York (Mr. \nZeldin), the sponsor of this piece of legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. \n2460, which would expand disabled veterans' access to adult day health \ncare, a daily program for disabled veterans who need extra assistance \nand special attention in their day-to-day lives. Those veterans who are \n70 percent or more disabled from a service-connected injury often \nrequire significant assistance from others in order to carry out basic \neveryday tasks.\n  Despite various care options for veterans, their choices are often \nlimited and can come at a great expense. One such program that is \ncurrently available is adult day health care. This program provides \ndisabled veterans and their families with a high-quality alternative to \nnursing home care, providing quality outpatient services for those \nsuffering from debilitating illnesses or disabilities.\n  These programs provide a range of services from daily activities such \nas bathing to full medical services like physical therapy. The focus of \nthe program is on improving disabled veterans' quality of life through \nan individualized plan specific to their needs while still allowing \nthem to maintain their independence.\n  Adult day health care programs don't only benefit the veteran, they \nalso benefit the family members and caregivers as well. This model \nallows caregivers to tend to their day-to-day activities without \nworrying about the well-being of their spouse, child, or friend, \nallowing the veteran to lead a much more fulfilling life, while keeping \nfamilies together and strong.\n  Adult day health care, however, is only currently offered at three \nfacilities in the entire country. My district is fortunate to have one \nof these facilities, the Long Island State Veterans Home in Stony \nBrook, New York, but this program could easily be offered at any of the \n153 State veterans homes across the country.\n  Since the Department of Veterans Affairs does not currently cover the \ncost of participation in this program, the expense must be paid out of \npocket by the veteran and their family, which significantly limits the \nnumber of veterans who can enroll.\n  My bill, H.R. 2460, would ensure that 70 percent or more service-\nconnected disabled veterans are able to receive adult day health care \nat no cost to the veteran and their family by defining the program as a \nreimbursable treatment option through the VA. This would expand this \ngreat option of care for our veterans.\n  Currently, 52 Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber have signed \non as cosponsors of this bill. I would like to thank the chairman of \nthe House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Jeff Miller, for his \nleadership as chairman of the committee and for recognizing the urgency \nin passing this bill. Myself, the committee, many Members of this \nCongress, his constituents, and this country will miss him following \nhis service this year.\n  I would also like to thank House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy for \nhaving this bill placed on the calendar for today.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support \nH.R. 2460.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I, too, ask all my colleagues to \nsupport this piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2460.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2913-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2913-H2914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FINAL FAREWELL ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3715, as amended, the \nFinal Farewell Act of 2016.\n  We know that it can sometimes be a challenge to take time away from \nwork to attend a funeral or a memorial service for a loved one. This \nbill, which is sponsored by the ranking member of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, Congresswoman Corrine Brown of Florida, would lessen \nthat challenge for those arranging to attend the funeral service of a \nveteran buried in a national cemetery.\n  This bill would require VA, upon the request of the family of the \ndeceased, to permit weekend funerals and memorial services. In doing \nso, this bill would allow more family members and friends to pay final \nrespects to their loved ones as they are laid to rest.\n  Our veterans--the men and women who sacrificed so much for us--have \nearned the right to be treated with honor and respect after they pass \non. Although I support this bill, I understand that some of the State \nDirectors of Veterans Affairs have raised concerns with the restriction \nit contains on grants to State and tribal cemeteries who receive \nFederal grants. I look forward to working with the ranking member to \naddress these concerns during the upcoming negotiations with the \nSenate.\n  I want to thank Ms. Brown once again for sponsoring this legislation \nand bringing this very important issue to our attention. I urge all of \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3715, as amended, the \nFinal Farewell Act. This bill is of great importance to many families \nwho traditionally hold funerals on weekends.\n  While the VA has the authority to provide weekend services to \nveterans and their families, they rarely do. This has been a particular \nchallenge for various religions and cultures who bury their loved ones \non Saturday. Furthermore, these families are forced to bear the cost of \nstoring their loved one's remains over the weekend. However, this bill, \nas amended, makes weekend burials available to all veterans, regardless \nof their reasoning and need for a weekend burial.\n  This benefit for our veterans is to honor their service to our \ncountry. Their loved ones should have the opportunity to mourn their \nloss at a time that works for them. I thank all Members for their \nconsideration and support for this commonsense change.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Miller for his support of this \nimportant legislation, and I urge passage of this very important bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Once again, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3989, as amended, \nSupport Our Military Caregivers Act.\n  Congress created the Family Caregivers Program in 2010 to support \nthose family members and friends who put their own lives and careers on \nhold to care for those veterans who have been gravely wounded in \nservice to our Nation following September 11, 2001. At the time, VA \nexpected 3,000 family caregivers would apply for the program. However, \nin fiscal year 2015 alone, more than 24,000 caregivers participated in \nand received at least one stipend payment through the program.\n  Unsurprisingly, in 2014, the GAO found that staffing for the Family \nCaregivers Program was insufficient to meet higher-than-expected \ndemand, and staffing shortages impeded the timeliness of the program \nand negatively impacted services to veterans and caregivers. This is \nunacceptable.\n  H.R. 3989, as amended, would provide a safety valve for understaffed \nVA caregiver support coordinators by allowing veterans and caregivers \nto elect to have an independent entity provide a clinical review of \neligibility for the Family Caregivers Program in certain instances. VA \nwould be required to take the external clinical review into account and \nto provide clinical justification if VA's ultimate decision is contrary \nto the findings contained in the external clinical review.\n  To increase transparency and ensure the program is functioning as \nCongress intended, it would also require VA to issue directives \noutlining the policies, procedures, and operational requirements for \nthe Family Caregivers Program and would require GAO to report to \nCongress on VA's processes for determining eligibility for the Family \nCaregivers Program, adjudicating appeals for the Family Caregivers \nProgram, and periodically reevaluating eligibility for program \nparticipants and communicating any changes that result from such \nreevaluation to the veteran or caregiver in question.\n  Finally, the bill would also limit the amount of taxpayer dollars \nthat VA can spend on awards and bonuses to VA employees.\n  H.R. 3989, as amended, is sponsored by Congresswoman Elise Stefanik \nof New York, and I thank her for her hard work and advocacy in \nintroducing this bill on behalf of our veterans and caregivers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3989, as amended. I know \nfirsthand how difficult it is to deal with the illness of a loved one. \nI was blessed with the continued vibrant presence of Big Mama, my \ngrandmother, until just a few years ago. My mother is with me now in \nFlorida.\n  I want to say that the work of a caregiver is God's work. I cannot \nthink of anything more rewarding, pleasing, tiring, exhausting or \nmentally draining than taking care of a family member.\n  I was pleased to support the Caregiver Assistance and Resource \nEnhancement Act in the 111th Congress. President Obama signed into law \nthe Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act on May 5, 2010.\n  The law requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish \ncaregiver support services to veterans. Family caregivers are the \nfoundation of the long-term care system, with more than 50 million \npeople who provide informal caregiving for a chronically ill, disabled, \nor aging family member or friend in any given year in the United \nStates. In fact, it is estimated that about 80 percent of adults living \nin the community and in need of long-term care depend on family \ncaregivers, therefore, costly institutional nursing home care.\n  The one issue I have with the legislation is that the bill asks the \nVA to report on expanding the caregiver program. We all know about the \nprogram. It works.\n  Why have another report when we should just expand the program?\n  Let me repeat that. We already know that the program works. We don't \nneed another report. What we need is to just expand the program.\n  I would ask that the Speaker allow us to bring up H.R. 2894, the \nCaregivers Access and Responsible Expansion for All Veterans Act.\n\n[[Page H2916]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  This bill expands the caregivers programs to veterans of all eras. \nThe caregivers program works, and we need to expand the program.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may \nconsume to the gentlewoman from the 21st District of New York (Ms. \nStefanik), the sponsor of this important piece of legislation.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today regarding H.R. 3989, the \nSupport Our Military Caregivers Act.\n  After working with a constituent who was having trouble with the \nbureaucratic Military Caregiver system at the VA, I was proud to \nintroduce this legislation last November.\n  Military caregivers are loved ones who selflessly care for our \nNation's heroes behind the scenes to enhance their everyday lives.\n  Thankfully, the Family Caregiver Program, implemented in 2011, was \ndesigned to ensure caregivers were not forgotten. My bill would \nguarantee that those who dedicate their lives as caregivers receive the \nsupport they so desperately need and they so desperately deserve.\n  My district has the largest veteran population of any district in New \nYork State. This has provided me with a greater understanding of the \nselfless sacrifice our veterans and their families provide to our \ncommunity and our Nation.\n  Over the last 15 years of war, our servicemembers have served bravely \nand their families have sacrificed an immeasurable amount. So it is \nvital that we ensure they receive the best possible care available.\n  Unfortunately, the VA has had a difficult time managing the high \ndemand of Family Caregiver enrollees, which is much larger than \noriginally accounted for.\n  VA medical centers lack sufficient caregiver support coordinators and \nthe necessary clinical staff to carry out medical assessments for \neligibility. Application deadlines are not being met by their own \ninternal standards, and the staff is still shorthanded.\n  This bill would ensure that military caregivers have access to an \nobjective third party to conduct clinical reviews in the event of an \nappeal. It also ensures that the process is transparent so that our \nveterans and caregivers are never left with an unanswered question.\n  Military caregivers are truly silent heroes in our communities and \ndeserve the respect and benefits proportionate to their significant \ncontributions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am truly humbled to represent the veterans in my \ndistrict and will continue to work to improve their lives.\n  I want to thank Chairman Benishek of the Veterans' Affairs Health \nSubcommittee for working with me on this legislation as well as \nChairman Miller and Ranking Member Brown for their leadership and \nbipartisan support of this bill.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this important bill to improve \nthe lives of our veterans and their caregivers.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3989, as \namended, a bill that is designated to create a process for external \nclinical review of the VA caregivers program.\n  I am hoping that the chairman, as we move forward, will work with the \nSenate and try to come up with a way that we can at least have a pilot \nprogram to expand the caregivers program.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have one remaining speaker. I \nyield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young).\n  Mr. YOUNG of IOWA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nSupport Our Military Caregivers Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor.\n  Congress established the Family Caregiver Program to assist military \ncaregivers and, yet, many face delays in getting the support they need \nto effectively care for our wounded veteran heroes.\n  The Support Our Military Caregivers Act would streamline the process, \nallowing the Department of Veterans Affairs to contract with a third \nparty to reduce the claims backlog.\n  Rather than leave care to strangers, some family members choose to \nquit their job and make other significant life changes to care for \ntheir loved ones. We need to do more to support them.\n  More and more of our veterans are returning from war with battle \nscars or invisible wounds of war. I often meet with Iowa veterans who \nhave been wounded while serving our country. We have all met with them. \nThese brave servicemembers deserve the best care and assistance we can \ngive.\n  I am proud to support this bill to support our wounded veterans and \ntheir dedicated caregivers. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing \nthis bipartisan, important bill.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Ms. Stefanik, for her bipartisan \nleadership on this bill.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at \nthis time. So I would urge my colleagues to support this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Westerman). The question is on the \nmotion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the \nHouse suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3989, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend \ntitle 38, United States Code, to improve the process for determining \nthe eligibility of caregivers of veterans to certain benefits \nadministered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other \npurposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2916-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2916-H2918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IMPROVING TRANSITION PROGRAMS FOR ALL VETERANS ACT\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and \npass the bill (H.R. 5229) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nto carry out a study to evaluate the effectiveness of programs, \nespecially in regards to women veterans and minority veterans, in \ntransitioning to civilian life, and for other purposes, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 5229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Transition \n     Programs for All Veterans Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The rate of unemployment for women veterans is higher \n     than the rate for male veterans. In 2015, the unemployment \n     rate for women veterans remained relatively unchanged at 5.4 \n     percent, while the rate for male veterans declined to 4.5 \n     percent.\n       (2) Women veterans, on average, earn less than male \n     veterans. In 2013, the median income for women veterans was \n     $35,264, while the median income for male veterans was \n     $41,310.\n       (3) Women veterans and veterans with disabilities are more \n     likely to become homeless.\n       (4) Service-connected disabled veterans with relatively \n     high disability ratings have a higher unemployment rate than \n     those with relatively low disability ratings. In 2015, the \n     unemployment rate for veterans with a service-connected \n     disability rating of 60 percent or higher was 9.6 percent, \n     much higher than the 4.0 percent rate for veterans with a \n     service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or lower.\n       (5) In 2013, American Indian and Alaska Native veterans had \n     the lowest median personal incomes of any group of minority \n     veterans.\n       (6) In 2013, American Indian and Alaska Native veterans \n     were less likely to have finished an advanced degree than \n     other veterans.\n       (7) American Indian and Alaska Native veterans were more \n     likely to have a service-connected disability rating compared \n     to all other veterans. In 2013, the rate of American Indian \n     and Alaska Native veterans with a service-connected \n     disability rating was about 26 percent compared to 18.2 \n     percent for all other veterans.\n       (8) There is a lack of data on, and an understanding of, \n     the challenges and needs of veterans who are residents of a \n     territory of the United States and veterans who are part of \n     the indigenous population of a territory of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 3. STUDY ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VETERANS TRANSITION \n                   EFFORTS.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in \n     coordination with the Secretaries of Labor and Defense, shall \n     carry out a study to evaluate programs to assist veterans of \n     the Armed Forces in their transition to civilian life. Such \n     study shall be designed to determine the effectiveness of \n     current programs,\n\n[[Page H2917]]\n\n     especially in regards to the unique challenges faced by women \n     veterans, veterans with disabilities, Native American \n     veterans, veterans who are residents of a territory of the \n     United States, veterans who are part of the indigenous \n     population of a territory of the United States, and other \n     groups of minority veterans identified by the Secretaries, \n     including whether such programs--\n       (1) effectively address the challenges veterans face in \n     pursuing higher education, especially the challenges faced by \n     women veterans, veterans with disabilities, Native American \n     veterans, veterans who are residents of a territory of the \n     United States, veterans who are part of the indigenous \n     population of a territory of the United States, and other \n     groups of minority veterans identified by the Secretaries;\n       (2) effectively address the challenges such veterans face \n     entering the civilian workforce and in translating experience \n     and skills from military service to the job market; and\n       (3) effectively address the challenges faced by the \n     families of such veterans transitioning to civilian life.\n       (b) Report.--Eighteen months after the enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit a report \n     to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and \n     House of Representatives regarding the findings and \n     recommendations of the study required under subsection (a) of \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       No additional funds are authorized to carry out the \n     requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried \n     out using amounts otherwise authorized.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5229, as amended, the \nImproving Transition Programs for All Veterans Act.\n  The transition from military life to civilian life is not always a \nsmooth one. The Transition Assistance Program that is run by the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, and Labor does a pretty good \njob alleviating some of the stress that can occur before a \nservicemember leaves the military, and it is a good opportunity to \ninform outgoing servicemembers of what benefits they may be entitled to \nfrom Veterans Affairs and how to prepare for civilian life.\n  Although TAP continues to improve, it still is a struggle to fully \nprepare servicemembers for this short 5-day period, let alone address \nthe specific needs each individual has in each program.\n  The bill before us today would be a first step in examining how TAP \ncan further be improved to address the specific needs of minority \nveterans, women veterans, disabled veterans, Native American veterans, \nand veterans from U.S. territories.\n  It is important that, as a Nation, we prepare our men and women of \nall backgrounds for life after uniform, and the study required by this \nbill will give the VA, DOD, and Department of Labor the ability to \nreview TAP and to better understand how it can be improved to ensure \nthat we properly transition all servicemembers and address their \nspecific needs as they prepare for life after the military.\n  I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nTakano), and the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Ms. Radewagen) for \ntheir work on this legislation. It does have my full support. I would \nurge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 5229, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of Mr. Takano's bill, H.R. 5229, as amended, the \nbipartisan Improving Transition Programs for All Veterans Act.\n  Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that veteran \nunemployment is at a 7-year low. As of April 2016, veterans faced an \noverall unemployment rate of 3.9 percent, which is better than the \nNation's unemployment rate of 4.5 percent. This is excellent news.\n  I am proud that the numbers have improved under the leadership of our \ncommittee, the administration, and the Secretary of the VA; yet the \noverall unemployment rate for all veterans does not tell the whole \nstory. Some subgroups of veterans are still struggling to find \nfulfilling careers that pay them well and provide an opportunity for \ngrowth.\n  According to the Advisory Committee on Veterans' Employment, \nTraining, and Employer Outreach at the Department of Labor, certain \nveteran populations face challenges and aspire to career paths that \ndiffer from the broader population of transitioning servicemembers.\n  To ensure that we as policymakers are ahead of developing trends \nregarding the unique needs of these subgroups of transitioning \nveterans, this bill will determine the degree to which their needs are \ndifferent and look for innovative approaches toward meeting their \nunique challenges.\n  H.R. 5229 requires the VA to initiate a research program, in \ncollaboration with DOL and DOD, to better understand if and how current \nveterans transition programs address what may be differentiated needs, \nchallenges, and post-service aspirations of women veterans, veterans \nwith disabilities, Native American veterans who are veterans from the \nU.S. territories, and other subgroups that the Secretary identifies.\n  When we, as a Nation, sent individual members of the Armed Forces to \nwar, Congress promised to support all servicemembers when they made the \ntransition back into civilian life.\n  The makeup of our modern military forces is changing, and in a few \nshort years there will be a substantially greater percentage of female \nveterans than there are now.\n  Thanks to modern-day medicine, more veterans survive injuries to \nreturn to productive life, even with service-connected disabilities.\n  But women veterans face a higher unemployment rate than their male \ncounterparts, and veterans with high disability rates have an \nunemployment rate much higher than those of veterans with low \ndisability ratings.\n  What is more, Native American veterans earn the lowest median \npersonal income and are less likely to have finished an advanced degree \nthan other veterans. There is much more we don't know about how these \ntrends impact veterans from the U.S. territories.\n  As policymakers, we must first understand the different needs of \nthese groups of veterans and then be ready to adapt VA policies and \nprograms to help all veterans access the resources they need to be \nsuccessful. This bill will enable us to do that.\n  I want to thank the leadership on this important issue and my \ncolleague from across the aisle for being an original cosponsor of this \nbill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I don't have any speakers on \nthis. So I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 16\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. minutes remaining.\n\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Takano).\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for \nyielding.\n  I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 5212, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, the initial transition from military to civilian life is \noften the most difficult time for returning veterans. The Federal \nTransition Assistance Program, otherwise known as TAP, is designed to \nease that shift by teaching veterans about their benefits and preparing \nthem to enter the workforce, attend school, or both.\n  As the ranking member noted, the program has largely been successful. \nVeteran unemployment is at a 7-year low.\n  However, supporting transitioning veterans requires more than a one-\nsize-fits-all program. There are more than 135,000 former \nservicemembers in my district, and just one approach cannot meet the \nneeds of every individual.\n\n[[Page H2918]]\n\nCertain veteran communities are still being left behind.\n  Women veterans, Native American veterans, veterans from the U.S. \nterritories, and veterans with disabilities face challenges and aspire \nto jobs that differ from the broader population of returning \nservicemembers. We cannot be satisfied with a program that allows large \ngroups of veterans to slip through the cracks.\n  The Improving Transition Programs for All Veterans Act is a \nbipartisan bill that requires the VA to launch a research program \nexamining if and how the current program meets the needs of minority \nveterans groups.\n  In collaboration with the Departments of Labor and Defense, the bill \nwould require the VA to recommend changes to TAP that would address \nbarriers and better serve these veterans in their pursuit of meaningful \nemployment following their military service.\n  More than ever before, our military reflects America's diverse mix of \npeople and cultures. Each of these transitioning servicemembers, \nregardless of gender, race, or disability, has made the same commitment \nto defending this Nation.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  All of them deserve our full support when they return home.\n  I am proud to have introduced this bill with the gentlewoman from \nAmerican Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen).\n  I want to thank Mr. Wenstrup, chair of the Economic Opportunity \nSubcommittee, and Chairman Miller for their support in moving this \nforward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to promptly pass this \nlegislation.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss bipartisan efforts \nto improve the work our Nation does to care for our veterans.\n  Next week we will be honoring those who gave their lives for this \ncountry on Memorial Day. We will commemorate the lives and the \nsacrifices of those who died while wearing the uniform of the United \nStates of America. We will rightly recognize their courage and \ncommitment, but we must also ensure we continue to recognize the same \ncourage and dedication found in our veterans and Active-Duty personnel \nand the challenges that many of them face as they transition into \ncivilian life.\n  The Improving Transition Programs for All Veterans Act will allow \nCongress, the VA, and the Departments of Labor and Defense to better \nunderstand these challenges. The study created by this bill will allow \nus to understand what is working, what is not working, and how veterans \ncan best be placed in a position to succeed once they transition to \ncivilian life.\n  It will allow us to better understand the challenges, the unique \nchallenges, faced by the growing number of female veterans in our \npopulation, a group that generally has a higher unemployment rate and \nlower post-military salaries than their male counterparts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that we can \nmore effectively allocate resources dedicated to assisting veterans in \ntheir transition out of uniform and support several other great \nveterans bills on the floor today that would assist veteran caregivers \nand ensure that the VA develops plans to hire permanent medical center \ndirectors.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the \nbipartisan committee for coming up with this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3956, as amended, the VA \nHealth Center Management Stability and Improvement Act. H.R. 3956, as \namended, is sponsored by my good friend, colleague, and fellow \ncommittee member, Congressman Bost of Illinois.\n  H.R. 3956, as amended, also contains provisions from H.R. 4977, the \nVA Scheduling Accountability Act, which is sponsored by Congresswoman \nJackie Walorski from Indiana, who is also an active Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee member.\n  There has been a tremendous amount of turnover among the Department \nof Veterans Affairs medical center leaders in the last few years. \nAccording to the Deputy Secretary of VA Sloan Gibson, over half of \nVeterans Health Administration senior leader positions turned over from \nOctober 2013 to October 2015. Without consistent, high-quality \nleadership in VA medical centers, our veterans aren't being served as \nwell as they could be or they should be.\n  H.R. 3956, as amended, would direct VA to develop and implement a \nplan to hire a director for each VA medical center without a permanent \ndirector and prioritize hiring at VA medical centers that have not had \na permanent director for the longest periods of time. Once stable \nleadership is in place, we need to ensure that they are held \naccountable.\n  One of the contributing factors behind the access to care crisis that \nplagued the VA healthcare system in 2014 was the failure of VA medical \ncenters to comply with VA scheduling policies. To avoid that in the \nfuture, H.R. 3956, as amended, would require VA to ensure that \ndirectives and policies apply uniformly across the entire department \nand require VA medical center directors to annually certify compliance \nwith the scheduling directive or any successor directive that replaces \nit. If a facility fails to comply, leaders at that facility would be \nprohibited from receiving a bonus.\n  I am grateful to both Congressman Bost and Congresswoman Walorski for \ntheir efforts on this legislation on behalf of our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. \n3956, as amended.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3956, as amended. This \nbill finds that multiple VA centers are managed by acting or temporary \ndirectors--some of these centers have lacked a permanent director for a \nlong time; there are time limits as to how long a Senior Executive \nService employee can be placed in a temporary position--that there is \nfrequent turnover of medical center directors, impeding the medical \ncenter's ability to engage in long-term planning and other necessary \nfunctions; and that the VA should develop a comprehensive plan to \nrecruit permanent directors at each medical center that lacks a \npermanent director.\n  This bill requires the VA to come up with a plan to fill all of the \npositions that are not currently held by a permanent director. They \nthen will report back to Congress on their progress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from the 12th District of Illinois (Mr. Bost), the sponsor of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, as a marine and the father of a marine, I \nunderstand it takes leadership to win a battle. However, at VA medical \ncenters across this country, we have seen a revolving door of temporary \ndirectors that has made it difficult to implement the long-term reforms \nour heroes deserve. This first came to my attention in my own backyard.\n  Many southern Illinois veterans receive treatment at the VA Medical \nCenter in St. Louis. This facility has struggled to find a permanent \ndirector since July 14, 2013. That is 34 months ago. It is a similar \nstory at roughly three dozen other VA hospitals nationwide.\n  Part of the problem is rooted in the fact that the Office of \nPersonnel Management only allows temporary directors to serve a term of \n120 to 240 days. How are we ever going to clean up the VA if no one is \naround long enough to do it?\n  That is why I introduced H.R. 3956, the VA Health Center Management \nStability and Improvement Act. My bipartisan legislation, introduced \nwith Congressman Costa, will help close the revolving door at the VA \nclinics. It requires the VA to report to Congress on any unfilled \nvacancies and identify roadblocks that may have led to the problem to \nbegin with. It requires the VA to develop a plan of action for hiring \nhighly qualified and permanent directors for each and every opening. It \ntells the VA to access opportunities for promoting and training high-\nperforming candidates from within the organization.\n  The status quo is unacceptable, as it determines the quality, \nconsistency, and speed of care that our veterans receive. Mr. Speaker, \nI urge my colleagues to join The American Legion, AMVETS, Disabled \nVeterans of America, and other service organizations by supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3956, as \namended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from the Second District of Indiana (Mrs. Walorski)\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. I thank the chairman for all his hard work on many VA \nissues in reference to veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3956, the VA Health \nCenter Management Stability and Improvement Act. This legislation \nincludes my bill, the VA Scheduling Accountability Act, which locks in \na crucial measure of oversight over VA scheduling practices.\n  Hearings held by the Veterans' Affairs Committee and investigations \nby the VA inspector general and the GAO have, unfortunately, \nsubstantiated many of the allegations of manipulated schedules and \nfalsified wait time data at VA facilities across the country.\n\n[[Page H2920]]\n\n  VA Directive 2010-027 contains the VA's policy for appointment \nscheduling processes and procedures. It contains a checklist with 19 \ndifferent items, such as ensuring that a patient's desired appointment \ndate is not altered and that the staff have appropriate training.\n  Importantly, the directive requires each facility to annually certify \nits full compliance with all 19 items. However, an August 2014 VA \nOffice of Inspector General report uncovered that in May of 2013, a \nsenior VA official waived the certification requirement for FY 2013. \nThis essentially put facilities on the honor system by allowing them to \nonly self-certify. Without this crucial accountability mechanism, bad \nactors were given free rein to manipulate the wait time data and allow \ncompliance with scheduling practices to deteriorate. Meanwhile, \nveterans died waiting for appointments while others faced delays in \ngetting the critical care they needed. I am glad that the VA has \nreinstated the certification requirement, but I am concerned there is \nnothing stopping them from waiving it again.\n  H.R. 3956, the VA Scheduling Accountability Act, requires each \nfacility director to annually certify compliance with the scheduling \ndirective, or any successive directive that replaces it, and, most \nimportantly, prohibits any future waivers. In addition, it prohibits \nthe VA from giving bonuses to directors if their facility fails to \ncertify compliance, and it requires the VA to report to Congress a list \nof facilities not in compliance. This will provide more oversight of \nthe VA, ensure Congress is aware on noncompliant facilities, and end \nthe reckless practice of self-certification.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill \nand the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3956, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to direct \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop and implement a plan to \nhire directors of the medical centers of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and for other purposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2920-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2920-H2921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1715\n        SERGEANT FIRST CLASS WILLIAM ``KELLY'' LACEY POST OFFICE\n\n  Mr. WALKER.

Sergeant Lacey was on a \ntour of duty in Afghanistan when he was killed in action on January 4, \n2014.\n  During his time in the Army, Sergeant Lacey earned more than 30 \nmilitary awards and decorations, including a Bronze Star with Valor and \ntwo more Bronze Star Medals.\n  Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Lacey exemplified leadership throughout his \ncareer.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller).\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. \nWalker.\n  A little over 2 years ago, northwest Florida and our Nation lost a \nwarrior and a patriot upon the death of Army Sergeant First Class \nWilliam ``Kelly'' Lacey. Kelly was assigned to the 201st Brigade \nSupport Battalion, 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Infantry Division \nout of Fort Knox, Kentucky, and was killed on January 4, 2014, in \nNangarhar province, Afghanistan, while in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom.\n  Today I stand before you to honor this true American hero by \ndesignating the facility of the United States Postal Service, located \nat 3957 2nd Avenue in Laurel Hill, Florida, as the Sergeant First Class \nWilliam ``Kelly'' Lacey Post Office.\n  Kelly had served three tours in Iraq and was completing his second \ntour in Afghanistan when his life was tragically taken. During the \nmission that took his life, Kelly protected fellow soldiers during an \nattack where a car bomb had breached his base perimeter, allowing \nmultiple combatants, many bearing suicide vests, to initiate an \nassault. Kelly took a guard tower and began providing cover fire, \nkilling three assailants before a rocket-propelled grenade took his \nlife. He was scheduled to return home just 2 weeks from the time of his \ndeath.\n  We must never forget, nor take for granted, the many liberties we \nenjoy as Americans--liberties earned and fortified by soldiers like \nKelly, who never hesitate when called upon. Kelly bravely dedicated his \nlife to protect our freedom. While there is nothing we can do today to \nbring Kelly back to us and take away the pain that is felt by his loved \nones that have been left behind, we can help memorialize his ultimate \nsacrifice.\n  America's sovereignty and democracy is deeply rooted in the \ncourageous\n\n[[Page H2921]]\n\nacts of our men and women in the Armed Forces, who willingly serve \nknowing that at any time they could pay the ultimate sacrifice. \nRenaming the post office will help ensure that future generations \nforever remember that sacrifice and understand the true cost of \nfreedom.\n  I ask my colleagues for your support on this legislation.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Ross Andrew McGinnis was born and raised in Knox, \n     Pennsylvania, the son of Tom and Romayne McGinnis.\n       (2) Specialist McGinnis joined the Army in 2004 and \n     following his training, was assigned to 1st Platoon, C \n     Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade \n     Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division.\n       (3) On December 4, 2006, McGinnis was killed in action \n     while serving in Iraq. For his actions that day, he was \n     awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by President George \n     W. Bush on June 2, 2008.\n       (4) From the official Medal of Honor Army Citation:\n       (A) Private First Class Ross A. McGinnis, United States \n     Army. For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk \n     of his life above and beyond the call of duty.\n       (B) Private First Class Ross A. McGinnis distinguished \n     himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond \n     the call of duty while serving as an M2 .50-caliber Machine \n     Gunner, 1st Platoon, C Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry \n     Regiment, in connection with combat operations against an \n     armed enemy in Adhamiyah, Northeast Baghdad, Iraq, on 4 \n     December 2006.\n       (C) That afternoon his platoon was conducting combat \n     control operations in an effort to reduce and control \n     sectarian violence in the area. While Private McGinnis was \n     manning the M2 .50-caliber Machine Gun, a fragmentation \n     grenade thrown by an insurgent fell through the gunner's \n     hatch into the vehicle. Reacting quickly, he yelled \n     ``grenade,'' allowing all four members of his crew to prepare \n     for the grenade's blast. Then, rather than leaping from the \n     gunner's hatch to safety, Private McGinnis made the \n     courageous decision to protect his crew. In a selfless act of \n     bravery, in which he was mortally wounded, Private McGinnis \n     covered the live grenade, pinning it between his body and the \n     vehicle and absorbing most of the explosion.\n       (D) Private McGinnis' gallant action directly saved four \n     men from certain serious injury or death. Private First Class \n     McGinnis' extraordinary heroism and selflessness at the cost \n     of his own life, above and beyond the call of duty, are in \n     keeping with the highest traditions of the military service \n     and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the \n     United States Army.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. Speaker, in just a few days, people \nacross the Nation will pause on Memorial Day to remember the men and \nwomen who paid the ultimate sacrifice, losing their lives as members of \nAmerica's Armed Forces.\n  As a Member of Congress and an Army dad, with my son, Logan, being \nwounded in Iraq, I know some of the struggles our military families go \nthrough every day. I also know how courageous and strong our fighting \nmen and women are, and the bravery of those who did not make it home.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 433, which renames the United States Post \nOffice in Knox, Pennsylvania, as the Specialist Ross A. McGinnis \nMemorial Post Office, a designation which will honor an exceptionally \nbrave young man.\n  Medal of Honor recipient Ross A. McGinnis was born June 14, 1987, \nFlag Day, in Meadville, Pennsylvania, the son of Tom and Romayne \nMcGinnis. He was killed in the line of duty on December 4, 2006, while \nserving in Iraq.\n  Ross grew up in the community of Knox, located in Pennsylvania's \nFifth Congressional District. He attended Clarion County Public Schools \nand was a member of the Boy Scouts, along with participating in \nbasketball, soccer, and Little League Baseball. He was a member of the \nSt. Paul's Lutheran Church in Knox, and a 2005 graduate of Keystone \nJunior-Senior High School.\n  Ross had long wanted to be a soldier, and in 2004, on his 17th \nbirthday, he visited an Army recruiting center and joined the delayed \nentry program.\n  Following his initial training, Ross was deployed to eastern Baghdad \nin August of 2006. He served as an M2 .50-caliber machine gunner in the \n1st Platoon, C Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, in \nsupport of operations intended to combat an intense insurgency in that \nregion.\n  On December 4, 2006, McGinnis' platoon was on mounted patrol in\n\n[[Page H2922]]\n\nAdhamiyah. During the course of the patrol, an insurgent on a nearby \nrooftop threw a grenade into the vehicle Ross was riding in. Without \nhesitation or regard for his own life, McGinnis threw his body on top \nof the grenade, saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. Posthumously, \nhe was promoted to Specialist and was awarded the Silver Star.\n  On June 2, 2008, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. In part, his \ncitation reads his ``extraordinary heroism and selflessness at the cost \nof his own life, above and beyond the call of duty, are in keeping with \nthe highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit \nupon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.''\n  It is my hope that through the naming of this post office, his \nheroism and selflessness will live long through the ages.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, again, I urge the passage of H.R. 433.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 433.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2922-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2922-H2923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CHIEF PETTY OFFICER ADAM BROWN UNITED STATES POST OFFICE\n\n  Mr. WALKER.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3931, introduced by Congressman Bruce \nWesterman of Arkansas. H.R. 3931 designates the post office located at \n620 Central Avenue, Suite 1A, in Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas, \nas the Chief Petty Officer Adam Brown United States Post Office.\n  Chief Petty Officer Adam Brown was a true American hero and someone \nwho I hope will serve as an inspiration to many. Adam went from drug \naddiction, theft, and prison time to a life devoted to faith, family, \nand country.\n  A decorated Navy SEAL, Adam served multiple tours of duty and lost an \neye and multiple fingers, but returned to duty nonetheless. One tour in \nAfghanistan was not just to fight for his country. He went to give away \n500 pairs of shoes to Afghan children that he had collected as a \npersonal project.\n  Adam's legacy should live on in our hearts and minds as well as in \nphysical remembrance. I urge Members to support this bill and name a \npost office after this hero, Chief Petty Officer Adam Brown.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 3931, a bill to \ndesignate the facility of the United States Postal Service, located in \nHot Springs National Park, Arkansas, as the Chief Petty Officer Adam \nBrown United States Post Office.\n  Adam Brown never did anything halfway. He was always ready to push \naside his own needs to help others. Adam joined the Navy in 1998. It \nwas not long before he became a Navy SEAL and eventually served as a \nmember of the elite SEAL Team Six and a special operations task force \ndeployed to Afghanistan.\n  Again, we have the opportunity here in Congress to recognize \nsometimes the quiet, but amazing, contributions of our military and of \nthis individual we bring forward to be named today. We should pass this \nbill to remember the tenacity of Chief Petty Officer Brown and to honor \nhis valiant military service.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the fine gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Westerman).\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, Jesus said: ``Greater love has no one \nthan this, that he lay down his life for his friends.'' This poignant \nverse is inscribed on the headstone of Arkansas and American hero and \nHot Springs native Chief Petty Officer Adam Brown. Adam's story is a \nstory of loyalty and dedication to the American way of life, and it is \nan inspiring testament to overcoming adversity through faith.\n  True to the Navy SEAL creed, Adam's strength and leadership abilities \nwere forged by adversity. Although Adam's eagerness for risk led to \ntrouble in his youth, his determination to do the right thing, fueled \nby a love for his family, faith, and country, led him to become a \nmember of the elite SEAL Team Six.\n  On March 17, 2010, while conducting a raid on an enemy stronghold in \nKomar province, Afghanistan, Chief Petty Officer Adam Brown selflessly \nplaced himself in the enemy's line of fire to protect and assist his \nbrothers in arms.\n  Though his brave actions relieved the fire on his teammates and \nultimately led to the capture of the stronghold, Adam was struck and \nkilled by enemy fire. Many Members of this body as well as countless \nothers have read Adam's inspiring life story in the best-selling book \n``Fearless.''\n  Mr. Speaker, during this week before Memorial Day, it is my hope that \nthis piece of legislation will not only serve to honor Chief Petty \nOfficer Brown, but that it will also honor all of the men and women \nfrom Arkansas' Fourth Congressional District who have laid down their \nlives in defense of the United States of America and freedom.\n  As we remember the fallen, let us also remember those who gave \nmentally, physically, and emotionally, people like Lieutenant Colonel \nHugh Mills, Jr., who survived his helicopter being shot down 16 times \nand who was awarded three Silver Stars for his heroic actions in \nVietnam.\n  I thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings and the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee for their attention to this \npiece of legislation.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 3931.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3953, introduced by Congressman Gus \nBilirakis of Florida. H.R. 3953 designates the post office located at \n4122 Madison Street, in Elfers, Florida, as the Private First Class \nFelton Roger Fussell Memorial Post Office.\n  Roger Fussell enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1969 at the age of 18 \nand left for Vietnam in that same year. Exactly 1 year after he \nenlisted, Fussell was tragically killed by enemy fire. Private First \nClass Felton Roger Fussell volunteered his service and lost his life \nall too soon while fighting for a country he believed in.\n  I urge Members to support this bill that names a post office in his \nhonor. In a moment, I will yield to its sponsor, my friend, Congressman \nBilirakis, to tell us more about Private First Class Felton Roger \nFussell.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I join with my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 3953, a bill \nto designate the facility of the United States Postal Service, located \nin Elfers, Florida, as Private First Class Felton Roger Fussell \nMemorial Post Office.\n  Roger Fussell received numerous awards for his honorable service, \nincluding an Expert Marksman Medal, a Vietnamese Military Merit Medal, \nthe Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross, and a Purple Heart.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to create and \npreserve the memory of Private First Class Fussell's achievements and \nto honor the ultimate sacrifice he made on behalf of this country.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3953, \nlegislation to designate the Elfers post office as the Private First \nClass Felton Roger Fussell Memorial Post Office.\n  I never had a chance to meet Private First Class Felton Roger \nFussell, but after working on this legislation with his family and \nfriends, I wish I had.\n  Private Fussell was born in New Port Richey, Florida, and graduated \nfrom Gulf High School in 1968. Despite his love for hunting, fishing, \nand repairing old cars, Private Fussell pursued his calling by \nenlisting in the Marine Corps.\n  On June 6, 1968, Private Fussell entered the service along with his \nfriend, Jack Mathison, under the Buddy System program. They went to \nbasic training at Parris Island, South Carolina, where Roger was the \nhigh shooter for his platoon.\n  He also was honored with the Expert Marksman Medal for superior \nscores in rifle range shooting. Private Fussell then continued on to \nadvanced infantry training at Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton.\n  Private Fussell departed for Vietnam in March of 1969 and served with \nhonor and distinction. On the 1-year anniversary of his enlistment, he \nwas killed by mortar fire in service of his country.\n  For his bravery and sacrifice, Private Fussell earned several awards, \nincluding the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross, which is awarded for \nacts of valor and heroic conduct during an armed conflict.\n  He also received the Vietnamese Military Merit Medal, which is the \nhighest military decoration that was bestowed by South Vietnam during \nthe Vietnam war.\n  Clearly, Private First Class Felton Roger Fussell is a hero who is \ndeserving of having his hometown's post office in Elfers, Florida, \ndedicated in his honor.\n  I have worked closely with Roger's family and with the entire Elfers \ncommunity on this legislation to help solidify the memory of Private \nFussell's bravery, American spirit, and optimism.\n  His actions served as an inspiration for his brother, Timothy, who \nhas gone on to serve his community as chief of the Port Richey Fire \nDepartment.\n  Honoring Private Fussell with the Elfers post office's designation \nalso honors the work of his sister, Myra. Myra served her community in \nthis very post office for 20 years.\n  Let's honor this American hero and his family by passing H.R. 3953 \nand by designating the Elfers post office as the Private First Class \nFelton Roger Fussell Memorial Post Office.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE.

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott), the sponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank \nChairman Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee, for helping me, for working with me, and for taking \ntime with me in getting this bill through the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee and here on the House floor for a vote before we break \nfor the Memorial Day holiday observance.\n  Chairman Chaffetz and I had a wonderful conversation, and we both \nagreed that we wanted to get this bill out before the Memorial Day \nobservance because this bill represents a most appropriate way for us \nto begin the observance of Memorial Day.\n  I thank Ranking Member Elijah Cummings. I want to thank, also, the \ncommittee members of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I \nwant to thank Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Speaker Paul Ryan for \ntheir help in moving expeditiously with this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you that the idea for this bill came to \nme directly from the heart and the soul of the wonderful people of \nRiverdale, Georgia, who truly love and endear Major Barney.\n  Riverdale, Georgia, is an extraordinary city with a rich history. It \nis led by Mayor Evelyn Wynn-Dixon, Police Chief Todd Spivey, council \nmembers Cynthia Stamps-Jones, An'Cel Davis, Wanda Wallace, and Kenny \nRuffin. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, council members Stamps-Jones \nand An'Cel Davis stopped by my office in Jonesboro and presented this \nidea to me.\n  I want to thank my chief of staff, Michael Andel, and my senior \nstaffer here in Washington, William Burriss, for their tremendous work \nin helping. I also thank my district director, Chandra Harris, and \ndeputy district director, Isaac DoDoo, for working with us in Georgia.\n  Now I want to say the other important thing about this bill. This is \ntruly a bipartisan bill. This bill honoring Major Barney is cosponsored \nby all 14 members of the Georgia congressional delegation, Democrats \nand Republicans, and by both of our United States Senators, Johnny \nIsakson and David Perdue, who will handle this in the Senate.\n  I want to thank, as I look over and I see some of my Republican \nfriends and colleagues on the floor, Tom Price, Lynn Westmoreland, and \nJody Hice for joining us here for this important bill.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, why we are here?\n  On February 11, 2016, Major Gregory E. Barney, who also, notably, was \nthe very first African American interim police chief in the history of \nRiverdale, Georgia, was fatally shot in the line of duty while he was \nserving a warrant for the arrest of a drug dealer, the dregs of our \ncommunity right now. Major Barney stepped up and responded. He was \nworking with a detail of the Clayton County Police, their narcotics \nunit and their SWAT team; and they were there to put forward this \nwarrant for this arrest, and the drug dealer shot Mr. Barney.\n  Now, the day of this tragic death, also, Mr. Speaker, the 11th of \nFebruary, there was something else significant. It also marked the \nanniversary of his 25-year career. Major Barney was shot on the 25th \nanniversary of his 25 years of service to the Clayton County and \nRiverdale police forces.\n  So I know, with a heavy heart and deep condolences, that each of us \nin this United States Congress takes this moment to extend our \nheartfelt condolences to the family of Major Barney: his lovely wife, \nLisa, and his two sons, Gregory and Robert. Mr. Speaker, these were \ntwin boys who have lost their father.\n  It is most fitting, also, Mr. Speaker, that the post office that we \nare naming for Major Barney is located directly across the street from \nthe Riverdale Police Department headquarters now. Mr. Speaker, it is \nalso within the view of the apartment complex where the drug raid took \nplace where Major Barney lost his life.\n  Mr. Speaker, Major Barney became the first police officer in \nRiverdale, Georgia, to be slain in the line of duty.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we are here and we look forward to that day when we \nname this post office, we hope that in some small way that, to the \nfamily, to his children, to the people of Riverdale, Georgia, and the \npeople of this Nation, when they pass by this post office, they will be \nable to pass by with a sense of great pride, great respect, and great \ngratitude for Major Barney, who was truly a Georgia hero.\n  Not only was Major Barney a Georgia hero, he was an American hero. \nFor, as you and I and all of us here in Congress know, when we \nrecognize Major Barney, we are recognizing so many of our brave men and \nwomen who put their lives on the line every single day to protect us in \nlaw enforcement and in the military.\n  Mr. Speaker, Jesus Christ, just a few hours before he was crucified, \nsaid to his disciples: This is my commandment: that you love one \nanother as I loved you.\n  And then Jesus said: Greater love hath no man than this, that a man \nlay down his life for his friend.\n  Mr. Speaker, such a man was Major Gregory E. Barney.\n  I ask this House for a unanimous ``yes'' vote.\n  God bless you.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Tom Price).\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to join my \ncolleagues today to honor Major Greg Barney, who was tragically shot \nand killed, as has been defined, in the line of duty on February 11, \nthis year, while serving in the city of Riverdale, Georgia.\n  Major Barney was a United States Navy veteran and had served with the \nRiverdale Police Department for over 25 years, including as a school \nresource officer at Riverdale High School. We all know what a selfless \nrole that is, a true labor of love. Major Barney embodied the kind of \ncourageous and valiant men and women we all want on our police forces.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Georgia's Sixth District, I offer our \ndeepest condolences to his wife, Lisa, and their 15-year-old twin boys, \nRobert and Greg, and their family and friends. I offer our heartfelt \ngratitude for his service and sacrifice. It is because of his type of \nheroism that we all feel protected in our communities.\n\n  So this is a fitting tribute, Mr. Speaker, and I ask my colleagues to \njoin us in support of H.R. 4747, to designate the facility of the \nUnited States Postal Service located on Church Street in Riverdale, \nGeorgia, as the Major Gregory E. Barney Post Office Building.\n  My colleague David Scott has worked tirelessly on this bill, and I am \nproud to be a cosponsor. I thank Congressman Scott for his efforts and \nthis House for your support.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 4747, \na bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service \nlocated in Riverdale, Georgia, as the Major Gregory E. Barney Post \nOffice Building.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor Major Gregory Barney's \n25 years of service to his community, in addition to his service to his \ncountry and to commemorate the life that he led. I urge its passage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H2925]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina for yielding.\n  I also rise in support of H.R. 4747, to designate the U.S. post \noffice in honor of Riverdale Police Major Gregory E. Barney.\n  I also sincerely want to thank Congressman David Scott from Georgia's \n13th District for his great leadership on this bill.\n  As has been spoken already, Major Barney led a life of service both \nto his community and of devotion to his family. Starting his career as \na firefighter and then later serving in an ambulance squad, Major \nBarney joined the Riverdale Police Department in 1990. There he served \nfor the next 25 years, as has already been mentioned, serving, \nultimately, as the first African American chief of police in Riverdale.\n  Tragically, as we have heard tonight, his life ended in a shooting \nwhile trying to execute a no-knock warrant. On that tragic night of \nFebruary 11, he gave his life trying to bring drug dealers to justice. \nAlthough I did not know him personally, from all accounts, Major Greg \nBarney died just as he lived: going above and beyond the call of duty \nto make his community a better place.\n  It is fitting that the Riverdale Post Office that we are discussing \nis directly across the street from the Riverdale Police Department. It \nwill serve as a daily reminder to all who enter those buildings of \nMajor Barney's dedication to the community and of his valor in the line \nof duty.\n  Also, as has been mentioned, I would like for us to remember his \nloving wife, Lisa, and twin teenage boys, Robert and Greg, in our \nthoughts and prayers while they continue to mourn his passing.\n  I urge our colleagues to support H.R. 4747.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Westmoreland).\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I am honored today that my colleague, \nCongressman David Scott, asked me to participate in this.\n  My father was a firefighter for 26 years in the city of Atlanta, and \nhe died answering an alarm in 1972. So I understand the heartache of a \nfamily when a loved one goes to do their job, to be that first \nresponder, that first person on the scene, and does not come back.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  I think it is particularly interesting that, in this case, this \nofficer and his colleagues were serving a no-knock warrant. No-knock \nwarrants are issued by a judge because they are basically the most \nprotective type of warrant for a police officer because they go in, and \nthey know there is criminal activity or there are drug sales, gambling, \nor whatever the circumstance is, that they can go in.\n  Major Barney was out in the field and happened to give chase to a \ngentleman who ran out the back door. A lot of times when these first \nresponders put their lives on the line, I don't think people understand \nthat they have got a wife, such as he had, Lisa, sons, Robert and Greg, \nwho he wanted to go home to that night. Those boys wanted their daddy \nto come home, and that wife wanted her husband to come home. He was out \nserving the community.\n  I think that is one of the great attributes that, if you look at \nMajor Barney and how other people looked at him, it is what he did for \nhis family, what he did for his community and all the different \nservices that have already been mentioned here tonight. A lot of times, \nfor some reason, the public does not want to understand that these law \nenforcement officers, these first responders, these medics who go out \nand do this, they do this for the protection of all of us--at the risk \nof their lives. Major Barney gave the ultimate sacrifice.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I think, as we remember his family and \nthe other families tonight, we should remember them for a while and \nthank them.\n  We have just recently had another officer who was killed. We have to \nremember these people and their families and not only pray for the \nprotection of the public servant, but pray for those families that, \nwhen that loved one leaves their house, like in my case, and you don't \nknow whether your loved one is coming back, pray for them that they \nwould have that strength and that encouragement and that love to let \nthat loved one go do their job.\n  How appropriate, as has been mentioned, that this post office is \nright across the street from the Riverdale Police Department. A post \noffice is somewhere where the community comes and gathers and talks. I \ndon't think there is any more honorable tribute. I have lived in \nRiverdale. I know that area. I know that post office. I know how the \ncommunity respects that, so there could be no greater tribute than to \nhave a post office named after you.\n  I want to encourage all my colleagues to help us send a great message \nto this hero's family and support H.R. 4747.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott), my \nfriend, for letting me participate in this.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4747.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2925-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2925-H2926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           LCPL GARRETT W.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALKER. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4877, introduced by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson). H.R. 4877 designates the post office \nlocated at 3130 Grants Lake Boulevard in Sugar Land, Texas, as the LCpl \nGarrett W. Gamble, USMC Post Office Building.\n  Lance Corporal Gamble was a determined young man. Before he even \ngraduated high school, he already decided to join the Marines. Less \nthan a year after being deployed in Afghanistan, Gamble was killed when \nhe stepped on an enemy land mine.\n\n[[Page H2926]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, Garrett Gamble's life was taken far too soon. Naming a \npost office after him is just a small honor we can give to a man who \ngave his life for his country. I urge Members to support this bill to \nname a post office in Gamble's honor.\n  I will soon yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson), my \ncolleague and the bill's sponsor, to tell us more about the honorable \nsoldier Lance Corporal Garrett W. Gamble.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 4877, \na bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in \nSugar Land, Texas, as LCpl Garrett W. Gamble, USMC Post Office \nBuilding.\n  It has been stated that this amazing young man was only 20 years old \nwhen he gave the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan. Garrett will be \nremembered for his bravery, his determination, and, it has been said, a \nbig personality. He is survived by his parents, stepfather, and two \nyounger brothers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think, again, we are seeing multiple examples of our \nbrave, dedicated citizens in the United States giving the ultimate \nsacrifice. I feel strongly that we should pass this bill to commemorate \nLance Corporal Gamble's sacrifice for his country.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from North Carolina. I \nwould also like to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. \nChaffetz, the ranking member, Mr. Cummings, and the entire committee \nfor getting H.R. 4877 to the House floor this afternoon.\n  This bill names a post office a few miles from my home after Lance \nCorporal Garrett Gamble, United States Marine Corps. Garrett died \ndefending our freedom on March 11, 2010, in Afghanistan. He was 20 \nyears young.\n  Garrett died before I could meet him, but I will never forget him \nbecause of the stories I was told after God called him home. His \nmother, Chelle, told me about a 10-year-old boy who got very angry when \nhe saw those towers fall, the plane crash into the Pentagon, and the \nplane go down in rural Pennsylvania on 9/11. He never wanted to see his \nhomeland attacked like that again. The drive to join the Marine Corps \nhad started, and that drive would never end.\n  Garrett wanted to destroy evil. He knew that joining the Marine Corps \nwas his calling when he saw al Qaeda's evil firsthand. Garrett and some \nmarines were on a foot patrol in a small Afghan village. Garrett must \nhave flashed that big smile because a young Afghan boy waved at \nGarrett. Garrett waved back and held up a small mint for the boy to \nhave.\n  The boy walked up slowly, took the mint, and ran to his father to \nshow him what the American had given him. Garrett watched in horror as \nthe dad beat the tar out of his son. He kicked him; he punched him; he \nknocked him senseless. Garrett wanted to shoot, but he could not. He \ngot back to base and asked the old-timers what the heck happened. Why \ndid that boy get beat for this small mint?\n  The old-timers told him, al Qaeda was watching. When we left, they \nmay go to that man's home and kill that man--the father, his boy, his \nmother, his sisters, his brothers. That was a plea from the father: \nDon't kill my family. My boy did wrong by taking this small mint. \nPlease leave us alone.\n  Garrett knew he was no longer fighting for America; he was fighting \nfor people all over the world who craved freedom.\n  The final story says everything about Garrett. When he finally \nenlisted, he was a junior in high school--Austin High School, the \nBulldogs. He told his best friend: I have done it. I have joined the \nMarine Corps.\n  His best friend became irate. He never thought Garrett would do that. \nHe never thought he would join the Marine Corps. He said: I can't \nbelieve you joined the Marine Corps. You may get killed. I would never, \never join the Corps.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. OLSON. I thank my friend from North Carolina.\n  Garrett, in an act of true human love, put his arms on his best \nfriend's shoulders, looked him square in the eye, and whispered: That \nis why I did it. That is why I did it.\n  Garrett did not earn this honor by his death; he earned it by his \nlife. Because of this bill, Garrett's love will be on permanent display \nat 3130 Grants Lake Boulevard in Sugar Land, Texas, the Garrett W. \nGamble Post Office.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE.

Nelson.\n  On October 1, 2011, Petty Officer Nelson gave his life in service to \nhis country when he was killed on a combat patrol by an explosive \ndevice that struck his vehicle in Zabul province, Afghanistan. His \nselfless and courageous service to our country will never be forgotten. \nThough we cannot repay the ultimate sacrifice that Petty Officer Nelson \nmade while protecting our Nation, his legacy will now have a permanent \nphysical memory through H.R. 4975.\n  This legislation will designate the post office located a 5720 South \n142nd Street, near my home in Omaha, Nebraska, as the Petty Officer 1st \nClass Caleb A.

We have lost \nmany brave men and women who have left this country to protect our \nlife, and I am proud and humbled to stand here before this House to \nhonor the life and bravery of one of those men today.\n  Petty Officer Nelson entered the Navy in the engineering career field \nand graduated from boot camp on October 11, 2005. After graduating from \nNavy technical training, Petty Officer Nelson was accepted to attend \nBasic Underwater Demolition SEAL training. He graduated from SEAL \ntraining in November 2006.\n  As a member of the elite team of Navy SEALs, Petty Officer Nelson \ncontinued to serve his country as a seasoned combat veteran, with a \ndeployment to Iraq in 2009, and a deployment to Afghanistan in March \n2011.\n  Petty Officer Nelson's awards and decorations speak to his selfless \nheroism.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4761, introduced by \nCongresswoman Judy Chu of California.\n  Louis Van Iersel's story is an unbelievable one. Louis came to the \nUnited States from the Netherlands, and he served his new home with \nfervor. On his first day in the United States, he enlisted in the Army \nand soon after was deployed to Europe as part of World War I. He was \nawarded the Medal of Honor for saving hundreds of Americans' lives \nduring the war.\n  At the start of World War II, Louis tried to enlist in the Army \nalongside his sons, but he was turned away because of his age.\n  So what did he do?\n  He enlisted with the Marines instead. Through his life, Van Iersel \ntruly wanted to serve the United States, the country he adopted as his \nhome.\n  I urge Members to support the bill to name a post office in Van \nIersel's honor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the \nlife of Sergeant Louis Van Iersel, a decorated veteran of both World \nWars, by offering a bill to designate the U.S. Post Office in the city \nof Sierra Madre, California, the Louis Van Iersel Post Office.\n  Sergeant Van Iersel was the true embodiment of an American hero. An \nimmigrant from the Netherlands, his acts of heroism began even before \nhe sat foot on American soil. On his voyage to the United States in \n1917, he assisted in the rescue of 27 shipwrecked British soldiers \ntorpedoed by a German vessel.\n  On the very day he arrived in the United States, Mr. Van Iersel \nregistered for the draft and enlisted in the Army. He didn't speak a \nword of English, but he learned while working in the Army kitchen. He \nwas eventually assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division and was deployed \nto France at the end of World War I.\n  It was in France that Mr. Van Iersel showed extraordinary heroism \ntime and time again. He first gained notice when he and a comrade \nbraved German gunfire to carry 17 soldiers to safety. He was then \npromoted to sergeant, when he led a small reconnaissance patrol and \nfound enemy trenches. It was there that he was able to use his native \nlanguage of German to infiltrate them and convince the officer in \ncharge to surrender 60 German soldiers.\n  From there, Mr. Van Iersel increased his efforts to gain information \non German troop movements. In one particularly treacherous situation, \nMr. Van Iersel braved heavy fire to swim across the icy Seine River. He \noverheard German soldiers discussing a heavy artillery barrage that \nwould have wiped out the whole American battalion.\n  With this critical information, he swam back across the river and \nreported his findings, enabling the American troops to take cover \nbefore the attack began. Because of his actions, he saved 1,000 \nAmerican lives. For all his efforts, he was awarded dozen of medals, \nincluding two military medals, the French Croix de Guerre and the \nAmerican Medal of Honor. These are the\n\n[[Page H2928]]\n\nhighest honors that both countries can bestow.\n  At the end of the World War I, Mr. Van Iersel moved to the city of \nSierra Madre, California, in my district. He became a citizen, got \nmarried, and started a family. But then World War II broke out, and Mr. \nVan Iersel knew he could not sit idly by. He and his three sons all \nreported to the Army to enlist and to serve their country. But Mr. Van \nIersel was turned away, because the Army told him he was too old to \nserve.\n  While he would not let this stop him, undeterred, Mr. Van Iersel \ntalked his way into the Marine Corps. He served with the 3rd Marine \nDivision in the Pacific, and safely returned home in 1945.\n  Mr. Van Iersel passed away at the age of 93. But as a longtime \nresident of Sierra Madre, Mr. Van Iersel exemplified the American \nDream, raising his family after he left military service, volunteering \nwith his local Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter, and remaining an \nactive member of the community.\n  I encourage you to honor his extraordinary legacy and vote ``yes'' on \nH.R. 4761.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize \nLouis Van Iersel's unparalleled dedication to our country.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 4761.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER.

Langlais Post Office Building'', as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3218\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SPECIAL WARFARE OPERATOR MASTER CHIEF PETTY \n                   OFFICER (SEAL) LOUIS ``LOU'' J. LANGLAIS POST \n                   OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 1221 State Street, Suite 12, Santa \n     Barbara, California, shall be known and designated as the \n     ``Special Warfare Operator Master Chief Petty Officer (SEAL) \n     Louis `Lou' J. Langlais Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Special Warfare Operator Master Chief \n     Petty Officer (SEAL) Louis `Lou' J. Langlais Post Office \n     Building''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Walker) and the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. \nLawrence) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3218, introduced by \nCongresswoman Lois Capps of California.\n  Master Chief Lou Langlais served in the military for 25 years. He was \nin his final tour in Afghanistan when enemy fire shot down his \nhelicopter, killing him and 29 other Americans.\n  I will ask my colleague and the sponsor of this bill, Congresswoman \nLois Capps, to share the incredible story of Master Chief Langlais, but \nI first want to urge Members to support this bill and name a post \noffice after Special Warfare Operator Master Chief Petty Officer Louis \n``Lou'' J. Langlais. Hearing his story of lifelong service is \ninspiring, and I am hopeful that permanently naming the post office in \nthe remembrance of his sacrifice will serve to inspire generations to \ncome.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps), the sponsor of this bill.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 3218, which \nwould designate the United States Postal Service facility that is \nactually on State Street in Santa Barbara as the Special Warfare \nOperator Master Chief Petty Officer (SEAL) Louis ``Lou'' J. Langlais \nPost Office Building.\n  Lou was a soldier and beloved family man. He dedicated his life to \nprotecting our freedom and our country. This is an important bill not \nonly for my community of Santa Barbara, but for the memory of a brave \nmember of our armed services we lost way too soon. Naming the Santa \nBarbara post office in honor of Lou Langlais is a fitting tribute.\n  Born in Quebec, Lou grew up on the central coast. He was an avid rock \nand mountain climber who spent much of his free time rock climbing some \nof California's most renowned and challenging locations, including \nYosemite National Park and Joshua Tree National Park.\n  After graduating from Santa Barbara High School, Lou joined the Navy \nin 1986. He spent 3 years on a warship before being accepted into and \ngraduating from SEAL training class 162 in February 1989. He was a \nmember of the Navy Parachute Team, the Leap Frogs, and served in the \nPersian Gulf War with distinction and valor.\n  Then in 2000, Lou joined the highly selective Naval Special Warfare \nDevelopment Group, where he eventually rose to become a troop leader in \nthe Navy SEALs' elite Team Six before serving multiple tours in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  During his 25-year military career, Lou earned many personal and unit \ndecorations, including five Bronze Stars with Valor, the Purple Heart, \na Defense Meritorious Service Medal, three Navy and Marine Corps \nAchievement Medals, and three Presidential Unit Citations, as well as \nseveral other campaign and unit decorations.\n  It is also important to note that he is most remembered as a trusted \nfriend, family member, and teammate for so many.\n  On August 6, 2011, Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Langlais was \none of 30 Americans killed in action when their helicopter was shot \ndown in eastern Afghanistan. At the time, he was serving what was \nsupposed to be his very last deployment. He had plans to return home to \nhis family and continue his service as a trainer in the Navy SEAL \nprogram. But alas, he made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Lou is survived by his wife, Anya, and their two sons, Gabe and Jake, \nwho also have given so much for their country. This bill honors them \nfor their sacrifice and perseverance in the face of tragedy.\n  As our community and Nation still mourn, I am proud to have authored \nthis legislation. The naming of the Santa Barbara post office after \nMaster Chief Lou Langlais is a fitting tribute and a way for Santa \nBarbara to remember and honor one of our own.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize the \nincredible achievements of Special Warfare Operator Chief Petty Officer \nLou Langlais as well as the ultimate sacrifice he made for this \ncountry.\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 3218.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H2929]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3218, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill designate \nthe facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1221 State \nStreet, Suite 12, Santa Barbara, California, as the `Special Warfare \nOperator Master Chief Petty Officer (SEAL) Louis ``Lou'' J.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This bill is sponsored by Congressman Joe Heck from Nevada, and I \nthank him for introducing this piece of legislation.\n  Master Chief Petty Officer Jesse Dean was born on August 11, 1947, \nand enlisted in the United States Navy when he was just 17 years old. \nThroughout his time in the Navy, Master Chief Petty Officer Dean served \non numerous ships and on several overseas assignments and earned \nseveral awards and commendations.\n  Master Chief Petty Officer Jesse Dean served our Nation both in and \nout of uniform. He served his fellow veterans and neighbors in Nevada. \nIt is entirely fitting that with the passage of H.R. 3969, as amended, \nwe name the VA community-based outpatient clinic in Laughlin, Nevada, \nthe Master Chief Petty Officer Jesse Dean Department of Veterans \nAffairs Community-Based Outpatient Clinic.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3969, as amended, which would \ndesignate the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient \nclinic in Laughlin, Nevada, as the Master Chief Petty Officer Jesse \nDean Department of Veterans Affairs Community-Based Outpatient Clinic.\n  Master Chief Petty Officer Dean, who passed away in 2014, was a \nhighly decorated Vietnam veteran who served 27 years in the Navy before \nretiring in 1992. He settled in Laughlin and joined the American Legion \nwhere he was revered by fellow members for his selfless service and \ndedication. By all accounts, Master Chief Petty Officer Dean was an \nexemplary sailor and beloved citizen, husband, and father.\n  I understand that when Congressman Heck asked his constituents to \nrecommend a veteran to name this clinic after, Officer Dean was the \nonly name mentioned.\n  Mr. Speaker, Master Chief Petty Officer Dean's dedication to duty, \nhis community, and his country reflected great credit upon himself and \nwas in keeping with the finest ideals of service, selflessness, and \ngiving, making him the ideal namesake for the new veterans clinic in \nLaughlin, Nevada.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heck).\n  Mr. HECK of Nevada. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to urge the House to adopt \nH.R. 3969, legislation I introduced to name the Department of Veterans \nAffairs community-based outpatient clinic in Laughlin, Nevada, in honor \nof Master Chief Petty Officer Jesse Dean.\n  On February 19, 2015, I helped cut the ribbon at the grand opening of \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in \nLaughlin, Nevada. Shortly after the clinic was completed, members of \nthe American Legion Richard Springston Post 60 in Laughlin came to me \nwith an idea that the clinic should be named for a prominent Laughlin \nveteran. As we started the search, one name stood out amongst the rest: \nMaster Chief Petty Officer Jesse Dean.\n  From the time he was a boy, Jesse Dean only wanted to do one thing--\nserve his country as a member of the United States military. In 1965, \nat the age of 17, he enlisted in the Navy. Jesse would go on to serve \n27 years, achieving the highest grade for an enlisted sailor, that of \nmaster chief petty officer.\n  His first sea duty assignment was aboard the aircraft carrier USS \nHornet, and during Vietnam he served as part of the brown-water navy. \nOver his 27-year career, Jesse earned numerous awards and \ncommendations, including three Navy Commendation Medals, two Navy \nAchievement Medals, a Combat Action Ribbon, a Vietnam Service Medal, \nand an Overseas Service Ribbon.\n  Upon his retirement from the Navy in 1992, Jesse moved to Laughlin \nand promptly joined American Legion Post 60. As a member of the Legion, \nJesse was revered by fellow members for his selfless service and \ndedication to the Post and his fellow veterans. He did the majority of \nthe maintenance work on the Post. He drove fellow veterans to medical \nappointments and to the store. He even donated a trailer that he owned \nto be used as a shelter for homeless veterans. Jesse did all of these \nthings and more for the Post and his fellow veterans, but he never \naccepted compensation for his tireless work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I did not have the privilege of knowing Master Chief \nJesse Dean, but it is clear from speaking\n\n[[Page H2932]]\n\nwith community members and veterans in Laughlin that naming the new VA \nclinic in his honor is a fitting tribute.\n  The master chief was called to his final duty station in 2014. Today \nwe have a chance to repay him with a resounding Bravo Zulu for his \nyears of dedication to Laughlin American Legion Post 60, to the veteran \ncommunity of Laughlin, and to the United States Navy by naming the new \nVA health clinic in his honor.\n  I thank all of the members of the Nevada Congressional Delegation for \nbacking this building naming as well as to thank the members of the \nAmerican Legion Richard Springston Post 60 in Laughlin for working with \nus on this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3969 to name the Department of \nVeterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Laughlin, Nevada, \nin honor of Master Chief Petty Officer Jesse Dean.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As we enter into the Memorial Day celebration, I want to point out \nthat, like Master Chief Petty Officer Dean and many Vietnam veterans, \nwhen they returned, this country did not receive them as we should have \nand thank them for their service.\n  Of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, only 3 of them are \npart of the VA system. I would like for all of us to reach out to the \nVietnam veterans and to first thank them all for their service and then \nfor all of us to soldier up and man up and to let them know we love \nthem, that we appreciate them, and that we appreciate their service.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3969, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Walker) and the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. \nLawrence) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4425, which was introduced by Congressman \nTom Emmer of Minnesota. H.R. 4425 designates the post office located at \n110 East Powerhouse Road in Collegeville, Minnesota, as the Eugene J. \nMcCarthy Post Office.\n  Former Senator Eugene McCarthy dedicated much of his life to service. \nSenator McCarthy served his faith through his work at St. Thomas \nCollege, and he served his country as a code breaker for the Army in \nthe War Department.\n  After leaving the Army, he continued to serve in the public sector as \na Representative in the House and then in the Senate for the \nDemocratic-Farmer-Labor Party. Near the end of his life, Senator \nMcCarthy had a post office named after him in Twin Cities, Minnesota. \nThat post office has since been closed.\n  We will soon hear more about Senator McCarthy from my colleague, \nCongressman Tom Emmer, the bill's sponsor. For now, I urge Members to \nsupport this bill to rename a post office in remembrance of Eugene J. \nMcCarthy.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 4425, \na bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in \nCollegeville, Minnesota, as the Eugene J. McCarthy Post Office.\n  Mr. McCarthy had many successes. He served as a politician. He served \nin the military. He taught and was an educator. He was one of our \ncolleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives and later in the \nSenate.\n  Ultimately, he entered the Presidential race to become President of \nthe United States. Although he did not win that nomination, I feel \nstrongly in urging the passage of H.R. 4425.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank Eugene McCarthy's \ndaughter, Ellen, and St. John's University president Dr. Michael \nHemesath and Dr. Matthew Lindstrom from the Eugene J. McCarthy Center \nfor Public Policy & Civic Engagement at the College of Saint Benedict \nand St. John's University for their help in making this dedication \npossible. The staff and students of this center provide valuable \nevents, lectures, and discussions that engage the entire community \nsurrounding Collegeville, Minnesota.\n  I rise today to honor Senator Eugene McCarthy, a man who is \nremembered for shaking up the D.C. establishment and for being a \ndriving force behind the level of civic engagement Minnesota has today.\n  In the year which would have been his 100th birthday, I am proud to \nhave the full Minnesota delegation's support for dedicating the post \noffice at St. John's University--the college where McCarthy grew up, \nstudied, and taught--after this great public servant.\n  If recent years in politics have taught us anything, it is that the \nAmerican people are tired of the status quo. They value independent \nthinking and honest, plain-spoken leaders. Eugene McCarthy was a \npatriotic American who valued his faith and his country, but who was \nnot afraid to speak out when he believed our Nation was headed down the \nwrong path.\n  He left his Benedictine studies to serve his country in World War II \nas a code breaker in the Military Intelligence Division of the War \nDepartment. Serving in the Army gave McCarthy a firsthand perspective \non the level of dedication and sacrifice our Nation's servicemembers \ngive in furtherance of a just cause.\n  McCarthy is best known for effectively ending the political career of \nhis party's presumptive Presidential nominee. As the country tired of \nwatching\n\n[[Page H2933]]\n\ntheir sons die in Vietnam without there being a winning strategy, \nMcCarthy challenged Lyndon Johnson for the Presidential nomination in \n1968.\n  In a party that struggled to justify its failed foreign policies, \nMcCarthy garnered a substantial percentage of the New Hampshire \nprimary, causing a severe blow to then-President Johnson's prospects as \nwell as opening a door for Robert Kennedy, a young Senator from New \nYork, to challenge the sitting President. Johnson ended his campaign \nwithin the same month.\n  Although Nixon won the election, McCarthy had done the groundwork to \ninject public opinion into the national election process. Eugene \nMcCarthy revived the idea that those who were truly committed to self-\ngovernment could participate and impact the process to correct \ninjustice and improve citizens' lives in Minnesota and around the \ncountry.\n  McCarthy served as a Representative and Senator from our great State \nfrom 1949 to 1971. When McCarthy left the Senate, he returned to his \nlife as a reluctant Minnesota leader, prolific poet, and educator. He \nauthored over 20 books on public policy, political theory, and \neconomics, including memories from growing up in Minnesota.\n  McCarthy continued to strongly influence Minnesota's politics; yet, \nhe never clung to a party line. McCarthy was publicly critical of Jimmy \nCarter, and he supported Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.\n  Eugene McCarthy's father, a postmaster himself and a proud \nRepublican, once said: Gene is a good boy, but he's in the wrong party.\n\n  In Minnesota, we pride ourselves on being able to disagree without \nnecessarily being disagreeable. We pride ourselves on working together \nfrom different perspectives, politically and otherwise, toward common \ngoals. Personally, I don't like the term ``bipartisan,'' but not for \nthe reason you may think.\n  You see, I think the instant we refer to something as ``bipartisan'' \nwe immediately make an issue about our different points of view instead \nof about the fact that we all want, essentially, the same things.\n  For instance, we all want clean air, clean water, good schools, good \njobs, safe communities, and a better life for our children than we have \nenjoyed. The list goes on and on.\n  Again, for the most part, we all want the same things. Sometimes we \njust have different perspectives on how to best achieve the things we \nall want.\n  Senator McCarthy was not afraid to do the right thing for the right \nreason even if that meant working with someone who did not have the \nsame political affiliation or religious views.\n  In my book, that is not just called independence. That is called \nleadership. Naming a post office after Eugene McCarthy is a worthy \ndedication for a man who shook the foundation of the political \nestablishment at a national level.\n  I thank Chairman Chaffetz and the committee for their work to \nofficially honor this great Minnesotan, Eugene McCarthy.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today we have named post offices after some great individuals--public \nservants, members of our military, politicians, community leaders--and \nwe have done it in the name of respecting their legacies and in \nhonoring them so that their families are honored as well.\n  I just want to go through the names again: Ross McGinnis, Adam Brown, \nRoger Fussell, Gregory Barney, Garrett Gamble, Caleb Nelson, William \nLacey, Louis Van Iersel, Louis Langlais, and Eugene McCarthy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 4425 and say, as it has been \nsaid earlier, that post offices are gathering places in our \ncommunities. I gave 30 years of service to the United States Postal \nService at various levels of service.\n  I know that the Postal Service is a place at which people trust their \nmail will be handled, for the commerce of our country rests in those \npost offices, and in small rural communities, it is the community \ncenter.\n  Today we have done a great thing, and we have done it bipartisanly. I \nhear that word, and I sigh a breath of relief in knowing that this \nbody--the Members of Congress--can come together. We have come together \nto recognize people not because of their parties, but because they are \nAmericans and they have served this great country.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Congresswoman \nLawrence for her service, for her time, and for her work this evening.\n  I urge adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous material on H.R. 4465, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 4465, as amended, includes reforms that will reduce the deficit \nthrough the consolidation and selling of Federal buildings and \nimproving the management of Federal real property. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  I want to recognize the tireless work of the gentleman and former \nchair of the Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency \nManagement Subcommittee, Mr. Denham, for his leadership on this issue, \nalong with the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government \nReform, Mr. Chaffetz. This bipartisan legislation incorporates critical \nprovisions crafted by both committees to address decades-old problems \nrelated to Federal real property.\n  H.R. 4465, as amended, establishes a pilot program that includes an \nindependent review of the Federal real property inventory and \ndevelopment of recommendations for the disposition of vacant and \nunderutilized properties. We have had hearings highlighting Federal \nbuildings sitting vacant, costing the taxpayer through maintenance \ncosts and unrealized sale proceeds. These buildings are often eyesores \nin local communities and provide no local tax benefits.\n  Agencies have been slow in getting rid of unneeded properties. For \nexample, the Old Georgetown Heating Plant, in one of the most expensive \nareas of D.C., sat vacant for 11 years and was only sold after our \ncommittee held a hearing spotlighting the vacant property. The pilot \nincluded in this legislation will result in an independent look across \nagencies at opportunities to sell, redevelop, and consolidate Federal \nproperties.\n  Following the pilot, H.R. 4465, as amended, would then allow agencies \nto retain a portion of the disposal proceeds to offset the up-front \ncost of property disposal.\n  The legislation will also codify the Federal real property database, \nproviding for better congressional oversight of the real property \ninventory. If this bill works as intended, we can make significant \nstrides in reducing the cost to the taxpayer and putting underused \nproperties back on local tax rolls for redevelopment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4465, the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer \nAct of 2016. This bill begins the process of reforming GSA's public \nbuilding services.\n  I would like to, first of all, recognize wholeheartedly my very good \nfriend, whom I had an opportunity to travel with, my colleague from \nCalifornia (Mr. Denham) for his work in bringing this bill before the \nTransportation Committee and now the full House, and also my colleague \nChairman Barletta.\n  Today's legislation, Mr. Speaker, really has the potential to be a \nvaluable tool in right-sizing our Federal footprint. It authorizes an \nindependent board that could provide a source of revenue for the \nFederal Government to invest in its existing buildings and to better \nmanage its real estate portfolio. The board would make recommendations \nto dispose of unneeded and underutilized real estate, and it would make \nrecommendations to consolidate Federal real estate functions where \nappropriate.\n  H.R. 4465 is consistent with several governmentwide memoranda issued \nby the President that ordered agencies to reduce and freeze their real \nestate footprints. These directives represent the administration's \nsustained priority of improving the management of Federal real estate. \nI believe H.R. 4465 dovetails\n\n[[Page H2939]]\n\nwell with the administration's priorities and begins to address the \nissue in very meaningful ways.\n  Both the Transportation Committee and the Government Accountability \nOffice, or GAO, have repeatedly raised concerns about the way Federal \nreal property has been managed. The proposed board would be highly \ninstrumental in reconfiguring, co-locating, and even realigning the \nFederal real estate portfolio with best practices.\n  Although I believe the board can serve an important role in disposing \nof unneeded real estate, I also urge the board to not sell real estate \nassets in a soft market or sell properties that hamstring the \ngovernment's ability to house Federal employees in the future. Expert \nand specialized skill is still very necessary to dispose of \nunderutilized real estate assets while avoiding selling property the \ngovernment could need in the future. Without this expertise, we could \nend up with transactions leading to future long-term leasing because of \nthe haphazard disposal of underutilized real estate.\n  It is very important to note that today's legislation contains \nseveral checks and balances. As a result of the concerns expressed on \nmy side of the aisle, there were several changes to the bill while \nnegotiating the final version. Instead of the bill requiring six annual \nrecommendations, as originally proposed, the board will now make three \nsets of detailed recommendations over 6 years so that Congress can \nconduct oversight of the board's actions and properly gauge the \nalignment of the board's goals with congressional priorities.\n  In addition, the aggregate value of transactions is capped at no more \nthan $8 billion. Each potential real estate action with a value above \n$20 million will require an appropriation that will go through the \nnormal GSA prospectus approval process.\n\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, Federal agencies will be required to coordinate \nconstruction and alteration projects with GSA. I appreciate that the \nsponsors of this important legislation were willing to work with us to \naddress these concerns, and we look forward to continuing this great \nwork as it is being implemented\n  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I support today's legislation. It creates \nan independent board to make recommendations on how to meet the goal of \nright-sizing the Federal real estate portfolio and saving taxpayers \nmillions of dollars.\n  I intend to conduct vigorous oversight of this board and the actions \ntaken by GSA in order to make it a success.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Denham).\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation I \nhave authored to help reduce the size of the Federal footprint.\n  I first would like to thank Chairman Shuster and Chairman Barletta \nfor their ongoing support in this effort, as well as Ranking Member \nDeFazio and Ranking Member Carson for their help also.\n  This is truly a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that has garnered a lot \nof support because we have worked with both sides of the aisle, as well \nas with groups that have a vested interest in making sure that this \nhappens correctly.\n  I also thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings of the \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform for working to bridge the \ndifferences between our two committees.\n  Given our trillion-dollar deficit and skyrocketing debt, we have to \nexamine every area of government and look for ways to continue to cut \nspending. This bill has taken 5 years in the making. It was one of the \nfirst actions when I, as a chair of this subcommittee, initially, we \nheld a hearing in the Old Post Office in D.C. It was a January morning \nwith freezing temperatures. We went in to show that this vacant \nbuilding was sitting there and could be revitalized. Now we are going \nto see that building not only reopen as a hotel and retail space, but \nit is going to generate millions in profits for the Federal Government.\n  We continued to hold hearings like this in abandoned buildings all \nacross the country, ones that were neglected, underutilized buildings, \njust to highlight the failed state of failed property management. We \nwere successful in pressuring GSA in selling the long vacant Georgetown \nWest Heating Plant. That netted $20 million to the American taxpayer. \nSadly, this has got to be done across the entire country.\n  Every year since 2003, GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has \nfound that the Federal Government fails to manage hundreds of thousands \nof buildings across the entire country. According to the GAO, the \nFederal Government continues to maintain too much excess and \nunderutilized property, relies too heavily on costly leased space, and \nmaintains unreliable and misleading real property lists. The GAO agrees \nand has stated before this committee that legislation like the Federal \nAssets Sale and Transfer Act would go a long way toward fixing the \nproblems with Federal real property.\n  The President has also continued to support reforms to Federal real \nestate since speaking on it in his 2011 State of the Union. He has \nincluded it in his budget since then, and I am also pleased to have \nsecured the commitment of this administration to advance legislation \nand work with myself and Chairman Chaffetz to see real reforms signed \ninto law. Additionally, both Houses of Congress have included this idea \nin their annual budget documents.\n  I believe that we have the potential to save billions of dollars in \nreal estate property. To be successful, this board will need to \nconsolidate the Federal footprint, house more Federal employees in less \noverall space, reduce our reliance on costly lease space, sell or \nredevelop high-value assets that are underutilized, and dispose of \nsurplus property much, much quicker. This bill creates an environment \nthat will achieve these goals and creates a reliable and comprehensive \nreal property database so the public can actually see government's \nprogress.\n  Additionally, as I said, we worked with other groups. One of those \nwas dealing with the McKinney-Vento Act to better facilitate access to \nunneeded Federal real property to serve our Nation's homeless \npopulation. I am proud that these changes have led to the endorsement \nof this legislation by the National Law Center on Homelessness and \nPoverty. I am pleased to work with the Law Center throughout this \nprocess and look forward to continuing to work with them to address our \nNation's most vulnerable citizens.\n  Again, this is a good bill. This has been done in a bipartisan \nfashion, and it is going to save billions of dollars for the taxpayer.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Duncan).\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Barletta for \nyielding me this time.\n  I rise in support of both H.R. 4465, the bill by Chairman Denham, and \nH.R. 4487 by Chairman Barletta.\n  We need to realize, Mr. Speaker, that private ownership of property \nis a very important, even vital, part of our freedom and our \nprosperity.\n  Today, the Federal Government owns almost 30 percent of the land in \nthis Nation, and State and local governments and quasi-governmental \nagencies own almost 20 percent. So today, close to half of the land in \nthis country is under some type of public governmental ownership. But \nyou can never satisfy government's appetite for money or land. They \nalways want more.\n  I first became interested in this issue when I read in USA Today \nseveral years ago that governments keep adding land equal to half the \nsize of the State of New Jersey each year through direct purchases or \nthrough indirect purchases through land conservancies. Then I read that \nthe Federal Bureau of Land Management had about 3 million acres they \ndidn't even want.\n  I first introduced a bill on this subject in 2001, during the 107th \nCongress, called the Federal Lands Improvement Act. I reintroduced it \nin the next Congress. Then, in the 110th Congress, I introduced a \nsimilar bill with my colleague from the other side, Congressman Dennis \nMoore of Kansas, called the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement \nAct. In a similar bipartisan\n\n[[Page H2940]]\n\nfashion, Senator Tom Carper of Delaware and Senator Tom Coburn of \nOklahoma introduced companion legislation in the Senate.\n  Several years ago, the Office of Management and Budget had found \n21,000 Federal properties that the Federal Government no longer wanted \nor needed worth, at that time, $18 billion, and $9 billion of those \nwere real property assets that the Federal Government wanted to dispose \nof.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Jim Nussle, who was the Office of Management and Budget Director at \nthe time, wrote a letter endorsing legislation to do what these bills \nare attempting to do here tonight.\n  He said: ``To reach this objective, I believe we must improve and \nstreamline the current process that Federal agencies face in disposing \nof real property assets.''\n  Some extremists never want the government to sell any property, and \ngovernment at all levels continues to acquire more and more land every \nyear. But we keep shrinking the tax base, Mr. Speaker, at the time that \nschools and policemen and all these other government employees want and \nneed more funding.\n  This legislation, we have worked on this through both the Committee \non Transportation and Infrastructure, on which I serve, and the \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform, on which I also serve. I \nwant to commend, again, Chairman Barletta and Chairman Denham because, \nwith so many needs and so many good things that we can do for the \nAmerican people, it simply makes no sense to force the government to \nkeep properties that it no longer needs or wants. We can and should put \nthose assets to much better use.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Mica).\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I have to thank the chairman, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta), for taking this measure this far. I \nwant to thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) also. I have to \nalso thank Mr. Denham and others for bringing this legislation forward.\n  My involvement as a member and former chair of the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure was that we had the Subcommittee on \nEconomic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, which \nthe distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) chairs and \nthe gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) is the ranking member. They \nhave taken this proposal that we thought about for sometime, and we \nheard Mr. Duncan's work for years and brought it forward to a great \npiece of legislation that can save billions of dollars for the \ntaxpayers.\n  The Federal Government and the American people are, by far, the \nlargest landowners of anyone anywhere. The American people own more \nFederal property than anyone. There are some problems, though, and we \nidentified those. When we were in the minority several years back, we \nhad more time to do studies and reports. Mr. Speaker, we produced a \nreport that was called ``Sitting on Our Assets: The Federal \nGovernment's Misuse of Taxpayer-Owned Assets.''\n  What we did is we went through some of the public buildings and \nproperties that are sitting idle. One highlighted in the report--you \ncan look the report up--is the old post office two blocks from the \nWhite House sitting there idle, 400,000 square feet. Half of it is \nempty. Behind it there is a newer annex. The old building was built in \nthe 1890s. It was half empty, costing the taxpayers $6 million to $8 \nmillion a year in losses, to underwrite the losses.\n  It took us two hearings. The first hearing we held was in the empty \nannex, empty for 15 years. We brought the committee down there. The \nstaff said: Should we do it in the heated part half empty or should we \ndo it in the cold part?\n  It was 32 degrees outside, 38 degrees inside. We did the hearing in \nthe cold part. We made the bureaucrats shiver.\n  For a year they still didn't do anything. We got it put up for \ntender. Guess who won against the competition of the best hotels. Ritz \nCarlton, Marriott, and all of the other majors, Hilton, they all \ncompeted openly. Mr. Trump and his organization won. He is turning that \nasset that has been sitting idle, costing taxpayers from $6 million to \n$8 million a year in losses, into about a quarter of a million dollars \nrevenue, plus a percentage of some of the profits. Now, that is what \nyou do in turning government properties around. That is one example.\n  You could go throughout the District. Behind the Ritz Carlton in \nGeorgetown there is a property, a power station. We did a hearing in \nthe empty building there. We got it up for sale. Actually, the ``for \nsale'' sign went up the day before the hearing. It sold for $19 \nmillion. It was costing us $1 million a year to maintain empty.\n  One of the greatest victories is going to occur on June 3. Since \n2008, the Federal courthouse, which is a beautiful, historic building \nin downtown Miami, empty, costing more than $1.5 million to keep empty, \ndeteriorating. We held a hearing there in the empty courthouse several \nyears back. Nothing happened. Then I heard from the president of Miami \nDade Community College, my alma mater, across the street.\n  He said: I have written GSA, and we can't get them to do anything.\n  Well, on June 3, we will transfer that vacant property sitting idle \nsince 2008 to Miami Dade Community College, stemming losses.\n  These are just a few examples. Up in Mr. Hoyer's district, we have \ngot thousands of acres between the two major thoroughfares vacant at \nthe Department of Agriculture.\n  At Cape Kennedy, we have been private there for 5 years. We took the \ncommittee down, and we did a hearing there, 177,000 acres, five times \nthe size of Manhattan. There are another 16,000 acres adjacent with the \nAir Force, sitting there with 400 buildings, half of them empty. All I \nneed is 400 acres from the Air Force to do a cargo container port, and \nyou could employ 5,000 people. That is what the port director \ntestified.\n  So we have assets across this Nation sitting idle because no \nbureaucrat has the beanie up here to make that into a producing asset. \nWe haven't even gotten into VA. This doesn't include the Postal Service \nor DOD. We have thousands of properties, buildings sitting idle. This \nbill starts the process.\n  If you owned property, would you give it to the Federal Government to \nmanage?\n  I always ask groups that. People look at me like I have been smoking \nmarijuana.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. MICA. People look at you like you are dumb.\n  Would you consider giving your property--any of the Members--to the \nFederal Government to manage?\n  No way, Jose; they would not do it. So this bill has people who \nreally know how to deal and manage real estate look at the properties. \nWe don't even have an inventory of these properties, as some of this \ngets beyond the pale.\n  But we will get an inventory, we will get a recommendation, and then \nhopefully do something, make agencies do something. Bureaucrats will do \nnothing with those properties. They don't think. Their brains are not \nwired to think. They do nothing smart. They are getting their paycheck. \nThey don't think.\n  So this is the beginning of getting out of the dumb ages into the \nsmart ages, taking those hard-earned public assets, the poor person out \nthere who is dogging it, trying to put food on the table, gas in the \ncar, kids in school, and the government is sitting on huge Federal \nassets doing nothing.\n  Thank you for coming forward with this bill. Let's get it done. Let's \nget it passed.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4465, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n[[Page H2941]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2941-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE SENATE \n AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2576, TSCA MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2015, AND PROVIDING \n FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 897, REDUCING REGULATORY BURDENS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. WOODALL, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged \nreport (Rept.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Buildings Reform and \n     Savings Act of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STREAMLINED LEASING PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Execution of Leases.--The Administrator of General \n     Services shall establish and conduct a pilot program to \n     execute lease agreements pursuant to authority provided under \n     section 585 of title 40, United States Code, using \n     alternative procedures.\n       (b) Adoption.--The Administrator shall prescribe \n     alternative procedures to enter into lease agreements in \n     accordance with section 585 of title 40, United States Code, \n     pursuant to the provisions of this section.\n       (c) Goals of Procedures.--The goals of the alternative \n     procedures are--\n       (1) reducing the costs to the Federal Government of leased \n     space, including--\n       (A) executing long-term leases with firm terms of 10 years \n     or more and reducing costly holdover and short-term lease \n     extensions, including short firm term leases;\n       (B) improving office space utilization rates of Federal \n     tenants; and\n       (C) streamlining and simplifying the leasing process to \n     take advantage of real estate markets; and\n       (2) significantly reducing or eliminating the backlog of \n     expiring leases over the next 5 years.\n       (d) Leasehold Interests in Real Property.--\n       (1) Simplified procedures.--Notwithstanding section 3305(b) \n     of title 41, United States Code, but otherwise in accordance \n     with such section, the Administrator shall provide special \n     simplified procedures for acquisitions of leasehold interests \n     in real property at rental rates that do not exceed the \n     simplified lease acquisition threshold, as defined in \n     paragraph (2). The rental rate under a multiyear lease does \n     not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold if the \n     average annual amount of the rent payable for the period of \n     the lease does not exceed the simplified lease acquisition \n     threshold.\n       (2) Acquisition threshold.--For purposes of this section, \n     the simplified lease acquisition threshold is $500,000.\n       (e) Consolidated Lease Prospectuses.--The Administrator \n     may, when acquiring leasehold interests subject to section \n     3307 of title 40, United States Code, transmit, pursuant to \n     subsection (b) of such section, to the committees designated \n     in such section for approval a prospectus to acquire leased \n     space, and waive the requirements pursuant to paragraphs (3) \n     and (6) of section 3307(b), subject to the following \n     requirements:\n       (1) Cost per square footage.--The cost per square footage \n     does not exceed the maximum proposed rental rate designated \n     for the respective geographical area.\n       (2) Space utilization.--The Administrator ensures the \n     overall space utilization rate is 170 usable square feet per \n     person or better based on actual agency staffing levels when \n     occupied.\n       (3) Lease term.--The lease term, including the firm term, \n     is not less than 10 years.\n       (4) Geographic location.--The geographical location is \n     identified as having a large amount of square footage of \n     Federal office space and lease turnover and will likely \n     result in providing for the ability, on a timely basis, of \n     the agency to consolidate space effectively or meet any \n     requirements for temporary or interim space required for \n     planned consolidations.\n       (f) Consolidations Generally.--The Administrator may \n     consolidate more than 1 project into a single prospectus \n     submitted pursuant to section 3307(b), title 40, United \n     States Code, if such consolidation will facilitate \n     efficiencies and reductions in overall space and improved \n     utilization rates.\n       (g) Waiver Authority.--The Administrator may--\n       (1) waive notice and comment rulemaking, if the \n     Administrator determines the waiver is necessary to implement \n     this section expeditiously; and\n       (2) carry out the alternative procedures under this section \n     as a pilot program.\n       (h) Reports.--\n       (1) Annual reports.--During the period in which the pilot \n     program is conducted under this section, the Administrator \n     shall submit, annually, to the Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate a \n     progress report that provides updates on the number and \n     square footage of leases expiring in the 5-year period \n     beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, by agency and \n     region, and which shall include for the expiring leases--\n       (A) an average of the lease terms, including firm terms, \n     for leases executed; and\n       (B) the percentage of leases managed in-house or through \n     the use of commercial real estate leasing services.\n       (2) Final report.--Not later than 180 days after \n     termination of the pilot program, the Administrator shall \n     submit a final report to the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate. The \n     final report shall include--\n       (A) a review and evaluation of the lease agreements \n     executed under the alternative procedures established \n     pursuant to this section in comparison to those agreements \n     not executed pursuant to the alternative procedures;\n       (B) recommendations on any permanent changes to the General \n     Services Administration's leasing authority; and\n       (C) a progress evaluation in meeting the goals described in \n     subsection (c).\n       (i) Termination.--The authorities under this section shall \n     terminate on December 31, 2021.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on H.R. 4487, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4487, as amended, includes reforms that will reduce \nthe cost of Federal real estate and improve Federal building security. \nI am pleased to be the sponsor of this important legislation. I want to \nthank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio of the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure and our subcommittee Ranking Member \nCarson for working with me on crafting this important legislation.\n  The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and \nEmergency Management held a series of hearings, roundtables, and \nlistening sessions to examine the General Services Administration's \nlease portfolio. What we found was, within 5 years, half of all GSA \nleases will expire.\n  To give some perspective on how much space that represents, that is \n100 million square feet of space or 32 new World Trade Centers in New \nYork. More than half of GSA's total real estate inventory is in \ncommercial leased space, costing the taxpayer more than $5.5 billion \neach year.\n  How we replace these leases has a huge impact on the costs to the \ntaxpayer. For larger leases and projects requiring committee \nauthorization, we have already taken steps to reduce the cost of \nFederal real estate to the taxpayer.\n  Since last Congress, the committee has worked with GSA to reduce the \nFederal footprint through consolidating space and improving space \nutilization. Through those efforts, we have saved the taxpayer more \nthan $3 billion in avoided lease costs. Those are real savings.\n  When we reduce the amount of office space agencies are leasing, it \ndirectly reduces the cost to the taxpayer. With the large number of \nleases expiring in the near future, we now have a ripe opportunity to \nsave even more by negotiating better rental rates and concessions.\n  To take advantage of this opportunity, the Public Buildings Reform \nand Savings Act establishes a leasing pilot program. This pilot program \nwill\n\n[[Page H2944]]\n\nallow GSA to streamline the leasing process to work through expiring \nleases more quickly and lock in good deals for the long term. The \nlegislation gives GSA flexible pilot authority to address roadblocks to \nreducing costs so that space acquisition can be based on the best deal \nand not on arbitrary factors like unusually high ceiling heights that \nreduce competition.\n  The legislation could result in a 20 percent reduction in lease costs \nand save taxpayers more than $500 million annually, without even \naccounting for savings through reduction in space. The legislation also \nincludes language that will give GSA a better ability, where \nappropriate, to use public-private partnerships to meet space needs, \nleveraging private dollars to offset costs.\n  In addition to these reforms, H.R. 4487, as amended, includes \nprovisions that will improve building security by clarifying \nrequirements related to the training and accountability of the Federal \nProtective Service. H.R. 4487, as amended, also includes other \nprovisions that will improve Congress' oversight of public building \nprojects to ensure building projects make sense and stay within budget \nand on time.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                   Committee on Homeland Security,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2016.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster: I am writing to you concerning the \n     jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Homeland Security \n     in H.R. 4487, the ``Public Buildings Reform and Savings Act \n     of 2016.''

In addition, should a conference on \n     the bill be necessary, I would cooperate as you seek \n     appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any \n     House-Senate conference involving provisions within this \n     legislation on which the Committee on Homeland Security has \n     demonstrated a valid jurisdictional claim.\n       I will include our letters on H.R. 4487 in the \n     Congressional Record during House floor consideration of the \n     bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Barletta, \nChairman Shuster, and Ranking Member DeFazio.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4487, the Public Buildings Reform and \nSavings Act of 2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill begins the process of reforming GSA, Public \nBuildings Service, and the Federal Protective Service. I would like to \nthank my colleagues, again, for being a partner in developing this very \nimportant piece of legislation directing GSA to improve the management \nof Federal real estate. The GAO has consistently listed the management \nof Federal real property an area of high risk.\n  The provisions contained in today's legislation will address many of \nthe concerns that GAO has documented. Specifically, the bill will \ndirect GSA to reform the leasing process and tighten oversight of the \nconstruction program.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  The centerpiece of this legislation is a 5-year pilot program \ndesigned to streamline the GSA leasing procurement process. Mr. \nSpeaker, by raising the threshold for simplified lease acquisitions, I \nbelieve GSA will be able to reduce their workload on smaller leases and \nfocus their staff on the execution of larger leases that can provide \neven more savings to taxpayers.\n  While owning is often the most cost-effective option for housing \nFederal agencies, there will also be a need for the Federal Government \nto lease space. The pilot program, and the GAO reports authorized by \nthis bill, is expected to provide the Committee on Transportation with \ndefinitive data about the most efficient way to lease Federal office \nspace. The interim reports on the pilot program and the effectiveness \nof GSA's use of commercial brokers will be instructive as to which new \nauthorities Congress should let expire in 5 years and which we should \nkeep.\n  I am also pleased that today's bill includes several reforms authored \nin H.R. 1850, the Federal Protective Service Improvement Act of 2015. \nMr. Speaker, in the aftermath of the 1995 Murrah Building bombing in \nOklahoma City, the Department of Justice, or DOJ, assessed the \nvulnerability of Federal buildings in the United States, particularly \nrelated to acts of terrorism and other forms of violence.\n  The Department of Justice made several recommendations, including \nupgrading the Federal Protective Service and bringing each Federal \nfacility up to higher minimum standards for its security levels.\n  The reforms in today's legislation include creating a national \nframework for the 13,000 contract guards who protect Federal buildings, \nemployees, and visitors each and every day. It mandates a minimum level \nof training for Protective Service Officers, or PSOs, while at the same \ntime providing authority for PSOs to carry firearms and detain suspects \naccused of a felony on Federal property. As a former police officer, I \ncan't overstate the importance of a strong training standard for \nsecurity personnel at every Federal facility across our great Nation.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to study whether it has a sufficient number of law enforcement \nofficers and inspectors necessary to regularly conduct security \nassessments of Federal facilities. Another provision requires a study \nof whether FPS' fee structure is sufficient to fund the strong law \nenforcement presence needed today. Mr. Speaker, I expect that when \nthese reports are completed, they will help guide the Committee's \nefforts to address FPS' long-term funding and staffing issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe it is critically important that we do \neverything possible to protect the millions of Federal workers and \ndaily visitors to Federal buildings. With increased oversight and \nadditional legislative authority, I believe the FPS can fulfill its \nmission.\n  I hope, in closing, that we can continue to work in a bipartisan \nmanner on these matters. I thank the chair and ranking member of the \nfull committee, who both cosponsored and supported this important piece \nof legislation. Together, we can put forth commonsense reforms that \nallow both GSA and FPS to be good stewards of our Nation's public \nbuildings.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District \nof Columbia (Ms. Norton), who is an American icon and legend.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for his overly \ngenerous introduction, and I thank my friend from Pennsylvania and my \nfriend from Indiana for this bill.\n\n[[Page H2945]]\n\n  This bill, which I strongly support, the Public Buildings Reform and \nSavings Act of 2016, may seem quite technical to those who have heard \nit described, but I do want to congratulate my friends, the chairman \nand the ranking member, for a bill that will have great substantive \nimpact on the way that GSA does its business. I particularly appreciate \nthe bipartisan way in which both of them have always performed. I also \nthank them both for accepting my amendments: one, in keeping with both \nthis bill and the prior bill, for a new, federal footprint here, and a \nsmaller Department of Energy; and then an amendment that is not related \nto any of this, for lactation space for visitors to Federal buildings.\n  I appreciate the acceptance of an amendment that allows the GSA to \nsell or exchange the Department of Energy Forrestal Complex that is \nright in the heart of The Mall area, at 1000 Independence Avenue, in \naccordance with the so-called Southwest Ecodistrict Plan, which means \nthat all the appropriate planning has been done, given where this \nlocation is and how important it is to official Washington.\n  My amendment has two purposes. Because the DOE building is larger \nthan necessary and results in wasteful spending, we now require a \nsmaller footprint. It allows the Cotton Annex, close to the Department \nof Energy on The Mall, to be sold, and gives the GSA what a developer \nneeds--that is what GSA is, a developer--the flexibility to develop \nthis priceless land and assures that development will occur soon--GSA \nhas to come back by June, and we are almost there--with a process for \ndisposing of the Cotton Annex.\n  I want to thank both gentlemen for agreeing to my amendment that I \ncall the ``motherhood'' bill. GSA already requires that employees be \ngiven lactation space, but we discovered that some employees at the \nSmithsonian were not getting it. When I called the Smithsonian, they \nimmediately provided the regional space. It is not new space, only \nexisting space for a mother to pump or to nurse a baby, if she is a \nFederal employee. I simply added visitors and guests to Federal \nfacilities as those that can use this space.\n  The Nation's capital is a tourist mecca, so there will be some \nnursing mothers.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, the benefits of breastfeeding are well \ndocumented. Children's immune systems build up. Studies have shown that \neven risks of asthma, diabetes, and the like are reduced in breastfed \nbabies. There are benefits also to nursing mothers as well. The risk of \ndiabetes and cancer are reduced.\n  This bill isn't very much related to the important substance of the \nunderlying bill, but the relationship is clear enough.

Mr. Speaker, tonight my constituents back home in \nPennsylvania are gathering to remember and celebrate the life of a \nwonderful citizen. Judge Edmund V. Ludwig will be remembered for his \ncontributions to the community and the courtroom, and for his \nleadership as a jurist, educator, mentor, and historian.\n  Judge Ludwig died on May 17, 2016, at the age of 87. He will also be \nremembered for his wit and wisdom. His legal accomplishments include \nleading the way to improve access to counsel for the poor, reformation \nof the juvenile system, and improvement to State services for the \nmentally ill.\n  Judge Ludwig founded many of these organizations and served on \nseveral of the boards. His well-known affinity for history led to the \nfounding in 1955 of the Doylestown Historical Society, where he served \nas chairman until 2011.\n  The former judge of the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas was \nappointed in 1985 to the United States District Court by President \nRonald Reagan. He was honored with the William J. Brennan Jr. \nDistinguished Jurist Award by the Philadelphia Bar Association in 2005.\n  Judge Ludwig's life of service is imprinted in the history of Bucks \nCounty, Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2945-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMBATING THE ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is certainly time for Congress to do \nits job.\n  Just last week we were briefed by the Centers for Disease Control \nregarding the Zika virus. Earlier today in my congressional district in \nHouston, one of the infectious disease specialists called Houston and \nthe Gulf region the epicenter of the Zika virus.\n  It is well known that treatment for any child that is infected will \ncost $10 million. Frankly, the brain is literally destroyed by the \nvirus. So the deformity is the fact that there is no brain functioning \nin these children.\n  This map indicates the whole Gulf region. That is clearly in the eye \nof the storm. This map indicates that Houston, among other big cities, \nis number one as it relates to the Zika virus.\n  So my call today is for us to fully fund the President's emergency \nsupplemental. This is a picture of the mosquito causing these impacts. \nWe discussed today a task force, which I created in my district.\n  Finally, just to leave this information, this is the mosquito. Use \nDEET. This is a serious matter. We need full funding to combat the Zika \nvirus and save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2945-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING PENN STATE\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last Friday I visited Penn \nState University for their annual Energy Days program--focused efforts \nin research and education involving America's energy sectors.\n  As many people from Pennsylvania know, the university was founded as \none of our Nation's first colleges of agricultural science. Now under \nthe leadership of Penn State President Eric Barron, the university is \ntaking strides to become known as the energy university.\n  Courses of study are already being offered that prepare students for \ncareers in the Marcellus Shale industry, many of which offer a starting \nwage that can support a family.\n  I applaud the efforts of Penn State in striving to meet the needs of \nour energy sector, combining expertise in energy-related research, \nteaching, and service with contributions from leaders in the energy \nindustries.\n  The new initiative will greatly expand efforts in energy policy, \nfossil fuels, renewable energy, systems and technology, and \nenvironmental impact. More importantly, those efforts will be expanded \nacross the State at the university's 24 campuses.\n  Our energy industries, such as coal, natural gas, and oil, are vital \nto the history, heritage, and future of Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2945-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2945-H2946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ISIS MURDERS CHRISTIAN GIRL\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last week, ISIS terrorists came to the \nhouse of a Christian family in Iraq to collect the religious tax \nimposed on all non-Muslims.\n\n[[Page H2946]]\n\n  ISIS told the mother of the home: You have two choices. You are to \nleave now or you are to pay the tax.\n  The mother pled: I will pay, but give me a few seconds because my \ndaughter is in the shower.\n  But the ISIS terrorists did not wait. Instead, they set fire to the \nhouse. The mother, clutching a small child, escaped. But the girl was \ntrapped in the burning home. Later, she was found. She had such severe \nburns, she died in her mother's arms. The last thing she said to her \nmother was: Forgive them.\n  The girl is a better person than most of us.\n  From beheading to burning little Christian girls alive, ISIS' evil \ngenocide knows no bounds. ISIS murders in the name of religious jihad.\n  Will we allow this evil to continue? Or shall all religions unite and \nhold ISIS accountable?\n  We must stop ISIS' malicious murder of the innocent.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is once again an honor and a privilege \nto stand on the floor of the House of Representatives to help anchor \nthe Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour, this hour of power, \nwhere, for the next 60 minutes, members of the Congressional Black \nCaucus have the opportunity to speak directly to the American people on \nan issue of great significance.\n  Today's Special Order hour topic is Democracy in Crisis: The \nReckless, Republican Assault on the Right to Vote in America.\n  It is with great dismay that many of us come to the House floor today \nto speak to an issue of significance to the American people and our \ndemocracy.\n  There is nothing more sacred to the integrity of the democratic \nprocess than the right to vote. There are people throughout the years \nwho died trying to secure the ability to participate in the franchise \nto help execute upon that great American promise of a government of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people, to vote for those \nindividuals who would represent them at the city, State or Federal \nlevel, regardless of race or religion, ethnicity, immigration status.\n  While we undeniably have made tremendous progress in America, clearly \nthere has been an effort by some, unfortunately, led, in part, by \npeople on the other side of the aisle, to stop something so \nfundamentally American as the unfettered right to participate in our \ndemocracy by voting.\n  Today we are going to explore some of the history connected to the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965, widely regarded as one of the most \nsignificant pieces of legislation ever enacted by this august body.\n  Of course, we know that, in 2013, in the Shelby County v. Holder \ndecision, the Supreme Court effectively gutted section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act, widely known as the preclearance provision, in a manner \nthat has adversely impacted the ability of voting rights advocates and \nothers to protect the ability of people to participate without obstacle \nor obstruction.\n  It is my honor, as one of the anchors of the Congressional Black \nCaucus Special Order, to join in that responsibility with my coanchor, \nwho, from the moment which she arrived in the Congress, has been a \ntremendous force for the district that she represents, a voice for the \nvoiceless, someone who is both fierce in her beliefs, but willing to \nreach out to others across the aisle in order to get things done on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to my distinguished \ncolleague from Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise this evening proud to stand \nwith my coanchor, my classmate, the gentleman from the Eighth \nCongressional District of New York (Mr. Jeffries). I say to the \ngentleman that I look forward to tonight's Special Order hour.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congressman Jeffries and I, along with our colleagues \nfrom the Congressional Black Caucus, will have scholarly debate on how \nour democracy is in crises because of the assault on the right to vote \nin America.\n  As we just heard from Mr. Jeffries and we will hear from others, \nvoting is the voice of the people. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 passed \nwith bipartisan support, established strong Federal protections for the \nfreedom to vote, banning or limiting many of the discriminatory \nelection policies and practices of the Jim Crow South.\n  Combined with subsequent legislation such as the National Voter \nRegistration Act, which requires State agencies to provide \nopportunities for voter registration, the Voting Rights Act has helped \nour Nation make significant progress in boosting voting for African \nAmericans and other historically marginalized groups.\n  But we find ourselves, Mr. Speaker, today facing our first \nPresidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  As Mr. Jeffries referenced in Shelby, the Supreme Court decision \nreversed over 50 years of progress made to expand access to the voting \nbooth and opened a pathway to new voting laws that discriminate against \nAfrican American voters.\n  As a result of Shelby, new voting restrictions have been put in place \nin 22 States, 18 of them, Mr. Speaker, Republican-led since 2010, \nmaking it harder for millions of Americans to exercise their right to \nvote.\n  The way States have been able to reduce the voting power of minority \ncommunities and put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to \nmake it harder for millions of Americans to vote is appalling.\n  Mr. Speaker, our democracy is in crisis. Our right to vote is under \nassault.\n  Mr. Speaker, why would we want to make it harder for Americans to \nvote?\n  I believe we should be making it easier for Americans to have access \nto the ballot box. But, apparently, some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle do not agree.\n  We need to put forth a vote on the Voting Rights Act now. New laws \nrange from strict photo ID requirements to early voting cutbacks, to \nregistration restriction.\n  Among these 16 States with new voting restrictions is my home State \nof Ohio. In Ohio, in 2014, lawmakers cut 6 days of early voting and \neliminated the golden week, during which voters could register and cast \na ballot all in one trip, Mr. Speaker.\n  Of course, Ohio is not alone in its efforts to make it harder for \nAmericans to vote. Mr. Speaker, the freedom to vote is one of America's \nmost constitutionally guaranteed rights, and it should be easily \naccessible to those who want to exercise it.\n\n  That is why I am honored this Congress to serve as the deputy vice \nchair of the newly created Congressional Voting Rights Caucus, a caucus \ndedicated to protecting our democracy by ensuring the fundamental right \nto vote is safeguarded for all Americans.\n  However, after a longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on voting \nprotections, House Republicans now refuse to bring either bill to the \nfloor for a vote.\n  This is unthinkable, Mr. Speaker. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has \nbeen reauthorized with bipartisan support five times. Congress has a \nduty to ensure elections are free and transparent so that all eligible \nvoters feel comfortable and welcome.\n  I would echo President Obama's February 13, 2013, statement on the \nVoting Rights Act, and let me quote:\n  ``We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are \nprotected . . . That includes one of the most fundamental right of a \ndemocracy: the right to vote. When any American, no matter where they \nlive or what their party, are denied that right . . . we are betraying \nour ideals.''\n  There are 168 days until the Presidential election, and our democracy\n\n[[Page H2947]]\n\nstill has far too many missing voices, particularly among those who are \nalready at a disadvantage due to deeply rooted racial and class \nbarriers in our society.\n  We must ensure that voter suppression is not the new normal. In order \nto have a truly vibrant democracy, the United States must take steps to \nensure inclusive voting by reducing barriers to voting.\n  Efforts to suppress voting turnout undermine democracy, and those \nefforts, Mr. Speaker, are on the wrong side of history.\n  As I close, Mr. Speaker, the time is now. I am calling on all people, \nincluding our community and national leaders, to join me in working to \neliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought \nfor, marched for, died for. Mr. Speaker, that is the Voting Rights Act.\n  Human rights organizations like the NAACP and the Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights have been at the forefront of \nthese issues along with my colleagues, members of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus, encouraging and training poll workers and poll \nprotectors.\n  It is up to all of us, Mr. Speaker, to protect the most at risk among \nus and to expand opportunity for all.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for making \nseveral extremely important observations about the urgency of restoring \nthe Voting Rights Act, of Congress voting up or down.\n  All we are asking for is for Members of this House to act on \nbipartisan legislation that has been introduced in this Congress that \nwould respond to the Supreme Court's decision, adopt a new coverage \nformula, and allow us to move forward in advance of this consequential \nPresidential election with a system that we can all be confident in \nwill fairly allow everyone who wants to vote the opportunity to vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor and my privilege to yield to the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), chairman of the \nCongressional Black Caucus, someone who had a distinguished record \nprior to his service in the House as a jurist on the bench as a civil \nrights lawyer in North Carolina and has continued his fight here on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives for the last 10 years on behalf \nof fairness, justice, and equality, particularly in his capacity as \nchairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I thank the gentleman for yielding time this \nevening, and I thank him for his incredible work not just in the \nCongressional Black Caucus, but on behalf of the people that he \nrepresents in that great borough of Brooklyn, New York.\n  And I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for all the work \nthat she does. She is an incredible leader in this Congress, and we \nappreciate her so very much.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for selecting the topic for discussion \ntonight. It is certainly an appropriate topic.\n  There are so many of us who have been working on enforcement and \nextension of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. They are too numerous to \nmention, but I will certainly single out Congressman John Lewis, \nCongresswoman Terri Sewell, Congressman Mark Veasey, Congressman John \nConyers, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, and so many others, who have \njust worked tirelessly to enforce the right to vote not just for \nAfrican Americans, but for all Americans.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Mr. Speaker, on August 6, 1965--and I remember it so very well; it \nwas a few days after I had graduated from high school--this Congress, \nthis House of Representatives where we are seated tonight, and the \nSenate, which is just a few steps down the hall, together passed the \nVoting Rights Act. This act was signed by the President of the United \nStates immediately, and it has had a profound impact on empowering \nAfrican American communities all across the country to participate in \nthe electoral process.\n  Prior to the Voting Rights Act, it was a sad state of affairs, Mr. \nJeffries, in North Carolina, in South Carolina, and in Alabama. It was \na very sad state of affairs. In order to register to vote, one had to \nbe able to read and to write. But not just that. They had to be able to \nsatisfy a registrar. In all cases, it was a White registrar. African \nAmerican citizens had to satisfy a registrar who, in many cases, \ndiscriminated that he or she was competent and able to be able to read \nand to write; and, in most instances, those would-be voters were denied \nthe right to vote.\n  In addition to that, laws were passed all across the South that \ndisenfranchised minority groups. Redistricting schemes were drawn to \ndisenfranchise, at-large elections and staggered terms and all of the \nrest. So there was a necessity--a necessity--Congressman, for the \nVoting Rights Act. It was just not a good idea; it was actually a \nnecessity in order to enforce the right to vote. Congress enacted this \ntool, and it has been very effective.\n  One of the most effective parts of the Voting Rights Act--there are \nmany parts of the Voting Rights Act. Section 2 is that part that gives \nminority communities the right to bring lawsuits, and that applies to \nevery county in the United States. It is a permanent law. It is on the \nbooks permanently. It also eliminated the literacy tests.\n  But there is another provision that kind of goes unnoticed from time \nto time, and it is called section 5. Section 5 is an oversight \nprovision. It gives the Federal Government the right to preclear \nelection changes before they go into effect to determine whether or not \nthese changes would have a discriminatory result in their community.\n  Section 5, Mr. Speaker, does not apply to every county in America. \nSection 5 only applies to certain States that had a long history of \nvoter discrimination. In my State, for example, North Carolina, the \nwhole State was not included under section 5. Only 40 counties were \nincluded for preclearance. So it has been a good law, and it has worked \nquite well. As the previous speaker said, it has been extended from \ntime to time.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, on June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that \nsection 5--first of all, the Supreme Court ruled that section 5 is a \nproper exercise of legislative authority. But the Supreme Court \nsurprised us. It determined that the formula used to determine which \ncounties or which States should be subject to section 5 is outdated. \nThe Court suggested that it needed fixing.\n  So the Court called on us here in this Congress to fix it, and the \nCongressional Black Caucus has been fighting every day since that Court \ndecision to try to put together a bipartisan agreement to fix the \nformula.\n  No one in this Congress has worked harder than Congresswoman Terri \nSewell of Alabama. Her bill is now pending before this House, and we \nneed to fix the formula, and we need to do it now.\n  When you look at the 2013 discriminatory election law changes and the \n2011 legislative and congressional redistricting, you must conclude--\nanyone must conclude--that there is a concerted effort in many parts of \nthe country to disenfranchise particular groups of voters from \nparticipating in the process.\n  The absence of section 5 protection allows States--allows States, my \nState included--to pass discriminatory laws that disenfranchise African \nAmerican voters and other groups. We have seen these laws enacted in \nState after State all across the country.\n  On July 25, 2013, Mr. Jeffries, the North Carolina General Assembly \npassed--now, remember, the Supreme Court decision was June 25, 2013--30 \ndays later. I don't know why they didn't do it 30 days earlier. Well, I \ndo know why, and that is because there was a section 5. But after \nsection 5 was suspended by the Supreme Court, 30 days later, the \ngeneral assembly passed a sweeping voting law that discriminates not \nonly against African Americans, but other minority groups. It \ndiscriminates against students and seniors.\n  This law has also cut back on early voting. That is a big deal in our \ncommunities. It cut back on early voting by a week and barred same-day \nvoter registration. The law went into effect upon passage, and there is \nno oversight in section 5 to protect us.\n  This is disappointing. This law is regressive and absolutely \ndisgusting. We have to let our State lawmakers know that our voices \nmatter and that all citizens--all citizens--in this country should be \nable to participate in democracy through unfettered access to the \nballot box.\n\n[[Page H2948]]\n\n  So, in closing, the Congressional Black Caucus, of which I am honored \nto chair, vows to continue our fight to restore section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act to stop the assault on access to the ballot box because \nevery citizen deserves the right to vote.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nCongressional Black Caucus for his eloquent words and for explaining \nthe practical realities of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down \nthe coverage formula and effectively invalidate section 5 and the \nimplications that that has had on people all across the country, in \nNorth Carolina and beyond.\n  I also note that the Voting Rights Act in section 5 and the coverage \nformula in section 4, upon passage in 1965, didn't just impact States \nin the South. There are five counties in New York City that constitute \nthe Big Apple, and three of those counties in the Bronx, Manhattan, and \nBrooklyn, were covered by section 5.\n  We recognize that there had been challenges all across the country \nwith respect to the right to vote, and many of us, even beyond the \nSouth, have now lost that critical protection. That is why it is time \nfor Congress to act.\n\n  I thank the chairman for his continued leadership.\n  It is now my honor to yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from the \ngreat State of Alabama (Ms. Sewell). She has been a tremendous \nproponent of the right to vote. We were all in awe of her leadership \nlast year when we were down in Selma, Alabama, to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of Bloody Sunday and are thankful for all that she \ncontinues to do to uphold that great American tradition that sprang \nforth from that small city down in Alabama where the distinguished \ngentlewoman hails from. She currently is a sponsor--the lead sponsor--\nof the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would fix the problem that \nthe Supreme Court created.\n  It is now my honor to yield to Representative Terri Sewell.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my \ndistinguished colleague from New York and my distinguished colleague, \nthe gentlewoman from Ohio, for this wonderful hour of power on voting. \nIt is my great honor to stand with them, to rise today and to join with \nmy CBC colleagues to discuss the reckless Republican assault on the \nright to vote in America.\n  We began tonight by bringing attention to the ever-evolving crisis \nbrewing in our democracy. Since the Supreme Court in the Shelby \ndecision gutted the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, there has been nothing short of an assault on the right to vote--\nthe most sacred right to vote. This 2016 election will be the first \ntime in my lifetime and, I daresay, in the lifetime of the gentleman \nfrom New York, that we will have a Presidential election in which there \nwill not be the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  As the gentleman so rightly acknowledged, I welcomed, in 2015, 100 \nMembers of Congress, both Republican and Democratic, to my hometown of \nSelma, Alabama, in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the historic \nBloody Sunday march from Selma to Montgomery, where people shed blood \nand tears. Our own colleague, John Lewis, was bludgeoned on that \nbridge, the Edmund Pettus Bridge, 50-some years ago in order to have \nthe right to vote for all Americans.\n  On that day, Republicans and Democrats held hands as we crossed the \nEdmund Pettus Bridge one more time, as John Lewis likes to say, this \ntime on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. We all had a Kumbaya \nmoment, if you will, but we came back to Congress and did nothing to \ntry to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  I ask my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, have we really gone so far in the \nlast 10 years? After all, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was amended and \nreauthorized five times, most recently in 2006 under a Republican \nPresident, President George Bush, who was with us on that glorious day \non the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery march to make sure \nthat his support for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was there.\n  So I say to you, in 10 years since 2006 when we reauthorized the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965, overwhelmingly, in both Houses of Congress--\noverwhelmingly--we reauthorized the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. Had \nit not been for the Shelby decision which gutted section 5, which \nprovided that preclearance formula, and made the full protections of \nthe Voting Rights Act null and void, we would still be living under a \nregime where, as the gentleman so rightfully said, it was not only the \nDeep South States that were part of the coverage formula, but New York \nwas part of the coverage formula as well.\n  So the Supreme Court, in the Shelby decision, really issued a \nchallenge to Congress to come up with a modern-day formula. The \nchallenge was that we shouldn't hold States like Alabama and the Deep \nSouth for past discriminations that were so long ago, back in the 1950s \nand the 1960s and the 1940s, but, rather, we should come up with a \nmodern-day formula.\n  The Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015 does just that. I was \nprivileged to introduce that bill along with my colleagues Linda \nSanchez and Judy Chu; and Senator Leahy, on the Senate side, introduced \nthat bill. It has a lookback not since the 1950s or 1960s, but it has a \nlookback of 25 years, since 1990 going forward. It says that if there \nhave been five violations, statewide violations, that a State would be, \nthen, opted in to preclearance if they had five.\n  Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that not 1, but 13 States have had \nviolations of voting discrimination over the last 25 years? Those \nStates include California, New York, Arizona, Alabama, Mississippi, \nLouisiana, Texas, and Florida. Thirteen States would actually fall \nunder the rubric.\n  I think that it is really telling that we, in 2016, saw such long \nlines wrapped around Maricopa County, Arizona, most recently in March, \nduring their Presidential election primary in March. Do you know why? \nBecause Maricopa County used to be covered under the coverage formula \nfor the 1965 Voting Rights Act; and since it no longer has any teeth \nand has been gutted, they could summarily close down polling stations.\n\n  It shouldn't surprise you, Mr. Speaker, that in 2008, Maricopa County \nhad 800 polling stations, in 2012 it went down to 400 polling stations, \nand for 2016, 60 polling stations--and those 60 polling stations \ncovered the whole county of Maricopa County, Phoenix, Arizona. It was \nclearly not enough to get all of the folks who wanted to vote to be \nable to vote. They could close down those polling stations without any \nadvance notification because there was no more Voting Rights Act of \n1965.\n  My own State of Alabama was one of those States that, after the \nShelby decision, decided to institute a photo ID law. So many of my \nconstituents came up to me and said: We need a photo ID to get on the \nplane these days. We need a photo ID to get a passport. Why shouldn't \nwe need a photo? How is that in some way discriminatory?\n  I had to remind many of our constituents that so many of our elderly, \nespecially in the rural communities that I represent, many of whom were \nborn by midwives, don't have birth certificates and can't actually \nreadily prove a birth certificate in order to get a photo ID law. Some \nseniors and those who are disabled, like my father who no longer \ndrives, therefore, he doesn't have a driver's license. He was a nine-\ntime stroke victim--actually, a survivor. He is still with us today.\n  But my dad was determined to get that photo ID in 2014 when Alabama's \nlaw came into effect. He was highly motivated, Mr. Speaker, because his \ndaughter's name was on a ballot, and he wanted to be able to vote. I \nwant you to know that it took my dad 5 hours to get a photo ID. Now, if \nthat is not a barrier--you say to yourself: Five hours. Why would it \ntake 5 hours?\n  Well, Dallas County Courthouse is a courthouse that actually was \ngrandfathered into the ADA laws and so did not have to have a ramp by \nwhich people who have wheelchairs can get readily into the courthouse. \nIt had been grandfathered in. We were very blessed to have a gentleman \nhelp us get my dad up those seven stairs into the courthouse. But when \nwe got into the courthouse, because the voter registration was on the \nsecond floor, we had to take an elevator upstairs.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Lo and behold, that particular day, the one elevator bank was what?\n\n[[Page H2949]]\n\n  Actually out of service. Out of service.\n  Now, my mom, having been a former member of the City Council in Selma \nand, obviously, a very well-known member of the citizens of Selma, she \ncould go across the hall and talk to the probate judge's office and \nsay: Look, we are here today to get this photo ID, this nondriving \nphoto voter ID, so that my husband can vote.\n  It took 1\\1/2\\ hours, but they got someone to service that elevator. \nAnd by the time that elevator was working and we got up to the second \nfloor, lo and behold, it was 11:30. And guess what? Lunchtime.\n  Now, I say to you, Mr. Speaker, we no longer have to count how many \nmarbles are in a jar, we no longer have to recite all 67 counties in \nthe State of Alabama in order to get a voter registration card, but we \nshould not in America have to go through so many hoops in order to \nexercise the most fundamental right, the most sacred right of our \ndemocracy--the right to vote.\n  And I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that any denial of access to the \nballot box, to me, totally obfuscates and really undermines the \nintegrity of the electoral process. If one person who wants to go out \nand vote has to stand in line for hours upon hours and can't actually \nphysically stand in line because they have other obligations like \nchildren and day care and jobs, then it is unfair. We are actually \nlimiting access to the ballot box, which actually goes to the integrity \nof our electoral process. It is fundamental to our democracy.\n  So I say to you tonight, I am honored to join my CBC colleagues as we \nfight for the opportunity of all Americans to have equal access to the \nballot box.\n  Mr. Speaker, my State of Alabama, after having a photo ID requirement \nand during the State budgetary process, had the gall to actually decide \nto close down 30 Department of Motor Vehicle offices, which, as all of \nus know, the most popular form of photo ID is a driver's license. So to \nactually require a citizen to have a photo ID and then to close down \nDMV offices in rural parts of my district in the State of Alabama was \nreally unconscionable.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Isn't it the case that a disproportionately high number \nof those DMV offices that the State of Alabama just happened to decide \nto close were in predominantly African American parts of the State of \nAlabama?\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. They were. Those DMV offices, as the gentleman \nfrom New York so aptly recited, were mostly located in heavily African \nAmerican parts of the State of Alabama, but they were also \npredominantly rural parts of the State of Alabama. Those same areas \nhave a hard time having transportation, public transportation, to get \naround in those areas.\n  They said, of course, that the reason why they were closing down \nthese DMV offices had nothing to do with voting, of course, but had to \ndo with the fact that there were serious budgetary restraints. \nObviously, one of the consequences of the closures of those DMV offices \nwas to limit access to those people getting photo IDs, the most popular \nform of photo ID, which is a driver's license, and, therefore, limiting \ntheir ability to go vote.\n  I did speak with our Governor, and he did open up those DMV offices \non a limited basis, but only on a limited basis. And I say to you that \nit is unacceptable in America to have any limitations on the right to \nvote.\n  I really ask all of my colleagues, especially those who have come to \nSelma over the years with John Lewis on these pilgrimages, to really \nsearch deep in their hearts. If they are really about access to the \nballot box and being able to make sure that all Americans have an \nopportunity to exercise this fundamental right, then why would we not \nmake it easier for people to vote?\n  Instead of going the way of Alabama and having these photo ID laws, \nit seems to me that all of us should be adopting laws like the State of \nOregon, which has mail-in ballots and same-day registration. There are \nways that we can make it much easier for every American to exercise \nthat most fundamental right to vote.\n  So tonight I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join in \nwith the 168 cosponsors of the Voting Rights Advancement Act, and join \nus in this fight to make sure that we do a modern-day formula, a \nmodern-day formula, with a look back, since 1990 going forward, to look \nat whether or not there have been discriminatory acts that have limited \npeople's access to the ballot box.\n  I also ask my colleagues to join us every Tuesday that we are in \nsession. We have declared it to be Restoration Tuesday. And on those \nTuesdays, since Tuesdays are the days that we vote, we go to the well \nof the floor, and we talk about why it is important to restore the \nvote.\n  So I want to thank my colleagues, the gentleman from New York and the \ngentlewoman from Ohio, for leading us in this charge tonight. I hope \nthat it will spill over to tomorrow, which is Restoration Tuesday, \nwhere we can really talk about the modern-day examples of people being \ndenied access to the ballot box because of people's inability to \nactually get the credentials that people require them to have, or \nbecause they have to work late. They don't have the ability to be able \nto drop everything and go and vote and stand in long lines if those \npolling stations have been closed.\n  I say all this to say that it is really imperative, I think, that we \nput real action behind our talk. We do a lot of talking about our \ndemocracy and upholding our Constitution. This is an opportunity for \nthis august body to actually do something about it.\n  In closing, I want to quote one of our Republican colleagues, who has \nbeen in this fight for a very long time, Republican Congressman \nSensenbrenner from Wisconsin, who I think really best summed it up when \nhe wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times after witnessing those long \nlines in Maricopa County, Arizona, the following:\n  ``Ensuring that every eligible voter can cast a ballot without fear, \ndeterrence, and prejudice is a basic American right. I would rather \nlose my job than suppress votes to keep it.''\n  I have to repeat that.\n  ``I would rather lose my job than suppress votes to keep it.''\n  My Republican colleague went on to say:\n  ``Our credibility as elected officials depends on the fairness of our \nelections.''\n  Mr. Speaker, voting rights transcend partisan agendas. It really \nsolidifies that equality in voting is the Democratic way.\n  I ask my colleagues to join all of us in this fight, this fight for \nour democracy. This crisis that we are in is a crisis that we can fix \nin Congress by coming up with a modern-day formula.\n  We already have several bills in the House. Congressmen Sensenbrenner \nand Conyers introduced the Voting Rights Amendment Act. I have \nintroduced the Voting Rights Advancement Act. There are several bills--\ntwo bills, in fact--that would actually come up with a modern-day \nformula. I dare this august body to actually act on one. I am here to \ntell you that the American people will be stronger, and this Republic \nwill be stronger, because of it.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from \nAlabama, my good friend, Terri Sewell, for a very compelling, \ncomprehensive, and complete analysis of the situation that we find \nourselves in in the practical consequences of the Supreme Court's \ndecision. And the fact that there are people all across this country, \nin Alabama, and in other parts of this great Republic, who are \ndetermined to elevate themselves by suppressing the ability of others \nto participate in the Democratic process, that is a shame, it is a \nstain on our democracy, and it is time for this Congress to act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), my \nclassmate and good friend, who himself has been championing the issue \nof fair redistricting, who has personally been impacted in terms of his \ncapacity as a representative, to make sure that lines are fairly drawn, \nand most recently has announced the formulation of the Voting Rights \nCaucus here in the Congress. He has been a tremendous leader in this \narea. A great Member of the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Hakeem Jeffries from New \nYork and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty from Ohio for everything that they \nare doing on raising this issue tonight. It is very timely, considering \neverything that we are going through\n\n[[Page H2950]]\n\nright now. When you think about the Voting Rights Act, it is literally \nthe single most important piece of legislation that has ever been \npassed in the history of the United States as it deals with an \nindividual's right to vote.\n  But as you know, 3 years ago, the Supreme Court regressed and sent us \nback by gutting section 4 of the Voting Rights Act. Not only was that \nbad because it hurt the Voting Rights Act, but it was also bad because \nof everything that it did to propel States around the country from also \nretrogressing and sending us back in the area of voting rights.\n  You are starting to hear so many stories of States and localities \nthat are passing more and more laws to restrict the right to vote, \nmaking it harder for young people to vote--seniors, the disabled, \npeople that move around a lot and are transient, people that don't \nnecessarily have the money that they need in order to obtain the proper \nidentification.\n  And you heard Congresswoman Sewell when she so eloquently talked \nabout the fact that oftentimes, particularly in the South, people were \nborn by midwives. We have a lot of baby boomers that are out there. \nPeople think these things happened a long time ago. That is the thing \nthat you hear all the time. But there are people that are living here \ntoday, a lot of baby boomers, that were born down in the piney woods of \neast Texas, that were born in other parts of the South, that don't have \nthe proper documentation that they need in order to be able to vote.\n  I have met people since I have been involved in campaigns and \nelections and as an elected official that didn't have the proper ID to \nvote. I have to tell you that there are many of them out there.\n  Just hours after the Supreme Court made the decision in 2013 that my \nhome State of Texas implemented the most egregious voter ID law in the \nentire country, just hours after the Supreme Court gutted section 4, \nthey moved to reimplement the law. That was very disappointing, \nconsidering that an appeals court had already said that the voter ID \nlaw in Texas was one of the worst in the country.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Isn't it a fact that the case as it relates to that \nparticular ID law in Texas, that individuals are able to vote if they \nhave a gun license identification card, but are not able to vote under \nthat draconian Texas law with a college ID?\n  Mr. VEASEY. That is correct. If you have an ID that is issued to you \nby the University of Texas, or Texas A, or Prairie View A \nUniversity, that same ID, that same student ID that can be used to \nidentify yourself to campus police officers, that can be used to \nidentify yourself for other things that you would need an ID for, it \nwill not work in order for you to go and vote. But if you have a \nconcealed handgun license, then you can vote. Concealed handgun \nlicenses are mostly used by White males in the State. It is really \nunfair that a more diverse form of ID, like the student ID, is not \nallowed under Texas laws.\n\n  That was one of the reasons why I became the lead plaintiff on the \nvoter ID lawsuit, Congressman Jeffries. It is Veasey v. Abbott. We are \ngoing to continue to fight. We just got news today that the Fifth \nCircuit Court is going to take up our case. I am going to continue to \nwork here in Congress, continue to work in Texas, continue to work in \nthe Dallas-Fort Worth area to protect the voting rights of individuals \nthat have been wronged.\n  I also want to point out that, again, you oftentimes hear people say \nthat we have progressed as a country and we don't need these laws. But \nwhen you look at what is going on in Texas and when you look at what is \ngoing on across the South, I just think we can't sit back anymore. We \ncan't sit back and be idle and say: Oh, no, well, we are doing a little \nbit better, so these people that are going to be discriminated \nagainst--the transients, the college students, the people that don't \nnecessarily have their birth documentation in order like other people \nmay have--we just can't sit back and say we are going to just move on \nand forget about them. We have to fight for those individuals as well \nbecause it is their right to vote, and we must protect it.\n  In 2016, I just think we should be making it easier for citizens to \nvote. We should be talking about things like same-day registration. We \nshould be working together, Democrats and Republicans, on ways to ease \nlines when it comes to voting in places. We should be looking at ways \nthat we can make it to where we have more days to vote early. You are \nstarting to hear about laws around the country to scale back the number \nof in-person early voting days. I just think that is wrong.\n  Again, I want to thank you for your leadership on this issue. I also \nwant to thank you for pointing out that I have introduced the first \nCongressional Voting Rights Caucus to help aid and fight in the battle, \nalong with so many other task forces and organizations that are here in \nCongress that are working on those issues.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  We want to continue to make sure together again--and we need to do it \nin a bipartisan manner--that we all protect the right to vote.\n  I thank the gentleman and the Congresswoman from Ohio, Representative \nBeatty, for their work and passion on this issue.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank my good friend for his leadership on this very \nimportant issue and for the steps that he has taken both here in \nCongress, with the initiation of the Voting Rights Caucus, as well as \ndown in Texas as the lead plaintiff in the Veasey v. Abbott lawsuit to \nchallenge the voter ID requirements--the draconian requirements--that \nhave been imposed by the State of Texas.\n  It should shock the conscience of every American that a State would \nimpose a restriction that allows licensed gun owners to vote who \ndisproportionately happen to be of a certain demographic--white male--\nbut would deny the legitimacy of IDs that the State of Texas itself \nissues.\n  Texas A, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of \nHouston, and other institutions are all public universities, and these \nindividuals--these students--pay tuition to go to these public \nuniversities, and, in response, they are issued identification \nvehicles, identification cards, but the State of Texas has seen fit to \nsay that that is not valid in order to vote.\n  I think that one example--and we have heard several others--basically \nexposes the fact that the movement to impose voter identification \nrequirements is fraud in itself. It is a sham.\n  The whole argument behind it is that: We are trying to protect the \nintegrity of the voting system. But here is the problem: you are \nprotecting the integrity of the voting system by imposing a solution in \nsearch of a problem because none of these individuals in any of these \nStates has been able to produce a scintilla of evidence of fraud.\n  In fact, there are studies that have shown that there have been over \na billion instances of Americans exercising their right to vote without \nany evidence of misrepresentation--over a billion times. The number of \ninstances of questionable voting is less than 50; yet, in State after \nState, we see voter identification laws being imposed on the people.\n  It is not designed to protect the integrity of anything. It is \ndesigned to protect certain individuals and maintain their power in the \nface of troubling demographic changes that are occurring in America. \nLet's call it like it is.\n  Let me ask the Chair how much time we have remaining in this Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, let me now yield to someone who has been a \ntremendous champion from the great State of Texas in representing her \npeople in Houston and is a phenomenal member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the distinguished gentleman from New \nYork, who shows that the issues of voter empowerment are nationwide.\n  Let me also thank the gentlewoman from Ohio, who has been steadfast \non important issues that deal with the empowerment of all Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I note that my colleague from Texas made his \npresentation, Congressman Veasey, who everyone knows was the plaintiff \nin Texas for the voter ID law.\n  I wanted to come this evening very briefly to, one, submit a full \nstatement\n\n[[Page H2951]]\n\ninto the Record and to make this point. And let me read the headline or \nthe topic again: Democracy in Crisis: The Reckless Republican Assault \non the Right to Vote in America.\n  It did not have to be, for it is evident that we have dealt with \nvoter empowerment in a bipartisan way. It is the very difficult journey \nthat Lyndon Baines Johnson took in 1965 after the foot soldiers and Dr. \nMartin Luther King and others made their momentous march and statement, \nincluding a letter from a Birmingham jail that captured the history or \nthe sentiment and the movement of the civil rights movement in the very \nbasic words: Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.\n  With that power behind him, he was able to frame the Voting Rights \nAct in a bipartisan manner with Republicans from the North and with \nwhom we used to call Dixiecrats from the South. It can be done.\n  Then, in 2006 and 2007, I was privileged to have another Texan, \nGeorge W. Bush, as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, after \n15,000 pages of testimony with a Republican chairman, and we went and \npassed a vote reauthorization of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n  Let me close with these points about the pointedness, Mr. Jeffries, \nof what voting power actually means.\n  What it means is that we would not have the North Carolina set of \nvoting laws, if you will, that cut Sunday voting or early voting. It \nhad one of the most horrific voter ID laws.\n  We would not have the Texas voter ID law that disenfranchised \nthousands upon thousands of Hispanics because of no DPS officers--\nDepartment of Public Safety officers--in their locations.\n  We would not have an attempt to cut billions of dollars from food \nstamps and an attempt to cut trillions of dollars from education for \nour children and the status that we are in right now of trying to seek \nthe full funding of the President's emergency funding of $1.9 billion \nfor the Zika virus. This is what ``voting power'' means.\n  Finally, after the Supreme Court instructed the Congress or told the \nCongress that we needed to have a new bill, we would not have the \npredicament we are in now. We need voting power, and that is what \nvoting rights are all about.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman \nJoyce Beatty (D-OH) who are anchoring this Special Order on Democracy \nin America and the Reckless Assault on Minority Voting Rights.\n  I thank all of my colleagues on the Congressional Black Caucus for \ntheir leadership on fighting back against voter suppression and holding \nthis important special order to discuss what we can do to protect our \nvoices and democracy.\n  I applaud my colleagues here today for their commitment to being the \nchange that we all wish to see in America--today and for generations to \ncome.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. Veasey for his \nleadership in forming the Voting Rights Caucus. As a Vice Co-Chair, I \nlook forward to working with the Members of this new Caucus and my \ncolleagues of the CBC Voting Rights Task Force as we continue in this \nmovement to elevate our voices and rights as citizens that we have long \nfought for and earned.\n  We are at a pivotal time to protect and embrace the power that we \nhold in restoring and maintaining our democracy.\n  The 2016 election season is already in full swing.\n  As voters in a number of states face new restrictions for the first \ntime in a presidential election, we've already seen problems in \nprimaries across the country.\n  A new photo ID requirement led to long lines in Wisconsin. A \nreduction in polling places forced some to wait five hours to vote in \nArizona. New rules created confusion in North Carolina.\n  And in my home state of Texas, last minute changes to polling \nlocations in Harris County resulted in long lines, confusion and for \nsome, the inability to vote.\n  The challenge of voting in fewer polling locations without adequate \nnotice, along with the implementation of long-contested voter ID law \nchanges, created unnecessary and burdensome obstacles for voters in a \ncounty that is home to more minorities and non-English speaking \nresidents than that of greater state of Texas or the nation.\n  In a county that ranks third in the nation in terms of population, \ncritical changes impacting the ability of individuals to exercise their \nright to vote must be reviewed to ensure that any violation of federal \nlaw is addressed and corrected.\n  This could be an early glimpse of problems in November--as voters \nface the first presidential election in 50 years without the full \nprotections of the Voting Rights Act, which was designed to prevent \ndiscrimination in voting.\n  In 2016, 17 states will have restrictive voting laws in effect for \nthe first time in a presidential election.\n  Restrictions in most of these 17 were passed before this year.\n  The new measures range from strict photo ID requirements to early \nvoting cutbacks to registration restrictions.\n  Those 17 states are: Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, \nMississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, \nOhio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and \nWisconsin.\n  We cannot afford to turn back the clock--we must continue to forge \nahead and push back against these egregious and painful laws.\n  The Voting Rights Act is still needed.\n  Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by \nDr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but could not \neliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in \nstymying the practices that resulted in the wholesale \ndisenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did \nnot eliminate entirely.\n  Or as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in her dissent \nof the Court's ruling:\n\n       Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is \n     continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like \n     throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are \n     not getting wet.\n\n  As stated by my predecessor, Barbara Jordan, a civil rights and \nvoting rights icon and a woman of many firsts--I know that perhaps the \ngreatest and most important battle to be fought is on behalf of the \nright to vote, the most precious right of all because it is a \npreservative and passage of all other rights.\n  We must be vigilant in this movement to elevate our voices and rights \nas citizens that we have long fought for and earned.\n  Fifty years ago, America was preparing for the first national \nelection following passage of the Voting Rights Act--the crucial \nlegislation for which Martin Luther King, Jr. and civil rights \nactivists toiled for years.\n  Today, we're preparing for our first election in half a century in \nwhich these essential voter protections will not be available.\n  Voting rights were ascendant in 1966--today voter suppression tactics \nare spreading throughout the nation.\n  Congress was increasingly an ally in 1966--now in 2016, it's \nconspicuously absent.\n  Regressive state voter suppression laws--including Voter ID laws, \nVoter caging, elimination of polling places, elimination of early or \nSunday voting, refusal to locate sites in low-income areas, last-minute \nchanges to polling locations--are the clear culprits.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court's disastrous Shelby \nruling--which eliminated the requirement that areas with histories of \ndiscrimination receive preclearance for any changes to voting laws--\nthere was hope that Congress would act to mitigate the damage.\n  But those hopes have been diminished.\n  There has been no Congressional action to repair the VRA to date.\n  At face value, a voter ID law might not look as egregious as a poll \ntax.\n  But, considering the hurdles that they present--including the need to \nprocure a birth certificate or visit a far-away DMV during severely-\nlimited operating hours--the obstacles are comparable.\n  These laws are especially prohibitive for elderly or low-income \npeople who have difficulty traveling.\n  Recent studies reveal that state voter suppression could stop \napproximately 1.3 million from voting in competitive election states.\n  Thirty-six states have promulgated new laws that disproportionately \nimpact minority citizens in response to fabricated issue of ``voter \nimpersonation.''\n  Sixteen of these states will see their plans go into effect for the \nfirst time in the 2016 elections.\n  An analysis by Nate Silver for the New York Times shows that these \nlaws can decrease turnout by between 0.8 and 2.4 percent--a potentially \ndecisive amount in highly competitive elections.\n  As The Nation's Ari Berman and others have methodically reported, the \nefforts to suppress votes through Voter ID laws, the purging of voter \nrolls, and the elimination of polling places are already having their \nimpacts.\n  The 2016 primaries have been marked by long lines in several states \nand severe hurdles to voting.\n  According to Ari Berman, voters disenfranchised by new laws include: \na man born in a German concentration camp who lost his birth \ncertificate in a fire; a woman who lost use of her hands but was not \nallowed to\n\n[[Page H2952]]\n\nuse her daughter as power of attorney at the DMV; and a 90-year-old \nveteran of Iwo Jima, who was not allowed to vote with his Veterans ID.\n  We need to translate widespread outrage about voter suppression into \nmomentum for an actionable voting rights agenda.\n  While proponents of voter ID laws point constantly to a looming \n``crisis'' of voter impersonation to justify barriers to accessing the \npolls, they've yet to demonstrate empirical evidence. Where is the \nproof?\n  We now have empirical evidence, gathered from academic experts at \nUniversity of California at San Diego and other leading institutions, \nthat voter suppression laws disproportionately impact minorities and \nimmigrants.\n  Fixing the VRA is just the start of the fight to secure voting \nrights.\n  We must also deal with issues including aging and insecure voting \nmachines, problems with absentee ballots, willful misinformation, felon \ndisenfranchisement, partisan election administration, untrained \nelection staff, and many others.\n  As we know, the Voting Rights Act is one of the most fundamental \npieces of American legislation, designed to prevent the \ndisenfranchisement of black and minority voters by prohibiting voting \npractices and procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, \nor membership in a language minority group.\n  In signing the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965, President Lyndon \nJohnson said:\n\n       The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by \n     man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible \n     walls which imprison men because they are different from \n     other men.\n\n  Since its passage in 1965, and through four reauthorizations signed \nby Republican presidents (1970, 1975, 1982, 2006), more Americans, \nespecially those in the communities we represent, have been empowered \nby the Voting Rights Act than any other single piece of legislation.\n  Section 5 of the Act requires covered jurisdictions to submit \nproposed changes to any voting law or procedure to the Department of \nJustice or the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. for pre-\napproval, hence the term ``preclearance.''\n  Under Section 5, the submitting jurisdiction has the burden of \nproving that the proposed change(s) are not retrogressive, i.e. that \nthey do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or \nabridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\n  In announcing his support for the 1982 extension of the Voting Rights \nAct, President Reagan said, ``the right to vote is the crown jewel of \nAmerican liberties.''\n  And Section 5 is the ``crown jewel'' of the Voting Rights Act.\n  But a terrible blow was dealt to the Voting Rights Act on June 25, \n2013, when the Supreme Court handed down the decision in Shelby County \nv. Holder, 537 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b), the \nprovision of the law determining which jurisdictions would be subject \nto Section 5 ``pre-clearance.''\n  In 2006, the City of Calera, which lies within Shelby County, \nAlabama, enacted a discriminatory redistricting plan without complying \nwith Section 5, leading to the loss of the city's sole African-American \ncouncilman, Ernest Montgomery.\n  In compliance with Section 5, however, the City of Calera was \nrequired to draw a nondiscriminatory redistricting plan and conduct \nanother election in which Mr. Montgomery regained his seat.\n  In 2010, Shelby County filed suit in federal court in Washington, \nD.C., seeking to have Section 5 declared unconstitutional.\n  In 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia upheld \nthe constitutionality of Section 5, holding that Congress acted \nappropriately in 2006 when it reauthorized the statute.\n  And in 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit affirmed the district court ruling by a vote of two to one.\n  However, on June 25, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Section 4 \nof the Voting Rights Act, which sets out the formula that is used to \ndetermine which state and local governments must comply with Section \n5's preapproval requirement, is unconstitutional and can no longer be \nused.\n  Thus, although the Court did not invalidate Section 5, it will have \nno actual effect unless and until Congress can enact a new statute to \ndetermine who should be covered by it.\n  According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down \nSection 4(b): ``Times change.''\n  Now, the Court was right; times have changed. But what the Court did \nnot fully appreciate is that the positive changes it cited are due \nalmost entirely to the existence and vigorous enforcement of the Voting \nRights Act.\n  And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed.\n  Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by \nDr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but could not \neliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in \nstymying the practices that resulted in the wholesale \ndisenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did \nnot eliminate entirely.\n  Or as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in her dissent \nof the Court's ruling:\n\n       Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is \n     continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like \n     throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are \n     not getting wet.\n\n  Before the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, the right to vote \ndid not exist in practice for most African Americans.\n  And until 1975, most American citizens who were not proficient in \nEnglish faced significant obstacles to voting, because they could not \nunderstand the ballot.\n  Even though the Indian Citizenship Act gave Native Americans the \nright to vote in 1924, state law determined who could actually vote, \nwhich effectively excluded many Native Americans from political \nparticipation for decades.\n  Asian Americans and Asian immigrants also suffered systematic \nexclusion from the political process.\n  In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were \napproximately 300 African-Americans in public office, including just \nthree in Congress. Few, if any, black elected officials were elected \nanywhere in the South.\n  Because of the Voting Rights Act, there are now more than 10,000 \nblack elected officials, including 46 members of Congress, the largest \nnumber ever.\n  The Voting Rights Act opened the political process for many other \nminorities, including over 6,000 Latino elected officials and almost \n1,000 Asian American elected officials.\n  Native Americans and others who have historically encountered harsh \nbarriers to full political participation also have benefited greatly.\n  Aided by Section 5, the Voting Rights Act was successful in \npreventing the states with the worst and most egregious records of \nvoter suppression and intimidation from disenfranchising minority \nvoters.\n  So successful in fact that the Supreme Court apparently saw no harm \nin invalidating the provision that subjected those states to the \nfederal supervision responsible for the success it celebrated.\n  Now to be sure, the Supreme Court did not invalidate the preclearance \nprovisions of Section 5; it only invalidated Section 4(b).\n  But that is like leaving the car undamaged but destroying the key \nthat unlocks the doors and starts the engine.\n  According to the Court, the coverage formula in Section 4(b) had to \nbe struck down because the data upon which it was based--registration \nrates and turn-out gaps--was too old and outdated.\n  But my colleagues in Congress and I refused to let the Voting Rights \nAct die--as states all across the nation had already begun implementing \nrestrictive voting laws that would keep thousands of citizens away from \nthe polls.\n  After months of hard work, consultation, negotiation, and \ncollaboration, we were able to produce the ``Voting Rights Amendment \nAct'' which sets out to achieve these goals.\n  I was an original cosponsor when this bill was first introduced in \n2014 (H.R. 3899), and again when it was reintroduced in 2015 (H.R. \n885).\n  To be sure, this legislation is not perfect, no bill ever is.\n  But--and this is important--the bill represents an important step \nforward because it: is responsive to the concern expressed by the \nSupreme Court; and establishes a new coverage formula that is carefully \ntailored but sufficiently potent to protect the voting rights of all \nAmericans.\n  First, the Voting Rights Amendment Act specifies a new coverage \nformula that is based on current problems in voting and therefore \ndirectly responds to the Court's concern that the previous formula was \noutdated.\n  The importance of this feature is hard to overestimate. Legislators \nand litigators understand that the likelihood of the Court upholding an \namended statute that fails to correct the provision previously found to \nbe defective is very low and indeed.\n  The Voting Rights Amendment Act replaces the old ``static'' coverage \nformula with a new dynamic coverage formula, or ``rolling trigger,'' \nwhich works as follows:\n  For states, it requires at least one finding of discrimination at the \nstate level and at least four adverse findings by its sub-jurisdictions \nwithin the previous 15 years;\n  For political subdivisions, it requires at least three adverse \nfindings within the previous 15 years; but\n  Political subdivisions with ``persistent and extremely low a minority \nvoter turnout,'' can also be covered if they have a single adverse \nfinding of discrimination.\n  The effect of the ``rolling trigger'' mechanism effectively gives the \nlegislation nationwide reach because any state and any jurisdiction\n\n[[Page H2953]]\n\nin any state potentially is subject to being covered if the requisite \nnumber of violations are found to have been committed.\n  Prior to Shelby Co. v. Holder, the Voting Rights Act covered 16 \nstates in whole or in part, including most of the states in the Deep \nSouth.\n  The states that would be covered initially under the new bill are: \nTexas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina.\n  To compensate for the fact that fewer jurisdictions are covered, our \nbill also includes several key provisions that are consistent with the \nneeds created by a narrower Section 5 trigger.\n  For example, the Voting Rights Amendment Act:\n  Expands judicial ``bail-in'' authority under Section 3 so that it \napplies to voting changes that result in discrimination (not just \nintentional discrimination);\n  Requires nationwide transparency of ``late breaking'' voting changes; \nallocation of poll place resources; and changes within the boundaries \nof voting districts;\n  Clarifies and expands the ability of plaintiffs to seek a preliminary \ninjunction against voting discrimination; and\n  Clarifies and expands Attorney General's authority to send election \nobservers to protect against voting discrimination.\n  This bipartisan compromise legislation is not ideal--but on the \nbalance, it represents a step forward as we continue to fight for \nenforcement of our most fundamental right: the right to vote.\n  Additional measures introduced to help protect and enforce our right \nto vote include the Voter Empowerment Act and the Coretta Scott King \nMid-Decade Redistricting Prohibition Act.\n  The Voting Empowerment Act was introduced to help ensure equal access \nto the ballot for every eligible voter.\n  The Voting Empowerment Act was designed to protect voters from \nsuppression, deception and other forms of disenfranchisement by \nmodernizing voter registration, promoting access to voting for \nindividuals with disabilities, and protecting the ability of \nindividuals to exercise the right to vote in elections for Federal \noffice.\n  This legislation would expand and protect citizens' access to the \npolls and would increase accountability and integrity among elected \nofficials and poll workers.\n  It would also expand eligibility to allow all ex-offenders who have \nbeen released from prison (even those who may still be on probation on \nparole) the opportunity to register and vote in federal elections.\n  Outlined in 13 Title sections, this bill prioritizes access, \nintegrity and accountability for voters.\n  I have also introduced H.R. 75 (originally introduced in 2013 as H.R. \n2490) which prohibits any state whose congressional districts have been \nredistricted after a decennial census from carrying out another \nredistricting until after the next decennial census, unless a court \nrequires such state to conduct a subsequent redistricting to comply \nwith the Constitution or enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is no ordinary piece of legislation.\n  For millions of Americans, and many of us in Congress, the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 is a sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil \nand tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was \npossible to accomplish extraordinary things.\n  Please know that I am as committed to the preservation of the Voting \nRights Act and I will not rest until the job is done.\n  As I stated in 2006, during the historic debate in Congress to \nreauthorize the Voting Rights Act of 1965:\n\n       I stand today an heir of the Civil Rights Movement, a \n     beneficiary of the Voting Rights Act. I would be breaking \n     faith with those who risked all and gave all to secure for my \n     generation the right to vote if I did not do all I can to \n     strengthen the Voting Rights Act so that it will forever keep \n     open doors that shut out so many for so long.\n\n  With these legislative priorities and principles at the forefront, I \nintend to work with my colleagues and advocates to do all I can to \nprotect the voting rights of all Americans.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman.\n  The right to vote is fundamental to the integrity of our democracy, \nand, as Lyndon Baines Johnson said from this very Chamber shortly \nbefore the Voting Rights Act was passed into law a few months later, \n``We shall overcome.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/house-section/article/H2953-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2953-H2959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     1-YEAR ANNIVERSARY FOR JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) is recognized for \nthe remaining time until 10 p.m. as the designee of the Majority \nLeader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers be allowed 5 days to file remarks and revise and extend those \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, May 29, marks the 1-year \nanniversary for the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act being signed \ninto law, or the JVTA, as we refer to it.\n  This is a vital piece of legislation that the House and Senate passed \nand that was signed by the President a year ago that takes this scourge \nof human slavery that is taking place internationally, but also here in \nthe United States, and Congress weighs in on this to deal with this \nissue, I think, in a very good way.\n  It is impressive to me as a Member of the House how many Members of \nCongress on both sides were involved in drafting legislation over a \nyear ago that came to the House and passed. In the House itself, there \nwere 11 pieces of legislation that dealt with sex trafficking. All of \nthose bills came up to the House floor in the same week, and all of \nthem passed with overwhelming numbers.\n  They went down the hallway to the U.S. Senate. The Senate combined \nthose bills into one bill, and it passed that legislation. It came back \nto the House, we passed that, and it was signed by the President. I \nwant to thank all of those Members of Congress--Republicans and \nDemocrats--who worked on this.\n  Just by way of background, I got involved in this issue in several \nways. One way was when I was in Eastern Europe several years ago and \nfound out about the human trafficking, sex trafficking, and labor \ntrafficking that was taking place in Eastern Europe and how young women \nwere lured into thinking they were going to get a better job--or have a \njob--in Africa and the next thing they knew they were in sex slavery in \nnorthern Africa. Most of those women just disappeared over the years.\n  Then, back here in the United States, we have the problem of the \ncrime and the scourge of trafficking, and it happens in two areas. \nThere is international sex trafficking into the United States. About 20 \npercent of the trafficking here in America is international, primarily \ncoming from the southern border.\n  You see those drug traffickers, those drug dealers, who come across \nthe southern border of Texas. They bring anybody into the United \nStates, and they will do anything for money.\n  They will bring young girls, young women, and traffic them into the \nUnited States and turn them over to the criminal gangs, like the MS-13 \ngang, and then they are trafficked throughout the United States.\n  That is about 20 percent of the trafficking. The other 80 percent is \ntrafficking by domestic or young girls, young women. They are \ntrafficked throughout the United States in the same crime--sex slavery, \nsex trafficking.\n  I had an opportunity to meet a lot of these trafficking victims in my \nwork as chairman and co-chairman with Jim Costa of the Crime Victims \nCaucus. I will tell you about three of those, and those three women \nhelped get the minds straight of Members of Congress on this issue that \nis taking place.\n  ``T,'' as her nickname is, was in foster care. She spent 18 years of \nher life in foster care. In foster care, she was abused, treated like \nan animal, hardly fed by some of the individuals who were in the foster \ncare system. All she wanted was a family, someone to love and care for \nher.\n  She met an older boy, and that individual made her feel special. He \npromised to love her and take care of her. But as soon as she left with \nhim, she became a sex slave, and her innocence was crushed. She was \nsold around the country in massage parlors, strip clubs, in hotels, and \non the Internet. She was treated like property for 7 years, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  I mentioned that she was in foster care. We now understand that about \ntwo-thirds of the sex trafficking victims in the United States, at some\n\n[[Page H2954]]\n\ntime in their lives, were in foster care. That is an issue we have to \ndeal with. Congress has to deal with that.\n  Finally, ``T'' was rescued, and now she tells her story wherever she \ncan. Even Time magazine featured her and her life and her story and her \nrecovery.\n  Brooke Axtell I met in Texas. Her mother was extremely ill when she \nwas about 7 years of age. So the mother turned Brooke over to a nanny, \nbut the nanny did not protect her. In fact, the nanny did just the \nopposite. The nanny sexually abused Brooke and then trafficked her.\n\n  It is common with child trafficking victims, as with Brooke, to also \nbe victims of child pornography. After Mom got out of the hospital, \nBrooke was slow to tell Mom what happened, but she finally did. In \nworking with her mother, she was able to be rescued and get out of this \nscourge of sex trafficking. Now she works with Allies Against Slavery \nin Texas.\n  The third person I want to mention very briefly is Cheryl Briggs. She \ngrew up in an abusive home. She was sexually abused by her father. \nThings were so bad in the home that Mama left when Cheryl was very \nyoung to escape the abuse.\n  At the age of 12, Cheryl didn't know what else to do except get away \nfrom her father. So she ran away. She began hitchhiking with truck \ndrivers or with anybody who would take her. It led her to get involved \nwith a motorcycle group, and she started a career, unfortunately, in \nsex trafficking hell.\n  This individual took her to a biker club that was filled with men who \nsexually assaulted her. They raped her. She became a trafficked victim \nand was forced to do all kinds of just awful, horrible things. She was \ntrapped in this scourge of human trafficking and didn't know how to get \nhelp.\n  She was finally able to get help when a patron of the strip club \nfigured out on his own that she was too young and helped her get \nrescued. Now Cheryl works to help those who are in this sex trafficking \nin the United States.\n  Those are just three stories, Mr. Speaker. Let me tell you about one \nbill, and then I want other Members of Congress who are here at this \nlate hour to make comments as well.\n  Carolyn Maloney and I worked on the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act. Now, you know Carolyn Maloney. She is a New York \nliberal Democrat who talks a little funny. She teamed up with me, a \nTexas conservative who talks a little funny, according to her.\n  The two of us got together and started working on this with lots of \nMembers of Congress. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, thanks \nto the hard work of Mrs. Maloney and others--and especially of the \nwomen in the U.S. House of Representatives--passed the House. It does \nthree things.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  It does three things. It goes after the trafficker, the slave master, \nand makes sure that when prosecutors--Mr. Speaker, as you know about \nprosecutors--when they prosecute those cases, that person goes away to \nthe penitentiary, the do right hotel, for as long as the judge can send \nthem.\n  It then goes to the other end and looks at the trafficking victim. \nFor years, society looked at this victim as a criminal, a child \nprostitute. Children cannot be prostitutes. It is impossible, legally \nimpossible. So rather than treat them like criminals and put them in \nthe criminal justice system, it rescues those victims and treats them \nlike victims of crime rather than criminals. This is a major change in \nsociety's thought and thought process about these children and young \nwomen.\n  Also, Mr. Speaker, it goes after the money, the consumer, the buyer \nin the middle. Too long, these buyers of trafficking victims who pay \nmoney to do these awful things to children have kind of skated under \nthe criminal justice system. Not anymore. Those days are over. The days \nof boys being boys are over, and these buyers can be prosecuted to the \nsame extent of the law as the trafficker.\n  So the bill does three things: it goes after the trafficker; it goes \nafter the demand, the money; and it rescues the victims.\n  How do we pay for this? It is kind of a novel approach. Federal \njudges now can impose fines and fees on the trafficker and the buyer \nbecause a lot of them have a lot of money. And that money goes into a \nfund, and that fund is used and given as grants to different \norganizations, nonprofits throughout the country in States to help \ntrafficking victims and also to educate police and educate the public.\n  So it is a good piece of legislation. That was just one of several \npieces of legislation that came to the House floor.\n  As I mentioned, this was a bipartisan effort. Mrs. Joyce Beatty of \nOhio is here. She filed legislation called Improve the Response to \nVictims of Child Sex Trafficking. All of that legislation was included \nin the Senate bill and came back to the House and then passed. What it \ndoes is decriminalize child sex and makes it easier for people to \nreport potential incidences of crimes against children.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), a great advocate \non behalf of crime victims and trafficking victims.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge Poe, chairman of the Victims' \nRights Caucus and Representative of Texas' Second Congressional \nDistrict, for organizing this evening's important Special Order hour \nand for all of his hard work on behalf of the victims of human \ntrafficking.\n  I am also very pleased to have the opportunity to partner with my \ngood friend, Congresswoman Ann Wagner of Missouri, who is my classmate \nand a friend. We share the same priority of eradicating human \ntrafficking.\n  It is kind of odd, as Judge Poe talked about his relationship with \nCarolyn Maloney. They are two people who seem, on paper, very \ndifferent. One might say the same about Ann Wagner and me. But, Mr. \nSpeaker, there is that common thread that puts us together to not only \nadvocate and fight for something that we need to fight for, but we have \nbeen able to make a difference.\n  That is why I come to the House floor this evening to recognize and \ncelebrate a very important anniversary: the 1-year anniversary of \nbipartisan, comprehensive legislation, Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act, that was signed into law.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, or JVTA, was a landmark \nbill, as you have heard, that updated America's effort to combat the \nscourge of human trafficking and provided essential resources to \nsurvivors and law enforcement officials. I am so proud to have had my \nbill be included in this legislation and to have been able to take part \nin its drafting, passage, and enactment.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the year since JVTA's enactment, we have witnessed \nimportant achievements. For example, the JVTA has reinvigorated \nAmericans' commitment to protecting our children from cruel \nexploitation. And, Mr. Speaker, these children still need our \nprotection.\n  Human trafficking, as we have heard, is an estimated multibillion-\ndollar-a-year international enterprise that forces the most at risk \namong us, both here at home and abroad, into modern-day slavery. It is \none of the fastest growing crimes in the world.\n  According to the United States State Department, human trafficking is \namong the world's top three criminal enterprises. It is forced \nprostitution, domestic slavery, and forced labor, which is why \nenactment and, now, the implementation of the JVTA is so important. We \nmust continue to work to eradicate human trafficking and support the \nvictims.\n  In the year since the JVTA's enactment, we have seen educators, law \nenforcement officials, and service providers working together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, Mr. Speaker, raising awareness in our \ncommunities that human trafficking is not merely an international \nphenomenon. It, unfortunately, happens all too often in our backyards, \njust as we have heard Judge Poe talk about ``T'' and talk about Brooke. \nAnd the stories could go on and on.\n  In fact, in my home State of Ohio, for example, each year, an \nestimated 1,000 children become victims of human trafficking, and over \n3,000 more are at risk. Ohio is the fifth leading State for human \ntrafficking because of its proximity to waterways that lead to an \ninternational border and the I-75 interstate that allows anyone to exit \nthe State, within 2 hours, to almost anywhere.\n\n[[Page H2955]]\n\n  Lastly, I am very thankful for having amazing advocates in Ohio for \nvictims of human trafficking, like Theresa Flores, the founder of SOAP, \nSave Our Adolescents from Prostitution, and State Representative Teresa \nFedor, a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, who has made a \nlifetime commitment to working to protect our victims.\n  We must remain vigilant in the implementation of JVTA, as we were \nwhen we passed it, so every child, every woman and man is free from \nthis form of modern-day slavery, which is why I am proud to have joined \nJudge Poe and Congresswomen Wagner and Maloney of New York in leading a \nletter to United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch supporting the \nDepartment of Justice's implementation thus far of the JVTA and \nrequesting needed information on what more can be done within the \nconfines of the current law.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this is what happens when we work together. This is a \ngreat example of what we can do when Democrats and Republicans come \ntogether to change lives.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio. I \nlike your tag line. I might use it myself.\n  You point out several good things, and I think everybody listening \ncan understand why legislation like this got passed because of your \npassion and--I will say it again--because of the women in the U.S. \nHouse that pushed this last year and were relentless until all this \nlegislation came up.\n  You point out many good things. There are two things, though, that I \nwant to point out myself that you mentioned. One is about the money.\n  People may ask, Mr. Speaker, why is there so much money involved in \nthis? Well, drug dealers, when they sell drugs, you sell drugs one \ntime. The cost of apprehension, the consequences, are great, and the \nchances of getting caught are great.\n  On the other end, you have sex trafficking. Unfortunately, these \nchildren are sold multiple times a day--sometimes 20, 25 times a day. \nThe risk of getting caught is very low, and the punishment, up until \nnow, has been very low. So that is why it is the second or third \nbiggest monetary system of criminal enterprises anywhere.\n  That, Mr. Speaker, in itself is a disgrace to us as a people to allow \nthis to happen, where slavery is the second or third money maker for \nthe criminal gangs who primarily run all of these enterprises.\n  I yield to another gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber). He has been in \nthe antitrafficking movement a long time. He worked in the Texas \nLegislature and helped Texas get ahead of the curve on the movement \nbefore we actually did here in the House.\n  I yield to the gentleman from southeast Texas (Mr. Weber).\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here and to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion across the aisle for this very worthwhile \ncause.\n  I will tell you, Judge Poe is exactly correct. In Texas, we like to \nsay that things are bigger in Texas. But, unfortunately, Texas has one \nrecord that we really didn't want, and that is that we have 25 percent \nof the sex trafficking in the country. We are 1 of 50 States, and yet \nwe have 25 percent of the victims of sex trafficking going on right \nthere in Texas.\n  We were able to pass Texas House Bill 4009, which did a number of \nthings. It actually instructed the enforcement officials to take a look \nat some of these young girls that were picked up--and, I guess, for \nthat matter, young men as well--and to not just assume that they were \nwillfully participating in the sex trade, but to look deeper into the \nbackground there.\n  Some of these girls we found out were actually held against their \nwill, were drugged and beat into submission. Some, as young as 12, were \ndancing in some of these strip clubs and, like Judge Poe said, some of \nthe patrons would take notice of that and would actually get them help.\n  In Texas, we did identify that pretty early on, about 5 or 6 years \nago now, and were able to pass legislation to get the HHSC to put law \nenforcement together, to get some training for these officers, to get \nthese NGOs together to say, look, we need to get some programs for \nthese young girls to rehabilitate them. How in the world do you ever \nget them back to normal life after something like this? We needed more \nfacilities, more beds, more training. So I am proud to say that, in \nTexas, we actually did take the lead on that.\n  One of my favorites was in the town of Waco. You mentioned three \nthings: going after the perpetrators; going after the demand, the \nmoney; and, of course, helping the victims. Well, the town of Waco had \na way of dealing with the johns. What they did was, when someone was \narrested in Waco, they would put that john's picture on a billboard in \nthe city with the headline, ``Arrested for solicitation of \nprostitution.''\n  Now, that will ruin your family life at home and in a little town \nlike Waco. So we took some lessons from that to say, look, we are going \nafter the demand, after the johns, to try to dry up that money stream\n  Mr. Speaker, Judge Poe ought to be commended. It has been almost a \nyear since the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was signed into \nlaw. This comprehensive legislation tackled a number of issues to \ncombat human trafficking. It took a stand against the seller, which we \nhave been talking about, and the buyer by criminally pressing charges \non both for the first time.\n  It also provided smart solutions to help victims of trafficking get \nback on their feet, which is what I said from my days in the Texas \nLegislature. They needed a program. They needed people to understand. \nThey needed counseling. Good Lord, how do those young girls ever get \nback to some semblance of normalcy after something like that?\n  Thanks to the JVTA, States are now incentivized to draft and pass \nwhat we call safe harbor legislation, which helps victims of \ntrafficking expunge their criminal records in an effort to start fresh \nwithout the ghosts of their past haunting them.\n  Legislation like this also addresses the need for shelter, for more \nbeds, for facilities for those NGOs, a place for rehabilitation.\n  As you know, currently, 34 out of the 50 States have versions of safe \nharbor legislation, which is an increase of 14 States just since the \npassage of the act. Training on the identification of trafficking \nvictims has also increased within the airline, the hotel, and even in \nthe medical industries.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  Mr. Speaker, victims of human trafficking are men, women, and \nchildren. This is not a victimless crime, I might add. We all have \nundoubtedly passed these victims in an airport, at a hotel, or maybe \neven at the fuel station. Until society at large stops sexualizing our \nchildren, we will be unable to prevent the predators' interest in our \nminors.\n  We have made crucial steps, Mr. Speaker, toward combating human \ntrafficking, as evidenced by the very success of the Justice for \nVictims of Trafficking Act we are talking about here tonight. Yet, we \nstill have a long way to go to eradicate this scourge of human slavery. \nBut we have a good start on it, and we are committed to seeing it \nthrough to the end and making a difference. Mr. Speaker, you know I am \nright.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for \nhis several important comments that he made about facilities to take \nthe victims once they are rescued by law enforcement or by nonprofit \norganizations.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no place to put them. Sometimes that is why the \npolice arrest these young girls and put them in juvenile detention, is \nbecause there is no facility to take them. I am not blaming the police. \nThey have no other place for them to go.\n  There have been some studies done on how many beds are available for \ntrafficking victims. The latest comes out of the State of Illinois. \nThey did some research, and there are about 600 to 700 beds nationwide \nfor trafficking victims--600 to 700 beds; that is it--in a country of \n350 million people.\n  Compare that to animal shelters. I love animal shelters. I have got \nthree Dalmatians. I call them the weapons of mass destruction. I got \none of them from a Dalmatian rescue in Dallas. But there are 5,000 \nanimal shelters in the United States, and that is good. We need every \none of them.\n\n[[Page H2956]]\n\n  Six hundred to seven hundred beds for trafficking victims is not near \nenough. That is one thing this legislation does. It provides resources \nso we can have places to take these crime victims, and that is what \nthey are.\n  They are victims of crime. They are not criminals. They are hard to \ndeal with. They are not easy to help. They have had their whole lives \ndestroyed in front of them. So it takes time, it takes facilities, and \nit takes resources.\n  One other comment you made about the signs. Of course, I am a big fan \nof criminals carrying signs in front of businesses that they commit \ncrimes in. I did that as a judge and some other things.\n  You are exactly right. If we could add an amendment to this \nlegislation--and I think we should--to give Federal judges the option \nto allow the posting in the county in which the crime was committed on \na billboard or a sign of a photograph of the child molester who has \nbeen convicted of trafficking children, that would get the attention of \nsome of those folks out there who are trying to hide their criminal \nconduct.\n  And maybe those billboards ought to pop up right before some big \nsporting event that cities have as well. That is just a thought, Mr. \nSpeaker. I think we ought to work on that.\n  We also have with us another person who has worked on this whole \nissue of trafficking victims and justice for them. Mr. Yoho is one of \nour newer Members of Congress, Ted Yoho from the Third District of the \nState of Florida. I yield to the gentleman at this time.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Texas. \nYou wouldn't have hurt my feelings if you would have said one of the \nyounger Members, but that wouldn't have been true.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the growing army that is \nfighting human trafficking worldwide. I rise to speak out against this \nheinous crime known as human trafficking, the scourge of our time in \nthe 21st century, a $32 billion industry.\n  The statistics are overwhelming, as we have heard all the estimates \nof over 22 million people being trafficked worldwide. Sometimes, \nthough, they seem far away. It is estimated that the individuals in the \nadult entertainment are often victims of human trafficking, people in \nfarm camps, people in domestic servitude. There are people being \ntrafficked for human body parts. It goes on every day.\n  People often say, ``That kind of stuff happens overseas'' or, ``That \ndoesn't happen here.'' There is an acronym called NIMBY, not in my \nbackyard. People don't think this happens. No, it happens in our own \nbackyards. It happens here at home. It happens in your State, in your \ncounty, and more than likely it happens in your town.\n  Human trafficking happens as we speak. Human trafficking knows no \nskin color, no gender, no socioeconomic background. It only knows how \nto exploit, abuse, and victimize.\n  Who is guilty of this? Well, nation-states are guilty of this, \ncriminal gangs, drug cartels, people needing labor, and terrorist \norganizations. People are doing this for greed, profit, and power. They \nare the scum of humanity, the people who are involved in this.\n  ISIS, as we all know today, traffics people for terrorist reasons. \nThey sell children from 1 to 9 years of age. Children 1 to 9 years of \nage bring the most for ISIS, $168. Young women between 9 and 18 have \ndropped in value. They are worth $128. ISIS even gives away slaves for \nrewards of deeds that we deem are bad deeds.\n  The alarming estimate of more than 1 million teenagers run away every \nyear in the United States. Runaways are the most at-risk youth and \nsusceptible of trafficking. Runaways are the most at risk when they \nleave. In fact, runaways are typically picked up by the pimps or \ntraffickers within the first 48 hours.\n  Who does this sort of thing? Well, the perpetrators aren't of a \ncertain stereotype. They are of all backgrounds. I don't want to name \nany backgrounds, but they are people of low, no, and high profiles.\n  This year in my hometown of Gainesville a trafficking ring was \ndiscovered and six people were arrested.\n\n  Last week a person of high profile, one of the leaders of the Black \nLives Matter movement, was arrested for sexually trafficking a minor in \nNew York.\n  Just last year a 15-year-old girl was discovered by police in a motel \nroom being sexually abused and trafficked several times a day. When I \nsay several times a day, we are talking 15 to 20 times a day their body \nis being sold, like an amusement ride.\n  Her parents had been handing out missing child flyers in the \nneighborhood when somebody recognized her picture from an online ad. \nThat young girl went from being a runaway to a trafficking victim in \nless than a month. That 15-year-old girl could be the son or daughter \nof you, your friends. It could be your niece or nephew, your brother or \nsister.\n  However, it is not just runaways that become victims of trafficking. \nTraffickers don't discriminate based on economic class, race, gender, \nor age. Traffickers are motivated by profit. The average cost of a \nslave worldwide--worldwide--is less than $90. That is the value the \nscum of the earth puts on the value of a human's life.\n  As the world's fastest growing and third largest criminal enterprise, \nit is shocking how little people know about this horrendous practice. \nFurther, it is appalling how little is put toward the effort to stop \nit.\n  In my district, we have created the North Central Florida Human \nTrafficking Task Force, which is aimed at bringing together community \npartners from the Federal, State, and local levels to combat \ntrafficking.\n  For many, education awareness is half the battle. We teamed up with \nthe Department of Homeland Security and used their Blue Campaign to \nraise awareness. This week here on Capitol Hill we celebrate the 1-year \nanniversary of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act sponsored by \nJudge Ted Poe of Texas, and I am a proud cosponsor of this important \nlegislation. I thank my colleagues for their support of this bill as \nwell.\n  This issue, the issue of human trafficking, is not a Republican or \nDemocratic issue. Back in January, several of us took to this very \nHouse floor to speak of the horrors of this crime.\n  But taking a stand on one particular day or highlighting the issue \nonce a month doesn't even begin to cover what the victims experience on \na daily basis or the horrors and nightmares they have for a lifetime.\n  We must always, always be vigilant and active in our fight. If we \nbecome aware and educate just one other person to know what the signs \nare, we can help end this horrific tragedy.\n  Mr. Speaker, no neighborhood is immune. No city is exempt. These \nslaves, or victims, are a part of our daily lives quietly suffering, \nbut being traded like livestock and treated beyond comprehension.\n  We cannot in good conscience continue our daily routines without \nmaking every effort to stamp out the practice of forced labor, domestic \nservitude, sex trafficking, or the selling of body parts. Whether you \nare a college student, businessowner, or stay-at-home parent, we all \nplay a role.\n  First, I ask my colleagues to stand with me as we take another step \nin taking down trafficking. Thank you to all those both here at home \nand abroad who are fighting every day to make this modern-day slavery a \nthing of the past. All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men, \nwomen, or people to do nothing.\n  Finally, thank you to my colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nPoe), for hosting this Special Order.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida. I \nappreciate his comments. He made several excellent points, the NIMBY \nattitude that some people have, not in my backyard.\n  I met with a father last week. He came to my office and told me the \nstory of how his daughter had been trafficked. He went to the local \nsheriff in another part of the State and told the sheriff what had \nhappened. The sheriff said: It doesn't happen here.\n  It does. It happens everywhere. It is in our backyard. It is \neverywhere. We need to recognize that. The gentleman worked on his own, \nthen, to find his daughter and take her back home.\n  The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) makes another good comment \nabout how these young kids are prey. A trafficked child, like the one I \njust mentioned, they had been working on her for 18 months, seducing \nher, talking to her, using the Internet. She\n\n[[Page H2957]]\n\nthought these people were her friends. They were not her friends. They \nwere all involved in the trafficking process.\n  We need to understand that traffickers are not old guys in trench \ncoats wandering around and snatching kids. They are not. Many times \nthey are young people, young, good-looking guys who will strike up a \nconversation with a middle schooler at the mall and then talk to them \nagain later and then later and then, finally, that individual gets in \nthe vehicle or meets the individual, the trafficker, someplace, and \nthen she is gone.\n  This father that I talked to knew the statistics, that, if you have a \nchild that is trafficked, you have about 3 weeks to find her or she is \ngone because those traffickers move those kids all over the country, \nselling them every day. It is in our backyard, unfortunately.\n  I yield to another Texan, the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas, Ms. \nSheila Jackson Lee, who has worked on this issue of trafficking here \nand also back home in our hometown of Houston.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Texas \nfor his persistence, his determination, and for this exciting \ncommemoration of the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016.\n  Let me thank the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus and co-chair \nJim Costa, along with Congressman Poe, Judge Poe, who famously has \nsaid, ``And that is just the way it is,'' and I see all of us seemingly \nadopting those words. So he has now put the English language in a form \nthat we just can't help ourselves. So I thank Judge Poe so very much.\n  I remember his beginning. I want to thank him for a year or 2 ago \nwhen he joined me and Chairman McCaul for a Committee on Homeland \nSecurity human trafficking hearing in Houston, Texas.\n  I believe we have had other hearings since then because we know that \nHouston, Texas, Harris County, and in Texas has been called one of the \ncenter points of human trafficking, to our dismay. Many stories have \ncome to our attention.\n  I think it was about 2 years ago, Judge Poe, when they found a stash \nhouse out in the county. I actually went to that site where teams of--\nwhen I say teams, tens upon tens of individuals, including children, \nwere in that particular place. We had to shut down a cantina in and \naround the inner city that had been used for human trafficking in the \ncity of Houston.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  The one point that is very important that I will make--and I will \ncomment on some other aspects that are in this bill--is that human \ntrafficking is profitable. Human trafficking is profitable. That means \nthat slavery is not dead. Human trafficking is profitable.\n  The reason is, tragically, the young child, the young teenager, the \npreteen, the young woman, or the young man or boy is recycled, \ntragically, over and over again, which makes human trafficking more \nthan profitable and vicious and vile. They have to keep that human \nbeing who needs to be free and enjoy the freedom of being a child and \nenjoy the various special things of being a child, like being loved and \nnurtured, going to picnics, going to school, they have to keep that \nyoung woman, that young man in bondage.\n  That is what this bill, as spoken of previously, and certainly among \nother things, speaks to today. In the many bills that were incorporated \nin this bill, it was to eliminate, if you will, the pain and \nviciousness of human trafficking.\n  Let me quickly say that I want to congratulate the fact that this \nbill reduces the rape kit backlog and provides resources for forensic \nlabs in cities all over America. As a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, we were hearing the stories about backlogs of rape kits. So \nthis bill requires at least 75 percent of amounts made available to the \nDOJ for forensic testing and to be used for direct testing of crime \nscene evidence, including rape kits.\n  It improves the sexual assault nurse examiner program by \nincentivizing the hiring of full-time nurses, particularly in rural and \nunderserved areas, and reauthorizes and improves the Paul Coverdell \nForensic Science Improvement Grants, which awards grants to States and \nlocal governments to improve the quality of forensic science services, \nwhich is so very important.\n  I also say that I acknowledge that numerous studies have shown that \nat least 75 percent of youths involved in the justice system have \nexperienced traumatic victimization, making them vulnerable to mental \nhealth disorders and perceived behavioral and noncompliance and \nmisconduct.\n  This legislation deals with best-evidence research to be able to help \nour youth as well, and to ensure that they get the kind of treatment \nthey need, particularly after sexual assault, which is what human \ntrafficking mostly is, besides the heinousness of being held by another \nhuman being.\n  So I am very glad that we are moving forward on the reauthorization \nfor Justice for All for 2016. So many things have been made better.\n  I want to cite one example as I close. I am reminded of this because \nof the floods that we dealt with recently. There were incidences of \nwomen living in places where their name was not on the lease. So, for \nexample, if a man gets evicted for abusing his live-in girlfriend, the \ngirlfriend who is not a named tenant on the lease, but is a resident, \nwould automatically be evicted. That is so very important. Many times, \nthat girlfriend is living there with her children. She would be \npermitted to stay for a reasonable time to establish her own \neligibility to remain in the public housing unit.\n  Let me say this: this is not a one-size-fits-all, but it is not one \ncommunity. It is not any race of people, it is not any economic level \nof people. It is people who are egregiously abusing and violating \nanother human being. In many instances, Judge Poe, it is a child.\n  So I want to thank you for this legislation. Let us continue to walk \nthis pathway together in a bipartisan manner. Certainly, as a very \nvalued member of the Judiciary Committee, a lot of your work is part of \nthat legislative agenda, and I am very glad to join in. A lot of your \nwork is also on the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  Let us work together to save lives and to protect our children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional \nVictims' Rights Caucus, Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX) and Congressman Jim \nCosta (D-CA) who are anchoring this Special Order in support of the \nJustice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016.\n  The Justice for All Act, which I co-sponsored in 2004, enhanced \nprotections for victims of Federal crimes, provided resources to \nimprove the use of DNA and forensic technology to combat crimes, and \nestablished safeguards to prevent and reverse wrongful convictions.\n  This legislation reauthorizes and improves many of the programs \ncreated by the original law and responsibly reduces overall funding in \nresponse to current economic conditions.\n  The bipartisan Justice for All Act of 2004 increased resources \ndevoted to DNA and other forensic technology, established safeguards to \nprevent wrongful convictions, and enhanced protections for crime \nvictims.\n  This legislation builds on the Justice for All Act to improve the \ncriminal justice system and ensure public confidence in it.\n  The Justice for All Act of 2016 increases access to restitution for \ncrime victims and requires that interpreters be available to all \nfederal crime victims who wish to participate in a court proceeding.\n  Reauthorizing important programs used to notify crime victims of \ntheir right to be heard in court, this legislation provides them with \nlegal assistance.\n  Additionally, the bill improves housing rights for domestic violence \nvictims and protects Violence Against Women Act (VA-WA) funding from \nfederal penalties.\n  The bill makes payment of restitution a mandatory condition of \nsupervised release for any defendant convicted of a Federal felony or \nmisdemeanor and ordered to pay restitution.\n  The bill will also amend the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to \ngive the court authority to appoint an interpreter for any victim \npresent during proceedings.\n  Importantly, this legislation supports programs that inform crime \nvictims of their rights and helps ensure that those rights are enforced \nby reauthorizing the Crime Victims Legal Assistance Grants and Crime \nVictims Notification Grants.\n  Reducing current Rape Kit Backlog, the Justice for All Act requires \nthat at least 75% of amounts made available to the Attorney General for \nlocal, state, and Federal forensic activities must be used for direct \ntesting activities described in the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant \nProgram.\n  Requiring law enforcement agencies to conduct audits of their \nbacklogged rape kits, this\n\n[[Page H2958]]\n\nlaw also creates tracking mechanisms, and prioritizes testing in cases \nin which the statute of limitations will soon expire.\n  The Act also amends the Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Program Grants \nto give preference to entities which will: operate or expand forensic \nnurse examiner programs in rural areas or for underserved populations, \nhire full-time forensic nurse examiners, or support training programs \nfor forensic nurse examiners.\n  Critically, the Act provides community health centers, colleges and \nhospitals with information about resources available to address \ndomestic violence, sexual assault, and elder abuse.\n  Clarifying requirements for housing protections in the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, the act will extend protection against automatic \neviction to any ``resident'' in a public housing unit--who is not a \ntenant listed on the lease--in situations where the named tenant is \nevicted.\n  For example, if a man gets evicted for abusing his live-in \ngirlfriend, the girlfriend, who is not a named tenant on the lease but \nis a resident, would not automatically be evicted. She would be \npermitted to stay for a reasonable time to establish her own \neligibility to remain in the public housing unit.\n  The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 strengthens the \nPrison Rape Elimination Act (PREA).\n  PREA currently requires that all states to comply with its \nrequirements or suffer a 5% reduction in DOJ funds they would receive \nfor ``prison purposes.''\n  States can still receive the funds however, even if they are not in \ncompliance, if the Governor submits an ``assurance'' that the state \nwill reallocate 5% of those funds to PREA implementation.\n  To ensure compliance, states are required to have all of their \nprisons audited for at least once every three years.\n  The bill requires Governors to submit with their annual certification \nor assurance information about the state's PREA implementation efforts, \nincluding which correctional facilities were audited in the most recent \naudit year, a proposed schedule for completing an audit of all prison \nduring the next three audit years, and all final audit reports.\n  Numerous studies have also shown that at least 75% of youth involved \nin the justice system have experienced traumatic victimization, making \nthem vulnerable to mental health disorders and perceived behavioral \nnon-compliance and misconduct.\n  Over the years, clear evidence has emerged from federal \ninvestigations, class-action lawsuits or authoritative reports written \nby reputable media outlets or respected public or private agencies \nshowing that youth corrections facility across the country have \nrepeatedly failed to protect youth from violence by staff or other \nyouth, sexual assaults and/or excessive use of isolation or restraints. \n(Annie E. Casey Foundation--Maltreatment Report, 2015).\n  Despite costly law suits and periods of federal supervision, inhumane \nconditions of youth confinement remains rampant and a national \nepidemic.\n  Despite national outcry for compliance with PREA, Many states have \nfailed to implement and enforce its standards for youth in correctional \nand detention facilities.\n  Current law provides that states not conforming to required protocols \nwill lose 5% of all funds they receive from the U.S. DOJ grant \nprograms.\n  However, financial penalties will not begin until 2017, and expected \nthat DOJ will extend deadline and/or disperse funds to non-compliant \nstates (provided they use the money toward implementing PREA \nrequirements). (AECF Report).\n  Further, the bill requires the Attorney General to post all final \naudit reports on its website and to update the site at least annually.\n  Expanding the reach of these valiant efforts, the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act of 2016 clarifies that grants authorized for victim \nassistance may be used to support nonprofit entities which assist \nvictims of crime on a nationwide basis or Americans abroad who are \nvictims of crimes committed outside of the United States.\n  Truly, improving the administration of criminal justice programs, the \nbill increases accountability for federal funds spent by state and \nlocal governments by requiring that states receiving funds under the \nEdward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program develop a \nstrategic plan detailing how the funds will be spent.\n  The bill directs the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to \npromulgate best practices for evidence retention within eighteen months \nof enactment and requires NIJ to assist state, local, and tribal \ngovernments wishing to adopt those best practices.\n  Because this bill has tremendous potential to improve victims' access \nto justice, support law enforcement, exonerate the innocent, and \nstrengthen and improve the criminal justice system, we urge the \ncommittee to bring this bill up for timely consideration and passage.\n  As a member of the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, I thank my \ncolleagues Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX) and Congressman Jim Costa (D-CA) \n) for hosting this Special Order in support of the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act of 2016.\n  It is an invaluable and much needed effort.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. As the \ngentlewoman knows and has been mentioned on the House floor, I think, \nby Mr. Weber, Houston, Texas, is a hub for child sex trafficking in the \nUnited States, and it is because of our location. We are using that, \nthough, to change the dynamics of the city, working with our new mayor, \nSylvester Turner, who was in the State legislature for a long time.\n  Our new mayor has now come up with a protocol for the city of Houston \nto work to eliminate this scourge. I think it is a protocol that cities \nthroughout the country will be able to use themselves to address the \nissue, admit the problem, and then deal with it on a multilayer basis, \nworking with all the nonprofits and all the government agencies and \ndifferent types of law enforcement.\n  So I know that the gentlewoman is working with the mayor on this \nproject. I want to congratulate you and the mayor for taking this issue \nand solving it so that Houston now will be an example of what to do in \nsolving this scourge.\n  I also thank you for being on the Victims' Rights Caucus. As you \nmentioned, it is bipartisan. Jim Costa and I started this in 2005. \nThere are 80 members: 40 Republicans, 40 Democrats.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Victims' Rights Caucus promotes victims of crime \nbefore Congress.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I express my appreciation for being a member of the \nVictims' Right Caucus because it is bipartisan. I should say it is \nmulticommunities. All different people.\n  Let me thank the gentleman for mentioning Mayor Turner. This is an \nexciting effort. If you don't take notice, you are not going to be able \nto solve the problem. And that is what the city is doing. It is taking \nnotice and putting in infrastructure for being helpful.\n  Let me close by simply saying that, as Judge Poe knows, in the last \ncouple of days of Houston we have been mourning the killing of an 11-\nyear-old child on his way home from school. We have not determined who \nit is, but all I can say to you is that even our children are \nvulnerable, whether by a heinous individual that maybe was trying to \npick the child up--we don't know--but the child is now deceased. My \nsympathies to his family, the Flores family in my congressional \ndistrict. All I can say is that it is our responsibility to protect \nthese children and not for little Josue to have died in vain in the \ntragic way that he lost his life.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman for allowing me to offer sympathy to his \nfamily and his community and say that we are doing the right thing by \ntrying to protect those who are most vulnerable.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. The gentlewoman is exactly correct. That is really \nwhat we are supposed to be doing, is helping those that are the least \nfortunate, the most vulnerable in our community. And there is no more \nvulnerable people than our children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize numerous Members of Congress \nwho have worked on all this legislation. Before I do that, though, I \nwant to recognize a person on my staff, Blair Bjellos, who is leaving \nthe Hill and going to work for one of these groups that is trying to \nsave the world, which is great. They are.\n  Blair has worked for me for almost 6 years. She is my victim \nadvocate. I think I am the only Member of Congress that has a victim \nadvocate who works on victims' issues. She was, in large part, \nresponsible for drafting this legislation, Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act. I want to thank her publicly for the work she has done \non the victims' movement, working on the Victims' Rights Caucus, this \nlegislation, and for other victims' issues as well. I am fortunate to \nhave a person who is so passionate working to help those who are most \nvulnerable in our community, and that is victims of crime. So I want to \nthank her for doing that.\n  I want to mention some other Members of Congress and just put in the\n\n[[Page H2959]]\n\nRecord some of the things they have been doing. It is not all of them, \nbut in limited time, I am going to mention the ones I can.\n  Two Members, bipartisan--one Republican, one Democrat--Renee Ellmers \nand Debbie Wasserman Schultz--introduced the Trafficking Awareness \nTraining for Health Care Act.\n  Remember, Mr. Speaker, all these bills were combined, passed the \nHouse, go to the Senate, and Senator Cornyn and Senator Wyden combined \nthem into one bill, it came back to House after it passed the Senate, \nand was signed by the President.\n  Also, Erik Paulsen, a Republican, and Representative Gwen Moore, a \nDemocrat, introduced the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act.\n  Joe Heck of Nevada, who was going to be here tonight to speak, \nintroduced Enhancing Services for Runaway and Homeless Victims of Youth \nTrafficking Act.\n  Ann Wagner, as has been mentioned already, introduced the SAVE Act; \nMark Walker, Human Trafficking Detection Act; Kristi Noem, Human \nTrafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act; Tom Marino and \nKaren Bass--one Republican, one Democrat--Strengthening Child Welfare \nResponse for Human Trafficking; Joyce Beatty, who has spoken here \ntonight, also worked with Ann Wagner and also introduced Improve the \nResponse to Victims of Child Sex Trafficking Act; and Sean Maloney \nintroduced the Human Trafficking Prevention Act.\n  There were lots of individuals, lots of folks who helped in the \nHouse. Then we had support from over 200 organizations throughout the \ncountry, trying to get this legislation passed. Some of those are \nRights4Girls, Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, Shared Hope \nInternational, End Child Prostitution and Trafficking in the USA, \nNational Children's Alliance, National Association to Protect Children, \nEquality Now, National Conference of State Legislatures, and the \nNational Criminal Justice Association were all on the same page of the \nhymnal singing the same song, Mr. Speaker, and that song is that we are \ngoing to do everything we can to stop this scourge of human \ntrafficking.\n  We want those folks to know that trafficked young children have no \nplace to hide and that those customers that buy those kids have no \nplace to hide. There is no safe place for them.
