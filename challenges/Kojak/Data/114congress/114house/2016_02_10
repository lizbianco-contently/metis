The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I came to Congress committed to helping \nthe Federal Government do a better job dealing with water and \nsanitation. We have had great success internationally raising the \nprofile and directing more money in a more effective way to deal with \nwater and sanitation in poor countries, making a difference in millions \nof lives.\n  In the United States, we often take those conditions for granted. But \nas has been demonstrated recently in Flint, Michigan, we do so at our \nperil because we have serious problems right here in the United States. \nIt is not just Flint, Michigan. There are up to 10 million lead water \nlines that remain where even a slight change in the water chemistry, \neven from just repairing it, can damage lead pipes enough to start \ncontaminating people's water. What is underground and out of sight is \nactually in worse condition than our crumbling roads and bridges. \nAmerica leaks more water than we drink every day.\n  In the aftermath of the recession, we have seen States cut drinking \nwater budgets and staff. The Federal Government had cut our investment \nin drinking water infrastructure by more than 80 percent by 1980. This, \ndespite the fact that ours is a growing country with aging \ninfrastructure that was rated a D by the American Society of Civil \nEngineers in their latest report.\n  Now, I am pleased that the administration in its budget would put a \nlittle extra money to help replace lead pipes. Sadly, that is being \nfinanced by cutting even more from the Clean Water State Revolving \nFund, essentially at the expense of keeping water clean in the first \nplace.\n  We should look at our water infrastructure as an entire system and \nincreased Federal investment is long overdue. We would have to increase \nour funding 500 percent to reach the level of spending during Jimmy \nCarter's presidency.\n  I have long advocated the development of a water infrastructure trust \nfund. We have reintroduced a bipartisan, budget-neutral solution to \ncreate a dedicated water infrastructure trust fund to provide \nadditional revenue to State and local water and sanitation projects. It \nis financed by a voluntary program where businesses that rely heavily \non clean water, like the beverage industry, for example, that have a \nkeen interest in maintaining water infrastructure would, on a voluntary \nbasis, pay a miniscule fee. In exchange, they would be designated as \nsupporting the clean water trust fund.\n  It is estimated that this could generate up to $7 billion annually in \nnew revenue that could go to State and local governments as grants and \nloans, which in turn could leverage even more money.\n  This legislation would also give direction and resources for the EPA \nto deal with the affordability gap. We can actually finance much of the \nneeded water and infrastructure improvements, but we are hamstrung \nbecause there is understandable reluctance to raise rates that fall too \nmuch on the poorest of citizens. Thus, we are in a cycle of unpaid \nwater and sewer bills that leaves nobody with satisfactory \nalternatives.\n  This legislation would give more money to State and local \ngovernments, allowing them to leverage additional money and to focus on \nways to deal with a very substantial problem of low income for whom \naccess to safe drinking water and sanitation is every bit as \nfundamental a human right as what we are doing to help poor people \noverseas achieve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I celebrate Secretary Clinton and a number of our \ncolleagues going to Flint, Michigan, to focus on the problem. I applaud \npeople who are looking at where the system failed, but I would hope we \nwould pay as much attention to the systematic failure of Congress and \nat the State level to attach priority to this fundamental building \nblock for a livable community.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me, not just in cosponsoring H.R. \n4468, but enacting the trust fund and fighting for budgets that \nrepresent the resources this crisis demands.\n\n[[Page H654]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H654-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n               DEDICATED WATER INFRASTRUCTURE TRUST FUND\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, next week marks an important milestone in the \nhistory of North Carolina's Piedmont region--the 250th anniversary of \nthe founding of the town of Salem.\n  In 1752, Moravian Church leaders purchased a 100,000-acre tract in \nNorth Carolina from the British Lord Granville. On February 19, 1766, \ntwelve Moravian brethren from nearby settlements made an 8-mile journey \nto establish the town of Salem, a new community that would serve as the \ntract's commercial center.\n  Moravian Church leaders decided that the new town should have the \nconvenience of running water to the buildings. The town built a \nwaterworks, which was constructed by burying hollowed logs from springs \nlocated about a mile away. This addition to Salem's infrastructure \nattracted the attention of President George Washington, who visited in \n1793.\n  However, Washington was not the first famous visitor to Salem. In \n1767, the royal Governor William Tryon heard about the building going \non in North Carolina's northwest wilderness. He and his wife made the \nlong journey from New Bern to examine the Moravians' new settlement \nfirsthand.\n  Along with its advanced plumbing, Salem was also at the forefront of \ninnovative medicine and was home to the first university-educated \nphysician in western North Carolina. In addition, Salem was known \nacross the colonial South as a place of commerce and trade, renowned \nfor its pottery, furniture, silver, and other artistic trades.\n  In 1913, the town of Salem, with its focus on craftsmanship, \nsustainability, education, and religion merged with the fast-paced \nindustrial town of Winston, thus becoming Winston-Salem.\n  Today, Winston-Salem is the fifth largest city in North Carolina. It \nis home to six colleges and universities, including Salem College, the \noldest continuously running women's college in the United States, as \nwell as the prestigious Wake Forest University and Winston-Salem State \nUniversity.\n  Reaffirming this time-honored tradition of forging boldly ahead, the \ncity continues to build a diverse business space leading in the areas \nof nanotechnology research, finance, and manufacturing.\n  The original settlement is a living history museum that engages \nvisitors in an educational, historical experience about those who lived \nand worked in the early South.\n  During the yearlong anniversary celebration, the Moravian Church, Old \nSalem, the City of Winston-Salem, and Forsyth County will honor \nimportant milestones in the town's 250-year history, such as George \nWashington's two-night visit to Salem in 1739 and the Nation's first \npublic July 4th celebration that took place in 1783. Most importantly, \nthe local community will come together to celebrate and reflect on how \nSalem's past informs its present and shapes its future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H654-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FORTHCOMING LEGISLATION ON PUERTO RICO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPuerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, Congress will hold its eighth hearing on \nPuerto Rico later this month. At the direction of Speaker Ryan, the \nNatural Resources Committee will then lead an effort to craft \nlegislation for the territory. The record will demonstrate that there \nis not a single crisis in Puerto Rico, but a series of intertwined \ncrises. It is an economic crisis, a fiscal crisis, a liquidity crisis, \na debt crisis, an immigration crisis, and a public administration \ncrisis.\n  If you visualize Puerto Rico as a tree and each crisis as a withering \nbranch, the root of the tree is Puerto Rico's unequal and undignified \npolitical status. While the immediate aim is to mend the branches, \nultimately, we will need to attack the problem at its root and that \nmeans Puerto Rico must become a State or a sovereign nation.\n  Last week, Antonio Weiss, a senior Treasury Department official, \nstated as follows:\n\n       There is no question that status is vitally important. Why \n     are we proposing that restructuring authorities and the \n     earned income tax credit and fair Medicaid treatment be \n     provided to Puerto Rico? Well, as a territory, Puerto Rico's \n     status does not afford it adequate tools in those three \n     areas. So we believe that we need to afford the Commonwealth \n     those tools that it needs so it can navigate this crisis. And \n     we agree that over a long period of time, status has \n     contributed to this crisis.\n\n  Since the problem in Puerto Rico has multiple dimensions, the \nlegislative solution should as well. First, the bill must empower \nPuerto Rico to restructure a meaningful portion of its debt. The bill \ncould provide a period in which consensual negotiations between bond \ninsurers and their creditors, mediated by neutral experts, can take \nplace. If those negotiations do not bear fruit, the Puerto Rico \nGovernment should be empowered to authorize its instrumentalities to \nadjust their debts under chapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, a \nright that every State has and that Puerto Rico used to have.\n  Puerto Rico's congressionally approved constitution provides that \nbonds issued or guaranteed by the central government receive priority \npayment. What binds us together as Americans--and Puerto Ricans are \nproud American citizens--is our commitment to the rule of law.\n  While I do not believe that Congress should override Puerto Rico's \nconstitution, I do expect all creditor classes, including GO \nbondholders, to make concessions for the public good that will \nultimately benefit all stakeholders. I sense that a bipartisan \nconsensus is finally emerging in support of reasonable debt \nrestructuring authority for Puerto Rico.\n  Second, the bill should address the outrageous disparities that \nPuerto Rico faces under key Federal programs, a main driver of our \ndeficits and debt. Consider that historically, Puerto Rico received \n$300 billion in annual Medicaid funding, while the similarly sized \nOregon receives $5 billion. I challenge any State to run a decent \nMedicaid program with that insulting sum without overborrowing in the \ncapital markets. Impossible.\n  Finally, the Puerto Rico Government has a record of fiscal \nmismanagement. This is a painful fact, but a fact nonetheless. We must \nface up to it, resolve to do better, and welcome some temporary \nassistance. I would support the creation of an independent board to \napprove Puerto Rico Government's financial plan and annual budgets and \nto help ensure they are adhered to.\n  The past is not always a prologue. There is no reason why future \nPuerto Rico leaders cannot embrace fiscal discipline, as distinct from \nausterity, and rapidly put the oversight board out of business. And \nCongress should be careful about casting moral judgment on Puerto Rico \nsince the Federal Government has a $14 trillion debt that is 75 percent \nof the GDP. We, in Puerto Rico, are responsible for our actions, but \nCongress is responsible for its actions and inaction as well.\n  A balanced board will obtain buy-in from government, business, and \nlabor leaders in Puerto Rico and can serve as a bridge to a brighter \nfuture. However, a punitive board that disrespects my constituents and \ntramples on the principle of states' rights will transform me from an \nally to an adversary very quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H654-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H654-H655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n             DEBT CEILING BILL IS FINANCIALLY IRRESPONSIBLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, America entrusted Republicans \nwith the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014.\n  Democrats lost Congress because their financially irresponsible \nconduct and trillion-dollar deficits threaten America with a \ndebilitating insolvency and bankruptcy.\n  House Republicans inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit in 2011. They cut \nit to $1.1 trillion in 2012, cut it to $680 billion in 2013, cut it to \n$485 billion in 2014, and cut it to $439 billion in 2015.\n  House Republicans did what the American people elected them to do. In \neach election thereafter, we were entrusted with 2 more years of a \nHouse Republican majority.\n\n[[Page H655]]\n\n  Unfortunately, newly released data from the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office reveals America's financial condition has taken a sharp \nturn for the worse.\n  According to the CBO, the first quarter fiscal year 2016 deficit \ndeteriorated by $36 billion compared to 2015's first quarter deficit. \nIf extrapolated to a full year, America's FY 2016 deficit would be $583 \nbillion. That is $144 billion worse than in fiscal year 2015.\n  Out-of-control spending was the problem, not taxes. During the first \nquarter, tax revenues were up 4 percent, but spending was up even more, \nat 7 percent.\n  Now, for the first time since I have been in Congress, Republican \ncompromises and surrenders to Obama and Democrats have made America's \ndeficits worse, not better.\n  This Congress broke open our kids' piggy banks, stole money we cannot \npay back, and used it to pay for a trillion-dollar omnibus spending \nbill that adds tens of billions of dollars to 2016's deficit. I am \nproud I voted against the financially irresponsible omnibus.\n  Mr. Speaker, America's Comptroller General and the CBO repeatedly \nwarn that America's financial path is ``unsustainable,'' meaning \nAmerica faces a debilitating insolvency and bankruptcy unless we get \nour financial house in order.\n  Further, the CBO warns that, absent correction, America's debt \nservice costs will increase by $600 billion per year within a decade, \nroughly what America spends on national defense, which begs the \nquestion: Where will the money come from for an additional annual $600 \nbillion debt service payment?\n  America's total debt approached $14 trillion when I was elected to \nCongress in 2010. We have blown through the $19 trillion mark. Now the \nCBO projects America will blow through the $29 trillion debt mark in a \ndecade.\n  For emphasis, Washington is engaged in the worst generational theft \nin American history. Washington steals from our children and \ngrandchildren with a callous devil-may-care attitude so that we can \ntoday live high on the hog, even though it forces our children into \nhardship and poverty.\n  Economic principles don't care if you are a family, a business, or a \ncountry. If you borrow more money than you can pay back, you go \nbankrupt. Time is running out. Washington must balance the budget \nbefore America's debt burden spirals out of control, before it is too \nlate to prevent the debilitating insolvency and bankruptcy that awaits \nus.\n  Mr. Speaker, Americans are rightfully angry at Washington elected \nofficials who care more about special interest campaign contributions \nthan American voters or America's future.\n  Will the American people channel their anger in the 2016 elections \nand elect Washington officials who both understand the threat posed by \ndeficits and debt and have the backbone to fix it? The answer to that \nquestion determines whether America continues as a great nation and \nworld power or declines into the dustbin of history.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can't speak for anyone else, but as for me, Mo Brooks \nfrom Alabama's Fifth Congressional District, I fight for financial \nresponsibility and prosperity and against an American bankruptcy and \neconomic depression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H655-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         EMERGENCY REQUEST FOR $1.8 BILLION TO FIGHT ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nHawaii (Ms. Gabbard) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly urge my colleagues \nto support the President's emergency request of $1.8 billion to fight \nthe spread of the Zika virus, a dangerous, mosquito-borne illness that \nhas surfaced in my home State of Hawaii and in at least 12 other States \nacross the country.\n  The symptoms and effects of the Zika virus, which have prompted an \ninternational public health emergency from the World Health \nOrganization, are not dissimilar to another mosquito-borne disease, \nDengue fever.\n  Dengue fever is spread through the very same Aedes aegypti mosquito \nas carries the Zika virus, as well as other mosquito variations. Like \nthe Zika virus, Dengue fever symptoms include fevers, rashes, joint and \nmuscle pains, severe headaches, and other painful symptoms.\n  The CDC has reported the harmful symptoms and effects of both Zika \nand Dengue and the ability of both of these diseases to spread very \nrapidly through mosquitos present in many regions of the United States, \nincluding in my home district.\n  So far, there have been around 50 cases of Zika virus confirmed in \nthe United States. But in the past 16 weeks, there have been 252 known \ncases of Dengue fever on Hawaii Island alone.\n  Now, Mayor Billy Kenoi, Hawaii County's mayor, on Monday announced a \nstate of emergency for the county to deploy more resources to battle \nthis Dengue fever outbreak.\n  I have asked our Governor to declare a state of emergency in response \nto this outbreak so that the people of Hawaii can receive every \nresource available to protect themselves, to eradicate this mosquito \nand its breeding grounds, and stop the spread of Dengue fever, which \nhas quickly become the largest outbreak in the State of Hawaii since \nthe 1940s.\n  The CDC has activated its emergency operations center to level 1 \nstatus. Now, to put this level 1 status in context, the CDC has only \nraised the emergency operations center to level 1 three times in the \npast: during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, during the H1N1 pandemic in \n2009, and after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n  The President's leadership and emergency request on this urgent issue \nis warranted and necessary to respond aggressively to the Zika virus \nearly on. He is treating this with the seriousness it deserves, \nrecognizing this global public health threat, the impacts, and long-\nlasting effects of which still are not fully known.\n  At the end of last year, Congress came together and passed a \nbipartisan omnibus spending bill that increased funding for public \nhealth preparedness and response by more than $52 million than the \nprevious fiscal year, but this additional emergency funding request is \nnecessary now in communities like mine on Hawaii Island and in \ndifferent parts of the country to combat disease-transmitting mosquito \nviruses like Zika and Dengue fever.\n  It is imperative that Congress, Federal agencies, local governments, \nand private sector partners partner together to take action now to deal \nwith the outbreaks we already have and prevent something far worse from \noccurring.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to push this critical \npublic health funding forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H655-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H655-H656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PFC JOSEPH P. DWYER VETERANS PEER SUPPORT PROGRAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Zeldin) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, this week I introduced legislation in the \nHouse to expand the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Veterans Peer Support Program \nto the national level.\n  PFC Joseph Dwyer was from Mount Sinai, New York, located in my home \ndistrict of Suffolk County.\n  PFC Dwyer served in Iraq and received nationwide recognition for a \nphotograph that went viral, showing him cradling a wounded Iraqi boy \nwhile his unit was fighting its way up to the capital city of Baghdad.\n  Sadly, after returning home and struggling with PTSD, PFC Dwyer died \nin 2008 and left behind a young widow, Matina, and a 2-year-old \ndaughter, Meagan.\n  In 2012, while serving in the New York State Senate, I created the \nDwyer Program as part of the 2012-2013 State budget. Originally in four \ncounties, including Suffolk, this program has since expanded to over a \ndozen counties throughout New York.\n  The Dwyer Program is a peer-to-peer support program for veterans \nsuffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain \ninjury. The program provides a safe, confidential, and educational \nplatform where all veterans are welcome to build vet-to-vet \nrelationships, supporting each other's transition from service to post-\nservice life.\n  During the first year alone, we were able to conduct 148 group \nsessions, serving 450 veterans just within Suffolk. Since 2013, the \nprogram has\n\n[[Page H656]]\n\nhelped over 1,500 veterans in New York State battling PTSD and TBI.\n  With the success that we have had in New York, I know that, if we \nmake this program national, we will ensure that every veteran across \nAmerica will eventually have access to a peer-to-peer support group.\n  With the VA reporting that an estimated 22 veterans a day commit \nsuicide, this national effort is long overdue. We must ensure that all \nveterans across America receive the proper care they need and deserve.\n  I will be working hard to spread awareness of my bill, gather \ncosponsors and the support of veteran groups and mental health \norganizations from all across the country so that we can pass this bill \nas soon as possible.\n\n\n                   We Must Act Now on the Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, shifting gears, on a completely separate \ntopic, I also rise today to discuss the mosquito-borne Zika virus, \nwhich has spread at rapid rates across South America, Central America, \nand the Caribbean, infecting individuals in more than 25 countries.\n  Zika has caused widespread alarm across the global community after \nBrazil reported a rise in the reported cases of microcephaly, a disease \nthat leads tragically to a baby being born with an unusually small head \nand brain damage.\n  What is so concerning about the Zika virus is how easily it can \nspread. The virus is spread not only through a mosquito bite, but also \nby contact with infected blood or sexual contact.\n  Furthermore, there is currently no vaccine to prevent or any medicine \nto treat the virus. All these factors have led the World Health \nOrganization to declare the Zika virus a public health emergency.\n  Confirmed cases of the Zika virus have been popping up across the \nU.S., including at least three confirmed cases in my home district of \nSuffolk County, Long Island.\n  With the recent outbreaks and the number of Zika cases among \ntravelers visiting or returning to the United States, it is only a \nmatter of time before this becomes a widespread epidemic right here at \nhome. This is why we must act now.\n  I recently introduced legislation, the Counterterrorism Screening and \nAssistance Act of 2016, H.R. 4314, which passed the House Committee on \nForeign Affairs with bipartisan support.\n  One key aspect of this legislation is that the bill would put in \nplace a monitoring system that would screen for infectious diseases \nabroad to contain and prevent any potential outbreaks.\n  The bill also helps quarantine the virus, authorizing the Secretary \nof Homeland Security to provide equipment and supplies to mitigate the \nrisk or threat of infectious diseases such as Zika.\n  This is a measure that is long overdue to protect not only our \nhomeland from terrorism, but also to ensure that we are prepared to \ncombat the spread of any infectious diseases. With this bill's passage \nout of committee, it is clear that my colleagues in Congress share my \nview.\n  I will continue to push for full passage of my Counterterrorism \nScreening and Assistance Act in the House and urge my colleagues to \nbring this bipartisan bill to the House floor for a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H656-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMBATING BDS ACT OF 2016\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the boycott, divestment, and \nsanctions movement, more commonly known as the BDS movement, has been \nemployed as a hateful weapon to delegitimize the State of Israel and \nall those who stand with her.\n  The BDS movement has neither brought Israelis and Palestinians closer \nto peace nor advanced the laudable goal of improving dialogue between \nthe supporters of both sides. Instead, it has served as a means to \ndemagogue Israel and inflame tensions in communities and college \ncampuses around our Nation.\n  Rather than sit back and react to the BDS movement's aggressive \nefforts to foment hatred for Israel, it is time to take charge and \nsimply say: ``Enough.'' It is time to go on offense against the BDS \nmovement's ongoing economic warfare targeting Israel.\n  That is why I am proud to announce the Combating BDS Act of 2016, \nbipartisan legislation that I am introducing with the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Vargas), a courageous leader in the anti-BDS movement.\n  The Combating BDS Act of 2016 affirms on the Federal level the \nauthority of State and local governments to divest public funds or \nentities that engage in commerce or investment-related boycott, \ndivestment, or sanctions activity targeting Israel.\n  Here is why this idea is so important. Similar to previous local \nefforts to divest from companies doing business with Iran, we are now \nseeing a growing movement in State and local governments throughout the \nNation to enact measures to divest public funds from entities \nparticipating in anti-Israel BDS.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  The Combating BDS Act of 2016 strengthens these efforts by affirming \nthe legal authority of State and local governments to act on divestment \nwithout running afoul of any potential Federal limitations.\n  This important legislation empowers community leaders and individuals \nwho seek to counter the hateful targeting and delegitimization against \nIsrael, and it sends an unquestionable message about where the United \nStates Congress stands on BDS.\n  This is not about left versus right. This is about right versus \nwrong. It must remain bipartisan. As the author of the Combating BDS \nAct of 2016, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to advance this powerful and important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H656-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H656-H657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IRAN'S HOSTILITY MUST BE COMBATED\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Roskam) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran--its past and its future.\n  February 11 is just an ordinary day for Americans, but in Iran, \ntomorrow is anything but ordinary. Military parades and massive state-\nsponsored celebrations fill the streets of Tehran and cities across the \nIslamic Republic. In just a few hours, it will be Islamic Revolution's \nVictory Day in Iran. The regime celebrates 37 years since the violent \ncoup that brought the Ayatollah Khomeini to power and transferred Iran \ninto a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy and the world's largest state \nsponsor of terrorism.\n  It is a dark period of history, Mr. Speaker. Thousands of innocent \npeople were killed as the revolutionaries consolidated power. The U.S. \nEmbassy was overrun and more than 50 Americans were held hostage for \n444 days.\n  The United States has seen six Presidents since 1979, reflecting a \nbroad range of leadership styles and governing philosophies. The \nIslamic Republic has been led by two Supreme Leaders, both zealots \nfanatically committed to the revolutionary ideas they espouse being \ncelebrated on the streets of Tehran on this day. Make no mistake, Mr. \nSpeaker, we are dealing with the same Iran today as we were in 1979.\n  The only day being celebrated by some Americans at the moment is \nimplementation day, as President Obama's dangerous nuclear deal has now \ncome and gone. The world is much more dangerous because of it.\n  Iran, the leading patron of global terrorism, just received a $100 \nbillion check. The mullahs continue to foment violence and chaos across \nthe Middle East, and their nuclear structure remains intact. The Obama \nadministration has long argued that we would only be giving them $50 \nbillion, but even they have conceded that it is closer to $100 billion \nor more.\n  We were also told that Iran would moderate its behavior as a result \nof this capitulation. Just in the past few weeks, Iran captured and \nhumiliated American sailors, illegally launched ballistic missiles, \nfired rockets within 1,500 yards of U.S. ships, and flew a drone over a \nU.S. aircraft carrier. The list goes on and on.\n  Iranian Special Forces continue to assist al-Assad in his slaughter \nof innocents in Syria. Over 200,000 have been killed so far. Iranian-\nbacked militias are likely responsible for kidnapping three American \ncontractors in Iraq.\n\n[[Page H657]]\n\n  It doesn't take much imagination to figure out what Iran will do with \nanother $100 billion, which is the windfall that they are about to \nreceive based on this bad deal. As President Obama and Secretary Kerry \nhave both begrudgingly admitted, it is nearly certain that the Iranians \nwill use this money to sow the seeds of even more death and \ndestruction. Think about that. They are nearly certain that part of \nthis $100 billion will go there.\n  The Islamic Republic is not our friend, Mr. Speaker. It is a \ndangerous geopolitical foe. It is led by a cult of extremists that are \nhellbent on our annihilation. Yet President Obama will do nothing to \nstem the tide of the Ayatollah's ambitions.\n  When faced with an adversary whose theology and eschatology are \nfundamentally incompatible with peace and world order, the United \nStates, under President Obama's leadership, chose a path of \nappeasement. I truly believe President Obama has made perhaps the most \ndangerous foreign policy blunder in our lifetime. We are now facing a \nnewly emboldened, cash-rich, radical Islamic regime fully committed to \nweakening our Nation, terrorizing the West, and destroying our way of \nlife.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is up to Congress to do everything in our power to \nkeep as much of this money as possible out of the hands of Iran's \nterrorist proxies. The Congress must move swiftly to strengthen \nterrorism- and human rights-related sanctions against Iran and its \nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Congress must maintain strict \noversight over Iran's nuclear program as its infrastructure remains \nintact.\n  Iran's hostility must be combated, Mr. Speaker, and this body should \nnot abrogate that responsibility, even if our President already has.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H657-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SARACINI AVIATION SAFETY ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, in light of recent reports of ISIS \nentering Europe disguised as refugees and a terrorist having just tried \nto take down an aircraft, I think it is important to understand the \nthreats we face, but also to learn from the past.\n  In the 9/11 Report, al Qaeda mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told \nal Qaeda terrorists to watch the cockpit doors at takeoff and landing \nto observe whether the captain went into the lavatory during the flight \nand to note whether the flight attendants brought food into the \ncockpit.\n  We all know what happened when these attackers stormed the flight \ndeck and turned our airliners into weapons of war. But today, more than \n14 years after the attacks of September 11, the FAA still admits the \ncockpit is vulnerable when the reinforced door has to be opened. That \nis unacceptable.\n  We know that terrorists study our vulnerabilities and make their \nplans accordingly. Yet, even after the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission emphasized the importance of ``a layered security system,'' \nwe have not taken the simple, cost-effective step to protect the skies \nabove us with the installation of secondary barrier doors.\n  These lightweight, wire-mesh gates can be closed whenever the cockpit \ndoor is opened and effectively protect against a terrorist--or team of \nterrorists--rushing the cockpit by providing the pilot enough time to \nrecognize the threat and reenter and lock the reinforced cockpit door. \nThey are easy to deploy and stow, and provide the ``layered \nprotection'' that experts agree is needed.\n  That is why I have introduced the Saracini Aviation Safety Act. This \nis a one-page bill named after my constituent, United Airlines pilot \nVictor J. Saracini, whose life was taken when his aircraft was hijacked \nand flown into the South Tower of the World Trade Center on September \n11. It requires that these cost-effective secondary barriers be \nincluded on large passenger aircraft.\n  We promised to never forget those lost on 9/11 and the lessons \nlearned by all of us on that tragic day; yet after many years and more \nthan 40 hijacking attempts around the world, including five that were \nsuccessful, we are still not taking this threat seriously.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will continue to advocate for the adoption of this \ncommonsense policy, both as a stand-alone bill or as part of a larger \npiece of legislation like the FAA reauthorization, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H657-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H657-H658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  GTMO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, one of the most oft-repeated campaign \npromises from President Obama's 2008 campaign was his determination to \nclose the U.S. Guantanamo Bay detention facility.\n  Congress, a coequal branch of government representing each citizen \nand reelected every 2 years, hasn't come to the same conclusion as \nPresident Obama about the status of GTMO moving forward. Because of \nthis, we have blocked funding for its closure year after year after \nyear.\n  We have strong reasons for concern. Last September, the Director of \nNational Intelligence reported that 117 transferred detainees are \nconfirmed to be reengaging in terrorist activities, with another 79 \nsuspected to have done so. Disturbingly, this amounts to a full 30 \npercent of transferred detainees either confirmed or suspected of \nreengaging in terrorist activities.\n  The Director's report clearly shows that the detainee transfer \nprocess is obviously deeply flawed and poses a significant unnecessary \nand unacceptable risk to the security of our Nation and, quite frankly, \nthe world.\n  The high percentage of reengagement clearly exposes the fact that we \nhave just simply failed to properly identify the threat posed by \ntransferred detainees and provide necessary safeguards to protect our \ncitizens--safeguards that should have been in place before one single \ntransfer ever took place.\n  Given the dire national security implications posed by these detainee \ntransfers, I, along with 23 of my colleagues in this House, sent a \nletter last week to President Obama requesting to see the terms of \nagreements made with countries where detainees have and will be \ntransferred.\n  There are 55 countries, by the way, including the likes of Yemen, \nSomalia, Pakistan, Libya, Iraq, and Iran. Yemen, really? Libya is a \nfailed state--which we may have had a great part in creating--and we \nare sending terrorists there to be detained? Think about it. What \nincentive would it take for you to bring a terrorist to your country? \nto your neighborhood? to your home?\n  In particular, I am interested in the agreements' provisions to \nmitigate the inherent danger posed by detainee transfers. Specifically, \nwhat were the provisions aimed at preventing reengagement? Were there \nany? How did we ensure accountability by the home countries? What did \nthese nations do to prevent contact with known terrorists, especially \nin countries that are full of terrorists, like Yemen or Somalia? How \ndid we ensure these countries offer no form of aid and assistance to \nterrorist organizations?\n  The President says detaining these people is a recruiting magnet. \nWell, I wonder if we shouldn't detain gang members in our country. It \nis a right of passage to go to prison if you are in a gang. Should we \nlet them all out, too? According to that logic, incarcerating them \ncreates more of them.\n  He also says that detaining them indefinitely, without a trial, \nviolates America's principles. You know what? He is right. You ought to \nask yourselves as taxpayers: Why did we pay millions of dollars for a \nstate-of-the-art court facility for sensitive and top-secret \ninformation during a trial, and yet no one has been put on trial? It is \nright there next to the detention facility. I walked through it myself. \nWhy can't the military tribunals take place so we can find out what the \ndeal is with these people and have them incarcerated correctly or set \nthem free? It doesn't happen at all.\n  President Obama declared to America in 2013 that his administration \nis ``the most transparent administration in history.'' I will take some \nissue with that. Despite that fact, the President has clearly not lived \nup to this standard recently.\n  I sincerely hope that the President will give his promise of \ntransparency higher priority than the priority given to unilaterally \nclosing GTMO as part of a final-year, legacy-driven agenda. It is\n\n[[Page H658]]\n\nnot about his agenda. It is about the security of our Nation. It should \nbe about the security of the world. These folks should not be let out. \nThey should be given due process. They certainly shouldn't be sent to \ncountries that are terrorist in nature.\n  Finally, the American people should know what the deal is. How much \nis this costing? Are we sending arms to these countries? What are the \narrangements? There are 55 countries. Why would they take these \nterrorists?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H658-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL BOY SCOUTS DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this past Monday, February \n8, is recognized by many as National Boy Scouts Day, marking the \nincorporation of the Boy Scouts of America 106 years ago.\n  I have spent close to four decades as a scoutmaster, Juniata Valley \nBoy Scout Council executive board member and council president, and as \na scouting dad. My wife and I are scouting parents, with three sons we \nare very proud of who are Eagle Scouts today.\n  In my own scouting experience, I was honored to become one of just \n2,000 people, since 1969, to receive the national Distinguished Eagle \nScout Award.\n  It was my experience in scouting that first sparked my interest in \npublic service--in the vein of the Boy Scout promise, which urges us, \nin part, to do our duty to God, to our country, and in the service of \nother people.\n  Scouting got its start around the turn of the last century, thanks to \nthe efforts of British Army Officer Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-\nPowell.\n  As Scouting history has it, in 1909, a Chicago businessman, a \npublisher, William D. Boyce, who actually grew up in western \nPennsylvania, lost his way in a dense fog in London.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  A young boy came to his aid, guiding Mr. Boyce to his destination. \nAnd in the end, when Mr. Boyce offered that young boy a tip, a coin, \nthe boy refused the tip offered by Mr. Boyce stating: Sir, I am a \nScout, and Scouts do not take rewards for doing good turns.\n  Well, that young boy was a Scout. We don't know his identity today, \nbut he certainly has changed our country. That single act of \nvolunteerism gave birth to what became the Boy Scouts of America, \nincorporated in 1910.\n  In 2013, there were more than 2.6 million members of the Boy Scouts \nof America. The program today serves not just boys, but also girls in \nour Scouting Venturing program.\n  In a time which has, in many ways, been highlighted by a decline of \nvolunteerism and criticism of perhaps our younger newest generations, I \nknow that our Nation's future is in good hands with those who live and \ndedicate themselves to the Scout Oath or the Scout Promise, which they \nstate at the beginning of every meeting and they end with. The words \nsince that time are:\n  ``On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country \nand to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep \nmyself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.''\n  Scouting prepares youth to be productive and successful members of \nthe workforce. The program introduces our youth to countless career \nopportunities, including the STEM fields.\n  As a Scout Master for almost three decades, I have seen these 11-\nyear-old youths, until the time they become 18 and go on into life, the \ncareer paths they were exposed to for the first time--whether it was \nmedicine, or teaching, or professional fire fighting, or across the \nboard--through the Scouting experience. What employer would not benefit \nfrom an employee with practical exposure from an organization that \nemphasizes values, service, and leadership?\n  Scouting fosters the values that make communities strong and \npreferred for families to set down roots and to contribute.\n  Scouting offers the world's finest leadership training for adults and \nyouth, leadership training that can be generalized to any occupations, \nincluding the United States House of Representatives.\n  As frequently said, ``Scouting is outing.'' Scouting is the youth \nleadership program that is grounded, not just in values, but in the \nbeauty and the nature of the outdoors, building appreciation and \nrespect for God's creation and for active lives, for being physically \nactive, that is so desperately needed today.\n  Now it is my hope that this wonderful organization continues to \ncontribute to the lives of young men and young ladies for generations \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H658-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H658-H659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRESCRIPTION DRUG EPIDEMIC IN WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, every morning, countless \nWest Virginians wake up fearing that they lost a loved one to drugs the \nnight before; and every morning, far too many West Virginians find this \nfear has come true.\n  The prescription drug abuse epidemic in our State is a tragedy that \nwe cannot afford to ignore. It ravages our communities, rips families \napart, stunts the development of our youth, and further ruptures our \nState's already ailing economy.\n  Overuse of prescription pain medication is one of the leading causes \nof opioid addiction. When a patient has more narcotic pain medication \nthan they need after a medical event, this excess medication can fall \ninto the wrong hands; and a narcotic pain medication in the wrong hands \noften leads to addiction. In fact, the National Institute on Drug Abuse \nhas found that 1 in 15 people who take nonmedical prescription pain \nrelievers will try heroin.\n  Last year, the number of fatal overdoses from prescription \npainkillers increased by 16 percent and, from heroin, 28 percent in the \nUnited States. In West Virginia, the story is even worse. According to \na recent study by the Trust for America's Health, the Mountain State \nhas the highest rate of overdose deaths in the entire United States.\n  This issue is above party politics. It is a plague that all Americans \nmust come together to solve. That is why, yesterday, I introduced H.R. \n4499, the Promoting Responsible Opioid Prescribing Act. This bipartisan \nbill strikes a harmful provision of ObamaCare that places unnecessary \npressure on doctors and hospitals to prescribe narcotic pain medicine.\n  This concern was brought to my attention while meeting with doctors \nand other healthcare professional workers in Charleston, West Virginia, \nwho are active in our State's medical society. In other words, this was \ntheir idea. I thank them for bringing this to my attention, and I \nencourage others to bring any ideas to help fight back against the \nopium epidemic to your local Congressman.\n  In 2006, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services developed a survey called the \nHospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, \npronounced ``H-caps,'' for short. HCAHPS is a standardized survey used \nto measure patient perspectives and satisfaction on the care they \nreceive in hospital settings.\n  At first, hospitals used this survey on an optional basis. However, \nwhen ObamaCare became law in 2010, it put in place ``pay for \nperformance'' provisions that use these survey results as a factor in \ncalculating Medicare reimbursement rates for physicians and hospitals \non quality measures.\n  This provision of ObamaCare was intended to save money and to force \nimprovements on hospital performance. However, it has led to unintended \nconsequences in the area of pain management.\n  The HCAHPS survey contains three questions on pain management:\n  One, during this hospital stay, did you need medicine for pain?\n  Two, during this hospital stay, how often was your pain well-\ncontrolled?\n  Three, during this hospital stay, how often did the hospital staff do \neverything they could to help you with your pain?\n  Because of the tie to reimbursement, hospitals and physicians are \npressured\n\n[[Page H659]]\n\nto perform well under HCAHPS, including the pain management questions. \nHowever, doctors, not the Federal Government, know how best to treat \npatients, and that includes the question of how best to use narcotic \npain medication.\n  The PROP Act would remove these pain management questions from \nconsideration when CMS is conducting reimbursement analysis. However, \nthe patient would still answer the survey questions so that hospitals \ncan monitor patient satisfaction.\n  By severing the relationship between HCAHPS questions on pain \nmanagement and reimbursement, doctors would no longer feel the undue \npressure to overprescribe opioid narcotics to people they believe may \nbe abusing it. This simple change will help reduce access to narcotic \npain medication for patients who do not need it, thereby reducing the \nrisk of addiction.\n  I would like to take the time to thank the bipartisan cosponsors of \nthis bill: Annie Kuster, Chairman Hal Rogers, Stephen Lynch, Frank \nGuinta, Tim Ryan, and Barbara Comstock.\n  Our bill has been endorsed by the American Medical Association and \nthe American Society of Addiction Medicine.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the House to consider cosponsoring my \nbill, H.R. 4499, the PROP Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H659-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISAPPEARANCE OF DAVID SNEDDON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Stewart) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, on August 14, 2004, David Sneddon, a \nstudent at Brigham Young University, disappeared without explanation \nwhile hiking in the Yunnan province of southwest China.\n  David is an outstanding young man who speaks fluent Korean and had \nspent the summer studying Mandarin in Beijing, with plans to return to \nthe U.S. in August to finish his degree in Chinese. He had already paid \na housing deposit and registered to take the Law School Admission Test.\n  The U.S. State Department and the Chinese Government eventually \nconcluded that David fell into a gorge while hiking, but David's family \nconducted their own exhaustive investigation, with David's father and \ntwo older brothers flying to China shortly after his disappearance to \nretrace his steps.\n  In the course of talking with numerous eyewitnesses, David's family \ndiscovered facts which contradict the official explanation and which, I \nbelieve, are compelling evidence of another possibility, which I will \nget to in just a moment.\n  My staff and I met David's family and heard his story soon after I \nwas elected 3 years ago. The Sneddons are remarkable people of great \nfaith who have continued to pursue an explanation for David's \ndisappearance for the past 11 years.\n  The resolution I am introducing today regarding David's disappearance \nis a result of the hard work and diligence of David's parents, \nsiblings, and cousins. They deserve answers. They deserve to have their \ngovernment do everything possible to determine what happened to David.\n  I should also add that David's story is personal to me. He was a \nclose friend of my oldest son, Sean. In fact, following David's 2-year \nmissionary service in South Korea, David taught my son Sean the Korean \nlanguage as he was preparing to begin his own missionary service in \nSouth Korea. Though I have not met David, I am grateful for the impact \nhe had on Sean's life.\n  Over the past 3 years, I have had various opportunities to meet with \nState Department personnel to discuss David's disappearance. They are \ngood people, and I commend them for their help, particularly in the \nimmediate aftermath of his disappearance when they repeatedly pressured \nthe Chinese Government to pursue the various leads identified by \nDavid's family.\n  However, I am concerned that bureaucratic inertia has made the State \nDepartment complacent in this case. I am concerned the State Department \nleadership has not done all they can do to pursue all of the possible \nexplanations for his disappearance.\n  One of the unexplored possibilities is that David was abducted by \nagents of the North Korean regime, something which a number of \nrespected experts on North Korea have advanced in recent years. While \nthis may sound like an outlandish theory to those unfamiliar with North \nKorea's history, it is becoming very plausible when you understand the \nregime's long history of abducting foreign citizens to use in training \ntheir own foreign agents.\n  For many years, North Korea systematically kidnapped Japanese \ncitizens and used captives to train their intelligence operatives in \nJapanese language and culture. The regime finally admitted to the \nabductions in 2002 and returned five of the Japanese citizens.\n  There are numerous other facts which, when combined, make North \nKorea's involvement conceivable.\n  North Korean agents are known to operate in Yunnan Province, a common \narea for those escaping North Korea into Southeast Asia.\n  David disappeared during a long time of heightened tensions between \nthe U.S. and North Korea, just weeks after this House passed the North \nKorean Human Rights Act.\n  And David disappeared 1 month after North Korea released Charles \nJenkins, an American deserter from the Korean war being held and used \nprecisely as the abducted Japanese citizens: as a language teacher for \nNorth Korean military cadets and spies. Jenkins was the last of the \nknown Americans being held for this purpose, and it is possible the \nregime needed a replacement for him.\n  Just this past Sunday, North Korea's rocket launch, in defiance of \nsanctions and against explicit counsel of the international community, \nreminded us that North Korea doesn't operate on the same norms that \nguide diplomacy for most of the rest of the world. They are a criminal \nenterprise more than a government, and they can do nothing for their \nown people, let alone for other nations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't raise the possibility regarding David Sneddon's \ndisappearance lightly, and I didn't sponsor this resolution lightly. I \nrecognize the words we speak on foreign policy have consequences far \nbeyond this room. But David is the only American to disappear in China \nwithout explanation since the normalization of relations during the \nNixon administration.\n  This is not a fact to be taken lightly. My resolution lays out the \nfacts of his disappearance and asks three essential actions by the \nState Department and intelligence community:\n  First, that they continue to investigate and consider all possible \nexplanations for David's disappearance, including potential abduction \nby North Korea;\n  Second, that they coordinate their efforts with the Governments of \nJapan, South Korea, and particularly China, the country known to have \nat least some influence over North Korea;\n  And finally, that they keep the Congress and the Sneddon family \ninformed of these efforts.\n  I would like to thank Senator Lee for sponsoring the companion bill \nin the Senate, and the rest of the Utah delegation for joining me as \ncosponsors.

Our border is not secure. Obama's amnesty is \ndevastating for Texas, particularly its border cities, but the problems \nfar exceed our border. This affects the whole country. It undermines \nthe safety of all Americans and hurts law-abiding taxpayers.\n  My most sacred duty is to protect our homeland and every citizen in \nit. I spent 29 years as a fighter pilot and 7 as a POW doing just that. \nRest assured, I will continue to fight to keep America safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H660-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GUN VIOLENCE MYTHS\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE.

In the coming days, I will be doing just that on \nmy Web site and through social media to help build support for \ncommonsense, responsible gun safety legislation.\n  After all, Mr. Speaker, facts should guide us in doing our work and \ndoing all that we can to reduce gun violence in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H660-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING PASTOR MICHAEL MOORE\n\n  (Mr. DENHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DENHAM.

The church grew to encompass \nPastor Mike's and Grace's vision of a casual atmosphere, practical and \nrelevant teachings, with contemporary worship.\n  Pastor Mike led the congregation in working with local churches to \nestablish the Hope Family Shelter and provide housing to homeless \nfamilies. The church also established a mobile medical clinic to \nprovide free medical service for those in need and has sent teams to \nrespond to global disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, the tsunami in \nAsia, and the Oklahoma tornadoes. The church has also sent missionaries \nto many corners of the globe.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Pastor Michael Moore and \nhis unwavering leadership in our community and many accomplishments \naround the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H660-7", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS.

Mr. Speaker, last week I was grateful \nto chair the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities hearing \nto receive outside views on biodefense for the Department of Defense \nand review the bipartisan report of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on \nBiodefense.\n  Chaired by former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Governor and \nSecretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge, the panel evaluated the \nstatus of prevention, deterrence, preparedness, detection, response, \nattribution, recovery, and mitigation of our Nation's biodefense.\n  The report was clear. Our Nation faces a complex threat from both \nbiological weapons and naturally occurring diseases. For example, the \nrecent response to the Ebola outbreak demonstrates the importance of \nthe Department of Defense's biodefense contributions to broader \ngovernment and global efforts.\n  I am grateful that the former Attorney General Ken Wainstein and Dr. \nGerald Parker, both members of the panel, were there testifying before \nthe subcommittee.

We have taken \na lot of hits, a lot of poverty, high unemployment, but we have always \nbeen able to get back up again as a community because there are strong \npeople in Flint, Michigan.\n  What has happened now in Flint is because of careless actions by \nState officials who put dollars and cents ahead of the health of \npeople, ahead of the health of 9,000 children.\n  We can get back up again in Flint, but we need a State response far \nmore robust than what has been recommended by Michigan's Governor and \nwe need help from the Federal Government. These people are American \ncitizens.\n  If the State won't act to make it right for the people of Flint, we \nneed our Federal Government to do everything in its power to help these \npeople and help Flint get back up again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H661-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HAMILTON CITY, CALIFORNIA, LEVEE PROTECTION\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA.

Currently fees are collected manually, which \nincreases congestion and deters Canadians from traveling to western New \nYork.\n  I called for the implementation of this policy last year and am happy \nto see the Department of Homeland Security moved so quickly on it. By \nautomating fee collection, hiring more Customs and Border Protection \nofficers, this budget will benefit the western New York economy that is \ndependent on commerce via the Peace Bridge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H661-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGENITAL HEART FUTURES REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

CHD is the most common birth defect and \nthe number one cause of birth defect-related deaths.\n  A few decades ago babies born with CHD were not living into \nadulthood. Now, due to continued investment and research and a series \nof medical breakthroughs, 90 percent of babies born with CHD are living \ninto adulthood. Let's makes it 100 percent.\n  There is still work to be done, and we must ensure these efforts to \nimprove the lives of those with CHD continue. This is why I introduced \nthe Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act, to spend CHD \nresearch, raise awareness of the importance of specialized care, and \nensure important research continues.\n  We must advance this legislation for the millions of Americans who \nneed our help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H661-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the success \nof the Affordable Care Act.\n  The numbers are in and, once again, millions of Americans signed up \nfor quality affordable health coverage. More than 12.7 million \nAmericans selected plans through the health insurance marketplaces--4 \nmillion, or 42 percent, of whom were new customers this year.\n  People want coverage. And, thanks to the ACA, millions can now have \nthe security of knowing they won't go bankrupt if they get sick or have \nan accident, can't be denied coverage because of a preexisting \ncondition, and have access to preventative and primary care services at \nlittle to no out-of-pocket cost.\n  In the 29th District that I am proud to represent, 55,000 residents \nfall into the expansion gap and have no insurance because States \nhaven't expanded Medicaid. It is time for Texas and other States to do \nthe right thing and recognize that health care is essential for some of \nour poorest families by expanding Medicaid.\n  The Affordable Care Act is here to stay. I hope Congress will move \npast repeal attempts and start talking about how we can make the \nAffordable Care Act work even better for the American people.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today yet again in need of bringing \nthe world's attention to the plight of Zhu Yufu.\n  Four years ago today, this democracy advocate was unjustly sentenced \nby the Chinese Government to 7 years behind bars, following previous \nimprisonments. His tireless advocacy for democratic rights, freedom of \nspeech, and the rule of law is worthy of praise. Yet the Chinese \nGovernment has harassed and jailed him numerous times on faulty \ncharges.\n  Yufu is in poor health. He is not able to stand without support. He \nhas coronary heart disease and a coronary artery tumor, in addition to \nother ailments. Yet Chinese authorities refuse to provide him with \nmedical care or medication. Further, they have forced him to do hard \nlabor and have caused the job losses of his family members.\n  This Saturday, Zhu Yufu turns 63 years old. The least the Chinese \nGovernment can do is provide him with proper medical treatment, improve \nhis living conditions, and leave his family alone. If China is serious \nabout demonstrating any legitimate leadership, it should release him \nand the hundreds of others like him immediately.\n\n[[Page H662]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H662-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                        MURDERED FOR THEIR FAITH\n\n  (Mr. ELLISON asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ELLISON.

I wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H662-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Denham) laid before the House the \nfollowing communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2016.\n     Hon.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wish we weren't here today. I wish this bill was not \nnecessary, but it is. Our hearts go out to the folks of Flint, \nMichigan. The system let them down at every level. That is, frankly, \nunacceptable.\n  All folks want is the peace of mind that their government is looking \nout for their best interest and that their water is safe. This bill is \nthe first step.\n  Imagine if you went to draw a cup of cold water from your kitchen \nfaucet and suddenly had to think about whether it is safe to drink or \nnot. Now put yourself into the shoes of a parent whose son or daughter \nhas already taken a drink from that faucet. Or, you made coffee or \ninfant formula. What health risk has your child already been exposed \nto? What do we do now? How can we expect a family to live life day-to-\nday without safe drinking water? And, after all those initial concerns, \nyou begin asking yourself: How is this situation possible in the 21st \ncentury in the United States of America?\n  We have been seeking answers to that question from EPA, from the \nState of Michigan, and from others. In the meantime, we know that part \nof the answer--certainly, not the whole story--is that there was a \nterrible breakdown in communication at every level of government.\n  It is sickening and it breaks your heart that thousands of kids \nindeed could be at risk, being poisoned from faucets that they thought \nwere safe.\n  Government officials knew there was serious cause for concern and \nfailed to inform the people of Flint. Many of those officials did not \neven seem to be effectively communicating and sharing data among \nthemselves.\n  The EPA regional office was not telling headquarters about \neverything, the State was not telling EPA everything, and we don't know \nyet what the city of Flint was telling the State or EPA. That has got \nto be fixed--and it has got to be fixed now.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act Improved Compliance Awareness Act ensures \nthat the public learns of excessive lead levels in their drinking water \nby setting forth how and when States, EPA, and public water utilities \ncommunicate their findings.\n  The bill also strengthens public notification rules when lead levels \nare exceeded. Individual consumers will be told when their own house \ntests positive for lead problems. And if the community or States fail \nto notify the public, EPA will step in and do so. They are required to \ndo that.\n  The bill also requires EPA to create a strategic plan for handling \nand improving information flow among water utilities, the States, EPA, \nand affected drinking water consumers before there is an enforceable \nlead exceedance in drinking water. Let me repeat that: before lead \nlevels get too high.\n  Finally, this bipartisan bill requires consumer notification when \nwater being transported in a lead pipe is so corrosive that, in fact, \nit could leach into public drinking water.\n  I want to thank all Members of the House for their support, \nespecially my Michigan colleagues, every one of which, from both \nparties, signed as an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  I want to particularly thank Mr. Kildee, a friend, who led this \neffort.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, \nparticularly Frank Pallone, John Shimkus, and Paul Tonko, for their \nadvice, collaboration, and support.\n  I also want to thank two McCarthys, Kevin McCarthy, for scheduling \nthis at almost a moment's notice, and my lead counsel on this \nlegislation, Dave McCarthy, who helped write and improve the bill as it \nwas originally introduced.\n  What is said on this floor today will not do anything to ease the \nmind of a\n\n[[Page H664]]\n\nparent in Flint. The entire situation breaks your heart, but we have a \nresponsibility, working together as Republicans and Democrats, to fix \nthe problem. This bill is an important step.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 4470, the Safe Drinking Water Act \nImproved Compliance Awareness Act, introduced last week by our \ncolleague Representative Kildee, with the support of other members of \nthe Michigan delegation.\n  This bill would strengthen requirements to have the EPA notify the \npublic when concentrations of lead exceed Federal standards. That is \nnotifying the public.\n  While I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to support \nit, far more than this is needed to address the many failings that led \nto the tragic circumstances that are still being experienced by the \nresidents of Flint, Michigan, a situation that has drawn the Nation's \nattention and drawn compassion for children and their families. This \nshould never have occurred in any city in our Nation.\n  As with any such tragic failure, there is an attempt to assess blame. \nWell, accountability is important. Those who failed in their \nresponsibility should be held accountable.\n  But no one here has yet taken responsibility for our part, Congress' \npart, in this event. Collectively, this Congress as well as many \nprevious Congresses have failed to maintain Federal support for the \nmaintenance and improvements of our water infrastructure.\n  We have been underfunding these systems for decades. The poor \ncondition of the water treatment and distribution system in Flint set \nthe stage for this tragedy.\n  We are doing this in an attempt to save money. Well, in fact, we are \nwasting many millions of dollars more by allowing essential \ninfrastructure to deteriorate to the extent where a constant stream of \nemergency responses and repairs are required to keep these systems \nworking.\n  Finally, we need to do something for the people of Flint. The State \nof Michigan and President Obama's administration have both begun to \nmobilize resources to deal with the immediate need for safe drinking \nwater, and they are working to eliminate lead from the water \ndistribution system. But we still don't know if essential corrosion \ncontrol can be reestablished.\n  And bottled water does not solve Flint's problems. The residents of \nFlint need a fully functioning public water system that delivers safe, \nclean water to their homes, to their schools, and to their businesses. \nWe need to work with the State of Michigan to make that happen.\n  We need to care for the people who were exposed to lead, especially \nour children, who are most vulnerable to lead exposure. They need \ntreatment and sustained assistance to deal with the health problems \nthey may experience as a result of this manmade disaster.\n  The conditions that enabled this crisis to happen are not unique to \nFlint. And while this bill is a first step to help communities that may \nface these problems in the future, it cannot be our last step. We must \nembrace our responsibility to support Federal investment in drinking \nwater systems.\n  The public health and future prosperity of the people of Flint and \nthousands of other communities across our great Nation are continuing \nto suffer from the concerns and are counting on our progressive \nactions. I look forward to continuing this discussion.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg), a cosponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking my friends, Dan \nKildee and Chairman Upton, for their work on this bipartisan \nlegislation and ensuring a swift congressional response to the ongoing \nwater crisis in Flint, Michigan.\n  What have we learned, and what will we do both now and into the \nfuture, Mr. Speaker, is the question.\n  What happened in Flint is not a natural disaster. It is a human \ndisaster and a failure of government at every level.\n  In my questioning at last week's Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee hearing, it became very clear that individuals with the EPA \nknew about the high lead levels in the drinking water for months but \nfailed to communicate this information to the people of Flint, even \nunder repeated Freedom of Information Act requests.\n  The bill we are considering today takes important steps to strengthen \nFederal requirements on the EPA to notify the public when \nconcentrations of lead in drinking water are above Federal \nrequirements.\n  I am glad the entire Michigan delegation is backing this bill; and I \nam committed to continuing to work together to get answers and help the \nfamilies in Flint who need clean water and, for that matter, Mr. \nSpeaker, learning from this for the families in the entire United \nStates to make sure that this doesn't happen to them as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, in America, in the 21st century, children should not \nhave to worry about safe and clean drinking water. The Flint water \ncrisis never should have happened, and we must take action to ensure it \nnever happens again.\n  Making things right must be a cooperative effort at every level, and \nthis bill takes important steps to ensure proper coordination going \nforward.\n  I offer all of my support, all of my assistance, all of my help and \nmy votes to make sure this happens.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Kildee), who has carried the concern and the emotion of \nthis situation as the Representative in the House of Flint, Michigan. \nHis energetic efforts, his determination, his obvious passion for \ngetting this done, getting some relief, the relief essential for Flint \ndone, is tremendously moving.\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank Mr. Tonko for his comments and his support and \nleadership on this issue.\n  And I would like him to please extend my thanks to Ranking Member \nPallone for his effort and his support. I know he is dealing with a \ndifficult time himself right now, and we extend our best wishes to him.\n  I want to thank all of my Michigan colleagues for joining as original \ncosponsors of this legislation; and I particularly thank Chairman Upton \nfor his help, his guidance, his assistance and, really, collaboration \non getting a piece of legislation put together that we think is very \nhelpful in preventing another situation such as what has occurred in my \nhometown from ever happening again in the United States.\n  I again thank Mr. Upton for his assistance and leadership on this.\n  Flint is my home. The people I represent are the people I grew up \nwith in Flint, Michigan. It is a great community. It has been through \nsome struggles, for sure, in the last few decades, but we have never \ndealt with anything quite like this, something so fundamental as safe \ndrinking water that we take for granted.\n  You turn on the faucet, as Mr. Upton said, you expect the water that \ncomes out of that faucet to be safe for yourself, for your children, to \nmake formula, to cook food, to drink. And because of a series of \ndecisions that really are almost incomprehensible in their impact, \npeople in Flint, Michigan, can't drink their water; 100,000 people \ncan't drink the water.\n  The thing that makes me most upset--sad, yes, but also angry--is that \nthis crisis, this situation, which will last for decades in its impact, \nwas completely avoidable.\n  Unlike a lot of other struggles that my hometown has faced as a \nresult of big changes in the economy--development patterns, et cetera--\nthis was a series of decisions that we can easily identify that could \neasily have been prevented with just more thought and more care and, in \nthis case, a stronger set of requirements for disclosure when lead \nlevels are elevated in a drinking water system.\n  So this legislation is one step. It is not the total solution. We \nreally have to deal--and I hope my colleagues will also join us--with \nputting together a response to the crisis being felt by the people in \nFlint right now.\n  This bill, unfortunately, is too late to help them, but it can help \nthe next Flint, perhaps. This would require the EPA to provide notice \nif the State agency responsible for enforcement of the clean drinking \nwater laws does not act to provide notice to the citizens affected and \nto the water system.\n\n[[Page H665]]\n\n  Let me just be clear on that. The State of Michigan, in the case of \nthe Flint situation, has primacy in terms of enforcement of these laws. \nIt is their obligation to ensure that the clean drinking water laws are \nenforced, to collect data, to do sampling and testing, and to provide \nremediation, to provide intervention, if, in fact, it is not the case.\n  So, yes, there has been a failure of government, but I think we have \nto take care not to attempt to create some sort of false sense of \nequivalency of responsibility.\n  The city of Flint, for example, which is the most local level of \ngovernment and where the water system is operated, was under the \ncontrol of an emergency manager, a State official appointed to overtake \noperation of the city of Flint. So to the extent that the city was \nresponsible, the city was the State in this regard.\n  In terms of the Federal role, there was apparent confusion or \ndisagreement as to whether the EPA had authority, absent State \nnotification to the public of the data that they had, whether the EPA \nhad authority to go public, to make it clear that there was a problem. \nThis legislation addresses that.\n  This legislation strengthens the hand of those who work at the EPA \nand actually requires them--not simply allows, but requires them--to \nprovide notice to the public and to a water system operator in the \nevent that the State fails to do so. Had that happened, it would not \nhave prevented the bad decisions that led to this crisis, but it would \nhave prevented them from going on for months and months and months with \nno action to protect the people in Flint.\n  This is important legislation. We need more. We need help for the \npeople of Flint. But this is a step in the right direction in \npreventing what happened in Flint from happening to another community.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, might I inquire as to how much time I have \nremaining on my side.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) has \n13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) has \n11\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Bishop), again, an original cosponsor of the bill.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I would first like to begin by \nthanking the gentleman from Flint, Michigan (Mr. Kildee) for his \nleadership in this matter and for raising our attention to this.\n  Also, I would like to thank Chairman Upton for his leadership for the \nMichigan delegation in bringing us together and putting aside any \npartisan differences to address a need of our great State and, also, \nfor the children and families across our country.\n  I have spent my entire life in the State of Michigan. I was born \nthere and raised there. Many generations before me were the same, born \nand raised in Michigan. My current family, my wife and my three kids, \nalso live in Michigan and will also, I am sure, see to it that their \nchildren live there as well.\n  When I learned what happened in Flint, I was absolutely heartbroken. \nFrankly, it frightens me to think that a failure of this magnitude \ncould happen in the 21st century and in our State.\n  Can you imagine not being able to drink the water from your own tap? \nWhat if you weren't able to bathe or take a shower because of fear of \nwhat might be in the water? The anger and the frustration is palpable, \nand it should be.\n  My district borders on Congressman Kildee's, and I can tell you \nfirsthand the crisis not only affects and impacts the community of \nFlint, but the entire Great Lakes State.\n  For weeks I have seen local high schools, veterans groups, and \nconcerned citizens--you name it--people from all over Michigan, rising \nup to address the crisis and to help the residents, the families, and \nchildren of Flint.\n  When it comes to local, State, and Federal leadership, we must do \neverything possible to help as well. Every single one of us here today \nhas a duty to ensure families and children are safe and have access to \nthe essentials, the most basic of which is clean drinking water from \nhousehold faucets.\n  Sure, we can point fingers and play the blame game. But when it comes \ndown to fixing it, we must do so fast. We need more action than words. \nWe need solutions.\n  What Chairman Upton and Congressman Kildee have proposed is a first-\nstep solution to ensure this won't happen again.\n  First and foremost, this legislation makes sure the EPA will step in \nand notify the public when they know concentrations of lead in drinking \nwater are above Federal requirements. It also streamlines communication \nbetween utilities, the States, the EPA, and the affected customers.\n  The entire delegation of the State of Michigan and Congress agree \nthat this is a crisis. But to be clear, this is not a Democratic or \nRepublican issue. I would say shame on anyone who attempts to \ncapitalize on this issue or use the families of Flint in this crisis to \nfurther their own personal agenda. This is about common sense and \ndelivering solutions to these children and families.\n  I ask my colleagues on behalf of both sides of the aisle to join \nMichigan and help us take action.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Lawrence). She is another member of the Michigan \ndelegation.\n  Representative Brenda Lawrence has shown great leadership in her role \non the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and, again, has been a \npassionate voice to address the families of Flint.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the crisis in Flint \ndemands action. I ran for Congress after serving as a mayor because I \nfelt strongly that our government has a responsibility.\n  When you ask for a vote, you are asking for the trust in our \ngovernment. We betrayed the trust of our citizens when we did not \nprovide a human need, and that is clean water.\n  I stand here today encouraged. I ran on the premise that we need to \nwork together as a government. I can tell you that this crisis in Flint \nis not a political issue. It is a moral issue. It is why each of us in \nCongress sit here today on the vote of the people's trust, and that is \nto take care of this great country.\n  It is a moral issue, and it calls for all of us in Congress to act. \nToday I am standing here with a sense of hope being fulfilled that we \nhave eliminated the aisle, and we are standing here together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4470, the Safe Drinking \nWater Act Improved Compliance Awareness Act. This bill will ensure that \nEPA notifies communities of lead contamination if State or local \nagencies fail to do so. That clearly is what happened in Flint.\n  Local water authorities will have to provide notification to the \npublic when lead contamination is a result of lead from pipes and other \ninfrastructure leaching into the water supply. This notice will have to \nbe provided to affected residents, regardless of whether any drinking \nwater standards were violated.\n  If the operator does not notify the public--in this case, it was \nMichigan Environmental Quality--if they do not notify the public, then \nthe EPA must do so. This is precisely what happened in Flint.\n  State officials repeatedly ignored the pleas of the residents and \nthose we are calling civic heroes from outside and experts about the \nlead levels.\n  Passing this bill today will ensure that the situation in Flint--and \nI am joining with my Republican colleagues and Democratic--never \nhappens again in our United States. The decision to share that type of \ncritical information should not be based on political judgment.\n  H.R. 4470 will ensure that residents acquire the information they \nneed about their drinking water systems and give EPA the ability and \nresponsibility to step in and notify residents if a State or water \nsystem fails to act.\n  H.R. 4470 is just the first step, as we heard, in addressing our \ncountry's drinking water infrastructure issue. I hope that we can \ncontinue to work together in a bipartisan manner to ensure that Flint \nnever happens again.\n  This is the first step in fixing our infrastructure in America \nbecause other\n\n[[Page H666]]\n\nMembers of Congress have talked about lead water crises in their \ncommunities. So this is a first step.\n  For me, this is a fulfilling day to stand here and support my \ncolleagues, regardless of our political affiliation, and take care of \nthe people of America.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Moolenaar). Again, he is a cosponsor of Mr. Kildee's \nbill.\n  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I also want to join my Michigan \ncolleagues as a cosponsor of this legislation and thank Representative \nKildee and Chairman Upton for bringing this legislation forward.\n  Our hearts go out to the people of Flint who are enduring so much and \npersevering during this time. It is heartwarming to see the way people \nacross the country have come together in support of the people of \nFlint.\n  The sad thing is that this situation could have been prevented and \nshould have been prevented. The legislation we are discussing today \nhere in the House of Representatives is because of failures in local, \nState, and Federal Government.\n  The fact is that the officials at the EPA knew last April--10 months \nago--that the Flint Utilities Department was not using corrosion \ncontrols, putting water safety at risk.\n  Instead of alerting the public, the EPA stayed silent. When an EPA \nemployee tried to speak out, he was silenced. The EPA deferred to a \nState agency, the MDEQ, which also failed to tell the public.\n  Last month the EPA administrator sent a memo creating a formal policy \non the importance of assessing and responding to critical public health \nissues. That the administrator had to remind employees of the \nimportance of public health speaks to the misplaced priority of the EPA \nand its officials.\n  So today we have to pass a law requiring the Agency to notify the \npublic when water quality is unsafe and constitutes a public health \nthreat. This legislation is a reminder to the EPA that it needs to \nfocus on its core responsibility with safe drinking water, using its \nauthority appropriately, rather than overreaching outside of its \njurisdiction.\n  This is an example of one community that has been adversely affected. \nFlint is not alone in this challenge, and this has ramifications all \nacross our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I am waiting for another individual to offer \ntestimony.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Trott), another cosponsor of the legislation.\n  Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Chairman Upton and \nRepresentative Kildee for their important, bipartisan work on this \nissue.\n  I rise today in support of the Safe Drinking Water Act Improved \nCompliance Awareness Act. This bill is a step in the right direction to \npreserve and protect the health of our citizens.\n  The legislation requires the EPA administrator to work with States \nand local water authorities to develop a strategic plan for addressing \nlead contaminants in drinking water. This important legislation will \nensure that the complete failure to notify people of a health risk, \nwhich occurred in Flint, does not happen again.\n  This is an issue that many communities across our country will have \nto deal with as our water system infrastructure ages. We must ensure \nthat the public is aware, our citizens are informed, and that our water \nauthorities and agencies identify and take steps to prevent this level \nof failure from happening again.\n  Mr. Speaker, on the Federal level, it is unacceptable that the EPA, \nan agency with a budget of over $8 billion, did not escalate its \nconcerns over the presence of lead contaminants.\n  This is an agency that is literally paid to protect the public health \nand environment, and it failed. This failure may not happen again. All \nAmericans should feel safe drinking water from their kitchen sink.\n  This legislation is a commonsense solution. I urge its immediate \npassage.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this act. I thank the \nchairman for his hard work and the committee's hard work on this bill.\n  I will be exceedingly brief because certainly, as has been outlined \nby any number of different speakers, this is about a failure of \ngovernment at a multitude of different levels, at the State, local, and \nFederal levels, a real failure and real consequences to the people of \nFlint.\n  It is also, I think, a reminder to all of us of the significance of \nbracket creep in government; wherein, if everybody is involved, nobody \nis involved; if everybody is accountable, nobody is accountable.\n  That is true of a government at a government level. It is true of a \nregulatory body. The importance of clearly defined missions I think is \npart of what your strategic plan really gets at in this act, and I \nadmire your work on that.\n  I also want to just reference that this is also a reminder, a wake-up \ncall, if you will, on the importance of watching out for unsustainable \npolitical promises.\n  I say that because, if you look at the general budget and the general \nfund within Flint, basically one-third of their revenue goes to pay for \nretiree benefits.\n  That number by the year 2020 is going to rise to essentially 40 \npercent, 40 percent. I bring that up because it is indeed a wake-up \ncall to the unsustainability of our Federal promises as you look at the \nnumbers going forward at the Federal level.\n  So my heart goes out to the people of Flint. I think that this is an \nimportant measure going forward, but it is also an important reminder \nto every one of us here at the Federal level to watch out for the \nunsustainable promises here in Washington.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, might I inquire how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder). The gentleman from Michigan has \n5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from New York has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. I appreciate \nall the comments and the support, especially the sympathy and, really, \nunity with the people of my hometown of Flint.\n  I do want to ensure, though, that we are properly characterizing the \nlegislation, its reasoning, and its impact.\n  The legislation would actually not just require EPA to provide \nnotice, but would require the local jurisdiction, the State agency, to \nprovide them with the opportunity to do what they should do anyway, \nthat is, to provide notice. Absent their willingness to do so, the EPA \nwould then be required.\n  It is an important distinction because, in this case, the State of \nMichigan has primacy in enforcement of these rules.\n  The EPA in the case of Flint did take action when they learned of the \nelevated lead levels. The action was to repeatedly reach out to the \nMichigan Department of Environmental Quality and insist that they \nenforce the lead and copper rule.\n  Actually, they went so far as to insist that they initiate corrosion \ncontrol, which is the mechanism by which lead leaching would have been \nprevented.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Not only did the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality fail to \nact, they actually told the EPA almost a year ago that they actually \nhad initiated corrosion control when they had not.\n  I think it would be a mistake to create some sort of equivalency \nbetween the role of the EPA and the role of the State of Michigan in \nthis. It was the State of Michigan that had prime responsibility that \nfailed.\n  The EPA, while I would have preferred that they had shouted from the \nmountaintop that they were having this problem getting the lead agency \nto enforce the rule, there was at least confusion as to whether or not \nthey had the authority to do so. Even today, the State of Michigan \ncontinues to push back on the EPA's attempts to\n\n[[Page H667]]\n\ntest water to insist on enforcement. It is an important distinction to \nmake.\n  Regarding my friend Mr. Sanford's comments, I appreciate his \nreflection on the financial situation within the city of Flint. While \nthat is a set of questions that clearly needs attention, the truth of \nthe matter is, had the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality \ninsisted on the use of corrosion control in the Flint water system, as \nthe law would require, the cost would have been $140 a day. All of this \ncould have been prevented by the State simply requiring that $140 a day \nbe spent.\n  This legislation is important in preventing this from happening again \nso that an agency of a State that refuses to enforce the law at least \ncan't do so in the dark; and if the State won't give public notice, it \nwould require the EPA to do so. This is an important step. We have \ncrafted this legislation to make sure that each level of government is \ntransparent when it comes to these issues.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, let me again offer my appreciation to Chairman Upton and \nour ranking member, Representative Pallone, for their leadership on \nthis and for working in a spirit of bipartisanship to bring this \nmeasure to the floor and in working with the Michigan delegation and, \nin particular, Representative Kildee, who has been directly impacted on \nbehalf of Flint, Michigan, which he represents.\n  I would also make certain that we remember that under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, as Representative Kildee indicated, States have \nprimacy, an important issue for Members who frequently talked about \nempowering our State and local governments. It is a State's \nresponsibility when they accept that role of primacy to run these \nsystems and comply with Federal standards.\n  Before we point fingers at the EPA, let's remember that Congress has \ncut its budget year after year. We want them to do more with less. We \nhave passed the point of achieving efficiency, we have cut valuable \nstaffing, and we have cut valuable programs.\n  We can point to failures by all levels of government in this \nsituation, but the public doesn't want to hear us blame anyone. They \nwant and deserve real solutions and financial assistance to address the \ncrisis at hand.\n  We need to help the people of Flint and better protect our public \nhealth going forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Tonko said this bill is not about a blame game. We are trying to \nfix a problem so it doesn't happen again anyplace.\n  I just might note that the House was out 2 weeks. We had Martin \nLuther King week, then we had the snowstorm, and we couldn't come back.\n  Our committee held a number of briefings. I expanded it to include \ncertainly all of the members--Republican and Democrat--on the Energy \nand Commerce Committee, but I also extended that out to all of the \nmembers of the Michigan delegation, both our Senators, as well as the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee majority and minority staff.\n  Mr. Kildee mentioned about Mr. Pallone not being here. His father \ndied earlier this week, so he is where he should be. But he cares \ndeeply about this legislation as well.\n  I know when I sat down with my friend Mr. Kildee last week to talk \nabout the intent of this legislation and where he was, we were able to, \nI think, make some important, constructive changes that strengthen the \nbill. It was a no-brainer for us to get every Member on both sides of \nthe aisle from Michigan to be an original cosponsor, and I congratulate \nhim for that initiative.\n  But I must say, too, this is a first step. I know in the future our \ncommittee is going to be looking at how we can better expand \nflexibility, I think, of States as it relates to their safe drinking \nwater fund, and the State revolving fund as well. We are looking to \nhear from the States what we might be able to do on the Federal \nresponse. Again, the primacy is at the State and local level, \nparticularly when a State, like we have seen here, actually has been \ngiven an emergency declaration, as our Governor sought.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I commend \nMr. Kildee.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Safe Drinking \nWater Act Improved Compliance Awareness Act and am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this bill, which will strengthen public notification \nrequirements in the event of lead contamination.\n  The situation in Flint is unacceptable--it is a violation of the \nright to clean water and a breakdown of the basic responsibility of \ngovernment to its citizens. And it was completely preventable--we know \nthe damaging impacts of lead and we know how to protect people from \nlead poisoning. We need an aggressive response, both for the people in \nFlint and for every community that faces lead exposure.\n  Today's bill is just a first step to address this problem by ensuring \nthat when contamination occurs, communities will be informed of what is \nhappening and what will be done to fix it. We should follow this action \nwith support for the Flint community and robust funding for lead \npoisoning prevention and clean water programs. I look forward to our \ncontinued work to protect children and communities from the dangers of \nlead.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Safe Drinking \nWater Act Improved Compliance Awareness Act, as amended. This bill will \nallow more transparency and increase education and outreach efforts to \ncommunities about their drinking water systems.\n  Communities are entitled to information about their drinking water, \nand we should make every effort to ensure that Americans receive clear, \nconcise and timely information about the safety of that water. This \nbill addresses a concern raised during the Flint water crisis about the \nsignificant delay in informing Flint residents about the dangerous \nlevels of lead in their water. I greatly appreciate the work of Mr. \nKildee and the Michigan Delegation in coming together and quickly \npufting forward this legislation. It is a good place to begin our \nefforts to help Flint and I support its passage.\n  Yet, this is a small, first step and does not address the imminent \nand long-term problems facing our nation's water systems. I know my \nfriend from Michigan, Mr. Kildee, agrees with me on this and has put \nforward legislation focusing on immediate and long-term investments for \nFlint to address both its health and infrastructure needs. We must do \nmore for Flint and more to ensure that our nation as a whole receives \nsafe, clean drinking water at the tap.\n  As I have stated time and again, our drinking water systems are \ndeteriorating. Transparency is important, but we need to follow this \neffort with a reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act that \nincreases the investment in our drinking water systems.\n  We must invest in our drinking water infrastructure to repair, \nmaintain, and replace aging pipes. We also must equip communities with \nthe resources to ensure the delivery of safe drinking water, safeguard \nsystems from vulnerabilities such as climate change, and encourage good \nfinancial and environmental management of water systems. There is no \ndoubt that this will be a large task, but we cannot shy away from it. \nThe longer we delay, the more costly the investment.\n  This should be a wakeup call that we cannot continue to stand by \nwatching as Flint--and far too many other American communities--are \nexposed to unsafe drinking water. We must take action now.\n  Again, I commend Mr. Kildee and the co-sponsors for their efforts on \nthis legislation. I thank the Gentleman and his staff for working with \nme and my staff to ensure this bill will truly increase transparency \nfor communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and look forward to \nadditional opportunities to work in a bipartisan fashion in the \nremaining months of this Congress on the pressing issue of safe, \nreliable drinking water for all Americans.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4470, the \nSafe Drinking Water Act Improved Compliance Awareness Act. This bill is \na good first step to helping ensure the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA) never again allows an intransigent state government endanger the \npublic welfare.\n  Let there be no mistake. The blame for what happened in Flint lies \ndirectly at the feet of Governor Snyder who ignored Flint's democratic \nrights, his appointed Emergency Managers who wanted to save a buck, and \nthe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) that was too \ntimid to protect the public from haphazard changes to the Flint water \nsystem.\n  But the EPA needs to take some blame for not dismissing out of hands \nthe efforts of the Governor, his Emergency Managers, and MDEQ to delay \naddressing the crisis in Flint.\n\n[[Page H668]]\n\nThe EPA let the endless echo of ``EPA overreach'' prevent them from \ndoing their job--which is telling anti-regulatory special interests \nthat the public's health comes first.\n  This bill is a start to fixing that problem, but we have a long way \nto go. My colleagues across the aisle need to stop fighting EPA on \nbehalf of special interests, and start fighting alongside EPA in the \npublic interest.\n  Because if they don't, there will be more Flints, there will be more \nmothers who can't sleep because their children are sick, and there will \nbe more ``bi-partisan'' bills expressing hindsight support for EPA \naction.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4470, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a rule and the \nunderlying bills, both of which will enhance accountability and create \nbetter processes for our Federal Government.\n  Necessary legislation is what we are talking about today. Legislation \nthat will help the Federal Government not only in its processes, but \nthat will allow the American people to have confidence in what their \ngovernment does not only on their behalf, but for a better future for \nthe American citizens, including our children and grandchildren.\n  We are here today because these are important issues, and we are \naddressing them. That is what Speaker Ryan wants this body to be doing. \nSpeaker Ryan wants us to bring our best ideas to the floor, to make \nsure the American people understand what they are, to fully debate \nthem, and to have all the open processes that are necessary to make \nsure that we are bringing to the American people the best ideas of \ntheir elected representatives. That is why we are here today.\n  I also want to point out that the Rules Committee, of which I am \nchairman, asked Members to submit their ideas and amendments regarding \nthese bills, and 14 amendments were made in order. That means that the \nRules Committee met, we looked, and we had discussions with Members \nabout the ideas that they have. Fourteen were made in order last night \nby the Rules Committee, and I am proud of that.\n  As a result, our resolution provides that H.R. 3442, the Debt \nManagement and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2015, which was altered and \nsupported by the gentleman from Coppell, Texas, Congressman Kenny \nMarchant, and H.R. 3293, the Scientific Research in the National \nInterest Act, which was brought to the committee by the young chairman \nof the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Lamar Smith from San \nAntonio, Texas, will both be considered today under a structured rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would normally run through my opening dialogue that I \nwould have about what is in these bills, why they are important, and \nwhat they would do. But because of time considerations today, one of \nour newest Members of Congress wants to speak. He has got a meeting in \na few minutes. I would like to ask him if he would at this time take \npart in my opening statement.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Windsor, Colorado (Mr. Buck).\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, for years, our Nation has limped along from \ndebt crisis to debt crisis. Every time, we say to ourselves ``just a \nlittle more spending today, and we will fix this mess tomorrow,'' but \ntomorrow never seems to come, and the ocean of red ink gets deeper and \ndeeper with each passing day. Thanks to this ``spend now'' and ``save \nnever'' mentality, the national debt has soared to $19 trillion, and \nthere is no end in sight. The Federal Government has been overspending \nfor so long that we are financially bankrupt. If we continue to pass \nthis debt on to our children and grandchildren, we are also morally \nbankrupt. We need a solution to our constant budget busting.\n  H.R. 3442 will help our Nation address this fiscal crisis. By \nrequiring the administration to testify before Congress,\n\n[[Page H669]]\n\nwe are requiring them to bring realistic, serious solutions to the \ntable. We are calling on them to offer a plan for actually reducing our \ndebt, and--this is key--we are requiring these solutions before we \nreach the point of no return.\n  What we have wrought in debt and deficit isn't merely a fiscal \nchallenge or an economic problem--it is poisonous to our human \npotential. It is time for the Federal Government to start making the \nsame tough choices that small businesses and folks in Colorado are \nmaking every day, and this bill is a good start.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The original intent also of a piece of legislation that we have goes \nback to 1950. The legislation that created the National Science \nFoundation was there at the time to support science that was in the \nnational interest. Unfortunately, the NSF has funded too many wasteful \nprojects under the ideas that have been presented to us by the Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee, the purposes of which were probably \nnebulous at best, which would be the argument that Chairman Lamar Smith \nmade with us, and which were, clearly, not necessarily in the national \ninterest.\n  We heard testimony that every single project that the National \nScience Foundation handled was in the American people's best interest. \nWe think that our discussion with Members of Congress today will show \nthem that we need to change the wording to where the national interest \nis obligatory to a proposal before a proposal is given. You have to \nprove it is in the Nation's best interest to spend money. Examples of \nsuch projects include $700,000 to create a climate change-themed \nmusical, $38,000 to study prehistoric rabbit hunting on the Iberian \nPeninsula, and--perhaps my favorite of all--$605,000 to study why \npeople around the world cheat on their taxes.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is hard-earned money that was spent that I do not \nbelieve was in the national interest. ``In the interest of the Nation'' \nmeans that it needs to be prioritized and that it needs to be something \nthat would produce an outcome that would, from the National Science \nFoundation, benefit the American people.\n  H.R. 3293 directly benefits the American people by promoting greater \naccountability--a mission statement, so to speak--in funding scientific \nresearch, not only at the NSF, but that also ensures that the research \nconducted is always in the national interest.\n  This is, I believe, a commonsense, bipartisan answer. Certainly, \nLamar Smith, as the chairman of the committee, brought forth the ideas \non a bipartisan basis to ensure that what we would do is not get in the \nway of any projects that are currently out there. Instead, anything \nthat is in the future would have to subscribe to the conditions of the \nnational interest.\n  Reckless and mandatory spending has placed our national finances and \nour economy--including our jobs, our infrastructure, and our future--in \nperil. Today, the total debt is subject to the limit, which includes \nTreasury securities held by Federal trust funds and other accounts, \nwhich stand at over $19 trillion. Additionally, the Congressional \nBudget Office projects that the 2016 deficit will be $544 billion. You \ncan see that we are not just at $19 trillion but that we are adding to \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, you know and I know, in just a matter of weeks, the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Tom Price), the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, will be bringing forth to this floor bills that address what \nour year is going to look like in 2017. The President of the United \nStates has a chance to do this. Every year, the President submits his \nbudget. It is $1 trillion more a year in spending. It is more \ngovernment. It is more spending. It adds more things to our debt. \nRepublicans, since 2011--since we have been in the majority--have tried \nto submit budgets that have held us in place; but by holding us in \nplace, which is the best we can do, it does not mean that we were \naddressing creating a surplus, which would be required not to add to \nthat debt.\n  So where we are is back to the American people again with an \nopportunity for them to understand our processes--a budget, an \nopportunity to get to where we do not add to the debt. Yet what we are \nhere to do today is not the budget but to address what we do under a \ncircumstance when we have a debt limit by which we have met the \nconstitutional constraints, the legal constraints, and what we are \ngoing to do in moving forward.\n  We are taking a bill that comes directly from Kenny Marchant, who is \na member of our Ways and Means Committee, who has spent a number of \nyears in thinking through how we can put a spotlight--how we can put \nthe light of day--on this issue to the point at which we can talk about \nit, understand more about it, and do something about it. That is also \nthe second bill: the National Science Foundation, what is in the \nnational interest, and, clearly, looking at the debt.\n  If we are going to have a debt limit increase, how do we as Members \nof Congress, under our constitutional powers, understand not just the \nissue but also the obligation that we have when we take votes so that \nwe know what is at risk, what the plan would be, and, perhaps more \nimportantly, how we can work together with the administration--\nRepublicans and Democrats--to make sure we get a better answer.\n  Now, there is one last point that needs to be made, and I think it \nwas made yesterday in the committee, not just by the gentleman Tom \nCole, not just by Virginia Foxx from North Carolina, and not just by \nme, which is that we don't know who the President is going to be next \nyear. We don't know who the Secretary of the Treasury is going to be \nnext year. The gentleman, the author of the bill, thinks that that is a \nprime reason his legislation should be a bipartisan, commonsense piece \nof legislation so that we are saying whoever it is has the authority \nand the responsibility to come to Congress and give us the insight.\n  Let's work together so that we avoid debt, so that we avoid making a \nmistake, and, mostly, so that we are on the same page together. That is \nwhy we are here today, Mr. Speaker.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSessions), my good friend and distinguished chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  I rise in strong opposition to this rule, which provides for the \nconsideration of H.R. 3293, a bill to hamstring the National Science \nFoundation and its gold standard review process; and I rise in strong \nopposition to H.R. 3442, a misnamed debt management bill that provides \nCongress with no new information about the debt limit and that does \nnothing to actually prevent default.\n  Despite a promise from Speaker Ryan and House Republican leadership \nfor an open and deliberative process, this rule makes in order only 14 \nof the 47 amendments that were submitted on both pieces of legislation \nto our committee--only six amendments for the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee's bill and eight for the debt limit bill. \nDemocrats on the Rules Committee offered an open rule so that both \nDemocratic and Republican Members could have an opportunity to make \ntheir views known on this bill, but as has become the custom, the \nDemocrats voted for an open process, and every single Republican voted \nagainst an open process.\n  Members should have the opportunity to offer their ideas on the House \nfloor, and we should be having a robust debate on these issues. Here is \na crazy idea, Mr. Speaker: Maybe, if we actually opened up the process \nand allowed for a full debate, we could actually pass bipartisan \nlegislation that would move through the legislative process and then go \non to the President's desk where he would then sign it into law. Yet, \nfor the most part, my friends on the other side of the aisle don't seem \ninterested in working with Democrats to advance common goals that will \nactually help the American people, and the legislation before us today \nis no exception.\n  H.R. 3442 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to appear before \nCongress and submit a report on the administration's debt reduction \nproposals. I have got some good news for my friends. The\n\n[[Page H670]]\n\nTreasury Secretary already regularly meets with Congress to discuss the \ndebt limit, and the President offers proposals to address the debt and \nthe deficit in his annual budgets. I would say to my colleagues on the \nRepublican side that it is okay--you can ask questions. That is what \nhearings are for. You can ask questions about the debt and deficit \nreduction.\n  In fact, just yesterday, President Obama sent his fiscal year 2017 \nbudget request to Congress, which included over $2.9 trillion in \ndeficit reduction over the coming decade--this on top of the $4 \ntrillion to $5 trillion in deficit reduction already achieved since \n2010. If my friends are interested in hearing about these proposals to \nreduce our deficit, perhaps they should reconsider their unprecedented \nand insulting decision to exclude the OMB from testifying on the \nadministration's budget proposal. Such a contemptuous attitude demeans \nCongress and the American people.\n  In addition to its annual budget, the administration also provides \nthe information requested by H.R. 3442 in the form of the Mid-Session \nReview, of the Daily Treasury Statement, of the Monthly Treasury \nStatement, of the Monthly Statement of the Public Debt, of the \nSchedules of Federal Debt, and of the Financial Report of the United \nStates Government.\n  The Treasury manages our debt, but it is Congress that holds the \npower of the purse. It is our responsibility to raise the debt limit \nwhen it is reached, and I would point out that it is the legislative \ndecisions made by Congress that determine the level of debt.\n  I say to my Republican friends, if you don't want to deal with the \nissue of raising the debt limit, then don't accumulate all of these \nbills. The debt limit debate is about making sure we live up to our \nfinancial obligations, the obligations that this Chamber agreed to.\n  Last night in the Rules Committee, we had a debate about deficit \nreduction and how to deal with the debt. Members on both sides of the \naisle offered suggestions on ways to reduce our deficit, and that is an \nimportant discussion we should be having because it is a big issue. Yet \nthis bill is not about deficit reduction; it is not about trying to get \nour debt under control; and it is not a serious attempt to help us \navoid future default. The Republican majority has threatened default on \nat least three separate occasions: in 2011, when default was narrowly \navoided with the Budget Control Act; in 2013, when Republican extremism \nled to a government shutdown, costing our fragile economy $24 billion \nand 120,000 private sector jobs; and this past fall, when Democrats \nhelped to pass the bipartisan budget agreement despite opposition from \ntwo-thirds of the Republicans in this Congress.\n  I would like to point out what is missing in this bill that we are \ngoing to be talking about later on this week. The report required by \nthis legislation would exclude the most important information Congress \nneeds when the debt limit is reached, which is an analysis of the \ncatastrophic consequences of default. If this were a serious attempt to \naddress our debt, I would think that the majority would want to know \nwhich bills the Treasury would need to stop paying if Congress failed \nto raise the debt limit. Would veterans stop receiving their benefits? \nWould Medicare providers stop being reimbursed? Would students stop \nreceiving Pell grants? The chairman of the Rules Committee said in his \nopening statement that the American people want us to do something. I \nagree.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  This is not doing something. This is trying to point the finger \nsomewhere else so that we can avoid responsibility for doing our job.\n  If we were serious about this issue, maybe we ought to think about \nactually passing legislation that would help reduce our deficit and pay \ndown our debt. Maybe we ought to be talking about comprehensive \nimmigration reform. CBO says that we would save hundreds of billions of \ndollars for our National Treasury if we actually did that, did \nsomething positive to resolve our immigration crisis and, in doing so, \nwe would save all this money that could go to reducing our deficit.\n  Maybe one of the things we ought to be talking about here is actually \nnot passing tax breaks for wealthy people that we don't pay for because \nthat adds to the bills that we accumulate here in Congress. If you want \nto give Donald Trump another tax cut, pay for it. That is all.\n  Maybe we ought to talk about dealing with the issue of these war \ncosts. I mean, we can't even come together and actually debate and vote \non an AUMF as these new wars are popping up all over the world.\n  By the way, if we did, maybe we could talk about the cost, which, by \nthe way, a big chunk of these war costs aren't even paid for. They are \nput on our credit card. I mean, the only people sacrificing in these \nwars are the men and women who we put in harm's way and their families. \nThe rest of us do nothing. We don't even ask the American people to pay \nfor it.\n  Well, here is an idea: if people don't want to pay for these wars, \nmaybe we ought not to go. Just putting them on our credit card should \nnot be an answer. Those are the kinds of things we should be talking \nabout here today if we were serious about getting our budget under \ncontrol.\n  Simply put, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is duplicative, \nunnecessary, and a waste of time. It does nothing to prevent future \nRepublican threats of default, and I strongly oppose this effort.\n  This week, also, Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are bringing to the \nfloor H.R. 3293, another antiscience piece of legislation. Now, some \nmight call this a thinly veiled attempt by the majority to dictate what \nthe National Science Foundation spends their funding on, but there \nreally isn't even a thin veil trying to cover up what this is. This is \na blatant attempt to coerce the NSF into only funding projects that fit \ninto the Republican political messaging agenda.\n  The NSF receives upwards of 50,000 proposals a year. Out of all these \nproposals, only about 20 percent end up receiving funding. The NSF puts \nthe applications through a rigorous process of peer review in order to \ndetermine which proposals they will fund.\n  I would like to emphasize the fact that this is a peer review, not a \ncongressional review. It is a peer review. Congress does not review \nthese applications because the vast majority of us are not scientists. \nI am not a scientist. I don't think many of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are scientists.\n  The NSF review process is also designed to be confidential in order \nto protect against any internal or external bias. Injecting \ncongressional interference and disruption into a well-functioning \nprocess will have a drastically negative effect.\n  Now, it should come as no surprise that a big part of the Republican \nmajority's argument is that the NSF is focusing too much of its funding \non projects studying climate change. I tried to figure out what the \nhook was, and I found that that is it.\n  I have said this here before, and I will keep saying it until we stop \ndebating these ridiculous bills. We know that climate change is real. \nWe see it. We live it. The scientific community overwhelmingly has \nverified it. Climate change is not a theory. It is not a hoax. It is \nnot some silly fantasy. The NSF should be funding research that is \ndirected toward understanding and mitigating the effects of climate \nchange.\n  The majority on the Science Committee has been on a crusade to inject \nitself into NSF's independent grant review process. The committee has \ndemanded an explanation on how roughly 40 studies could possibly serve \nour national interests. Now, we have seen time and time again that \nbasic research leads to positive, life-changing outcomes never imagined \nby researchers.\n  Congress certainly does not have the experience or the knowledge to \npredetermine the future value of a research project. Just because the \ntitle of a project doesn't sound particularly overwhelmingly impressive \ndoesn't mean it isn't, and we have a gazillion examples of that in the \nresearch that has been done in the NSF.\n  It is best to leave the scientific review process in the hands of our \nworld-class scientists who resoundingly oppose efforts to interfere \nwith NSF's rigorous review process. I join them in strong opposition to \nthis bill.\n  Now, once again, Mr. Speaker, we are on the floor debating two bills \nthat are going nowhere. Each bill has received a\n\n[[Page H671]]\n\nveto threat from the White House because this is not serious \nlegislation. Mr. Speaker, this is just more political fodder for the \nright wing of the Republican Party, sound bites for my friends on the \nother side of the aisle to use while on the campaign trail to attempt \nto sound like they are dealing with issues in a serious manner when, in \nfact, they are not. It doesn't matter what year it is. The American \npeople elected us to solve problems, not pad Republicans' political \ntalking points.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this restrictive rule and the two \npartisan pieces of legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee made in order more \namendments than Senator Harry Reid did as majority leader over 2 \nyears--in just 1 day. In just 1 day, more amendments were made in order \nin the United States House of Representatives. So I get it. I do.\n  I think I would be on the defensive, also, if I were my colleagues, \nmy friends that are Democrats, because what they are doing to this \ncountry doesn't work, and they are defensive about it. So they view \nanything that Republicans do, even on a bipartisan basis but doesn't \nfit their narrative as, ``this is political.''\n  Well, balancing the budget is in the best interest of the American \npeople. Presenting realistic budgets--not a trillion dollars more in \nspending and bigger government--is exactly the kind of policies that \nRepublicans do believe.\n  By the way, if they were really serious about trying to fix this \nglobal warming, they wold look in their own backyard with home heating \nfuel, which is diesel fuel, which they are putting all through the \nNortheast to heat their homes. That is a huge contributor to global \nwarming, as opposed to clean, natural gas. They can make their own \ndecisions. But I would say back to them: I think you ought to measure \nthree times and have seen once, not just go accusing other people of \nthings.\n  Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the Rules Committee, we had the gentleman \nfrom Coppell, Texas, Kenny Marchant, a great member of our Ways and \nMeans Committee, come and testify about this bill, about how we look at \nraising the debt limit. He spoke very passionately, and there was a lot \nof common sense involved about how do we look at this issue and how do \nwe solve it.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Marchant).\n\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to me \nand his support on this issue. Also, I thank him for allowing the Rules \nCommittee to spend over an hour on this issue yesterday to hear both \nsides of this issue as far as the debt ceiling goes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can't go to a townhall meeting or even go to a \ngathering of just a few people without the subject of the debt ceiling \ncoming up. My constituents on a regular basis, through emails, phone \ncalls, and letters, ask me the questions: What is Congress doing about \naddressing the debt ceiling? Why do you lurch from year to year to year \nabout the debt ceiling? Why don't you ever look at the debt ceiling in \na comprehensive manner?\n  The debt is too high. When I introduced this bill in September, the \ndebt had reached $18.1 trillion. Today, it is over $19 trillion. If the \ncurrent law remains unchanged, the Congressional Budget Office predicts \nthat the Federal debt held by the public will exceed 100 percent of our \nGDP in 25 years, and this is unsustainable.\n  The window to get a handle on the Nation's debt is closing very \nquickly. We need to enact solutions to retire the debt before it is too \nlate. That is what the Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act is \nall about.\n  This bill creates a new debt limit framework that places greater \nattention on finding debt reduction solutions. It does so by injecting \ntransparency, accountability, and timeliness into the debt limit \nprocess. The bill would allow Congress and the administration to take \ncomprehensive assessments of the debt and its drivers well before the \nstatutory debt limit is reached.\n  Each year since I have been in Congress, I can pick up the newspaper \none day and find that the Secretary of the Treasury announces that we \nhave reached our statutory debt limit and usually proclaims a date. In \nthis case, the statutory debt limit will be reached next March of 2017. \nAt that point, everybody seems to go about their business. There is no \nparticular action taken.\n  In fact, last month after that proclamation was made that we had \nreached our statutory debt ceiling, 7 months went by without us \nreaching the debt ceiling. How did that happen? Well, it happened \nbecause the Secretary of the Treasury has the ability to implement \nextraordinary measures. Now, if any committees in the Congress should \nknow what those extraordinary measures that he is using are going to be \nor are, it is the Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  So this bill very simply lays out a framework where, before the debt \nceiling is reached--and the Secretary of Treasury knows that--he has a \nframework of up to 60 days to come and appear before the Ways and Means \nCommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, which could be a joint \nmeeting, and lay out for us when the debt ceiling will be reached--not \nafter we have reached the debt ceiling, but before we have reached the \ndebt ceiling--what extraordinary measures he will take once we have \nreached that debt ceiling and when, in fact, he thinks we will actually \nrun out of money.\n  In that report, he will actually then lay out the administration's \nplan on addressing that debt in the short term, in the midterm, and in \nthe future. So it is a very commonsense plan. It involves one very \nspecific meeting with these two jurisdictional committees with the \nSecretary of the Treasury. The whole focal point of that meeting will \nbe to talk about the debt ceiling. That does not happen now.\n  We have dozens of reports that are online. We have dozens of \ndiscussions besides this, but never statutorily is the Secretary of the \nTreasury and the two jurisdictional committees required to meet and \ndiscuss this. This is the great thing about this bill, the \nimplementation of this bill.\n  Like so many Americans, my constituents have watched with great \nconcern as the debt has skyrocketed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Tipton). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 additional minute to the \ngentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. MARCHANT. If we share these concerns at all--and I know that many \nof us do--we need to pass the Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility \nAct.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the rule.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Maybe I can clear all this up so we don't have to debate this bill.\n  The gentleman asked a question about extraordinary measures that the \nSecretary of the Treasury could potentially use to deal with the debt \nceiling. I would just tell him that they are defined in statute, and we \nwill happily provide him a copy of the statute so that he can \nunderstand that.\n  I would go back to what I said in my opening statement that, if we \nare serious about dealing with our deficit and our debt, then maybe we \nought to be thinking in these terms, about actually not accumulating \nall these bills that get us to the point where we have to raise the \ndebt ceiling.\n  I mean, we in Congress--not the administration, but we in Congress--\naccumulate all these bills and all these financial obligations. Once \nyou do that, you have to pay for them. Our constituents, when they \naccumulate credit card debt, they have got to pay it. They just can't \nnot pay it because they don't want to. So we have to start behaving \nlike adults here and understand that we need to pay our bills.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that \none way we might want to save some money and not add it to the deficit \nor to our debt is to stop giving Donald Trump tax cuts that you don't \npay for.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  If you want to have tax cuts for wealthy individuals, fine. Pay for \nthem. Don't not pay for them. Stop subsidizing big oil companies in \nthis country.\n  Maybe there was a time when we first started exploring for oil that \nyou\n\n[[Page H672]]\n\ncould make the case that taxpayers ought to be subsidizing oil \ncompanies. Not anymore. Not with global warming and certainly not when \nthey are making zillions of dollars a year in profits. Maybe we could \ntake that money and put it toward deficit reduction.\n  Or maybe we could pay for these wars that everybody seems to want to \ncommit our young men and women to. If you want to go to war, you ought \nto pay for it, not just put it on a credit card. If you are not \nprepared to do that, then end these wars.\n  But just putting in danger the lives of our brave men and women and \njust accumulating all these massive bills that there is no \naccountability of I think is unconscionable.\n  Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I respect the motivation that underlies this \nbill. We have got a debt in this country that is too large, and we have \ngot to address it, but this is a nonresponse.\n  The job of addressing the debt belongs to Congress. It can't be \noutsourced. The Secretary of the Treasury has no more authority to \naddress the debt than the Secretary of Agriculture or Education or the \nDemocratic National Committee or the Republican Campaign Committee. \nThis is a job that has to be done, but it is our job to do it.\n  Asking the Secretary of the Treasury to come in and talk about when \nthat date certain will be on default when we set that date when we pass \nbudgets means that we are asking somebody else to do our job and asking \nsomebody who actually doesn't even have the authority to do the job. \nThat belongs to Congress.\n  Every time we vote on either a tax cut or an appropriation bill, it \nhas clear implications for how that will impact on the debt ceiling. It \nis debatable because there are fluctuations as to when we will hit that \ndate.\n  But it is absolutely certain that, when we appropriate money or we \npass tax cuts, in one case spending will go up, and in the other case \nrevenues will go down.\n  What we have done is gone along in a kind of la-la land where we \nthink we can cut taxes, we can raise spending, and then we are \nastonished when a year or so later there is actually a bill that comes \ndue.\n  This is not the debt management bill. It is not the fiscal \nresponsibility bill. It is the debt mismanagement and fiscal \nirresponsibility bill.\n  Think about the things that we have done. Mr. McGovern has been \ntalking about it. But we had a war in Iraq, a trillion dollars. Nobody \npaid for that. We voted to spend a trillion dollars on tax cuts. We can \nhave an argument about tax policy. But you know what, revenues went \ndown.\n  Congress voted to spend $800 billion on the prescription drug \nprogram, something that had bipartisan support. Not paid for. And then \njust a few weeks ago we passed tax extenders that are going to reduce \nrevenues by $2 trillion.\n  Actions have consequences. The consequences are ones that are \ninevitable and foreseeable as a result of the actions of this Congress. \nThis Congress, instead of assuming its responsibility, tries to \noutsource it.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. WELCH. To someone else, it is a dodge. That is all it is. It is \nus trying to fool the American people with a game of three-card Monte \nwhere we are pretending that the problem that we are decrying had \nsomehow mysteriously evolved out of nowhere.\n  I respect the concern of the authors of this bill about our debt. \nWhat I don't respect is the failure of Congress to address it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are doing this is \nbecause one day 2 years ago the President, through the Treasury, wrote \noff $339 billion in one day. That is not responsible. It didn't happen \nin one day.\n  They play games at Treasury. The President of the United States plays \ngames with this issue. Now it sounds like my colleagues are, also. This \nis an honest attempt to have a dialogue.\n  Regardless of who is going to be President or whoever is going to be \nTreasury Secretary next year, we want to know what kind of games or \nwhat kind of straightforward business they are going to operate.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nButler, Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), one of the most exciting young \nMembers of this Congress.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for referring to me \nas young and exciting. I am going to phone my wife to let her know that \nis the case.\n  Mr. Speaker, I come before you today because I am in strong support \nof H.R. 3442. I think that sometimes we make this a Democratic versus \nRepublican issue. Responsibility is not a political issue. It is a \nmoral issue.\n  Irresponsibility is the problem that we have. I wish we could go away \nfrom making political talking points into making solid policy positions \nthat say: okay, fine, if we are going to increase our debt ceiling, \ntell me why you are going to get there.\n  I come from the private sector. There are many times in my life I \nhave had to go to lenders and tell them I need to borrow money. The \nfirst thing they would say is: give me your financials; let me look at \nthe way you are running your company; let me see about what you are \ndoing; then we will make a decision.\n  Then they would come back to me and say: you know what, I am looking \nat what you are asking for, and you definitely need an injection of \ncapital; but my question is what is your turnaround plan so you are not \nback here in 6 months or 12 months asking for more money on a failed \nmodel.\n  The people's House, the Congress, is made up of both Republicans and \nDemocrats. More importantly, it is made up of Americans. We are looking \nat a year when the tax revenues are the highest they have ever been--\n$3.25 trillion--yet, we continue to spend $3.7 trillion to $3.8 \ntrillion.\n  Now people look at that and their eyes kind of roll back in their \nhead. They say: I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.\n  So you reduce it down to this, which I think is the most effective \nway of explaining it. Hardworking American couples sit down at the \nkitchen table. It is kitchen table economics. It is not all this other \nstuff. It is not all these hieroglyphics.\n  The husband and the wife talk and say: you know what, Honey, we had a \ngreat year; I was able to bring home $32,500; what I want you to do is \nto go out and spend $37,500 or $38,000.\n  They would look at each other and say: wait a minute, you told me you \nhad a great year--and you did--but you want me to spend even more money \nthan you brought in.\n\n  We constantly tell the American people: you are going to have to \ntighten your belts; you are going to have to live within your means. \nAnd then, because we don't have to, we go out and borrow and raise the \ndebt ceiling.\n  Think about that couple that is increasing their debt load year after \nyear after year--deficit spending--and we are crowing about the fact \nthat you know what, we have cut our deficit spending by half a trillion \ndollars this year. Aren't we doing well?\n  My question is: so where does that deficit spending go? It goes onto \nyour long-term debt. You are digging the hole so deep that you will \nnever be able to climb out of it, but you are feeling good about it \nbecause you were able to satisfy whatever your needs were at that \nmoment.\n  That is not only irresponsible, it is unconscionable. More than that, \nit is immoral for people to sit in this House as representatives of the \nAmerican people who have been given the authority to tax, but they have \nalso been given the responsibility to spend that hardworking American \ntaxpayer's dollar.\n  More importantly, once you have authority and once you have \nresponsibility, you have got to be accountable not just to that person \nin the mirror, but, in my case, the 705,687 people that I represent in \nwestern Pennsylvania.\n  Now, they are not all Republicans. They are not all Democrats. They \nare not all Libertarians. They are not all Independents. But they are \nall hardworking American taxpayers.\n  Why do we have to reduce this down to a political-talking-points \nissue instead of talking about what is fundamentally sound \neconomically?\n  You cannot spend your way out of debt. You cannot continue to borrow\n\n[[Page H673]]\n\nirresponsibly and say: well, we have the power to do it. So when we ask \nthe Secretary of the Treasury who else would you go to, that is who is \nresponsible for it.\n  I don't care who is sitting in there. I don't care who is in the \nWhite House. I care about sound, fundamental fiscal policy that \nprotects this country going forward, not only those that are with us \nright now, but those that came before us and those that are going to \ncome after us.\n  We are putting ourselves in a position that is totally going to be \nunrecoverable. Why would we knowingly sit here and think if I can pin \nthe blame on somebody else from the political opposite of me, I will \nsomehow win an election?\n  Is it really that important to win an election and lose the country? \nIs it really that important to have a political talking point that \nmakes you feel good about what you said so you can go back home to \nsomebody and say: you saw what I did on the floor; right?\n  I would hope that the constituents would say: yes, I did. You just \nput me deeper in debt. You made it impossible for me to plan for my \nfuture. You made it impossible for us to remain one of the strongest \ncountries in the world because debt will eliminate you. I don't care if \nit is a person. I don't care if it is a business. I don't care if it is \na State or a country.\n  We are quickly approaching the point of no return. To sit here and \ntry to make it a political battle instead of survival for the United \nStates of America is totally irresponsible. More importantly, it is \nimmoral.\n  This is not a political battle. This is a fight for the future of our \ncountry. This is a fight for sustainability in the greatest country the \nworld has ever known.\n  I do not think that any of us should ever turn our back on our \nresponsibility because it just wasn't politically right.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just say I have the greatest \nrespect for my colleague from Pennsylvania, but the reason why we \noppose this is because it does nothing.\n  Actually, it attempts to pin the blame on the Secretary of the \nTreasury, but the reality is--and I want to repeat this for my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--that Congress' decision on \nrevenue and spending policies ultimately determine the level of debt \nand when the debt limit is reached. It is our responsibility.\n  What we object to is that, instead of debating concrete issues to \nreduce our deficit and reduce our debt, we are involved in this kind of \ndebating a nonissue, a bill that does nothing, that will do nothing to \nreduce our deficit, reduce our debt, and is a complete waste of time.\n  At this point, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nConnolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Massachusetts \nfor his leadership.\n  I want to say to my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), whom I \nrespect and admire, this isn't like a simple, homespun, sit around the \nkitchen table and work this out and be responsible in paying our bills. \nI wish it were.\n  That homespun couple in Pennsylvania or my district in Virginia can't \nstart a war that is unpaid for in Iraq, can't decide to give wealthy \npeople a tax cut that is unpaid for, can't run the U.S. economy into \nthe ground that costs trillions of dollars in additional debt because \nof policy choices made in this Congress, not by the Secretary of the \nTreasury.\n  It was Republican Vice President Cheney who actually said in the \nmidst of all of that that debts no longer matter.\n  So we are glad to see the new-found religion here on the floor of the \nHouse with our friends on the other side of the aisle, who are now once \nagain concerned about debt, debt they helped accumulate to an obscene \ndegree.\n  I rise, Mr. Speaker, in opposition to not only that bill, but to the \nScientific Research in the National Interest Act bill.\n  It comes as no surprise to my constituents in Virginia that the most \nanti-environmental Congress--the House majority is now attempting to \ntell the National Science Foundation how they ought to do and award \nFederal research grants based on what Congress deems worthy.\n  The House majority has been open about its climate denialism and \ncandid about its outright political agenda against scientific fact. The \nvery scientific community that we should trust to understand and \nforecast the effects of manmade global climate change is substituted in \nthis bill by the United States Congress, a bunch of politicians.\n  This bill is a solution in search of a problem. It threatens the \nNational Science Foundation's gold-standard merit-review process that \nhas resulted in groundbreaking research over the years, including \nmedical, technological, agricultural, and public health advancements.\n  Even worse, how are we to explain the majority's decision to exclude \nclimate change, one of the most pressing global challenges we face, as \none of the bill's seven national interest criteria? It is not even in \nthere.\n  I offered an amendment that would have ensured climate change is \ndeemed in the national interest. The Republican majority would not even \nallow that amendment to come to this floor for debate.\n  The NSF is helping to lead research in global climate change. For \nexample, it was an NSF grant that launched a program in my district at \nGeorge Mason University that will help television weather forecasters \nbetter inform and explain to viewers how climate change will affect us \nand those communities.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  In 2013, Mr. Speaker, I visited a place called Ny-Alesund in \nSvalbard, Norway. This is the northernmost research installation in the \nplanet in the Arctic Circle and a leading research and monitoring \nstation that serves many of our international partners, including \nNorway, Italy, Japan, China, and the Netherlands.\n  I saw firsthand on that visit the rapid decline of Arctic sea ice and \nrapidly retreating glaciers. The research NSF funds there will have \nenvironmental and geopolitical benefits to the U.S., and we should be \nexpanding not retracting on those commitments. I ask: How is it that \nresearch is not in the national interest?\n  This destructive bill will have a chilling effect on our research \ncommunity, stifling ambitious research necessary to a 21st century \nfuture.\n  Sadly, once again, the Republican majority insists on misinformation \nand belief over empirical evidence and science.\n  I urge rejection of the bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for \nyielding, and I appreciate the chairman of the Rules Committee bringing \nthis rule to the floor to allow for consideration of H.R. 3293, the \nScientific Research in the National Interest Act.\n  H.R. 3293 requires each National Science Foundation public \nannouncement of a grant award to be accompanied by a nontechnical \nexplanation of the project's scientific merits and how it serves the \nnational interest. This written justification affirms the National \nScience Foundation's determination that a project is worthy of taxpayer \nsupport based on scientific merit and national interest.\n  The bill sets forth that NSF grants should meet at least one of seven \ncriteria that demonstrate a grant is in fact in the national interest. \nThese national interest areas are in the original enabling legislation \nthat established the National Science Foundation and its mission or are \npart of the National Science Foundation mission today. These criteria \nare:\n  Increased economic competitiveness in the United States;\n  Advancement of the health and welfare of the American public;\n  Development of an American STEM workforce that is globally \ncompetitive;\n  Increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with \nscience and technology in the United States;\n  Increased partnerships between academia and industry in the United \nStates;\n  Support for the national defense of the United States; or,\n  Promotion of the progress of science in the United States.\n  These seven national mission areas encompass the overriding needs of\n\n[[Page H674]]\n\nAmerica to which the scientific enterprise can contribute and advance. \nUnder this umbrella, many scientific disciplines and research areas can \nand do receive support and flourish.\n  The amendments that were not made in order by the Rules Committee \nwould have opened up this NSF national mission statement to include \nevery pet project, earmark, or political point that Members on the \nother side could think of. In fact, the explicit, line item-directed \nsubjects that Members wanted to add to the list of ``what is in the \nnational interest'' are already covered by one of the seven categories \nin the bill.\n  We welcome a fair and open debate on the merits of the bill, and \nseveral amendments were made in order that allow us to have that \ndebate. These include amendments by the ranking member of the House \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of \nTexas, as well as five other Democratic amendments.\n  This rule allows us to have that fair debate, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Every criticism I have heard in the last few minutes about this bill \ncould be addressed if those who oppose the bill just took the time to \nread the bill. It is only three pages long. You can probably read it in \n3 minutes. They would see that their opposition has no foundation \nwhatsoever.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 8 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question. If \nwe can defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the \nrule to bring up a bill that would help prevent mass shootings by \npromoting research on the causes of gun violence, making it easier to \nidentify and treat those prone to committing these acts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous materials, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, again, I oppose both H.R. 3442 and H.R. \n3293.\n  Again, on H.R. 3442, if we are serious about deficit and debt \nreduction, then we ought to be talking about substance and something \nreal, not some sound bite where Members of the House can point to the \nadministration to say it is all their fault.\n  The reality is, it really is the fault of all of us, when you come \ndown to it, because this is the place where spending decisions are \nmade, where tax policy is made.\n  If my colleagues do not want to raise the debt ceiling, then don't \naccumulate all these bills. It is Congress that does this. When you \naccumulate all these bills and you have to raise the debt ceiling, it \nis irresponsible to all of a sudden say that we don't want to do it and \nthen to default on our debt.\n  As I mentioned before, back in 2013, when Republican extremism \nactually shut the government down, it cost our economy $24 billion and \n120,000 jobs.\n  Now, $24 billion may not seem like a lot to my Republican friends, \nbut I assure you that it all starts to add up. Those 120,000 jobs that \nwere lost is all lost revenue coming into the government which would go \nto paying down our deficit and debt.\n  If you really want to deal with this issue, then let's talk about \nthings like paying for these wars that no one seems to want to pay for. \nLet's talk about not enacting tax breaks and tax cuts for wealthy \nindividuals and not paying for it. Let's talk about reeling in some of \nthese excessive subsidies to Big Oil and to other big corporate \ninterests in this country. Let's talk about passing comprehensive \nimmigration reform, which, again, the CBO has said would save us \nhundreds of billions of dollars that we could put toward getting our \nfiscal house in order.\n  Those are real things. This is just talk for the sake of talk. I \nguess maybe it is a good press release; but, quite frankly, I think our \ntime would be better spent doing something else.\n\n  Again, on H.R. 3293, the so-called Scientific Research in the \nNational Interest Act, I take great exception to those who question the \nintegrity of the NSF. The National Science Foundation has integrity, in \nmy opinion, beyond question. The work that they do is extraordinary. \nThe work that they do leads to all kinds of benefits not only for the \npeople in this country, but for the environment and people all over the \nworld.\n  I think the scientists who work there are having their reputations \nquestioned by the introduction of this legislation, never mind us even \nconsidering it here today. I think you are diminishing the incredible \nwork that they do.\n  I get it. For some reason, my Republican colleagues can't admit that \nwe have a thing called climate change going on around the world. So any \ntime anybody talks about climate change, you go after whatever \ndepartment or agency it is. You attack them. You try to cut their \nfunding. You try to question their integrity.\n  Well, I hate to tell my Republican friends that climate change is \nreal. The overwhelming science says it is real. If you don't appreciate \nthat, maybe you ought to go back to school and take a science class.\n  When we talk about the lack of accountability and the lack of proper \nstewardship of what we are supposed to be doing here, that is one area \nwhere I think we have let the American people down; indeed, the world \ncommunity.\n  We are sitting here debating whether it is even an issue--which the \nAmerican people can't believe--while things continue to get worse.\n  I would say to my Republican friends: admit it; climate change is for \nreal. You are on the wrong side of public opinion. When you try to \nclaim it is a hoax, you are on the wrong side of the scientific \ncommunity and you are on the wrong side of history.\n  One final thing, because I couldn't help but take note that my \ncolleague from Texas kind of took a jab at Massachusetts over home \nheating oil. I would say to the gentleman a couple of things. One, \nMassachusetts is leading the Nation in terms of investments in \nrenewable and green energy. I am really proud of what my State is \ndoing.\n  I would say one other thing to the gentleman from Texas, and that is \nthat his State--Texas--generates 10 times more emissions from heating \noil, compared to Massachusetts. So I would urge him to get his State's \nemissions under control for the sake of our planet.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  The first thing I would like to say to the gentleman is that Texas is \nbigger than France and Texas is bigger than Massachusetts. In fact, we \nhave economic output. We have lots of people working. We have economic \nprowess in Texas.\n  We do have more output of what might be carbon. We do. We also had \n$290 billion worth of economic activity that we sent overseas. Texas \nhelps the United States of America float its boat because we have jobs, \nwe have lower taxes, we have great schools, we have people that enjoy \nliving where they live, and we have people that take responsibility.\n  Across the board, Texas is a great place to live. Texas does, as you \nhave heard many times, move our country in a direction to more freedom, \nMr. Speaker. What we are talking about is freedom. With that freedom \ncomes responsibility.\n  Mr. Speaker, why we are here today--exactly as I started to say in \nthe very beginning--is that our Speaker, Paul Ryan, has challenged I \nthink all of Congress, but in particular this Republican majority, to \nbring forth good ideas that address the issues, thoughts, and answers \nabout the problems that the United States Congress perhaps is \nresponsible for and perhaps the United States sees that we need to \nstart talking about what our future is going to be.\n  When he was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the Ways and \nMeans Committee, Speaker Ryan talked about growing our economy. I know \nour friends want to raise taxes. I know the President of the United\n\n[[Page H675]]\n\nStates wants to also, now that the energy costs are down, stick them \nback up and stick the American people with a $10 a barrel tax. I know \nthat what they want is more and more and more spending. They will get \ntheir chance with the budget when it comes in a trillion dollars higher \nin a year than what we are spending right now. That is their vision.\n  What we are talking about today is our vision, Speaker Ryan's vision, \nand the Republican majority's vision. And what is that? We would like \nto put in place an agreement. We would like for it to be a bipartisan \nvote. We already have bipartisan support. And that is so that we could \nsay that, regardless of who is President and Secretary of the \nTreasury--right now, I don't know who it is going to be; I really \ncouldn't even guess--we, as a body, make sure that we are focusing on \nwhat this is going to look like at the time. The gentleman from \nMassachusetts was very clear to say we already know all these things, \nbut we don't.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleague to support this rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n  An Amendment to H. Res. 609 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3926) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \n     better understanding of the epidemic of gun violence, and for \n     other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the \n     bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute \n     rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3926.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-minute votes on adopting House Resolution 609, if \nordered; and suspending the rules and passing H.R. 4470.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 237, \nnays 180, not voting 16, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H678]]\n\n  H.R. 3293, the Scientific Research in the National Interest Act, is a \nbipartisan bill that ensures the grant process at the National Science \nFoundation is transparent and accountable to the American people.\n  America's future economic growth and national security depend on \ninnovation. Public and private investments in research and development \nfuel the economy, create jobs, and lead to new technologies that \nbenefit Americans' daily lives.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years, the Federal Government has awarded \ntoo many grants that few Americans would consider to be in the national \ninterest.\n  For example, the National Science Foundation awarded $700,000 of \ntaxpayer money to support a climate change-themed musical that quickly \nclosed and almost $1 million for a social media project that targeted \nAmericans' online political speech.\n  A few other examples of questionable grants include: $487,000 to \nstudy the Icelandic textile industry during the Viking era; $340,000 to \nstudy early human-set fires in New Zealand; $233,000 to study ancient \nMayan architecture and their salt industry; and $220,000 to study \nanimal photos in National Geographic magazine.\n  When the NSF funds such projects as these, there is less money to \nsupport worthwhile scientific research that keeps our country on the \nforefront of innovation. Such areas include: computer science, advanced \nmaterials, lasers, telecommunications, information technology, \ndevelopment of new medicines, nanotechnology, cybersecurity, and dozens \nof others that hold the greatest promise of revolutionary scientific \nbreakthroughs. These sectors can create millions of new jobs and \ntransform society in positive ways.\n  NSF invests about $6 billion a year of taxpayer funds on research \nprojects and related activities.\n  The 1950 enabling legislation that created the NSF set forth the \nFoundation's mission and cited the ``national interest'' as the \nfoundation for public support and dissemination of basic scientific \nresearch.\n  The Science in the National Interest Act reaffirms and restores this \ncrucial mission. This will add transparency, accountability, and \ncredibility to the NSF and its grant process.\n  H.R. 3293 requires NSF grants to meet at least one of seven criteria \nthat demonstrates it is in the national interest. These seven criteria \nare: increased economic competitiveness in the United States; \nadvancement of the health and welfare of the American public; \ndevelopment of an American STEM workforce that is globally competitive; \nincreased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science \nand technology in the United States; increased partnerships between \nacademia and industry in the United States; support for the national \ndefense of the United States; and promotion of the progress of science \nin the United States.\n  Both the National Science Foundation director and the National \nScience Board have endorsed the principle that NSF should be more \naccountable in its grant funding decisions.\n  To NSF Director France Cordova's credit, the NSF began to implement \nnew internal policies last year that acknowledge the need for NSF to \ncommunicate clearly and in nontechnical terms the research projects it \nfunds and how they are in the national interest.\n  Opponents of this bill must think they know better than the NSF \ndirector. Director Cordova testified before the House Science, Space, \nand Technology Committee that the policy in H.R. 3293 is compatible \nwith the NSF's internal guidelines. This legislation makes that \ncommitment clear, explicit, and permanent.\n  Today, the NSF funds only one out of five proposals submitted by our \nscientists and research institutions.\n  How do we assure hardworking American families that their tax dollars \nare spent only on high priority research when we spend $700,000 of \ntheir money on a short-lived climate change-themed musical? It is not \nCongress' money, it is the taxpayers'.\n  How could elected representatives not agree that we owe it to \nAmerican taxpayers and the scientific community to ensure that every \ngrant funded is worthy and in the national interest?\n  With a national debt that now exceeds $19 trillion and continues to \nclimbs by hundreds of billions of dollars each year, we cannot fund \nevery worthy proposal, much less frivolous ones like a climate change \nmusical.\n  The legislation before us reaffirms in law that every NSF grant must \nsupport research that is demonstrably in the national interest.\n  Scientists still make the decisions. They just do not get a blank \ncheck signed by the taxpayer. They need to be accountable to the \nAmerican people by showing their proposals are, in fact, in the \nnational interest.\n  H.R. 3293 passed the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee \nin October by a voice vote.\n  Congress has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are \nspent wisely and are focused on national priorities. This bill is an \nessential step to restore and maintain taxpayer support for basic \nscientific research.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3293, the Scientific Research in \nthe National Interest Act.\n  I oppose this bill because I believe that this bill will hurt the \nNation's premier basic research agency, lead to less high reward \nresearch, and, ultimately, leave America less competitive.\n\n  My Republican colleagues have a simple argument for their \nlegislation: Shouldn't NSF research be in the national interest? That \nis a very good question, but one that can be easily answered.\n  My answer is that NSF research is already in the national interest. \nIt has been for more than 60 years.\n  The Federal investment in basic research over the past 60 years has \nbeen the primary driver of our Nation's economic growth and innovation. \nIn innumerable ways, our investments in basic research have paid back a \nwealth of dividends.\n  This fact is widely recognized across academia and industry. The \nNational Academies' ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report made \nthis point a decade ago. That panel, chaired by the former head of \nLockheed-Martin, understood that investment in basic research was \nfundamentally in the national interest.\n  When we passed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 as \npart of the Democrats' innovation agenda, that bill was endorsed by \nhundreds of business and research organizations, including the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. They \nall understood that investment in basic research is in the national \ninterest.\n  What is this bill really about? Is it really about enhancing our \nNation's ability to innovate? No. Sadly, this bill continues the \nRepublican majority's preoccupation with second-guessing America's best \nand brightest research scientists.\n  For the past 3 years, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology \nmajority has been engaged in a relentless and pernicious campaign \nagainst research grants with silly or odd sounding titles.\n  Republicans have used that time to carry out an unprecedented rifling \nthrough the 70 NSF grants reviews. After all this effort, did they find \nany evidence of wrongdoing? No. The only thing they found was what they \nalready knew: each of the research grants had passed NSF's merit review \nprocess with flying colors.\n  The majority may not like it and wish the results were different, but \nthose are the facts. Let me be clear. Some of the greatest scientific \nachievements of the past 60 years were the result of funny sounding \nresearch, including research that was ridiculed in Congress as \nfrivolous.\n  There are scores of examples. One of my favorites is ``The Sex Life \nof the Screwworm,'' surely one of the silliest sounding titles for \nresearch there could possibly be. So silly, in fact, that in the 1970s, \nthe grant was ridiculed as an example of government waste on the Senate \nfloor. Sounds a lot like what the majority is doing here today.\n  It turned out that the screwworm was costing the U.S. cattle industry \na small fortune. As a direct result of this silly sounding research, \nthe cattle industry saved approximately $20 billion in the U.S. and \nsignificantly reduced the cost of beef to U.S. consumers.\n\n[[Page H679]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  At its core, this bill is about second-guessing our Nation's best and \nbrightest scientists and the grant-making decisions they make.\n  Perhaps this is not surprising when so many of my Republican \ncolleagues openly question the validity of whole fields of established \nscience, from the social sciences to climate science to evolutionary \nbiology.\n  Far from adding anything useful to the NSF's review process, H.R. \n3293 would add more bureaucracy and paperwork. Yet, my biggest concern \nabout these requirements is that they will push NSF reviewers to fund \nless high-risk research, which, by its very nature, entails the pursuit \nof scientific understanding without it necessarily having any \nparticular or known benefit. We know that high-risk research tends to \nhave the highest reward, something that we have seen throughout the \nhistory of the NSF.\n  I am not alone in my concerns. The President's science adviser, Dr. \nJohn Holdren, noted:\n\n       H.R. 3293 would create doubt at NSF and in the research \n     community about Congress' real intent in calling into \n     question the adequacy of NSF's gold standard merit-review \n     process for applied as well as for basic research.\n       This could easily have a chilling effect on the amount of \n     basic research that scientists propose and that NSF chooses \n     to fund, with detrimental consequences for this Nation's \n     leadership in science, technology, and innovation alike.\n\n  Mr. Chair, I choose to stand with the scientists when it comes to \nscience. For that reason, I strongly oppose this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I say to the gentlewoman from Texas that her objections are simply \ntoo late. They are too late because the Director of the National \nScience Foundation has already incorporated the national interest \nstandard into the current guidelines that are being used at the \nNational Science Foundation. We are already using that, and the bill \nmakes them permanent.\n  I do like the gentlewoman's example of a screwworm because that is a \nreason to vote for the bill and not to oppose the bill. One of the \nrequirements in the bill is that these grants be explained in plain \nEnglish so that we know their connection to the national interest. \nClearly, there would be no problem in explaining why the example she \ngave is connected to the national interest.\n  In a few minutes, I will give just a few more examples of how \ntaxpayers' money is currently being used and should not be used.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nLucas), who is the vice chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee.\n  Mr. LUCAS. I thank Chairman Smith for the time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3293, Scientific \nResearch in the National Interest Act.\n  The NSF invests about $6 billion of public funds each year on \nresearch projects and related activities. It is the only Federal agency \nthat is dedicated to the support of fundamental research and education \nin all scientific and engineering disciplines.\n  Since its creation in 1950, the NSF has served a mission that helps \nmake the United States a world leader in science and innovation. In \nrecent years, however, the NSF has seemed to stray away from its \ncreated purpose and has funded a number of grants that few Americans \nwould consider in the national interest.\n  H.R. 3293 seeks to restore the NSF's critical mission by requiring \nthe NSF to explain in writing and in non-technical language how each \nresearch grant awarded supports the national interest and is worthy of \nFederal funding.\n  Now, think about that for a moment: not just explaining it in \nscientific terms that the fellow scientific community can understand, \nbut also in terms that taxpayers can understand.\n  In a time of distrust and suspicion of the Federal Government and of \nall institutions, that is a very important key point, being able to \nexplain to the folks back home why it matters.\n  The bill also sets forth that NSF grants should meet one of seven \ncriteria that demonstrates the grant is in the national interest.\n  Today, as was noted by the chairman, the NSF is able to fund only one \nout of every five proposals. This is a critical bill to restore faith \nin the process. We need to pass this.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose this bill.\n  America is an exceptional nation. One of the reasons we are the best \ncountry in the world is that we believe in science and we believe in \ninnovation. Our country has always believed in physics and in \nchemistry, and we trust scientists.\n  The National Science Foundation has helped this country grow in terms \nof innovation and in terms of amazing scientific discoveries. It is not \nbroken. So why are we trying to meddle with what the scientists have \ndone?\n  The chairman mentioned some examples of grants that sounded sort of \nfunny. I understand that most of the Republican legislators do not \nbelieve in climate change, but the overwhelming majority of scientists \ndo, as does the U.S. military, as does ExxonMobil today.\n  One of the grants had to do with how people learn about climate \nchange. That is vitally important because climate change is going to \naffect our children and our grandchildren.\n  It is true that some of these grants sound funny. That is because \nscientists do all sorts of things that, to a layperson, may not be very \nobvious.\n  Because I am not a scientist and because most people are not \nscientists, I think that is perfectly fine, that we don't have all \nsorts of redundant writings that explain what an experiment does. Let \nme give you one example that is on the NSF's Web site.\n  One of the grants is to study funny-looking colored clay in France, \nblue-green clay in another country. It sounds like a really silly \ngrant, doesn't it?\n  It turns out that, when they looked at it, there were properties in \nthis blue-green clay in France that kill bacteria, anti-bacterial \nproperties that can help deal with MRSA, that can help deal with \nsuperbugs. This can be a groundbreaking grant, a groundbreaking \ndiscovery, but under this bill, it might have problems being funded.\n  Ultimately, what this is really about and what I have learned now in \nCongress is that often we are very arrogant. We do not trust \nscientists. We do not trust the people in America.\n  This is an arrogant bill that sort of says we know best, not the \nscientists who are doing peer reviews of what grants to fund, and that \nwe know which experiment might do exactly what.\n  It turns out, in science, lots of times scientists study one area and \nget a completely different, amazing discovery in a totally unrelated \narea. We need to fund basic science. We need to take our hands off \nthis. We need to trust scientists and trust the people in America.\n  Do not pass this bill. We are not that arrogant. We should not \ndetermine what scientists are to be doing and that we know better than \nthey do, because we do not. I ask for opposition to this bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I really wish the people who say they oppose this bill would actually \nread the bill. It is only three pages long. They can probably read it \nin 3 minutes. Let me read the last sentence of the bill itself.\n  ``Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering the \nFoundation's intellectual merit or broader impacts criteria for \nevaluating grant applications.''\n  Despite what just might have been told, we don't interfere with the \nmerit-review process whatsoever.\n  The other thing is, when you come up with an example, as the \ngentleman just gave, it is clearly in the national interest. All we are \nasking is that the explanation show why it is in the national interest.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nLoudermilk), who is the chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee of the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. I thank the gentleman from Texas, the chairman, for\n\n[[Page H680]]\n\nyielding this time and for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, last month the Congressional Budget Office released an \nupdated deficit projection for fiscal year 2016. The CBO now expects \nthat our deficit will be $544 billion this year, which is an increase \nfrom the original projection of $414 billion.\n  Now, more than ever, Congress needs to work diligently to reduce \nspending and balance the Federal budget. However, it is equally \nimportant for us to make sure that every taxpayer dollar that is spent \nis used responsibly.\n  That is why I am an original cosponsor of the Scientific Research in \nthe National Interest Act. It will help ensure that the National \nScience Foundation, one of our Nation's most critical research \nagencies, is using its funding in the most beneficial way possible.\n  This bill requires the NSF to explain how each of its grants further \nAmerica's best interests. This could be done through advancing STEM \neducation, national defense, economic competitiveness, public health, \nor other key priorities.\n  By requiring the NSF to justify its research, this bill will help \ncrack down on frivolous government programs. And, yes, Mr. Chairman, \nthere are frivolous government programs.\n  For example, the NSF is currently spending $374,000 of taxpayer money \non a study of the ups and downs of senior citizens' dating experiences. \nWhile we all want, I am sure, Americans to enjoy their romantic lives \nthroughout the year, we cannot afford this type of wasteful taxpayer \nspending when we have a $19 trillion debt.\n  This commonsense legislation will ensure that NSF research is well \ndirected and that it will help prevent valuable taxpayer dollars from \nbeing wasted.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I oppose this bill, which represents an effort by \npoliticians to overrule expert scientists in deciding which scientific \ngrants the NSF should fund.\n  In defense of their misguided effort, some of my colleagues like to \npick a grant and poke fun at it or trivialize it or simply state that, \nin their opinion, it is not worth funding.\n  One of the grants that has been singled out is entitled Participant \nSupport for the Zero Emissions Category of the Clean Snowmobile \nChallenge.\n  Snowmobiles are ideal modes of transportation in extreme polar \nlocations. This grant funded the Clean Snowmobile Challenge in which \nstudents formed teams to engineer a lower emissions snowmobile.\n  Engineering competitions are both an important proving ground for new \ntechnologies and an incredible opportunity for students to engage in \nreal-world engineering challenges.\n  My colleagues frequently talk up the importance of STEM competitions. \nThe Science, Space, and Technology Committee has held entire full \ncommittee hearings on that very topic. Now some of my same colleagues \nwould ridicule an engineering competition just because it might have a \nclimate change benefit.\n  I hope all of my colleagues here today agree with me that encouraging \nand, certainly, promoting our next generation of engineers is \ndefinitely in the national interest, even when it results in less \npollution.\n  This grant, singled out for ridicule by some in the majority, is just \nanother example of why we should be concerned about the intent of this \nlegislation.\n  I would also like to point out that I strongly believe that the \ncurrent gold standard merit-review process works and that we should not \nbe politicizing science.\n  The sheer number of amendments to this legislation demonstrates the \nflawed methodology of trying to define which research is in the \nnational interest.\n  I think all of the Members who offered amendments to this section \nwould agree that important priorities have been left out. Personally, I \nbelieve we have unacceptably overlooked clean drinking water and \nclimate change.\n  I offered an amendment with Congressman Kildee that would expand the \npriority of advancement of health and welfare to include clean drinking \nwater explicitly. Unfortunately, this amendment was not made in order.\n  As we have seen in the news recently out of Flint, Michigan, we have \ntaken our drinking water infrastructure for granted for decades. This \nneglect and lack of investment has caused serious public health issues.\n  We need to invest more, but we should not invest in a 20th or, in \nsome cases, in a 19th century drinking water system.\n  A 21st century economy requires a 21st century infrastructure, but \nthat cannot happen unless it is coupled with the critical research that \nwill help us improve the construction, the operation, and the \nmaintenance of our water systems. Our Nation's future public health and \neconomic development are counting on it.\n  Clean drinking water is one of many important priorities not listed \nin this legislation. However, beyond missing important priorities, I am \nconcerned that this legislation will limit critical research.\n  The exciting part of research is that, at the start, we do not know \nwhat we will find; so, we cannot accurately predict ahead of time all \nof the implications the research will have on specific national \npriorities. Instead, we should invest and encourage high-risk, high-\nreward research.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Here are some more reasons why we need this bill, and these are some \nmore examples of how taxpayers' dollars have been spent: $200,000 to \ntour Europe for an overview of the Turkish fashion veil industry; $1.5 \nmillion to study pasture management in Mongolia; $735,000 for the \nAmerican Bar Association to follow young lawyers' careers; $920,000 to \nstudy textile making in Iceland during the Viking era; $164,000 to \nstudy Chinese immigration to Italy in 1900.\n  There are dozens and dozens of more examples.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nWeber) who is the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Chairman \nSmith's bill, H.R. 3293. At a time when budget constraints and the \ndeficit loom large and ominous, why in the world would anyone object to \nmore transparency and accountability? Can anyone explain that to me? I \ndidn't think so.\n  Here is how some of our hardworking taxpayer money is being spent.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have a list of 41 studies and programs that, if \ntaxpayers knew, they would rise up and revolt.\n  Some of the more notable are:\n  $227,000 to review animal photos in National Geographic magazine. \n(what baboon thought that up?)\n  $350,000 to study human-set fires in New Zealand in the 1800s. (the \nmain ``human set fire'' here is our taxpayer dollars being burned)\n  $200,000 to tour Europe for an overview of the Turkish fashion-veil \nindustry. (I am reminded that fashion is a form of ugliness so bad, it \nhas to be changed about every 6 months!)\n  $735,000 for the American Bar Association to follow young lawyers' \ncareers (3 awards).\n  $920,000 to study textile-making in Iceland during the Viking era (2 \nawards).\n  $50,000 to support STEM education in Sri Lanka.\n  $164,000 to study Chinese immigration to Italy (1900 to present).\n  $20,000 to study stress among people from lowland Bolivia (one of 12 \nawards).\n  $147,000 to analyze fishing practices at Lake Victoria, Africa. \n(Heck: all you gotta do is come down to my district in Galveston TX and \nwe'll show you how to analyze fishing practices for a lot less and you \ncan spend that money in our country!)\n  $147,000 to study international marriages between citizens of France \nand Madagascar.\n  $50,000 to study civil lawsuits in colonial Peru (1600-1700 AD).\n  $250,000 to survey public attitudes about the Senate filibuster rule.\n  $300,000 to study law firms in Silicon Valley.\n  $170,000 to study basket weaving among Alaskan native peoples (2 \nawards). Perhaps that's what folks think Congress is majoring in.\n  $276,000 to study the pre-history of Chiapas, Mexico.\n\n[[Page H681]]\n\n  $246,000 to study migration and adoption between Peru and Spain.\n  $134,000 to study Late Bronze Age metallurgy in the Southern Urals, \nRussia.\n  $195,000 to contrast the histories of Patagonian and Amazonian \nnational parks.\n  $281,000 to analyze the history of Izapa, Mexico.\n  $136,000 to study life/history transitions among indigenous people of \nnorthern Argentina.\n  $27,000 to study Mayan wooden architecture and salt industry (600-900 \nAD).\n  $92,000 to study Mexico's public vehicle registration system.\n  $373,000 to study Chinese kinship, women's labor and economy (1600-\n2000 AD).\n  $152,000 to analyze accountability and transparency in China's dairy \nindustry.\n  $300,000 to study Cyprus during the Bronze Age (2 awards).\n  $226,000 to study cultural dynamics in western Turkey.\n  $119,000 to coordinate an international archeological project in the \nS. American Andes.\n  $300,000 to produce an experimental dance program about nature and \nphysics.\n  $516,000 to help amateurs create a video game--``Relive Prom Night.''\n  $200,000 to devise social media algorithms for ``Truthy.com,'' a \nwebsite aimed at censoring political speech by Tea Party members, \nconservatives, etc.\n  $605,000 to travel and study why people around the world cheat on \ntheir taxes.\n  $193,000 to study human fish consumption in Tanzania (300-1500 AD).\n  $221,000 to study use of ochre pigment for painting in Stone Age \nKenya.\n  $101,000 to pay for American psychologists to international \nconferences.\n  $250,000 to educate local TV meteorologists about climate change (2 \nawards).\n  $38,000 to consider whether livestock herding families in rural, \nundeveloped areas have more children in response to herd growth, or if \nincreased family size drives herd growth.\n  $193,000 to study human fish consumption in Tanzania (1300-1500 AD).\n  $38,000 to study prehistoric rabbit hunting on the Iberian Peninsula.\n  $1.8 million to study the potential of commercial fish farming at \nLake Victoria, Africa.\n  $330,000 to study the careers of 2,500 new lawyers in Russia.\n  $1.5 million to study pasture management in Mongolia.\n  Mr. Chairman, some of the more notable are:\n  $227,000 to review animal photos in National Geographic magazine. \nWhat baboon thought that up?\n  $350,000 to study human-set fires in New Zealand in the 1800s. The \nonly thing being set on fire here is taxpayers' dollars.\n  $200,000 to tour Europe for an overview of the Turkish fashion veil \nindustry. I am reminded what a friend of mine says. He says fashion is \na form of ugliness so bad that we have to change it every 6 months, and \nyet we want to study it over in another country.\n  $147,000 to analyze fishing practices at Lake Victoria, Africa. Heck, \nfolks, if y'all come on down to Galveston, Texas, we will show y'all \nhow to fish and analyze that, and you can spend money in our country.\n  $170,000 to study basket weaving among Alaskan Native peoples. Is it \nany wonder that most of Americans think Congress must major in basket \nweaving?\n  These are just some of the more notable ones, Mr. Chairman. I could \ngo on through the 41 on the list. For example, $330,000 to study the \ncareers of 2,500 new lawyers in Russia. It is not that we don't have \nenough lawyers over here in America; now we are concerned about the \nones in Russia.\n  I could go on and on, Mr. Chairman. I just want to simply say, I urge \nmy colleagues to support transparency and accountability on behalf of \nour constituents and taxpayers. After all, they are paying the freight \nfor this stuff. Shouldn't we be open and accountable to them?\n  I commend Chairman Smith for his bill and for putting hardworking \ntaxpaying Americans first.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes \nto the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I rise to voice my strong opposition to H.R. \n3293, the legislation of my friend, Chairman Lamar Smith, the so-called \nScientific Research in the National Interest Act.\n  I understand the genesis of this bill: Mr. Smith's dismay at some of \nthe titles of the National Science Foundation's funded research.\n  This bill is the wrong approach to addressing the very occasional \nmisuse of NSF grants, and it represents classic short-term thinking.\n  I am a businessman, and I know of no one in the business community \nwho wants politicians or government to decide business winners or \nlosers.\n  Of course, none of us, Democrat or Republican, believe that \npoliticians should be making science decisions either. I believe \nRepresentative Bill Foster is the only Ph.D. scientist in the House, \nand the rest of us don't qualify.\n  By proclaiming the seven definitions of what science is in the \nnational interest, we politicians are, in fact, deciding what is worthy \nof scientific research. By the way, no one on this side yet has raised \nany objections to the transparency or the accountability of the \nNational Science Foundation. That completely mischaracterizes our \nobjections.\n  These standards sound constructive and benign--increased economic \nactivity, advancement of health and welfare, support for the national \ndefense, et cetera--but only one of the seven definitions even mentions \nscience. The last one says for the ``promotion of the progress of \nscience for the United States,'' whatever that means.\n  Where, oh, where is the commitment to basic research, the kind of \nfundamental research that I know all of us value?\n  Listen to all the funny names that would have sounded especially \nfunny at the time: Would Einstein's 1905 papers on special relativity, \non the photoelectric effect, and on Brownian motion even qualify under \nthe seven definitions? How about Niels Bohr's research on quantum \nmechanics? How about Murray Gell-Mans' work on particle physics in \nquarks? How about Rosalind Franklin's work on the crystallography of \nDNA?\n  My college roommate spent 4 years at Berkeley, 1972 to 1976, studying \nsomething called Roman spectroscopy. He had no idea what it would do. \nToday we call them MRIs.\n  That is the whole point of basic research. We don't know where it \nwill lead. We don't know that it is in the national interest. It just \nadds to our knowledge.\n  On the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, we reveled in the \nNASA presentation of the Pluto photographs. How does our New Horizons \nmission to Pluto possibly qualify under the seven definitions of the \nnational interest?\n  I respect that the chair of the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee wants the NSF funds expended into legitimate scientific \nresearch. I agree. Mr. Smith used the phrase ``demonstrably in the \nnational interest.'' How could we definitely know, when all of basic \nresearch is, by definition, long term rather than short term?\n  Let's let the scientists decide and oppose this well-meaning but ill-\nconceived legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  To those who are on the other side, I really again encourage them to \nread the bill. It is three pages long. There is nothing in the bill \nthat says we are going to tell the scientists what to do or think. It \nis very clear, in the examples that the gentleman just gave, that all \nof those are connected to the national interest. If a scientist can't \nexplain that, then there are greater problems than we might expect.\n  The other point is, to repeat what I said a while ago, if you oppose \nthe national interest standard, you are too late. The National Science \nFoundation Director has incorporated the national interest standard in \nthe current guidelines. If you want to oppose the bill because you \ndon't want to make the standard permanent, that is your prerogative, \nbut don't oppose the national interest standard that is in the current \nguidelines.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nLipinski), who is an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I want to start where we all have \nagreement. I think everyone would acknowledge that they want research \nfunded by the NSF to be in the Nation's interest. We agree the Nation's \ninterest is furthered by promoting scientific progress. That is \ncertainly one of the principal reasons that I have served on the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee for 12 years.\n\n[[Page H682]]\n\n  We also have some disagreements. I have respectfully disagreed with \nthe chairman over his criticisms of some NSF grants. At a hearing in \nNovember of 2013, I spoke out strongly against a very different NSF \nbill, and I believe some people are confusing that bill with this bill \nthat we have here today.\n  If you read this bill's text, I don't believe you can find anything \nthat could undermine the merit review process at the NSF. In fact, I \nthink this bill will help protect the NSF from future attacks and make \nthe Foundation stronger.\n  H.R. 3293 says research funded by the NSF must be worthy of Federal \nfunding and in the national interest. The national interest is defined \nby a series of broad criteria, one of which is that a grant have the \npotential to promote ``the progress of science for the United States.'' \nIt is difficult to conceive of research that would be recommended by an \nNSF peer review panel that would not meet that standard. Thus, it is \ndifficult for me to see how this standard could harm the work that the \nFoundation does.\n  The bill clearly states that it is the job of the Foundation to \ndetermine what is worthy of funding, not politicians, and that nothing \nin the bill would alter NSF's blunted peer review process, which we \nagree is the gold standard for funding scientific research. As a \nscientist myself, I believe this is as it should be.\n  Nevertheless, there have been suggestions that this bill is \npoliticians creating a political filter on what research should be \nfunded, but it is striking how similar this language is to the broader \nimpacts criterion that we advanced in a bipartisan fashion in the 2010 \nCOMPETES Reauthorization Act. There was no concern at the time about \nthat language being a political filter, nor was there any concern that \nbroader impacts be applied to a portfolio of grants, rather than \nindividual awards.\n  Furthermore, at the time, the Foundation already had broader impact \ncriterion as part of their review process, yet this committee still \nacted to put the criteria in statute. And the ease with which NSF has \nimplemented the broader impacts criteria suggests to me that they could \nimplement this language without changing the nature of the research \nthey fund.\n  There is some concern that this bill would cause the Foundation to \nbecome more risk averse or applied, not funding breakthrough grants \nlike the one that started Google. So let's take a look at that grant.\n  The NSF funded the Stanford Integrated Digital Library Project in \n1994, and the research conducted through that grant, as well as other \nprivate and public support, including a graduate research fellowship \nfor Sergey Brin, led to the algorithms that were the intellectual basis \nof Google.\n  The purpose of that grant, as stated in the abstract, was ``to \ndevelop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and \n`universal' library, proving uniform access to the large number of \nemerging networked information sources and collections.'' Even putting \naside the emerging collections on the Web that could be impacted, that \ngrant clearly seemed to have the potential to promote the progress of \ncomputer science and be worthy of Federal funding and, thus, would have \nbeen funded under the provisions of this bill.\n  Indeed, the debate around this bill has focused less on the language \nin the bill and more on the concern of intentions behind the bill. As I \nhave said, I have disagreed with recent criticisms of the NSF. Time has \nshown us that some of William Proxmire's Golden Fleece Awardees have \nproven to be golden geese, as Ranking Member Johnson mentioned in her \nopening statement.\n  I think much of the criticism of grants comes from misunderstandings. \nThis bill can help prevent misunderstandings or at least give NSF a \nbetter ability to defend its work. This will come from the requirement \nthat abstracts be rewritten to more plainly explain the purpose of a \ngrant.\n  I applaud the NSF for steps they have already taken to better explain \nwhy scientific research is valuable and to better explain why promoting \nthe progress of science is in the Nation's interest and worthy of \nFederal funds. This policy and this bill will further help the NSF \ndefend worthwhile grants.\n  All of us may never see eye to eye on what types of research should \nbe supported by the Federal Government. For example, I see more value \nin social science and geoscience than many of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, and I never miss an opportunity to point that \nout.\n  But far from acting as a political filter, I believe this bill will \nhelp the NSF continue to be the world's preeminent foundation in \nfunding scientific research, and that is why I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this bill.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I want to point out that this grant was mentioned earlier in remarks. \nIn defense of their misguided efforts, some of our colleagues like to \npick certain grants and make fun of them--just as has just been said--\nand then say they are not worth funding.\n  One of the grants that my colleagues like to pick on is a grant \nentitled, ``Ecosystems Resilience to Human Impacts: Ecological \nConsequences of Early Human-Set Fires in New Zealand.'' It may be easy \nfor some of my colleagues to question why the Federal Government should \nspend money on studying fires that were set in a foreign country \nhundreds of years ago. Apparently, it is harder for them to spend 5 \nminutes reading the abstract.\n  It turns out that those early settlers in New Zealand caused the loss \nof more than 40 percent of the forests in just decades. By studying the \nlong-term effect on the ecosystem impacts of those long-ago fires, we \ncan gain knowledge to help natural resource managers make smarter \ndecisions about how to mitigate, prepare for, and respond to massive \nwildfires in our own country. It is right in the public interest.\n  Just to put an economic figure to this, in 2012, the United States \nspent $2 billion to suppress over 65,000 wildland fires that burned \nover 9 million acres.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  It sounds like this is of national interest to study the long term \nimpact of fires that were set so many years ago. I choose to stand with \nthe scientists when it comes to science. For that reason, I really \nuphold this misguided bill.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have one more Member on the way \nto the floor to speak, and then I am prepared to close.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I have no further \nrequests for time.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Babin), who is on his way to the podium right now.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3293, \nthe Scientific Research in the National Interest Act.\n  The National Science Foundation spends $7 billion in taxpayer funds, \nmost of which goes to important research that helps advance America's \ncompetitive edge. However, the NSF has funded far too many wasteful \nprojects that are not in the national interest.\n  Here are several examples: $1.5 million to study pasture management \nin Mongolia; $147,000 to study international marriages between the \ncitizens of France and Madagascar; $20,000 to study stress among the \npeople of Bolivia.\n  While the NSF has begun to implement some new internal policies that \nare intended to increase transparency and accountability, this bill \nwill help strengthen those reforms and make them permanent.\n  The Director of the NSF even testified before the House Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee that the policy of H.R. 3293 is \n``compatible with the NSF's internal guidelines.''\n  I highly commend Chairman Lamar Smith for his leadership on this \nimportant bill, and I encourage my colleagues to very much support it.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, once again, I stand \nwith the scientists. I also stand with the President's potential \nstatement. If this bill is presented to the President, scientists have \nrecommended that he veto it.\n  I stand with the scientists again and ask the people to vote against \nthis bill.\n\n[[Page H683]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of my \ntime.\n  I am glad that the gentlewoman brought up the administration's \nposition on this bill because it is absolutely no surprise.\n  When President Obama was elected, he promised that this would be the \nmost transparent administration in history. It has turned out to be the \nexact opposite.\n  Opposing a bill to bring more transparency to government, more \naccountability to the National Science Foundation is a perfect natural \nfor this administration.\n  Let me give you some more examples. According to an analysis of \nFederal data by the Associated Press, the Obama administration set new \nrecords 2 years in a row for denying the media access to government \nfiles.\n  More than that, in an unprecedented letter to several congressional \ncommittees, 47 inspectors general, who are the official watchdogs of \nFederal agencies, complained that the Justice Department, EPA, and \nothers consistently obstruct their work by blocking or delaying access \nto critical information.\n  This is the record, this is the history of an administration who \nopposes this bill. Again, a bill that is going to bring transparency \nand accountability to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. Chairman, it seems obvious to most of us and to most Americans \nthat taxpayer-funded grants should be in the national interest, but let \nme address some of the false arguments that have been presented by \nMembers on the other side.\n  Opponents claim that the bill interferes with the merit-review \nprocess for approving grants. This is false. The three-page bill \nclearly states ``nothing in this section shall be construed as altering \nthe Foundation's intellectual merit or broader impacts criteria for \nevaluating grant applications.''\n  Scientists still make the decisions. They just do not get a blank \ncheck written by the taxpayer. They need to be accountable to the \nAmerican people by showing that their proposals are in the national \ninterest.\n  What the bill does do is ensure that the results of the peer-review \nprocess are transparent and that the broader societal impact of the \nresearch is better communicated to the public. This makes it clear how \nthe grant is in the national interest.\n  Another common falsehood spread by opponents of the bill is that it \nmeans research projects will be judged by the title as to whether or \nnot they are worthy of Federal funding. Again, this is false. The bill \nactually corrects a past problem with some NSF-funded grants.\n  Often, the title and an incomprehensible summary were all that was \npublicly available about a research grant. The bill ensures that a \nproject's benefits are clearly communicated to earn the public support \nand trust. Researchers should embrace the opportunity to better explain \nto the American people the potential value of their work.\n  Finally, opponents have claimed that the bill discourages high-risk, \nhigh-reward research. Once again, this is false. Research with the \npotential to be groundbreaking is almost always worthy of Federal \nfunding and in the national interest.\n  Basic research, by its very nature, is uncertain regarding outcomes \nand results, but payoffs to society, quality of life, and standards of \nliving can be transformative.\n  Research that has the potential to address some of society's greatest \nchallenges is what the NSF should be funding.\n  Improving computing and cybersecurity, advancing new energy sources, \ndiscovering new medicines and cures, and creating advanced materials \nare just some of the ways that NSF-funded research can help create \nmillions of new jobs and transform society in a positive way.\n  On the other hand, how does spending $700,000 on a climate change \nmusical encourage breakthrough research? There may well be good answers \nto those questions, but we weren't able to come up with them, and \nneither was the National Science Foundation.\n  When the NSF funds projects that don't meet such standards, there is \nless money to support worthwhile research that keeps our country at the \nforefront of innovation.\n  Both the National Science Foundation Director and the National \nScience Board have endorsed the principle that NSF should be more \naccountable in its grant-funding decisions.\n  Why would Congress oppose such a commonsense requirement? Why do \nopponents of this bill think they know better than the NSF Director, \nwho has approved the national interest standard in the current \nguidelines?\n  It is just inconceivable to me that an elected U.S. Representative \nwould oppose requiring government grants funded by the U.S. taxpayer to \nbe spent in the national interest. Whose money do they think the NSF \nspends on these frivolous research grants? The taxpayers should know \nhow their hard-earned dollars are, in fact, being spent.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to bolster transparency and accountability, \nprotect American taxpayers, and promote good, fundamental science and \nbasic research.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois who spoke \njust a minute ago. He made a really, really good point that I want to \nrepeat, and that is that this bill is actually going to help strengthen \nthe National Science Foundation because it is going to give it more \ncredibility and taxpayers are going to have more assurance that their \nhard-earned money is being spent on worthwhile projects that are, in \nfact, in the national interest.\n  Mr. Chairman, taxpayers spend $6 billion; $6 billion is being spent \nby the National Science Foundation. They only approve one out of five \ngrant requests.\n  Shouldn't those grant proposals be in the national interest? \nShouldn't they be about breakthrough technology, technological \ninventions? Shouldn't they increase productivity in America? I think \nthat is exactly how the taxpayers' dollars should be spent.\n  Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Mooney of West Virginia). The gentleman from \nTexas has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, what I would like to do is to give \nmore examples of how the taxpayers' dollars actually should not be \nspent. These are grants that have been approved by the National Science \nFoundation in the past.\n  Again, I want to give the current Director full credit. She has \nchanged the standards. She has implemented the national interest as a \npart of their guidelines. But if we don't make these guidelines \npermanent, this is what could happen.\n  This is how the taxpayers' dollars have been spent:\n  $250,000 to survey public attitudes about the Senate filibuster rule;\n  $276,000 to study the prehistory of Chiapas, Mexico;\n  $246,000 to study migration and adoption between Peru and Spain;\n  $136,000 to study life/history transitions among indigenous people of \nnorthern Argentina;\n  $27,000 to study Mayan wooden architecture and the salt industry;\n  $152,000 to analyze accountability and transparency in China's dairy \nindustry;\n  $300,000 to study Cyprus during the Bronze Age;\n  $226,000 to study cultural dynamics in western Turkey;\n  $119,000 to coordinate an international archaeological project in the \nSouth American Andes;\n  $60,000 to study the Gamo caste system in southwestern Ethiopia;\n  $300,000 to produce an experimental dance program about nature and \nphysics.\n  Speaking of that, I think there was another $516,000 to help amateurs \ncreate a video game, $516,000 to help amateurs create a video game \ncalled ``Relive Prom Night.''\n  There is no national interest that I am aware of. If there is, they \nsure ought to point it out before we ask the taxpayers to spend half a \nmillion dollars on reliving prom night.\n  Let's see.\n  $605,000 to travel and study why people around the world cheat on \ntheir taxes;\n  $38,000 to consider whether livestock herding families expand in \nresponse to herd growth;\n  $193,000 to study human fish consumption in Tanzania from 1300 to \n1500 AD;\n  $250,000 to educate local TV meteorologists;\n  $275,000 to study tourism in northern Norway;\n\n[[Page H684]]\n\n  $450,000 to create the Climate Change Narrative Game;\n  $131,000 for a 1-day program about climate change education using \ngiant-screen TVs;\n  $430,000 to study Irish climate, environment, and political change in \nthe past 2,000 years;\n  $2.5 million to create dioramas for the Oakland Museum of California;\n  $590,000 to support private groups advocating drastic climate change;\n  $289,000 to study how colonialism and climate change threaten the \nsurvival of Arctic peoples in Russia;\n  $549,000 to--I am sorry. My time is about expired, and I appreciate \nthat.\n  I could go on and give dozens and dozens of examples, but I think it \nis clear that this is not how the American taxpayers' dollars should be \nspent.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3293, \nthe so-called Scientific Research in the National Interest Act, a bill \nthat would actually hinder the National Science Foundation's (NSF) \nability to meet the dynamic demands of science and provide resources \nacross all scientific disciplines without political manipulations. This \nbill is simply another in a line of Republican efforts to politicize \nscience and jeopardize discovery and innovation.\n  The NSF engages in remarkable, ground-breaking work. We must continue \nto support this organization and ensure that America remains a world-\nwide leader in scientific advances. To that end, I cosponsored a number \nof amendments with my colleague from Virginia, Mr. Beyer, that would \nallow NSF scientists to further our understanding of climate and \nenvironmental science. Unfortunately my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have displayed such open hostility towards climate science \nand research that they won't allow a vote on these amendments.\n  While I believe it's important that the NSF hold itself accountable \nregarding the research it funds, politicizing scientific research is \nshortsighted and can damage our ability to compete in the world \neconomy. H.R. 3293 would interfere with ongoing efforts at NSF to \nbetter quantify and communicate the value of the research it funds.\n  Mr. Chair, I am also concerned that this legislation will have a \nchilling effect on many of the scientists at NSF and throughout our \nscientific community. This bill would force scientists to second-guess \ntheir research based on political whims and require them to justify all \ntheir actions according to short-term returns, stifling high-risk, \nhigh-reward research and innovation across all fields. We must not \nsquelch creativity, critical thinking, and the open exchange of ideas.\n  Federal agencies like NIH and NOAA are headquartered in my district \nand I represent countless federally funded scientists who are advancing \nknowledge, discovering cures, and developing innovative technologies. I \nam committed to ensuring that the NSF and all of our research agencies \nhave the resources they need without being subject to superfluous \npolitical tests. The valuable work done by our scientists and \nresearchers at NSF and other institutions not only leads to the \ndevelopment of new innovations, but also enables our Nation to attract \nand retain the top research talent in the world. In order to continue \nto compete, we need sustained investments free from political \ninterference.\n  I strongly oppose this bill and any other efforts to needlessly \npoliticize scientific research.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Scientific Research in the \n     National Interest Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Standard for Award of Grants.--The National Science \n     Foundation shall award Federal funding for basic research and \n     education in the sciences through a new research grant or \n     cooperative agreement only if an affirmative determination is \n     made by the Foundation under subsection (b) and written \n     justification relating thereto is published under subsection \n     (c).\n       (b) Determination.--A determination referred to in \n     subsection (a) is a justification by the responsible \n     Foundation official as to how the research grant or \n     cooperative agreement promotes the progress of science in the \n     United States, consistent with the Foundation mission as \n     established in the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1861 et seq.), and further--\n       (1) is worthy of Federal funding; and\n       (2) is in the national interest, as indicated by having the \n     potential to achieve--\n       (A) increased economic competitiveness in the United \n     States;\n       (B) advancement of the health and welfare of the American \n     public;\n       (C) development of an American STEM workforce that is \n     globally competitive;\n       (D) increased public scientific literacy and public \n     engagement with science and technology in the United States;\n       (E) increased partnerships between academia and industry in \n     the United States;\n       (F) support for the national defense of the United States; \n     or\n       (G) promotion of the progress of science for the United \n     States.\n       (c) Written Justification.--Public announcement of each \n     award of Federal funding described in subsection (a) shall \n     include a written justification from the responsible \n     Foundation official as to how a grant or cooperative \n     agreement meets the requirements of subsection (b).\n       (d) Implementation.--A determination under subsection (b) \n     shall be made after a research grant or cooperative agreement \n     proposal has satisfied the Foundation's reviews for Merit and \n     Broader Impacts. Nothing in this section shall be construed \n     as altering the Foundation's intellectual merit or broader \n     impacts criteria for evaluating grant applications.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except \nthose printed in part B of House Report 114-420. Each such amendment \nmay be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member \ndesignated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable \nfor the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by \nthe proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and \nshall not be subject to a demand for division of the question.\n  The Chair understands amendment No. 1 will not be offered.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-420.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment \nat the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 15, through page 4, line 15, amend subsection \n     (b) to read as follows:\n       (b) Determination.--A determination referred to in \n     subsection (a) is a justification by the responsible \n     Foundation official as to how the research grant or \n     cooperative agreement--\n       (1) by itself, or by contributing to a portfolio of \n     research in that field or across fields, is in the national \n     interest as reflected in the National Science Foundation Act \n     of 1950 (42 U.S.C. 1861 et seq), namely to promote the \n     progress of science, to advance the national health, \n     prosperity and welfare, and to secure the national defense; \n     and\n       (2) is worthy of Federal funding, as demonstrated by having \n     met the merit review criteria of the Foundation.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, my colleague from \nTexas, the chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \nhas stated many times that H.R. 3293 is consistent with the policy \nannounced by NSF in January 2015.\n  He also frequently cites a year old comment by NSF Director Dr. \nCordova about this bill. However, it is one thing to use such vague \nstatements in defense of this bill; it is quite another thing to look \ndirectly at the NSF policy issued by Dr. Cordova to see what it \nactually says.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  I will quote directly from NSF's January 2015 policy:\n  The nontechnical component of the NSF award abstract must serve as a \npublic justification for NSF funding by articulating how the project \nserves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, to promote \nthe progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, \nand welfare; and to secure national defense.\n  As Dr. Holdren, the President's Science Adviser, said:\n  According to the clear wording and intent of the 1950 act that \ncreated the National Science Foundation, promoting the progress of \nscience through basic research is in the national interest.\n  Likewise, Dr. Cordova, in describing what she means by ``national \ninterest,''\n\n[[Page H685]]\n\npoints directly to the 1950 NSF mission statement. In her policy, there \nis no separate list defining national interest with criteria that, in \nfact, promotes more applied research, not basic research.\n  While the words ``promoting the progress of science'' appear in the \nbill before us, they do so only as an afterthought, in dead last place \nand added only after many versions of this bill.\n  Now that we all understand the National Science Foundation's actual \npolicy, I can briefly explain my amendment.\n  By tying the term ``national interest'' to the 1950 national \nstatement, my amendment brings the bill truly in line with the National \nScience Foundation's own policy for transparency and accountability.\n  My amendment also provides clarity to what we mean by the words \n``worthy of Federal funding,'' by stating that anything that has passed \nthe rigor of the National Science Foundation's peer-review process is \n``worthy of Federal funding.''\n  In short, my amendment fixes the underlying bill by removing \nrestrictions that may stifle high-risk basic research, and by taking \ndecisions about grant funding out of the hands of politicians and \nputting it back in the hands of scientists, where it belongs.\n  The National Science Foundation's 1950 mission statement, implemented \nthrough its gold standard merit-review process, has served science and \nthis Nation so well. Let's leave it intact by passing my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gentlewoman's \namendment, which undermines the bill and weakens accountability and \ntransparency.\n  First, the amendment seeks to dilute the bill's requirement that the \ngrant must be worthy of Federal funding. It is difficult to understand \nwhy anyone would have objections to requiring that a research grant be \nworthy of taxpayer support. Worthy means: having adequate or great \nmerit, character, or value; and commendable excellence or merit; \ndeserving.\n  The opposite of worthy of Federal funding are awards of taxpayer \nmoney to frivolous, low-priority projects, like producing a climate \nchange musical, creating a voicemail game, or studying tourism in \nNorway.\n  One would think that fundamental standards like ``worthy of Federal \nfunding'' and ``in the national interest'' would already be embedded in \nthe standards the National Science Foundation uses to evaluate \nthousands of grant applications and decide which ones should receive $6 \nbillion in basic research grants each year. From the Science, Space, \nand Technology Committee's review of past NSF grants, we have learned \nthat this is not always the case.\n  This amendment eliminates the requirement that each grant be worthy \nof Federal funding. It asserts that any grant approved by NSF through \nits merit selection system will be considered worthy of Federal \nfunding. With this change, every NSF-funded project would be considered \nworthy of Federal funding, no matter how absurd.\n  With this amendment, Congress would effectively abnegate its \nresponsibility to ensure that NSF spends taxpayer dollars only on \nprojects worthy of Federal funding.\n  The underlying bill does not interfere with the National Science \nFoundation's merit selection process. I have already quoted from the \nbill twice tonight. It only requires that NSF be transparent and \nexplain in writing and in nontechnical terms why each research project \nthat receives public funds is in the national interest. Taxpayers \ndeserve this information. It is their money.\n  Moreover, in order to maintain an increased public support for vital \ninvestment in basic research, NSF must be transparent and accountable \nand explain why every scientific investment deserves to receive hard-\nearned tax dollars.\n  NSF Director France Cordova and her team at NSF understand this. That \nis why the NSF is implementing new policies to make NSF grant-making \nmore transparent and understandable for the American people.\n  These policies acknowledge the primary importance of national \ninterest in awarding tax dollars. In fact, during her testimony before \nthe Science, Space, and Technology Committee last year, Dr. Cordova \ndescribed this national interest act and NSF's new transparency \npolicies as consistent and fully compatible with each other.\n  I would like to remind everyone that it is not Congress' or the NSF's \nmoney. It is the American people's money.\n  The amendment offered by the ranking member seeks to change the \nsection of the bill that requires NSF to accompany public announcement \nof every grant award with a nontechnical explanation of the award's \nscientific merit and national interest.\n  My concern is that the proposed amendment would create a loophole \nthrough which blocks of hundreds of grants in a particular area of \nscience would be justified by just one general statement. This is the \nopposite of accountability and transparency.\n  I strongly oppose the amendment for these reasons.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this does not do \nany more than what was intended under the law. It leaves it in the \nhands of the peer review board and not the politicians.\n  It does nothing to make this bill worse. In fact, it improves it so \nthat it can meet the charter of this Congress in doing its work.\n  Every grant that goes out of the National Science Foundation is peer-\nreviewed in a system that was set up 60 years ago. It has worked well. \nWe have gained great research. I don't think that making sure that the \npoliticians have something to say about it makes it any better. It \nmakes it worse.\n  I ask for the adoption of my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, the National Science Foundation \nDirector and the National Science Board have both expressed and \nendorsed a principle that NSF should be more transparent and \naccountable in its grant funding decisions. In fact, the NSF has \nalready incorporated the national interest standard in their \nguidelines.\n  This amendment creates loopholes and dilutes the intent of the bill--\na bill that NSF Director France Cordova has testified: is very \ncompatible with the new internal NSF guidelines and with the mission \nstatement of the National Science Foundation.\n  I ask my colleagues to say ``yes'' to accountability and transparency \nand ``no'' to the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded \nvote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-420.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 22, strike ``and''.\n       Page 3, line 23, redesignate paragraph (2) as paragraph \n     (3).\n       Page 3, after line 22, insert the following:\n       (2) is consistent with established and widely accepted \n     scientific methods applicable to the field of study of \n     exploration; and\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member, \nMs. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, for her leadership. I also want to \nthank Mr. Smith for his chairmanship of the committee.\n\n[[Page H686]]\n\n  I have known the commitment to science that so many Members have. I \nhope that my amendment reinforces the emphasis that we have had with \nrespect to science.\n  Scientists should control the direction and guidance of our research. \nThe National Science Foundation does simply that. I hope that both of \nmy amendments contribute to that premise, and I would like to \nacknowledge the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment seeks to improve H.R. 3293 by ensuring that \nNSF-funded research, as it has been, remains consistent with \nestablished and widely accepted scientific methods applicable to the \nstudy of exploration.\n  In conducting experiments or research in new areas of inquiry, grant \nrecipients would now follow protocols that ensure that the outcomes of \nresearch are able to be reproduced by other scientists or researchers.\n  I have always believed that science is the work that creates the \nultimate work in decades and centuries to come. Having served on the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee some years back, I used to \nalways say: science is the work of the 21st century. If you create in \nscience, innovation, products, and research, you create opportunities \nfor jobs and products to be sold. This is what good science is all \nabout and why basic research relies on the scientific method in the \nroutine practice of scientists and researchers around the world.\n  I fully believe that the National Science Foundation gets it. That is \nwhat their underlying work is about.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment will support the promise that basic \nresearch is conducted with the expectation that good science should be \nthe underlying goal. History has shown that basic research often leads \nto results with the utmost beneficial consequences for society.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank Chairman Sessions and Ranking Member Slaughter for making the \nJackson Lee Amendment in order for consideration under H.R. 3293, the \n``Scientific Research in the National Interest Act.''\n  My thanks and appreciation to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member \nJohnson for their support of this amendment and their staffs for \nworking with my staff to ensure the amendment reflects a goal we all \nshare.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment improves H.R. 3293, by ensuring that NSF \nfunded research, as it has been, remains consistent with established \nand widely accepted scientific methods applicable to the study of \nexploration.\n  In conducting experiments or research in new areas of inquiry, grant \nrecipients would now follow protocols that ensure that the outcomes of \nresearch are able to be reproduced by other scientists or researchers.\n  This is what good science is all about and this is why basic research \nrelies on the scientific method in the routine practice of scientists \nand researchers around the world.\n  In 1950, Congress passed the National Science Foundation Act to \n``promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, \nprosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense; in \naddition to other purposes'' by creating the National Science \nFoundation.\n  The Act authorized and directed the Foundation to ``initiate and \nsupport basic scientific research and programs to strengthen the \npotential of scientific research and education programs at all levels \nin the mathematical, physical, medical, biological, social, and other \nsciences.''\n  The 1950 Act also authorized and directed NSF to fund applied \nscientific and engineering research.\n  One hundred years of basic scientific research has revealed its \nvalue, exemplified in the advances that helped our nation win World War \nII and allowed Congress to appreciate science as the gateway to the \npre-eminent economic global success the nation could achieve.\n  This Jackson Lee Amendment would support the promise that basic \nresearch is conducted with the expectation that good science should be \nthe underlying goal.\n  History has shown that basic research often leads to results with the \nutmost beneficial consequences for society; although, at the time that \nbasic research is conducted, it may be impossible to predict how it \nwill benefit the nation or the world.\n  One such example is the Genomic studies of nematode worms that led to \nthe discovery of genes that ultimately control cell death; this study \nin turn opened the avenues of discovery for new treatment possibilities \nfor cancer and Alzheimer's Disease.\n  Additionally, basic research on atomic physics led to the development \nof the atomic clocks that now enable the highly precise Global \nPositioning System (GPS) used to guide commercial aircraft to their \ndestinations.\n  In 2014, due to a global embrace of scientific research the world \nsaw:\n  The first landing of a space craft on the surface of a comet;\n  The discovery of a new fundamental particle, which provided \ninformation on the origin of the universe;\n  Development of the world's fastest supercomputer; and\n  A surge in research on plant biology that is uncovering new and \nbetter ways to meet global food needs.\n  Unfortunately none of these achievements were led by our nation's \nresearchers or scientists.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this Jackson Lee Amendment so that we \nmay make strides toward joining and surpassing our global competitors \nin the emerging scientific community.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthis amendment, but I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment offered by \nthe gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment requires that, in addition to the National Science \nFoundation making a determination that a grant is worthy of Federal \nfunding and in the national interest, the NSF must also determine that \nthe grant is: consistent with established and widely accepted \nscientific methods applicable to the field of study or exploration.\n  I agree that this is an important determination. Basic research \nfunded by taxpayers must have a sound scientific foundation.\n  Reproducibility--the ability of an entire experiment or study to be \nduplicated--especially by someone else working independently, is the \ngold standard in the scientific method.\n  NSF should ensure that the research it funds meets this gold standard \nso taxpayer dollars do not go to waste.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for her amendment, and I do support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentleman from Texas \nand the ranking member for their support.\n  With that, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-420.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 22, strike ``and''.\n       Page 3, line 23, redesignate paragraph (2) as paragraph \n     (3).\n       Page 3, after line 22, insert the following:\n       (2) is consistent with the definition of basic research as \n     it applies to the purpose and field of study; and\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I restate my earlier premise that \nscience is the work of the 21st century. Maybe we will be saying the \n22nd century. Because when you are innovative and do research, you \ncreate jobs and opportunities. This amendment establishes that basic \nresearch is in the national interest of the United States.\n  Let me suggest to you that we have a lot of universities in this \ncountry. When I travel, I always hear individuals seeking to come to be \ntaught in American institutions of higher education. It is because of \nthe creative thought and, in many instances, the research that is done, \nwhether in medicine or all the forms of science and\n\n[[Page H687]]\n\ntechnology, because we have a free-flowing basis upon which people can \nthink and invent. I want that to continue. I want the National Science \nFoundation to be at the cornerstone of that.\n  I will include in the Record an article titled, ``The Future \nPostponed.'' Why Declining Investment in Basic Research Threatens a \nU.S. Innovation Deficit.\n\n            [From the Massachusetts Institute of Technology]\n\n                          The Future Postponed\n\n\nWhy Declining Investment in Basic Research Threatens a U.S. Innovation \n                                Deficit\n\n   (A Report by the MIT Committee to Evaluate the Innovation Deficit)\n\n       2014 was a year of notable scientific highlights, \n     including:\n       the first landing on a comet, which has already shed \n     important light on the formation of the Earth;\n       the discovery of a new fundamental particle, which provides \n     critical information on the origin of the universe;\n       development of the world's fastest supercomputer;\n       a surge in research on plant biology that is uncovering new \n     and better ways to meet global food requirements.\n       None of these, however, were U.S.-led achievements. The \n     first two reflected 10-year, European-led efforts; the second \n     two are Chinese accomplishments, reflecting that nation's \n     emergence as a science and technology power. Hence the wide-\n     spread concern over a growing U.S. innovation deficit, \n     attributable in part to declining public investment in \n     research (see figure).\n       This report provides a number of tangible examples of \n     under-exploited areas of science and likely consequences in \n     the form of an innovation deficit, including:\n       opportunities with high potential for big payoffs in \n     health, energy, and high-tech industries;\n       fields where we risk falling behind in critical strategic \n     capabilities such as supercomputing, secure information \n     systems, and national defense technologies;\n       areas where national prestige is at stake, such as space \n     exploration, or where a lack of specialized U.S. research \n     facilities is driving key scientific talent to work overseas.\n       This introduction also cites examples of the benefits from \n     basic research that have helped to shape and maintain U.S. \n     economic power, as well as highlighting industry trends that \n     have made university basic research even more critical to \n     future national economic competitiveness.\n       Basic research is often misunderstood, because it often \n     seems to have no immediate payoff. Yet it was just such \n     federally-funded research into the fundamental working of \n     cells, intensified beginning with the ``War on Cancer'' in \n     1971, that led over time to a growing arsenal of \n     sophisticated new anti-cancer therapies--19 new drugs \n     approved by the U.S. FDA in the past 2 years. Do we want \n     similar progress on Alzheimer's, which already affects 5 \n     million Americans, more than any single form of cancer? Then \n     we should expand research in neurobiology, brain chemistry, \n     and the science of aging (see Alzheimer's Disease). The Ebola \n     epidemic in West Africa is a reminder of how vulnerable we \n     are to a wider pandemic of emergent viral diseases, because \n     of a lack of research on their biology; an even greater \n     public health threat looms from the rise of antibiotic \n     resistant bacteria right here at home, which, because \n     commercial incentives are lacking, only expanded university-\n     based research into new types of antibiotics can address (see \n     Infectious Disease).\n       America's emergence last year as the world's largest oil \n     producer has been justly celebrated as a milestone for energy \n     independence. But the roots of the fracking revolution stem \n     from federally-funded research--begun in the wake of the \n     first OPEC oil embargo 40 years ago--that led to directional \n     drilling technology, diamond drill bits tough enough to cut \n     shale, and the first major hydraulic fracturing experiments. \n     Do we also want the U.S. to be a leader in clean energy \n     technologies a few decades hence, when these will be needed \n     for large scale replacement of fossil energy sources, a huge \n     global market? Then now is when more investment in advanced \n     thin film solar cells, new battery concepts, and novel \n     approaches to fusion energy should begin (see Materials \n     Discovery and Processing, Batteries, Fusion Energy).\n       Some areas of research create opportunities of obvious \n     economic importance. Catalysis, for example, is already a \n     $500 billion industry in the United States alone and plays a \n     critical role in the manufacture of virtually every fuel, all \n     types of plastics, and many pharmaceuticals. Yet today's \n     catalysts are relatively inefficient and require high \n     temperatures compared to those (such as enzymes) that operate \n     in living things. So the potential payoff in both reduced \n     environmental impact and a powerful economic edge for \n     countries that invest in efforts to understand and replicate \n     these biological catalysts--as Germany and China already \n     are--could be huge (see Catalysis). The U.S. also lags in two \n     other key areas: developing advances in plant sciences that \n     can help meet growing world needs for food while supporting \n     U.S. agricultural exports, and the growing field of robotics \n     that is important not only for automated factories but for a \n     whole new era of automated services such as driverless \n     vehicles (see Plant Sciences and Robotics).\n       In an increasingly global and competitive world, where \n     knowledge is created and first applied has huge economic \n     consequences: some 50 years after the rise of Silicon Valley, \n     the U.S. still leads in the commercial application of \n     integrated circuits, advanced electronic devices, and \n     internet businesses. But foreseeable advances in optical \n     integrated circuits, where both Europe and Japan are \n     investing heavily, is likely to completely reshape the $300 \n     billion semiconductor industry that today is largely \n     dominated by U.S. companies (see Photonics). In this area and \n     other fields of science that will underlie the innovation \n     centers of the future, U.S. leadership or even \n     competitiveness is at risk. Synthetic biology--the ability to \n     redesign life in the lab--is another area that has huge \n     potential to transform bio-manufacturing and food production \n     and to create breakthroughs in healthcare--markets that might \n     easily exceed the size of the technology market. But it is EU \n     scientists that benefit from superior facilities and \n     dedicated funding and are leading the way (see Synthetic \n     Biology). Research progress in many such fields increasingly \n     depends on sophisticated modern laboratories and research \n     instruments, the growing lack of which in the U.S. is \n     contributing to a migration of top talent and research \n     leadership overseas.\n       Some areas of research are so strategically important that \n     for the U.S. to fall behind ought to be alarming. Yet Chinese \n     leadership in supercomputing--its Tianhe-2 machine at the \n     Chinese National University of Defense in Guangzhou has won \n     top ranking for the third year in a row and can now do \n     quadrillions of calculations per second--is just such a straw \n     in the wind. Another is our apparent and growing \n     vulnerability to cyberattacks of the type that have damaged \n     Sony, major banks, large retailers, and other major \n     companies. Ultimately, it will be basic research in areas \n     such as photonics, cybersecurity, and quantum computing \n     (where China is investing heavily) that determine leadership \n     in secure information systems, in secure long distance \n     communications, and in super-computing (see Cybersecurity and \n     Quantum Information Systems). Recent budget cuts have \n     impacted U.S. efforts in all these areas. Also, technologies \n     are now in view that could markedly improve the way we \n     protect our soldiers and other war fighters while improving \n     their effectiveness in combat (see Defense Technology).\n       It is not just areas of science with obvious applications \n     that are important. Some observers have asked, ``What good is \n     it?'' of the discovery of the Higgs boson (the particle \n     referred to above, which fills a major gap in our \n     understanding of the fundamental nature of matter). But it is \n     useful to remember that similar comments might have been made \n     when the double helix structure of DNA was first understood \n     (many decades before the first biotech drug), when the first \n     transistor emerged from research in solid state physics (many \n     decades before the IT revolution), when radio waves were \n     first discovered (long before radios or broadcast networks \n     were even conceived of). We are a remarkably inventive \n     species, and seem always to find ways to put new knowledge to \n     work.\n       Other potential discoveries could have global impacts of a \n     different kind. Astronomers have now identified hundreds of \n     planets around other stars, and some of them are clearly \n     Earth-like. Imagine what it would mean to our human \n     perspective if we were to discover evidence of life on these \n     planets--a signal that we are not alone in the universe--from \n     observations of their planetary atmospheres, something that \n     is potentially within the technical capability of space-based \n     research within the next decade? Or if the next generation of \n     space telescopes can discover the true nature of the \n     mysterious ``dark matter'' and ``dark energy'' that appear to \n     be the dominant constituents of the universe (see Space \n     Exploration).\n       Do we want more efficient government, more market-friendly \n     regulatory structures? Social and economic research is \n     increasingly able to provide policymakers with useful \n     guidance. Witness the way government has helped to create \n     mobile and broadband markets by auctioning the wireless \n     spectrum--complex, carefully-designed auctions based on \n     insights from game theory and related research that have \n     netted the federal government more than $60 billion while \n     catalyzing huge new industries and transformed the way we \n     live and do business. Empowered by access to more government \n     data and Big Data tools, such research could point the way to \n     still more efficient government (see Enabling Better Policy \n     Decisions).\n       In the past, U.S. industry took a long term view of R and \n     did fundamental research, activities associated with such \n     entities as the now-diminished Bell Labs and Xerox Park. \n     That's still the case in some other countries such as South \n     Korea. Samsung, for example, spent decades of effort to \n     develop the underlying science and manufacturing behind \n     organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) before commercializing \n     these into the now familiar, dramatic displays in TVs and \n     many other digital devices. But today, as competitive \n     pressures have increased, basic research has essentially \n     disappeared from U.S. companies, leaving them dependent on \n     federally-funded, university-based basic research to fuel \n     innovation. This shift means that federal support of basic \n     research is even more tightly coupled to national economic \n     competitiveness. Moreover, there will\n\n[[Page H688]]\n\n     always be circumstances when private investment lags--when \n     the innovation creates a public good, such as clean air, for \n     which an investor can't capture the value, or when the risk \n     is too high, such as novel approaches to new antibiotic \n     drugs, or when the technical complexity is so high that there \n     is fundamental uncertainty as to the outcome, such as with \n     quantum computing or fusion energy. For these cases, \n     government funding is the only possible source to spur \n     innovation.\n       This central role of federal research support means that \n     sudden changes in funding levels such as the recent sequester \n     can disrupt research efforts and cause long term damage, \n     especially to the pipeline of scientific talent on which U.S. \n     research leadership ultimately depends. In a survey of the \n     effects of reduced research funding conducted by the \n     Chronicle of Higher Education last year among 11,000 \n     recipients of NIH and NSF research grants, nearly half have \n     abandoned an area of investigation they considered critical \n     to their lab's mission, and more than three quarters have \n     fired or failed to hire graduate students and research \n     fellows. Other evidence suggests that many of those affected \n     switch careers, leaving basic research behind forever.\n       Despite these challenges, the potential benefits from \n     expanding basic research summarized in these pages--an \n     innovation dividend that could boost our economy, improve \n     human lives, and strengthen the U.S. strategically--are truly \n     inspiring. We hope you will find the information useful.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  What this paper cites, in 2014, notable scientific advancements \nincluded landing of a manmade Earth object on a comet, discovery of a \nnew fundamental particle which provided vital information on the origin \nof the universe, development of the world's fastest supercomputer, and \na tremendous increase in plant biology that is discovering new and \nbetter ways to make global food requirements.\n  None of these, however, Mr. Chairman, were U.S.-led. So my amendment \nturns our attention, again, maybe to the obvious. Maybe if I say \nAlexander Bell, as we learned as children in school, everybody knew \nthat he created the telephone.\n  George Washington Carver was associated with the many scientific \ndiscoveries out of a single peanut, someone that those of us, in this \nmonth of African American History, when they would teach us African \nAmerican History, we would all know George Washington Carver, that we \nhad a real role model that was a scientist and that generated probably \nthousands of scientists, people of African American heritage and \nbeyond.\n  So I want my amendment to emphasize that we want the long list of \ninnovation to be on our side and to continue the tradition and \ntrajectory that we have had of basic research that then applies to all \nlevels to create opportunities of work and genius that is here in this \ncountry.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I thank Chairman Sessions and Ranking Member Slaughter for making \nthree Jackson Lee Amendments in order for consideration under H.R. \n3293, the ``Scientific Research in the National Interest Act.''\n  My thanks and appreciation to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member \nJohnson's staff for working with my staff on drafting this amendment.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 4--adds to the list of goals in the \nnational interest--the conduct of basic research that follow well \nestablished protocols and scientific methods.\n  The scientific method--it is what happens every day and can lead to \nbasic research experiments conducted by scientists.\n  Basic research is the foundation of tomorrow's innovations.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment will help ensure that the nature of basic \nresearch is preserved because without basic research the United States \nwill be dependent on others to make and reap the tremendous economic \nrewards from new discoveries.\n  Applied science depends on a well-grounded understanding of the basic \nresearch that leads to discovery.\n  I call my colleagues attention to a groundbreaking report by the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology entitled ``The Future Postponed: \nWhy Declining Investment in Basic Research Threatens a U.S. Innovation \nDeficit.''\n  For much of our history, the United States' industries took a long \nterm view of research and development and did fundamental research, \nactivities associated with basic research at Bell Labs and Xerox Park.\n  Today, as competitive pressures have increased, basic research has \nessentially disappeared from U.S. companies, leaving them dependent \nupon federally-funded, university-based basic research to fuel \ninnovation.\n  In 2014, notable scientific advancements included:\n  1. landing of a man made earth object on a comet;\n  2. discovery of a new fundamental particle, which provided vital \ninformation on the origin of the universe; development of the world's \nfastest supercomputer; and\n  3. a tremendous increase in plant biology that is discovering new and \nbetter ways to meet global food requirements.\n  These are wonderful accomplishments, but none of them were U.S. led.\n  The first two were European in origin and the second two were \naccomplished by China.\n  China landed the Jade Rabbit, its first lunar probe on the moon, and \non Sunday North Korea launched a long range rocket that put a satellite \ninto space that flew over the location of the Super Bowl.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment is intended to strengthen the nation's \ncommitment to basic research so that the United States remains \npreeminent in the field of discovery.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment, though I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), her second amendment that we \nare accepting on this side of the aisle.\n  I believe this amendment, in combination with the previous amendment, \naims to ensure that the National Science Foundation grants fund \nresearch that meets the highest standards so taxpayer dollars are not \nwasted on frivolous grants or poorly designed research proposals.\n  This amendment recognizes the National Science Foundation's basic \nresearch mission and endorses applying the bill's national interest \nstandards and criteria to National Science Foundation's basic research \ngrants.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for her amendment, and I support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman for supporting this amendment, \nand I thank the ranking member for supporting it.\n  In closing, Mr. Chairman, let me say that, in addition to following \nprotocol, we must invest funds, money, in basic research.\n  But I also want to take note of something that I have watched over \nthe years, and I have added amendments, and I have seen the growth.\n  One of my first acts on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee \nwas to utilize laboratory tools or equipment that were no longer needed \nby the Federal Government in its national science lab to give them to \nmiddle schools and high schools so that they would have access to this \nkind of equipment. Many of us know that there are schools all \nthroughout America who are deficient in science labs. I see them in my \ndistrict. I hear about them.\n  I think the other important point is that, over the years, we have \nexpanded the research collaboration to Historically Black Colleges, \nHispanic-Serving Institutions, Native American-Serving, rural, and \ncolleges that serve the economically disadvantaged.\n  Those are good things because we don't know where the genius is \nAmerica and how many people may come up with outstanding research. So I \nhope that we do focus on how important basic research is.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. DelBene\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-420.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 6, insert ``, including computer science and \n     information technology sectors,'' after ``workforce''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentlewoman \nfrom Washington (Ms. DelBene) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H689]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer this amendment to ensure the \nNational Science Foundation can continue investing in the development \nof an American workforce that is globally competitive in computer \nscience and information technology. This has been a bipartisan goal in \nthe past, and I am hopeful everyone in this Chamber will be able to \nsupport it.\n  Computing technology has become an integral part of our lives, \ntransforming our society and our Nation's economy. Nowhere is this \nclearer than in the Puget Sound region. I have the honor of \nrepresenting Washington's First District, which has some of the world's \nleading software companies and technology innovators.\n  But the same can be seen across the country. According to the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics, there will be roughly 10 million STEM jobs by 2020 \nand, of those jobs, half are expected to be in computing and \ninformation technology. That is nearly 5 million good-paying jobs. But \nunless we step up our game, our country won't have enough computer \nscience graduates to fill those positions.\n  Today, there continues to be a substantial shortage of Americans with \nthe skills needed to fill computing jobs, and too few of our students \nare being given the opportunity to learn computer science, both at the \nK-12 level and in college. What is worse, dramatic disparities remain \nfor girls and students of color.\n  Last year, less than 25 percent of students taking the AP Computer \nScience exam were girls, while less than 15 percent were African \nAmerican or Latino.\n  To remain economically competitive, we need to make smart investments \nnow to address these disparities and ensure we have a strong 21st \ncentury workforce in the decades to come. Thankfully, NSF supports \nvital research and development projects to help prepare the next \ngeneration to compete in STEM jobs, something we all agree is an \nimportant goal.\n  My amendment simply clarifies that, under the legislation, NSF can \nalso invest in projects aimed at developing an American workforce that \nis globally competitive in computing and information technology, \nsectors that are seeing enormous growth here at home and around the \nglobe.\n  If we want our students to be prepared for the digital economy, NSF \nmust be able to fund projects that support the teaching and learning of \nessential computer science skills like coding, programming, designing, \nand debugging. My amendment will do just that. It will ensure we are \nlooking forward and preparing students for the college degrees and \ncareers of the future.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment, but I do not oppose it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I accept the gentlewoman's \namendment. It clarifies that it is in the national interest to fund \ngrants that support the development of an American STEM workforce that \nis globally competitive and that includes computer science and the \ninformation technology sectors.\n  In October, the President signed into law the STEM Education Act, a \nbill that I introduced with my colleague Ms. Esty, which expands the \ndefinition of STEM to include computer science. This amendment \nreinforces that new Federal definition of STEM. It is a perfecting \namendment to the bill, and I welcome it.\n  I agree with my colleague that it is in the national interest to \nsupport creating training a STEM workforce which includes computer \nscience, and I support her amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DelBENE. I want to thank the chairman for his support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Ms. DelBene\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-420.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, after line 3, add the following:\n       (e) Clarification.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \n     to impact Federal funding for research grants or cooperative \n     agreements awarded by the National Science Foundation prior \n     to the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 609, the gentlewoman \nfrom Washington (Ms. DelBene) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an important amendment for \nscientists across the country who are engaged in ongoing research \nfunded by the National Science Foundation.\n  As everyone in this Chamber knows, research and innovation are \ncentral to American competitiveness and driving our national economy. \nEach year, investments in research through NSF help us push the \nboundaries of scientific knowledge, support new industries, and address \nthe challenges facing our society.\n  I don't think anyone would deny that funding for NSF has \noverwhelmingly benefited our country. It is also key to our country's \neconomic growth. Funding new explorations in science and technology is \nhow we stay on the cutting edge of research; it is how we continue to \ncompete globally in the 21st century economy.\n  That is why I have serious concerns about the implications of the \nunderlying legislation, which needlessly inserts a layer of political \nreview into the scientific research process. To remain a world leader, \nwe need to ensure scientists are exploring transformative new ideas and \nfrontiers based on the merits of their research, not the subjective \nopinions of politicians in Congress.\n  Unfortunately, those subjective opinions are exactly what is being \ninjected into the process under this legislation; and what is worse, it \nhas the potential to put ongoing research at risk. By changing the \nrules about how NSF funding is awarded, scientists across the country \nmay rightfully be concerned about how this legislation affects the \nimportant work that they are doing today.\n  As someone who started her career in research, I can tell you \nfirsthand it is incredibly important that you have the certainty to see \na project through to the end. Starting and stopping research is highly \ndetrimental.\n  We should provide scientists the long-term visibility to know their \nongoing research can be completed without interference from \npoliticians, and that is precisely what my amendment does. My amendment \nsimply clarifies that the underlying legislation does not impact any \ngrant funding that has already been awarded by the NSF. It is critical \nthat we pass it to ensure ongoing research is not disrupted by this \nunfortunate bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, research isn't a spigot you can turn on and off. I urge \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment, though I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I accept the gentlewoman's \namendment. It clarifies that the new requirements in the bill do not \napply to grants that have already been awarded by the National Science \nFoundation. I agree that the bill is not intended to be retroactive.\n  In January 2015, NSF began to implement new internal guidelines that \npromote accountability and transparency. These guidelines are \ncompatible with this bill, but the implementation of them is a work in \nprogress. I will continue to communicate with NSF about how they \nimplement their internal guidelines, but agree that this bill will only \napply to future grants, once enacted.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment.\n\n[[Page H690]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DelBENE.

Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. EDWARDS. I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Edwards moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3293 to the \n     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with instructions \n     to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the \n     following amendments:\n       Page 4, line 13, strike ``or''.\n       Page 4, line 15, strike the period and insert ``; or''.\n       Page 4, after line 15, insert the folowing:\n       (H) increased understanding of the causes and prevention of \n     gun violence.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Maryland is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It \nwill not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the \nbill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  H.R. 3293, the deceptively entitled Scientific Research in the \nNational Interest Act, represents an effort by the majority to overrule \nexpert scientists in deciding which scientific grants the Federal \nscientific agency should fund. What this really translates to, Mr. \nSpeaker, is that these are areas that some politicians do not want to \nfund because they don't believe in scientists.\n  Just a week ago, 26-year-old NeShante Davis, a second grade teacher \nin Fort Washington, and her 2-year-old daughter, Chloe, were gunned \ndown because of child support. We have a gun violence problem in the \nUnited States.\n  According to The American Journal of Medicine, compared to other rich \nnations, Americans are 25 times more likely to be violently killed with \na firearm, 6 times more likely to be accidentally killed with a gun, 8 \ntimes more likely to commit suicide using a firearm, and 10 times more \nlikely to die from a gun death overall.\n  To address this, Americans deserve the facts and Congress needs the \nbreadth and the data for the epidemic. Using the public health \napproach, we have reduced smoking among Americans from 43 percent, at \nthe time of the first Surgeon General's report in 1964, to 18 percent.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Since the 1970s, using the public health approach, we have reduced \ndeaths from motor vehicle crashes by more than 70 percent. In 1970, \nthere were over 55,000 deaths from motor vehicle crashes per year. \nToday there are around 30,000.\n  So what does the public health approach yield? Well, the essence is \nthis: define the problem, including its magnitude, nature, and \ndistribution in the population; define the cause or risk and protective \nfactors for the problem. What are the characteristics to prevent the \nproblem?\n  For example, educating people about the risk of guns that come with \ngun ownership and how to reduce that risk and develop widely \nimplemented programs using proven strategies to prevent the problem, \npublic health can help solve this problem.\n  At this time, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nSwalwell), my colleague and cosponsor of the motion.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I thank the gentlewoman from Maryland for \nyielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, on every block in every community across America, people \nare asking what is the Federal Government doing to keep our community \nsafe from gun violence. They are asking for good reason.\n  Nearly 11,000 Americans were victims of homicide by firearm in 2014. \nThere was nearly one mass shooting for each day of the year in 2015, \naccording to The New York Times. With these stats, are we doing enough? \nCan we do more?\n  Our motion to recommit answers this question by endeavoring to \nunderstand the causes of gun violence and learning how we can curb it. \nAs Members of Congress, we have no higher obligation than to protect \nthose we represent.\n  I urge all Members to live up to that responsibility. Help do all we \ncan to reduce gun violence. Pass this motion to recommit.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, using the public health approach, we have \nnow eradicated smallpox, eliminated polio in most countries, reduced \nmotor vehicle deaths by 70 percent, and reduced smoking rates by over \nhalf.\n  We can do something about gun violence, and we have an obligation to \ndo it today. Just think if we were able to do the same thing to address \nthe gun violence epidemic.\n  This is a small and yet powerful step with research--just research--\nthat could lead to significantly reducing the number of Americans \nkilled by firearms.\n  All we want to do is look at the problem. All we want to do is \nmeasure the magnitude. All we want to do is find solutions for NeShante \nDavis, 26 years old, and her 2-year-old daughter, Chloe, gunned down--\ngunned down.\n  In every single community across this country, we can do this by \nenabling the National Science Foundation to just look into the issue \nand give us some answers so that we can find solutions. We owe it to \nNeShante. We owe it to Chloe. We owe it to the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to treat this like \nthe epidemic that it is. End gun violence in this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense motion.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion \nto recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the motion to recommit.\n  H.R. 3293, the Scientific Research in the National Interest Act, is a \nbipartisan bill that ensures the grant process at the National Science \nFoundation is transparent and accountable to the American people.\n  America's future economic growth and national security depend on \ninnovation. Public and private investments in research and development \nfuel the economy, create jobs, and lead to new technologies that \nbenefit Americans' daily lives.\n  NSF invests about $6 billion of taxpayers' funds every year on \nresearch projects and related activities. Unfortunately, in recent \nyears, the Federal Government has awarded too many grants that few \nAmericans would consider to be in the national interest.\n\n[[Page H692]]\n\n  Only one out of five grant proposals are approved. We cannot fund \nevery worthy proposal, much less frivolous ones like $516,000 to create \na video game called ``Relive Prom Night.''\n  The legislation before us reaffirms in law that every NSF grant must \nsupport research that is in the national interest.\n  The 1950 enabling legislation that created the NSF set forth the \nFoundation's mission and cited the national interest as the foundation \nfor public support and dissemination of basic scientific research.\n  The Science in the National Interest Act reaffirms and restores this \ncrucial mission and requires the NSF grants meet at least one of seven \ncriteria that demonstrate it is in the national interest. This will add \ntransparency, accountability, and credibility to the NSF and its grant \nprocess.\n  Opponents of this bill must think they know better than the NSF \nDirector. Director Cordova testified before the House Science, Space, \nand Technology Committee that the policy in H.R. 3293 is ``compatible \nwith the NSF's internal guidelines.'' This legislation makes that \nstandard clear, explicit, and permanent.\n  Scientists still make the decisions. They just do not get a blank \ncheck signed by the taxpayer. They need to be accountable to the \nAmerican people by showing their proposals are in the national \ninterest.\n  The National Science Foundation has supported and continues to \nsupport basic research into the causes and prevention of crime and mass \nviolence. NSF-funded research has included studies of violent impulse \nbehavior, cultural and social factors affecting predisposition to \nviolence, the links between mental disorders and violent behavior, \nparenting and parental influences over their children's disposition \ntoward violent behavior, and patterns of crime and violence in American \ncities.\n  There is no need for this motion to recommit. In fact, it is an \ninappropriate earmark.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Jordan Defense \n     Cooperation Act of 2015''.\n\n[[Page H694]]\n\n  \n\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As of January 22, 2015, the United States Government \n     has provided $3,046,343,000 in assistance to respond to the \n     Syria humanitarian crisis, of which nearly $467,000,000 has \n     been provided to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\n       (2) As of January 2015, according to the United Nations \n     High Commissioner for Refugees, there were 621,937 registered \n     Syrian refugees in Jordan and 83.8 percent of whom lived \n     outside refugee camps.\n       (3) In 2000, the United States and Jordan signed a free-\n     trade agreement that went into force in 2001.\n       (4) In 1996, the United States granted Jordan major non-\n     NATO ally status.\n       (5) Jordan is suffering from the Syrian refugee crisis and \n     the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n     (ISIL).\n       (6) The Government of Jordan was elected as a non-permanent \n     member of the United Nations Security Council for a 2-year \n     term ending in December 2015.\n       (7) Enhanced support for defense cooperation with Jordan is \n     important to the national security of the United States, \n     including through creation of a status in law for Jordan \n     similar to the countries in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, \n     Israel, and New Zealand, with respect to consideration by \n     Congress of foreign military sales to Jordan.\n       (8) The Colorado National Guard's relationship with the \n     Jordanian military provides a significant benefit to both the \n     United States and Jordan.\n       (9) Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh was brutally murdered \n     by ISIL.\n       (10) On February 3, 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry and \n     Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh signed a new \n     Memorandum of Understanding that reflects the intention to \n     increase United States assistance to the Government of Jordan \n     from $660,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 for each of the years \n     2015 through 2017.\n       (11) On December 5, 2014, in an interview on CBS This \n     Morning, Jordanian King Abdullah II stated--\n       (A) in reference to ISIL, ``This is a Muslim problem. We \n     need to take ownership of this. We need to stand up and say \n     what is wrong''; and\n       (B) ``This is our war. This is a war inside Islam. So we \n     have to own up to it. We have to take the lead. We have to \n     start fighting back.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to support the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in its \n     response to the Syrian refugee crisis;\n       (2) to provide necessary assistance to alleviate the \n     domestic burden to provide basic needs for the assimilated \n     Syrian refugees;\n       (3) to cooperate with Jordan to combat the terrorist threat \n     from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or other \n     terrorist organizations; and\n       (4) to help secure the border between Jordan and its \n     neighbors Syria and Iraq.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) expeditious consideration of certifications of letters \n     of offer to sell defense articles, defense services, design \n     and construction services, and major defense equipment to the \n     Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan under section 36(b) of the Arms \n     Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2776(b)) is fully consistent \n     with United States security and foreign policy interests and \n     the objectives of world peace and security;\n       (2) Congress welcomes the statement of King Abdullah II \n     quoted in section (2)(11); and\n       (3) it is in the interest of peace and stability for \n     regional members of the Global Coalition to Combat ISIL to \n     continue their commitment to, and increase their involvement \n     in, addressing the threat posed by ISIL.\n\n     SEC. 5. ENHANCED DEFENSE COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the 3-year period beginning on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Hashemite Kingdom of \n     Jordan shall be treated as if it were a country listed in the \n     provisions of law described in subsection (b) for purposes of \n     applying and administering such provisions of law.\n       (b) Arms Export Control Act.--The provisions of law \n     described in this subsection are--\n       (1) subsections (b)(2), (d)(2)(B), (d)(3)(A)(i), and (d)(5) \n     of section 3 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2753);\n       (2) subsections (e)(2)(A), (h)(1)(A), and (h)(2) of section \n     21 of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2761);\n       (3) subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(6), (c), and (d)(2)(A) \n     of section 36 of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2776);\n       (4) section 62(c)(1) of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2796a(c)(1)); \n     and\n       (5) section 63(a)(2) of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2796b(a)(2)).\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. Speaker, it has been said that no veteran dies \nalone. Yesterday, southern Arizona proved that true in an amazing way.\n  Recently, Sierra Vista resident Sergeant First Class Sidney D. \nCochran passed away at the age of 93. He served 20 years in the U.S. \nArmy, serving in both World War II and Korea, but died without any \nfamily to attend his funeral. A call went out at the end of last week \non social media to encourage anyone to attend his service. Over 300 \npeople came out to show their respects.\n  The Sierra Vista Herald reported that American Legion Riders escorted \nSergeant Cochran to the cemetery, where members of the Tucson-based \nPatriot Guard Riders were waiting to\n\n[[Page H695]]\n\ngreet him. Fort Huachuca's Honor Guard carried him to his final resting \nplace, and an Arizona National Guard helicopter conducted a flyover. \nThe manager of the cemetery remarked that she had never seen a service \nlike that before.\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud everyone in my district who took the time to \ngive Sergeant Cochran the honor he deserved. Southern Arizona is unique \nfor so many reasons, and not least of all is the amazing way our \ncommunity shows appreciation for our veterans and their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H695-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CYBERSECURITY NATIONAL ACTION PLAN\n\n  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the President announced his \nCybersecurity National Action Plan in conjunction with his 2017 budget \nproposal. This proposal starts with a much-needed investment in Federal \ncybersecurity: a 35 percent increase in spending anchored by a $3.1 \nbillion revolving fund designed to kick-start the modernization of \noutdated government IT systems--something that is sorely needed.\n  The Action Plan is notable for its emphasis on centralizing Federal \ncybersecurity, something I have long called for. While the CISO created \nunder the plan does not have all authorities I think the position \nrequires, it is certainly a step in the right direction.\n  The plan also makes needed investments in workforce development, \nincluding the very successful CyberCorps program, and charters a \nPresidential commission to do more long-range planning in the domain.\n  I commend the President's effort, which reflects an appropriately \nstrategic adjustment to the breach of Office of Personnel Management \nsystems last year; however, I hope we will leverage this increased \nattention to address the challenges of tomorrow, not just those of \nyesterday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H695-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IRAN VIOLATES INTERNATIONAL LAW\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it was a routine exercise, sailing \nfrom Kuwait to Bahrain through the Persian Gulf, until, allegedly, the \nnavigation system failed on one of the two U.S. gunboats. Mysteriously, \nthe boats lost communication.\n  Next, 10 American sailors surrendered and were captured by Iran. They \nwere led off the boat at gunpoint and held hostage. Iran, \nunsurprisingly, violated Article 13 of the Geneva Convention by failing \nto protect our sailors from ``insults and public curiosity.''\n  Here is a poster of our sailors surrendering to the small boat of \nIranians. The bottom photograph apparently shows arms taken off the two \nAmerican boats. I assume the Iranians kept those.\n  Iran's Supreme Leader has awarded victory medals to its navy \ncommanders for capturing the Americans.\n  International law states that anyone can have innocent passage \nthrough a state's territorial waters, as long as it is nonthreatening, \ncontinuous, and expeditious.\n  Iran claimed the Americans were sent to spy. These claims turned out \nto be delusional. Iran acted without consequences, and the U.S. did not \nact at all.\n  Many questions remain. Where was the effective air cover for the \nNavy? Why did the sailors ``give up the ship''? Who gave the order to \nsurrender?\n  The Navy needs to let the American public know how two American boats \nwere confiscated by the Iranians and why it happened.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H695-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FLINT WATER CRISIS\n\n  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, in Michigan, thousands of young children were \npoisoned because Governor Snyder used a contaminated water source to \ncut costs. Last year, in my State of New Jersey, over 3,000 children \nunder 6 years old were afflicted with dangerous levels of lead, \naccording to a new report.\n  Four of the communities I represent in Congress--Irvington, East \nOrange, Newark, and Jersey City--have dangerous lead levels.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge south Floridians \nto join me at the Dolphins Cancer Challenge on Saturday, February 20.\n  The Dolphins Cancer Challenge raises money for the University of \nMiami's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center to help ``tackle \ncancer''--to the tune of $11.5 million since its inception in 2010.\n  This event was inspired by Jim ``Mad Dog'' Mandich, whom we see \npictured here, whom we tragically lost to cancer nearly 5 years ago.\n  A champion both on and off the field, the ``Mad Dog'' was a key \ncontributor for the still-perfect and still-peerless, undefeated 1972 \nMiami Dolphins.\n  But Jim was perhaps best known and loved for his broadcasting work, \nwhere he cheered our own Dolphins with his patented ``Alright Miami.''\n  So please ride, run, or walk with me at the Dolphins Cancer Challenge \nto help support Sylvester's innovative cancer care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H695-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MANMADE DISASTER IN FLINT, MICHIGAN\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in decrying this \nmanmade disaster that is affecting the residents in the city of Flint, \nMichigan.\n  Every day we learn more about how the Governor and Michigan public \nofficials made decisions that sacrificed the health and futures of the \nFlint residents in order to save a few dollars. That is just plain \nwrong. The people of Flint deserve better. We cannot stand silent while \nAmericans, while children, are poisoned.\n  Flint is a majority African American city, and the average household \nincome is just $24,834--that is a year--which is barely half of \nMichigan's average household income. Would the same decisions have been \nmade had this been in an affluent community? I doubt it.\n  Earlier today, this House passed the bipartisan Safe Drinking Water \nAct Improved Compliance Awareness Act, but we can and must do more to \nprevent this from ever happening again.\n  Our response must be comprehensive and urgent.

The President's \nbudget leaves our\n\n[[Page H696]]\n\nchildren and grandchildren burdened with an unfathomable mountain of \ndebt, regulations, and taxes; and like every other budget he has \npresented, it never balances. This budget is reckless and \nunconscionable.\n  When President Obama took office on January 20, 2009, the national \ndebt was $10.6 trillion; yet Mr. Obama has increased the national debt \nto $19 trillion, and this budget would increase our national debt to \n$27.4 trillion over the next decade--more than twice the debt when he \nfirst took office.\n  This cover will be part of the Archives of the United States.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, we are here for another \nFuture Forum discussion, and tonight our topic is restoring our \ndemocracy, campaign finance, and voting rights.\n  Americans agree, our voting system and our political system is \nbroken, and the integrity of our democracy is at stake.\n  Future Forum is a House Democratic Caucus group consisting of 17 of \nour youngest members who have gone across the country to 11 cities, \nnow, talking to young people about their democracy and what they care \nabout.\n  We were just in Dallas this past Friday, hosted in the Dallas/Fort \nWorth area by Congressman Marc Veasey, as well as being joined by \nCongressman Ruben Gallego of Phoenix.\n  Today we are following up on what we heard in Dallas and what we have \nheard in many of the cities before it, which is, for all the issues \nfacing millennials, many of them understand that, at the root of the \nproblem is the influence of outside money in politics and access to the \nballot box.\n  Joining us tonight is one of the leaders in the House on the issue of \nmoney and politics, Congressman John Sarbanes of Maryland. He is the \nlead sponsor of the Government By the People Act.\n  Also we will be joined by Congressman Kilmer, from the Seattle area, \nand Delegate Plaskett, from the Virgin Islands.\n  So I am going to first ask Congressman Sarbanes this question, which \nwe have heard from so many millennials across the country: What can we \ndo to restore their faith in their government?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the gentleman, \nCongressman Swalwell, of the Future Forum, for convening us around \nissues here in the Chamber and out in the country that are particularly \nimportant and critical for the next generation out there, and what we \ncan do to bring their interests in, bring them into the political town \nsquare, if you will, and get the benefit of their voices.\n  The gentleman is absolutely right to point to the challenge, the \nproblem we have. Many young people, many Americans of all ages these \ndays feel that their voice really isn't accounted for here in \nWashington. Their sense is that there is kind of an insider game being \nplayed, that big money and special interests hold particular sway in \nthis place, and the voice of everyday Americans, average citizens, just \ndoesn't have a place.\n  That has led to cynicism, it has led to anger, it has led to \nfrustration, and it has led to a lot of people deciding to exit the \npolitical arena.\n  It doesn't mean they are not passionate about things. That is clearly \nthe case. You see a lot of young people who are focused on climate \nchange, on the economy, on jobs, on issues that are important to them. \nThey have just kind of given up that maybe Washington and Congress are \nthe places where important decisions and progress can be made on those \nissues.\n  So the challenge for us is: How do we bring people back? How do we \nget them back into the conversation so we can benefit from what a \npluralistic democratic society is all about, which is, you get people \nin there, you tussle\n\n[[Page H697]]\n\naround, you put your views out, you reach a compromise, and then you \nmove forward? That is what progress is all about.\n  I think one of the critical ways to address this is we have got to \nlook at revamping the way we fund campaigns in this country. So the \ngentleman is right to call attention to that, and we have a lot of \nleadership here in the House that is focused on what we can do to kind \nof restore the voices of everyday Americans.\n  I appreciate your citing the Government By the People Act, which is \nreform legislation that we have introduced in this Congress. We have \nalmost 160 cosponsors, including, I think, everybody who is going to \nspeak this evening as part of the Future Forum.\n  The idea there is just to basically go build a different way of \nfunding campaigns that puts everyday citizens back at the center, so \nthey are the linchpin, they are the driver, where small donations can \nearn matching funds and help to power the campaign of Members of \nCongress and candidates out there who want to run and become part of \nthis place. There will be a place for candidates to turn to support \ntheir campaigns other than to the special interests and the big money \ncrowd.\n  We can build a system like that that is viable, that puts everyday \ncitizens at the center of it. And I think if we do that, young people \nand people, frankly, of all ages and stripes are going to decide they \nwant to step back into the political space because they will feel \nappreciated again, like their voice matters.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  So I look forward to the discussion tonight, and I want to thank you \nfor your work on the Future Forum and particularly calling attention \ntonight to this issue of money and politics, how we address it, and how \nwe bring the voices of everyday citizens back into the mix into the \npeople's House.\n  Mr. SWALWELL. I want to again thank my colleague from the Baltimore \narea in Maryland.\n  I want to ask Congressman Kilmer. The Future Forum went to Seattle. \nWe visited college campuses in the Tacoma and Seattle area. We went to \na couple of the big businesses in your area with a millennial \nworkforce.\n  We heard in Tacoma the same thing that we heard when we went to the \nManchester, New Hampshire, area and the same thing that we heard in the \nDallas area, which is that millennials just think that the system is \nrigged and there is no reason to participate. The numbers show that. \nRoughly 22 percent of the eligible millennials showed up to vote in \n2014.\n  What are you hearing in the Seattle area about this issue?\n  Mr. KILMER. I think that is pretty consistent with what we hear in \nour neck of the woods. You saw in the last election season two-thirds \nof Americans cast a no-confidence vote by not voting at all, and those \nnumbers are even worse when it comes to millennial voters.\n  I think as Mr. Sarbanes said, it is not that they don't care, there \nare a lot of things that they care about. But it is, I think, out of a \nfair belief that there is too much money, too many deep pockets, and \ntoo many special interests that are driving our democracy.\n  This week Politico came out with a report that the 100 biggest donors \nof the 2016 cycle have spent $195 million. That is more than the \ncombined total of 2 million small donors. So I think it is fair to say \nthat millennial voters see that dynamic and believe that their voice is \ngetting drowned out in the process.\n  Mr. SWALWELL. If you look at this chart here, 158 families gave \nnearly 50 percent of the early 2016 donations. How does that make you \nfeel?\n  If you are a part of the largest generation America has ever known, \n80 million people, the most diverse generation America has ever known, \nhow does it make you feel when 158 families are contributing over 50 \npercent?\n  Mr. KILMER. I think it drives the importance of some of the change \nthat we are talking about here tonight. Certainly, the Government By \nthe People Act is a key part of that, trying to get the deep pockets \nand special interest influence away and actually empower the everyday \nAmerican and millennial voters.\n  There are other things we have to do as well. You see this problem \nexacerbated by the Citizens United decision. Many of us are cosponsors \nof a constitutional amendment to undo that Supreme Court decision.\n  You have seen efforts focused on trying to at least shine a bright \nlight on where some of this dark money is coming from. There is a bill \ncalled the DISCLOSE Act that at least tries to focus on that issue.\n  Then the other thing that I have worked on is trying to put the teeth \nback into the watchdog of our campaign finance system. So, after \nWatergate, you saw the Federal Election Commission established. That \nwas really meant to be the watchdog to make sure people weren't \nviolating campaign finance law and that they were playing by the rules.\n  Unfortunately, as time has passed, the Federal Election Commission \nhas almost become as dysfunctional as the United States Congress. The \nconsequence of that is people are playing fast and loose with the \nrules.\n  You see the rise of super-PACs and this whole question of \ncoordination, particularly in the Presidential campaigns, and it is a \nreal problem. So we put forward a bill that is called the Restoring \nIntegrity to America's Elections Act. Very simply, it tries to put \nteeth back into the Federal Election Commission.\n  So there are all sorts of things that we have got to do on this front \nto try to reduce the role of money in our politics and to try to \nrestore the people's power back.\n  Because, if you look at some the extraordinary things that have \nhappened in this country, whether it be the civil rights movement or \nadvances made in environmental protection or any number of things, they \nhave happened when everyday Americans, citizens, are able to take hold \nof their government and to actually make a difference in their \ngovernment.\n  I think each of us is trying to do that, certainly from a policy \nstandpoint. Next week I am doing seven townhall meetings in my district \nto try to make sure that everyday Americans have a voice in their \ndemocracy.\n  But you look at charts like that and I think it makes it very hard \nfor people to feel any sense of impact and efficacy and feel like their \nvoice is being heard. I think it is an important conversation for us to \nbe having because we need to change that.\n  Mr. SWALWELL. Your proposals to have reforms with more teeth are \nquite popular across the country. I don't know if you knew this, but it \nhas strong support across a cross-section of the electorate.\n  For example, majorities of Democratic voters, 72 percent women and 84 \npercent men, support small donor reforms. Independent voters, 60 \npercent of the women polled and 66 percent of the men polled supported \nit. Among Republican voters, 57 percent of the women supported it, and \n53 percent of the men have supported small donor reforms.\n  So I want to ask Congressman Sarbanes--and then I see we are now \njoined by Congressman Veasey as well--how has money and politics also \nworked to disenfranchise voters? Because Congressman Veasey and I heard \nin the Dallas/Fort Worth area about how voting laws that have been put \nin place have made it actually quite hard to show up and vote. We heard \nabout the purging of people from the voter rolls.\n  What is the connection there when you have outside interests drowning \nout voices, putting in who they want as policymakers, and then the \neffect on the rules that go into place as far as how we govern our \nelection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. You can talk about the effect on the rules. You can \njust also talk about the effect on the enthusiasm for voting, period.\n  If people are convinced that money calls the shots, then they are \ngoing to look at voting as just being asked to come out on election day \nand decide which of two people to send to Washington to work for \nsomebody else.\n  Look at the issue of access to the ballot box and protecting access \nto the ballot box. Last year I had the opportunity with many Members of \nCongress to go down to Selma with John Lewis and remember the foot \nsoldiers from 50 years ago who fought for the right to vote.\n  We talked about protecting access to the ballot box. But just as \nimportant is\n\n[[Page H698]]\n\nprotecting the ballot box' opportunity to get to Washington without \nbeing hijacked along the way.\n  Because that undermines the franchise, too. People bleed and sweat to \nget to the ballot box. You have to make sure that ballot box is \npreserved on its way to Washington.\n  So on one side of the coin, you have the right to vote, which is \nsacrosanct in our country. On the other side of the coin, you have the \nright to have your vote mean something. That is where we have to \naddress the undue influence that money has.\n  Two other real quick points before I yield back.\n  One is--and this is important, I think, to millennials, young people, \nand the next generation--this question about what we do with money in \npolitics. It is not just about putting rules in place. Rules are \nimportant.\n  You have got to have disclosure and transparency. You have to have \nnon-coordination rules so the super-PACs can't talk to the candidates. \nYou want to try and get a constitutional amendment to put limits on \nwhat the big money players can do. But rules are putting a referee on \nthe field of the democracy to blow the whistle when the big money crowd \ngets out of hand.\n  We need the rules, but we also need power. We need to figure out a \nway to get Americans out of the bleachers and onto the field of their \nown democracy. That is what small donor matching systems of public \nfinancing are all about.\n  So it is about rules, but it is also about power. I think young \npeople are leaving a lot of power on the table that they can take back \nto give themselves a voice in their democracy again, and they will be \nat the center of that kind of reform. So that is why it is so critical \nto push forward with all of these different measures.\n  Then the last thing I just wanted to point out is one of the things \nthat happens is young people want to run for office. They want to get \ninto the game. They want to enter politics. They want to come into the \npolitical arena.\n  But, unfortunately, there is something called the money primary or \nthe green primary where, if you can't find a lot of people that can \nraise a lot of money for you, then you have no way to be viable as a \ncandidate. So then you don't even put your hat into the ring.\n  One of the things that will happen if we can create systems of small \ndonor public financing across the country--and we are starting to see \nthat in places like Seattle, Maine, Arizona, Connecticut, New York \nCity, and so forth--is that people who before could never imagine \nrunning because they couldn't raise the money because there is a system \nthat can lift them up, they will put their hat in the ring, they will \nrun, they will compete, they will win, and they will serve.\n  It will change the composition not just of Congress, but of State \nlegislatures all across the country. That is the promise of small donor \nreform. Then we can bring young people in here. Then we can get the \nbenefit of their wisdom not just as donors and not just as small \ndonors, but as candidates and public servants.\n  Mr. SWALWELL. Thank you again, Congressman Sarbanes, for your work.\n  I want to empower young people across America right now, \n#FutureForum. There is a poll right now: Do you believe Congress should \nvote to update campaign finance rules? We have had over 100 responses \nsince just posting it. Ninety percent of the people say yes.\n  Congressman Veasey, we were in Dallas on Friday. We talked to \nhundreds of young people about what issues they care about, especially \naccess to the ballot box.\n  What did you hear in Dallas?\n  Mr. VEASEY. Absolutely, Representative Swalwell. I appreciate you \ntaking your time to come out to Dallas/Fort Worth.\n  All the kids that were there, the college campus, the young \nprofessionals that we spoke to, the business leaders that we spoke to, \nreally appreciated the fact that you and others in Congress are leading \nthe effort to engage young people and to engage millennials.\n  They make up such a large portion of our population. They are going \nto continue to make up a very large portion of our population. We need \nto engage them to find out what it is they are thinking.\n  One of the things that we heard when we were in the metroplex, as we \nlike to call Dallas/Fort Worth, is that young people feel like voting \nis not necessarily easy, that some of the barriers that have been put \nup recently in place have made it a lot harder for young people to \nexercise their right to vote.\n  One of the young people that we met talked about the fact that they \nhad missed one election cycle, they went to go and vote, and they found \nout that they had been suspended from the voter file, that they had \nbeen actually purged.\n  Mr. SWALWELL. I remember that woman. How does she feel about that?\n  Mr. VEASEY. It was very discouraging for her. It makes it seem as if \nthe system is rigged against her, and she didn't understand why that \nhappened. That was really unfortunate.\n  One of the other things that I am aware of--because I am actually a \nplaintiff in a lawsuit to roll back the Texas voter ID law--is a lot of \nour young people, when they go to college, get IDs from their \nuniversity. At a lot of our State universities, they will get IDs.\n  These IDs are good if they need to identify themselves to a campus \npolice officer. If they need to be able to use the ID to get on a plane \nor anything like that, these kids can use these college IDs.\n  But under the Texas voter ID law, a lot of our young people, if they \ngo back home to vote in their home counties and they show their student \nID card--a student ID card, again, that is issued by the State of \nTexas--they cannot vote. They will be given a provisional ballot. It \nwon't count.\n  When young people hear things like that, it really discourages them \nfrom voting. So we need to do everything we can to engage young people.\n  One of the things that I hear, Representative Swalwell, from a lot of \nyoung people is that--for instance, the young lady that we met that was \npurged from the voter roll--if there were same-day registration--\nactually, same-day registration actually encourages young people to \nparticipate in voting.\n  But a lot of States, like the one that I live in, won't do things \nlike that. They won't take that initiative. They won't take that extra \neffort to engage young people.\n  It is no wonder that so many of our young people feel like the system \nis really rigged against them, that, if they vote, their vote really \nwon't count. It is really, really unfortunate.\n  I would really think that, in the wake of the 50th anniversary of the \nVoting Rights Act, there is really no better time to assure young \nvoters that they can play a pivotal role in our democracy and to \ncontinue to urge them, despite what a lot of States like mine are \ndoing, to really discourage them from voting and discriminate against \nthem, that they will continue to take part in help shaping America. The \nbest way how you can do that is by voting.\n  Mr. SWALWELL. We talked to a lot of innovative young people in \nDallas. If I have learned anything about young people--and I remember \nbeing up in Manhattan with Congressman Israel and Congresswoman Grace \nMeng.\n  We were at a district co-workspace. The complaint we often heard \nthere was just about how darn hard it is to get to the polls and why is \nit on a Tuesday. Why is it so inconvenient.\n  I want to have Delegate Plaskett speak to us on voting rights as \nwell, but in a moment I'm going to have Steve Israel talk to us about \nweekend elections because people on Twitter right now are asking: Why \ncan't we have votes on the weekend?\n  Delegate Plaskett, can you talk to us a little bit just about voting \nrights with respect to the Virgin Islands, but also what you are \nhearing among young people.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Thank you so much for putting this together for us to \nbe able to speak to the American people and speak to this body about \nvoting rights, its importance, and the difficulties, that many groups \nare feeling disenfranchised from the voting system.\n  The Voting Rights Act is probably one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation that this Congress has put forward. It was passed in 1965 \nto prohibit discrimination in voting.\n  According to the Department of Justice, the Voting Rights Act itself \nhas\n\n[[Page H699]]\n\nbeen called the single most effective piece of civil rights \nlegislation. That was back in 2009 when they said that.\n  The Department of Justice has had a history of blocking racial \ngerrymandering, which was covered in section 4 of the act. In 2006, the \nVoting Rights Act was reaffirmed by an act of this Congress.\n  The Senate voted for it 98-0, and the House voted 390-33 in favor of \nthe Voting Rights Act, which lets us know that this is a fundamental \nright that most Americans believe.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  But there are still these barriers that many groups feel. I know, \nCongressman Swalwell, you have gone around the country. You have heard \nfrom young people, you have heard from poor people, you have heard from \nthose who live in rural areas, the difficulty they have in exercising \nthis fundamental right.\n  In the Virgin Islands, we are facing an even greater constitutional \nissue that we are bringing court cases to the United States about. Many \nyears ago, Congress decided that the right to vote was not a \nfundamental right for people that were living in the territories.\n  Under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act, if you \nlive in the United States in any of the 50 States, if you decide to \nmove to Paris, if you decide to move to Timbuktu, you can still vote. \nBut if you decide that you are going to live in one of the United \nStates territories, you have given up that right to vote for your \nPresident in your Federal election. In places like Guam, American \nSamoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, we have the highest veteran rate \nper capita in the United States. In the Virgin Islands, we have the \nhighest casualty rate per capita of people who have volunteered to \nserve this country, but cannot vote for their Commander in Chief.\n  We are bringing case law--and I am part of an effort--to ensure that \npeople who decide to live in the Virgin Islands, who are from the \nVirgin Islands, can retain that right to exercise their voice in our \nFederal elections and not something that we are fighting for right now.\n  This goes along with many of the other what we believe to be historic \ndiscrimination that has gone on. There is an enormous amount of racial \ngerrymandering that is happening in this country. The great Mr. John \nLewis, our colleague, has issued H.R. 12, I believe it is, which is a \nbill to expand voting rights and the ability for people to vote.\n  I know that as you go around this country and you speak with people, \nRepresentative Swalwell, you will hear about the difficulties, \nparticularly those people who are discriminated against in many ways, \nfrom their ability to vote.\n  One of the things that I recall writing about when I was in law \nschool was individuals who have been incarcerated and the ability that \nthey no longer have to vote. We know that in the Black community there \nis a disproportionate amount of our young men and women who are \nincarcerated and then have lost their right to vote. The difficulties \nthey have reinstating that right and that ability to vote absolutely \nexcludes not only their dignity and their ability to voice their \nopinions, but they are feeling part of the American Dream, feeling \nincluded in this American mission. What message are we saying to them \nwhen they need to be reintegrated back into this country and to be \nproductive citizens that they can work, we want them to work, we want \nthem to do everything that they are supposed to do, but they cannot \nhave that fundamental right to vote.\n  These are the things that I am glad you are speaking about tonight \nand that you are making the American public available to. I don't know \nwhat the Twitter feed is working on right now, but I am hoping that \npeople will tweet about this and will get this word out and will really \ncreate an echo chamber of young people, and even those who are not \nyoung, who are concerned about millennials and concerned about the next \ngeneration being able to be a part of the American process.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I thank Delegate Plaskett. That was so \neloquently said.\n  On Twitter right now under the #futureforum, people are speaking \nabout their democracy and their right to access the polls. Anna Little-\nSana tweeted: Election day should be a Federal holiday! Kel tweeted: \nElections on Saturdays sounds like the easiest and least controversial \nsolution.\n  Congressman Israel, what if someone introduced the Weekend Voting \nAct? Wait, someone has, and he is here.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. What a coincidence.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Tell us about that.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. What a coincidence this is.\n  I want to thank my friend from California for his leadership in the \nFuture Forum, traveling the country, engaging young people and \nmillennials on the critical issue of participating in government. I \ndon't qualify as a millennial.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. It is a mind-set.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. I am slightly older than most of the audiences that you \nengage. But I used to be a millennial. I used to be a young person. I \ngrew up in Levittown, New York, on Long Island. I remember going to \npublic school at Gardiners Avenue Elementary School and being taught \ncivics, being taught what it takes to be a good citizen, and what our \nresponsibilities and obligations were.\n  The principal responsibility and the principal obligation of a good \ncitizen was voting. You could vote to the left, you could vote to the \nright, but vote. Now we are falling further and further behind on \nvoting because it has become harder and harder.\n  There is a particular Republican candidate who talks about how we \nhave to make America great again. Do you know what we are not so great \nat? We are not so great at voting. In fact, we are falling further and \nfurther behind the rest of the industrialized world. We are falling \nfurther and further behind most democracies in our voting \nparticipation.\n  Why is that well? One reason is because we reserve one day of the \nyear to vote in Federal elections, and that is Tuesday. I don't know if \nmy friend knows--here is a little history quiz, a little pop quiz, to \nput him on the spot: Why do we vote on that Tuesday? Do you have any \nidea why we vote on that Tuesday?\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I don't have the slightest clue, no. Why \ndo we?\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Here is the answer. In 1845, Congress decided that voting \nday would be on Tuesday in November. Why? Because at the time we were \nliving in a mostly agrarian society, we were a farm economy, and Sunday \nwas the Lord's day. The polling places were usually in the county seat, \nso Monday was the day that you traveled to the county seat. You got to \nyour county seat on Tuesday, you cast your vote, you returned on \nWednesday, and you farmed on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. That may \nhave made sense in 1845, but it doesn't make the same sense in 2016.\n  As a result of reserving this one Tuesday as voting day, most \nAmericans report that they didn't vote because they just couldn't vote \non Tuesday. Some people have two jobs, three jobs, and they are raising \nfamilies. As important as it is to be a good citizen and to cast their \nvote, they are finding it harder and harder.\n  The solution is very simple. I am going to make another quick \ncomment. The solution is very simple. Allow people to vote on weekends. \nDesignate Saturday and Sunday for voting. You can do it on a Saturday; \nyou can do it on a Sunday. But we ought to designate weekend voting.\n  There are other democracies in the world, other nations in the world, \nthat have weekend voting, and their voting participation is much higher \nthan ours.\n  If there is one thing the government should do to make it more \nconvenient for middle class citizens and working families, it is make \nit more convenient to vote, and we can do that on weekends.\n\n  Let me make one other point if I could. I made a decision that I \nwould not run for reelection. My decision was based on a broad range of \npersonal issues and personal considerations, personal desires, to do \nother things. I have been here for 16 years. It is time to pass the \ntorch.\n  But I will tell you what. One of the factors was that I could not \nstand to\n\n[[Page H700]]\n\nspend one more day asking one more donor for one more dollar.\n  We have a system that used to be dysfunctional. Now it is not \ndysfunctional. It is just beyond broken. It is a system that tells \npeople around the country that their voices are drowned out. There is a \nsense--particularly among the young people that you have engaged across \nthis country--that the only way you get heard in this place is if you \nhave a super-PAC or a registered lobbyist with you. Most middle class \nfamilies and most young people can't afford a super-PAC or a registered \nlobbyist.\n  I am concerned that we have a majority right now that has made \nCongress a gated community. We need to bring down those gates. The way \nto bring down those gates is to pass campaign finance reform; it is to \npass the DISCLOSE Act, which Democrats passed when we had the majority, \nrequiring that people know who are funding elections; that we pass \nweekend voting so it is easier for people to cast their votes and \nchoose their democracy, so that their democracy is not chosen by \nliterally a few hundred families, by passing something that our \ncolleague, John Sarbanes, talked about earlier: citizen-funded \nelections.\n  If you want a stake in democracy and if you want to own democracy, \nyou should have a share in that democracy. We ought to be encouraging \ncitizen-funded elections, which are being done in States across the \ncountry--Republican states, Democratic States. They are embracing \ncitizen-funded elections. We should be doing the same thing.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. You wrote a New York Times op-ed on this \nthat was very frank, very passionate, and I think, for a lot of people, \nvery disturbing to hear how much time Members of Congress have to spend \nfundraising.\n  I just want to ask you as you start your parting tour, which I am \nvery sad to see, but have you met a single colleague in this Chamber on \neither side--left or right--who told you that they came here because \nthey enjoyed raising money, or that that is the most enjoyable part, or \nanywhere close to the most enjoyable part of their job?\n  Mr. ISRAEL. No. In fact, I did write a piece in the New York Times \nthat went viral. I received responses on both sides of this aisle--on \nboth sides--people saying: You are right, we spend too much time in \ncall time. Instead of thinking about issues, instead of thinking about \na robust foreign policy that is going to defeat our enemies, we spend \ntoo much time trying to figure out a robust fundraising policy to get \nreelected. Both sides of the aisle said that.\n  Not one of our colleagues enjoy fundraising. But, in my view, there \nis only one party who is willing to do something about it. Pass the \nDISCLOSE Act, support campaign finance reform, demand transparency.\n  The only way we are going to take this government back and make \nAmerica great again is to engage voters across the spectrum by lowering \nthe barriers that exist in this place. That is going to require the \nDISCLOSE Act, citizen-funded elections, greater transparency, and \nweekend voting.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. That is right. Both sides from my \nexperience acknowledge this problem, but only the majority has the \nability to bring this up for a vote on these reforms.\n  I always have the sense that we can all smell the burning and the \nsmoke in this House, but the fire alarm is on this side of the Chamber. \nUntil our colleagues are willing to pull it and bring these issues to \nthis floor, we are going to see millennials continue to think that the \nsystem is rigged. It is not going to be any surprise when they show up \nagain at 20 to 25 percent at the polls.\n  In your district in Long Island, young people, what do they think \nwhen they see all this money in politics, that they are the largest \ngeneration in America, yet 158 families contributed over 50 percent so \nfar in the 2016 Presidential cycle? What do you hear from them as far \nas whether that makes them want to engage or participate?\n  Mr. ISRAEL. I am very fortunate because I represent a district in New \nYork that is blessed with universities and colleges. We have a \nwonderful infrastructure of university and college campuses, and I \ntoured those campuses and heard what you have heard: Congressman, my \nvoice doesn't count. Congressman, why should I vote when it makes no \ndifference? Congressman, why should I get involved in a campaign when \nmy $20 contribution, or my $3 contribution, gets drowned out by one \nbillionaire who is writing checks for millions of dollars for the \ncandidate that he supports?\n  I have said to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, it is bad \nfor all of us when an entire generation gives up on us. That is just \nbad for democracy. That is bad for trying to accomplish anything.\n  I have also said--and people understand this, I believe, \nintuitively--no matter what issue is important to you, no matter what \nit is--more investments in education or infrastructure or national \nsecurity or your paycheck or the environment--no matter what it is, it \nis all rooted in a system that doesn't allow progress on those issues \nbecause it is rigged against progress on those issues.\n  People say: Well, what can we do? What is the one thing we can do to \nget our voice back? Get this Congress to pass fundamental and \nmeaningful campaign reform and we will make progress on every other \nissue.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I will never forget at one of our \ntownhalls when we were in the Boston area. The students were listing \ntheir concerns from climate change and the inaction they have seen \nthere, to student loan debt and how it has them in financial quicksand. \nTo my surprise--and then I ended up seeing this on every campus we \nvisited--this particular student said: But, yeah, you are not going to \nsolve any of that because the system is rigged. As long as that is the \nperception, which we experience as our own reality, we won't see \nprogress on those issues.\n  We owe it to that generation. It is sad for you to acknowledge that a \nwhole generation is about to give up on us until we change the way that \nwe not only have rules for money and politics, but the way that we \ngovern and represent our constituents, not outside corporate interests.\n  We have a Future Forum event coming up in Denver. It is going to be \nin April, hosted by Congresswoman DeGette and Congressman Polis.\n  I will give you, Congressman Israel, the last word on this evening's \nFuture Forum focusing on voting rights and campaign financial reform.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Again, I thank the gentleman so much for his leadership.\n  If you would allow an aging 57-year-old to attend the Future Forum \nmeetings, I would be happy to do so. I will bring my crutch, my cane, \nand all of the other things that I need.\n  On a serious note, I really do want to commend you for the work that \nyou are doing, for the engagement. Through this engagement, you are \ngiving people hope. You are letting people know that there are people \nwho are listening to them. You go to those events without a super-PAC. \nYou go to those events without billionaire donors. You are representing \nthe best that the grassroots has to offer. I want to thank you for \nthat.\n  Leave people with a sense of hope. For as long as we are talking on \nthis floor about these issues, there is hope that something will be \ndone on this floor on these issues, and the middle class and young \npeople and millennials will make progress again.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H700-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H700-H707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AMERICA'S MANDATORY AND DISCRETIONARY SPENDING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, we are actually doing something a little \ndifferent tonight. We have brought about 15 to 20--what we will call--\nboards. If we were in a more electronic age, they would be PowerPoints.\n  We will have a couple of our brothers and sisters here, hopefully, \nfrom the Republican side to help us walk through some of these numbers \nand what they actually mean. We want to talk about what is really going \non fiscally, mathwise. I am sure it was riveting reading for Members of \nthis body;\n\n[[Page H701]]\n\nbut 3 weeks ago, on a Wednesday--so 3 weeks ago today--the CBO issued a \nnew report. When you go through the numbers of the reality of what is \ngoing on, it is devastating.\n  The reality is that, unless this body engages in activities and \npolicy and we have a President who is willing to work with us who \ndramatically improves economic growth and not just for a year but for \nthe next couple of decades, there is not enough revenue to cover the \nentitlement promises we have made. I know that is sort of inflammatory \nto say, but we are going to actually walk through a series of the \nboards and sort of explain what is really going on.\n  For someone who is actually out there who may have an interest in \nunderstanding what is happening, this is the CBO report from 3 weeks \nago. What makes this one so different from any other report that has \nhappened is that we have two major entitlement programs that run out of \nmoney--that go bankrupt--within the 10-year window.\n  For years, you would see people walk up to these microphones and say: \nA decade or two from now, such and such is going to happen--30 years, \n25 years from now. It is no longer decades. It is now. We are going to \nshow you a couple of portions of the data where, in 20 months, Social \nSecurity itself goes negative, meaning the interest income that we pay \nourselves--and we pay ourselves 3.1 percent in interest income from the \nmoney that the general fund has reached over and taken out of the \nSocial Security trust fund, and the tax revenues from Social Security \ndo not cover the money going out the door. This was not supposed to \nhappen.\n  When I first got here 5 years ago, it was a decade away. Then, in \nsome of the reports, it was 5 years. Now it is 20 months away.\n  We need to understand, when we talk about the desperate need for \neconomic growth, it is jobs; it is people's futures; it is their \nretirements; it is also the ability to support and pay for and finance \nthe promises this government has made--the earned benefits and--let's \nface it--some of the unearned benefits that are out there and our \nability to pay for them. So let's actually walk through some of the \nboards and sort of explain where we are. This is really, really \nimportant, and you are going to hear me say that over and over as we do \nthis.\n  This is the 2016 budget as we have it today. Do you see what is in \nblue--that bluish purple? That is what we call mandatory spending. That \nis Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, interest on the debt, veterans' \nbenefits, ObamaCare--the new healthcare law--and a handful of other \npoverty support programs, but it is mandatory. It is all formula \ndriven. You will notice it is 70 percent of our spending in the fiscal \nyear we are in--this year. The red--that 30 percent--is what we call \ndiscretionary. That is what we get to vote on around here. Half of that \ndiscretionary is defense. When you hear politicians or public policy \nanalysts or budget analysts talk, if they are not talking about the \nmandatory spending, they are missing, basically, three-quarters of our \nspending. Understand its rate of growth is squeezing out everything \nelse.\n  If you are someone out there who cares about healthcare research or \neducation or the parks, the resources for those activities in this \ngovernment are shrinking and shrinking and getting squeezed and getting \nsqueezed, and it is because of the movement of mandatory spending.\n  We have this thing called baby boomers. The fact of the matter is \nthat baby boomers began to retire about 3 years ago, and there are \nabout--what?--76 million of them who will retire in an 18-year period, \nand they do consume tremendous amounts of resources that we have failed \nto set aside for their futures.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just changed the boards. As we continue, the board \nthat is up right now, for those folks who would be interested, is \nactually where the money is going today. My friend from Pennsylvania \nand I are going to talk through some of the mechanics here; but Social \nSecurity today is 22 percent of the spending; Medicare is 17; Medicaid \nis nine; other spending--that would be Section 8, SNAP, and other \nthings that are mandatory spending that are in the formula--is another \n17 percent.\n  Mr. PERRY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Arizona.\n  When I start my townhall meetings, I always start with our fiscal \nsituation because people ask me--and I imagine it is the same in your \ndistrict--what is wrong with you people in Washington? Why can't you \nget along? What is all the bickering about? That slide is instructive \nbecause I explain to them that nearly 70 percent of the budget we don't \ndiscuss at all, and it keeps getting smaller--the things that they kind \nof associate with the Federal Government--because, in their minds, \nthese other things, the things you talked about--Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, care for our veterans, the ACA--all just happens \nautomatically, and they think about--oh, I don't know--the IRS, the \nPark Service, the military. I keep telling them that it gets smaller, \nand so we squabble more over this diminishing pie.\n  I just need you to clarify something. So you say it is formula \ndriven. That makes sense to you, and it makes sense to me.\n\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Yes.\n  Mr. PERRY. But can you make that easy for a layman?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. You and I have both had this experience because we \ntalked about it earlier. You get asked at our townhalls and at other \ngatherings: Why do you fight with each other? It is like other \nfamilies--it is about the money.\n  When I stand here and say it is formula driven, what happens is, when \nyou turn 65, you are eligible for certain earned benefits. When you \nturn 67, there are certain earned benefits. If you fall below a certain \nincome, there are certain things you can receive. They are based on a \nformula whether it be your age, whether it be your income, whether it \nbe your military service. That formula becomes sort of sacrosanct \naround here, and there is an inability to say, if we do these tweaks, \nwe can preserve this benefit for future generations or even, as you are \ngoing to see in some of these numbers--and I don't know if you have had \nthis experience in your townhalls where the political class before us \nused to say, ``This is for your grandkids.'' Then, after a few years, \nit was for your kids--and now?\n  Mr. PERRY. It is for my mother, who is already on Social Security, \nand it is definitely for me and for anybody who thinks he may collect \nSocial Security, understanding that, when we say ``entitlements,'' that \nis not meant to be you are entitled to it. Do you know why you are \nentitled to it?--because the government forced you to pay into it. They \nforced you to invest when it comes to Social Security, right? They \nforced you to invest. It might not be a good investment, but you must \ninvest. It is important, and I think you are going to talk about this a \nlittle bit in the future of how that investment is going.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. As we do this, we probably should make the \ndistinction between an earned benefit and an entitlement and those, \nbut, for right now, we are going to somewhat refer to them as \n``mandatory spending.''\n  Mr. PERRY. Sure.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. We could actually break down all of the programs, but \nthis is already a little geeky as it is because we are going to be \ntalking about numbers that are in the billions and trillions, and \npeople's eyes glaze over when you talk about that. It means zeros. Yet \nwhat is really, really important here is understanding the pattern of \nwhat is going on and how quickly these numbers are eroding.\n  One of the reasons for this board here is, as we talk about this \nCongressional Budget Office report, some of the erosion in our fiscal \nsituation is because of our lack of economic growth and of our failure \nto reform, repair, preserve a lot of these very programs we are talking \nabout.\n  There is this slide here. This is 2026. Understand, in 9 years, \nmandatory spending, earned benefits, and other types of entitlements \nare going to have increased over those 9 years 83 percent in spending. \nWhat you and I get to vote on of military and other discretionary--the \nPark Service, the EPA, education, health, medical research--that will \nhave grown 22 percent. That\n\n[[Page H702]]\n\nis over 10 years. So think of this. What we would consider \ndiscretionary will grow about what we expect inflation to be, and that \nis how it has been budgeted. It is meant to basically be flat on \npurchasing power but where the entitlements grow dramatically.\n  Mr. PERRY. Because of the formula.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Formula and--we have to be brutally honest--\ndemographics.\n  Mr. PERRY. Right, and the population growth for those people who will \nbe receiving benefits.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Yes.\n  Look, this isn't a sinister plot. I can remember, back in 1981 or in \n1982, sitting in a statistics class, and the professor at that time was \nactually showing how much money had to be set aside because the baby \nboomers eventually were going to turn 65. Though, as you have found \nhere in Congress, it is almost as if we have just recently discovered \nthat.\n  Mr. PERRY. We have a tendency in Congress--quite honestly, we have a \ntendency as Americans--with our domestic and foreign policy, to just \npretend that these things aren't happening.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Yes.\n  There are a number of times you and I have folks who come to our \noffices or to our townhalls who have great ideas, and they desperately \nwant some more resources for this research project or for this activity \nor for this infrastructure or for this and that. You try to explain--\nokay--this board here talks about the next 9 years; so from this budget \nyear--where we are right now working on the 2017 budget--for the next 9 \nyears. I know that seems like a long time, but the average over that \ntime--76 percent of all of the spending, three-quarters of all of the \nspending--is going to be in those mandatory: the formula, the \nentitlements, the earned benefits. Only 24 percent of the spending is \ngoing to be in the military or in other activities of government.\n  As we go back to make that circle again, why do we fuss with each \nother around here? It is about the money when you have someone standing \nin front of you and he is not talking about the need to do two things. \nNow, they are big things. One is to dramatically adopt policy that \ngrows the economy. We are not going to make it under this current \ngrowth rate. This Obama economy is just killing us. Number two, we are \ngoing to have to be honest about the benefits that we provide and the \nformulas underlying them. There may be some creative things we can do, \nbut as the political class, we have got to stop being terrified to talk \nabout it.\n  Mr. PERRY. What are the consequences of not doing that?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Oh, we are going to get to that slide.\n  Do you plan to live more than 9 years?\n  Mr. PERRY. I sure hope so. My kids hope so.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. You are incredibly fit. Understand, I am going to \nshow you some slides under the new projections by the CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, that came out 3 weeks ago.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Mr. Speaker, Social Security, the trust fund has about 14 years, but \nMedicare part A is gone in about 9 years. You are going to see Social \nSecurity disability may have only about 58 months, and that trust fund \nis gone again. So understand how fast these things are eroding.\n  Look, we are going through a lot of data and a lot of slides. I know \nyou and I and a couple of other Members, we are going to be putting \nthis deck of slides on our Web sites. For anyone that is actually \ninterested in the fiscal sanity and health of this country, this is the \nability to take a look at them, analyze them, give us suggestions, and \ngive us creativity.\n  This one right here, so, in 2026, think of this: only 22 percent of \nthe spending will be in what you and I get to vote on. Half of that is \ngoing to be defense; half of that is going to be nondefense.\n  Oh, and by the way, the one good thing I can tell you about we are \ngetting from the slow-growth economy right now is we have reprojected \nour interest rate. Because if I had shown this slide a few months ago, \nwe were expecting trillion-dollars-plus interest. Now, we only expect a \nmuch lower mean interest rate 9 years from now. So only 12 percent of \nour spending will be interest coverage.\n  Think of that. Interest will be greater than defense in 9 years. \nInterest will be greater than all discretionary spending in 9 years--\nand substantially so. So the growth you are going to see here is \nfunctionally in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the \ndebt, and some of the other programs. This is where we are at.\n  You try having a conversation with our constituents and say these are \nbig numbers, they are huge programs. You have got to move away from \nsome of the political folklore.\n  We should actually, as we go through these--because I have a couple \nof spots. How many times have you been at your townhall meeting and \nsomeone raises their hand? Some of the suggestions they have to save \nmoney are wonderful, but they are tiny.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. They want to cut something.\n  Why do you spend money on--I don't know. They call them Obama funds. \nOr why do you spend money on foreign aid? If we just cut that, we don't \nhave to pay for people to hate us. They will hate us for free. It all \nsounds all well and good, except you can cut all that completely and--I \nthink you will show at some point--it won't make a dent. It won't even \nbegin to make a dent.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, those of us on the right who are more \nconservative--we have our folks who are guilty of this, and, heaven \nknows, I see it from our friends on the left--where we hold up a shiny \nobject and pretend like this would take care of this fiscal cliff that \nis no longer very far in the future. It is here. We say, oh, if we \nwould just adjust this on foreign aid, we would be fine. Anyone who \nsays something like that, they don't own a calculator.\n  So the slide next to us right now--and the gentleman and I were \nworking on this earlier today. I thank the gentleman and his staff for \ntheir willingness to sit there and, shall we say, geek out with \ncalculators, budgets, and actuarial tables.\n  One of the things that has happened--about every 3 months, I do one \nof these presentations. If someone were ever to go back a few years \nwhen we did the very first one, parts of these numbers have actually \ngotten much worse. Even though we are supposedly out of the recession \nand we are supposed to be in a healthier economy, as we keep being told \nfrom the other side, the fiscal, the financial shape of the country is \nworse.\n  How is that possible?\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to make the argument that when we do examine \nwhat we were telling folks our financial situation was in the future, \nit is actually much worse. In 2011 we said, hey, when we finally get to \nthat year 2016, we are going to have 3.3 percent GDP. Then we had a \ncouple of crazy ones that said, in 2012 and '13, you are going to be at \n4\\1/2\\ or 4.4 percent GDP growth. You are going to be blowing the \nwheels off.\n  Then in 2014, it started to come down. Well, you are going to be at \n3.4 percent GDP growth. The problem is that the latest update on our \nnumbers, we are down to 2.3 percent GDP growth. So we are half of what \nwe were telling the public we were going to have just a couple of years \nago.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. More importantly, for this illustration, it is as \nimportant that we were telling the public--because the CBO projection \ntold us that it was going to be 4.5, 4.4, but we were basing all our \nestimates on those numbers. We are basing our estimates on those \nnumbers, and those numbers turned out to be true to the point that it \nis not even 2.3. It is more like 2.1, currently. It is even less than \nthat.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. As you know, the first quarter of this budget year--\nbecause budget years aren't the same as calendar years--came in at 0.7. \nSo we didn't even make a full percentage point of gross domestic \nproduct growth.\n  Once again, this is geeky and people's eyes are glazing over. Why \nthis is important is because that economic growth is what helps create \nthe jobs and the trade and the velocity in the economy, and that \nvelocity ends up creating the tax revenues and the revenues that get \npaid into Medicare, get\n\n[[Page H703]]\n\npaid into Social Security, help us pay and cover our promises.\n  What happens if you keep saying the check is out the door but you \ndon't have the revenues? That is why it is important to pay attention \nto what we do in tax policy over this coming year, what we do in \nregulatory policy over this coming year, when we start to take on those \nfactors that grow the economy.\n  I would think this would be both our friends from the left, who \nthought somehow we could regulate ourselves into prosperity, would see \nthe folly of their policies and see it in the numbers and be willing to \ncome our direction. Because do they care about saving Social Security? \nDo they care about saving Medicare? Do they care about saving Social \nSecurity disability? If they truly care, we have got to do something \nabout economic growth.\n  I want to switch up a couple of the boards and just sort of walk \nthrough some of the different numbers here and have this make more \nsense. Do you have the table that actually shows the change from 2022 \nto 2018?\n  Remember, the last board I was showing you that was talking about, \nhey, here is what happens when we miss all these GDP numbers? This is \nwhy, on occasion, I desperately wish more of our brothers and sisters \naround this body would grab a CBO like this and actually read it and \nhighlight it and pull out their calculators and look at it again. Yes, \nyou are going to fall asleep two or three times when you do it, but you \nwill understand how incredibly important some of the policy sets are we \nare making here.\n  This was just from when the trust funds' actuaries did their report \nthis last summer. We will just go down to the bottom line because that \nis the punch line.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, would the gentleman from Arizona confirm for \nthe audience or explain what OASI and DI mean?\n\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. When you see something that says OASI, that means \n``Old Age, Survivors Insurance.'' That is Social Security. That is \nSocial Security.\n  DI, think of it is as Social Security disability.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. You lose your job from unemployment, but you get hurt and \nyou can't work?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. A permanent injury that changes your ability to \nsupport yourself.\n  As you know, this last fall, fall of 2015, it was to be out of money \nright now.\n  We bailed it out, but we bailed it out in a fairly dodgy fashion. \nLet's be brutally honest. We reached over into big Social Security, \ntook $114 billion and handed it over here. All we bought was 5 years of \nfiscal survivability.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. So you took $114 billion out of OASI, which is the big \nSocial Security?\n  We took it out of that and put it into disability insurance because \ndisability was going to be bankrupt while we stand here today?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Right. Right now.\n  My calculations are we shortened the life of Social Security's trust \nfund by about 13 months when we did that. I don't think you voted for \nit. I don't think I did. I know I didn't. Now we have to deal with the \nrealities of what that meant.\n  As we were looking before, what happens when you are not achieving \nthe economic growth that is required? All of a sudden, you see numbers \nlike this. And this is stunning. When you are talking about a huge \ntrust fund, this should not be happening.\n  This is to give you a sense of how dramatic the problem is out there \nin this economy. I know we are happy talking. It is an election year \nand President Obama needs to sort of tell a story of how wonderful it \nis, but it isn't showing up on the map.\n  So this last August, the trustees of Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity--they all do their individual reports. The Social Security \ntrustee said interest income and tax revenues would cover the payments \ngoing out the door on Social Security until 2022, except for the small \nproblem of, somehow between August and 3 weeks ago when we got this new \nupdated report, it is down to 2018. Now, all of a sudden, Social \nSecurity goes negative, meaning it doesn't have enough revenues to \ncover its obligations.\n  So the way we were doing the math is, in 20 to 22 months, Social \nSecurity is going to have to start reaching over and cash in some of \nits bonds. We pay ourselves 3.1 percent interest in the washing machine \nwhere the general fund has reached over to the Social Security trust \nfund, taken the money, and loaned it to our debt.\n  This is devastating. If any of you have ever been in business or \nfinance, when you start to use up principal, you are in real trouble.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. So we lost 4 years. What caused losing 4 years?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. It is a combination of economy, growth rate, reaching \nover and taking $114 billion out to shore up Social Security \ndisability, and our recalculation of what future GDP is.\n  Just for the fun of it, can I talk my friend from South Carolina into \njoining us, A, because it is always entertaining when you get behind a \nmicrophone, and, B, you have no hesitation to correct me when I get \nmath wrong.\n  I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Well, anything for fun, Mr. Schweikert.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from South Carolina and I \nhave talked about these charts before, and the reality of this should \nterrify people how fast these numbers are eroding. Where is the \nconversation? Why isn't it a headline? Why isn't it on business news \nevery night?\n  If I came to you and said you just lost 4 years of actuarial \nsoundness on a trust fund that today is $2.8 trillion, you have got to \nunderstand the scale we are talking about.\n  I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. The real frustrating thing about it, Mr. Schweikert, is \nthat the demographic group that you would hope would be engaged in this \ntopic isn't. When you go home and you and I and Mr. Perry talk to our \nfolks back home, who is most interested in Social Security? The folks \nwho are already at or near retirement.\n  You have got another graph, by the way, that shows who really should \nbe interested in this because you have got the first year outgoing \nexceeds income, including interest. On another graph, you show when the \ntrust fund goes to zero for Social Security.\n  The last time I had the CBO run the numbers, it was roughly 2032. In \nfact, it was July of 2032. Why do I remember this? It is the month that \nI turn 65 years old. It should be our generation. It should be the \npeople in their thirties, forties, and fifties who are demanding that \nwe make this a topic of conversation, and they don't.\n  They are not demanding it right now in the Presidential election. \nThey are not demanding it in their congressional elections. They are \nmore concerned about other things that I get the importance, as Mr. \nPerry does, of national defense and immigration. I get all that.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. How do you and I and Mr. Perry help the public \nunderstand these numbers in the background are driving much of our \npolicy here, much of the fussing here, but yet it is not part of the \nPresidential campaign, and this is no longer about your grandkids? This \nno longer about your kids. It is about you retire--you turn 65 in what \nyear?\n  I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. 2032.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. You will be happy to know that my math is Social \nSecurity will have been emptied out 2 years before you retire. I mean, \nit is 14 years from now. So these are just critical.\n  I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Yet it is not our generation. It is Mr. Buck's \ngeneration, the gentleman from Colorado, the older generation, the next \ngeneration who is paying closer attention to it.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I am not going there.\n  Let's walk through a couple of the other trust funds because I know \nthis is\n\n[[Page H704]]\n\nreally exciting, but this is important. This is the 10,000-pound \ngorilla in the room. So often those of us, as Members of Congress, we \nget behind these microphones and we do the shiny object type of \ndiscussion.\n  This is it. This is going to decide what our military capability is \nbecause it is what we can afford. This is going to decide what money we \nhave for medical research and education. This is it. These numbers are \nincredibly important. If this doesn't drive us this year to start \nmoving forward on tax reform, on regulatory reform, things that will \nstart to kick-start economic growth, these numbers are devastating.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  Let's do a little quick discussion about Medicare part A. If I came \nto you right now and said: ``Hey, what was so devastating in this \nCongressional Budget Office report? What should have scared you out of \nyour mind?'', in here it basically for the very first time said one of \nthe major trust funds is out of money in the 10-year window.\n  Mr. PERRY. Ten years.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Look at this. If you plan to be around 9 years from \nnow, Medicare part A, what covers your hospital, those types of section \nin Medicare, it is gone. The trust fund is gone.\n  So all of a sudden now are we willing to do what Speaker Ryan has \ntalked about for years, premium support, some way to reform the way we \nprice and cost and the benefits we receive and how we allocate them and \nprice theory, you know, sort of thinking like an economist, but things \nthat make sure you get your earned benefit, but we also make it \nsustainable?\n  It is no longer a theoretical conversation for decades from now. It \nis in 9 years. So if you plan to live for 9 more years, understand, \nMedicare part A, the trust fund, is gone.\n  In our calculations in our office, it could be 30 percent cut in what \nis able to be paid out. How many medical professionals are willing to \nsee you when you come in and say that you need your cataract done, you \nneed a heart valve, you need this and, oh, by the way, the hospital is \nonly going to be paid 30 percent less what it gets today? Are they \nstill going to see you? Do you understand the wall we are going to be \nputting our seniors in? This happens in 9 years.\n  How many Presidential candidates have you seen or heard talk about \nthis?\n  Mr. PERRY. I haven't seen any talk about that.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. So now let's talk about the other trust fund that was \nin the Congressional Budget Office report, something we shored up this \nlast fall. You remember how we did it? We reached over and grabbed $114 \nbillion out of Social Security, old-age survivors, and moved it over to \nSocial Security disability.\n  In the discussions around here, people were happy. They were \napplauding. I thought we had fixed it for years. Remember there were \ngoing to be some reforms and some of these things? Well, these numbers \nare with the reforms and with the money, and it is gone in 58 months.\n  Mick, I am going to make you stand up again because you were one of \nthe most articulate in talking about the scale of reforms we had. Both \nwere just, in the modern economy, were there ways we could help our \nbrothers and sisters who are on Social Security disability move back \ninto at least some economic participation and not have them hit a cliff \nwhere all of a sudden their benefits are cut off.\n  It might cost us a little bit for a couple years, but in the future \nit would become more sustainable. We didn't do it. Now we are back on \nthe treadmill again.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. I have got a question for you. While we are preparing \nthat question, if the young man could put up the previous graph below, \nthat one that shows the status of the Medicare trust fund.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. It is stunning to think, in 9 years, Social Security \ndisability----\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Put them so we can see both of them at the same time, \nplease.\n  That is stunning. So between 2021 and 2025, we are going to have the \nSocial Security disability fund go broke----\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Yes.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. And Medicare part A go broke.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Correct.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Last time we fixed the Social Security disability--I am \nmaking the air quotations when I say fixed disability--by robbing from \nold-age retirement.\n  Where are we going to rob from the next time when we have both \nMedicare and Social Security disability going bust within a couple of \nmonths of each other?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Look, the ultimate driver for all of these trust \nfunds, for everything around us, would be incredibly robust economic \ngrowth. Math problem.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. What are the assumptions on this, by the way?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Oh, no. We are working on those tables because it \nturns out to be much more complicated. A couple years ago, when we were \npretending we would hit 2016 and be at 4\\1/2\\ percent GDP growth, if \nyou hit that number and could hold it, we were going to be okay.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. How many times, Mr. Schweikert, have we held 4\\1/2\\ \npercent growth for, say, a decade?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I don't think it has ever been done, ever.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. I think that is a fair assumption.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. In this environment, in the fourth quarter of last \nyear, which is the first quarter of our fiscal year, we were at, what, \n0.7?\n  Mr. MULVANEY. As this year stands, it looks like now, when they \nrevise the last quarter's numbers, which they will do here shortly, \n2015 will be the tenth year in a row without 3 percent growth in the \nAmerican economy.\n  If that turns out to be the case and we go 10 years without 3 percent \ngrowth during any of that decade, it will be the first time in the \nhistory of the Nation that that has happened.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. And then you try to have the conversation with our \nfriends from the left saying: You don't think the regulatory state \naffects us? You don't think raising taxes has slowed down the economy?\n  There is some actual great literature--and we are working on it for a \nfuture presentation--that says, for the tax hikes that the President \ndemanded a couple years ago that this body did, for every dollar of new \nrevenues that came in, a dollar was lost in economic growth.\n  It got us nothing. It basically slowed down our economic growth into \nthe future, ultimately costing us billions. In a couple of these \nprograms, if you really lay it out over 30 years, it could be in the \ntrillions.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Schweikert, I see you brought up the graph for the \nSocial Security trust fund. Have you explained what the nature of the \ntrust fund is?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. No, I haven't. I may let you do that. Let me just \npitch what this one means.\n  In 2011, when I first got here and I started this project in our \noffice, we actually set up a little team in our office we call the \nideas shop. We actually grind out these numbers all the time, and we \nwatch them like a hawk.\n  We actually do something fun. When the trustee reports come out, we \nsit there with our yellow highlighters and read them as a group. The \namazing thing is I have almost no staff turnover, which I can't figure \nout why they stay.\n  I hear some of my staff laughing in the background.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. No. That is us, actually.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. In 2011, this was the chart. I just want you to look. \nWhat is the direction? The trust fund was supposed to grow and grow and \ngrow up until 2021.\n  There was going to be more money there every year. This is what we \nwere telling ourselves, telling the public, telling the financial \nmarkets just 5 years ago.\n  Now take a look when we look at the new budget projection. And \nunderstand we went from saying these trust funds are going to grow.\n\n  So when you and I first got here, I think the Social Security trust \nfund was supposed to survive to 2038, and now we have taken 8 or 9 \nyears off that. This is the new number that just came out in the \nreport, that, in 22 months, it starts to go negative and we start to \ndip into the principal balance.\n  In 14 years--and you will see that in the next chart because in the \nnext one\n\n[[Page H705]]\n\nI take it beyond the 10-year projection because we had to do our own \ncalculations for the final 4 because they only give you 10 years when \nthey do the projections--in 14 years, the trust fund is gone.\n  Look, I know you have talked about how the trust fund works.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Yeah. The trust fund is actually fairly simple. A lot \nof people think that it doesn't exist. They think it is a myth. It is \nreal.\n  What it represents is the accumulated excess collections that Social \nSecurity has made over the years. I tell people that the last time we \nreally had a major overhaul of Social Security was back in the 1980s.\n  Ever since then, we have taken more money in every month in Social \nSecurity taxes, FICA, than we have paid out in benefits.\n  So if you take $100 in in a particular month and only spend $80, you \nhave $20 left over. That is the money that goes into the trust fund. It \nis essentially a savings account.\n  Now, when people say, oh, it doesn't really exist, you have stolen \nmoney from it, and it is not there, that is not true. You can't keep \n$20, real paper money, in an account someplace, in a desk. That would \nbe foolish.\n  What we do is we invest in the only thing the Social Security \nAdministration is allowed to invest in, which is U.S. treasuries. There \nis actually in excess of $2 trillion in the trust fund.\n  The trust fund exists. It is in a drawer in West Virginia in a \nbuilding named after Senator Byrd, as most of the buildings are in West \nVirginia. It is full of treasuries.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Actually, General Perry and I were talking about \nthat. You don't mind me calling you that, do you?\n  Mr. PERRY. Carry on.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Our official military expert. It was helicopters, \nwasn't it?\n  Mr. PERRY. Indeed.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. We were talking about earlier that my calculations \nare that, as of right now today, it is a little under $2.8 trillion of \nspecial Treasury notes that have been given from the Treasury to the \nSocial Security trust fund because that cash has been moved over here.\n  And the revenues that go into Social Security are a combination of \nthe FICA taxes. And would you believe we pay ourselves 3.1 percent \ninterest?\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Wow.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. It took us a while to find that number.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Do we actually pay that or we assume that?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. No. No. Technically, we are paying ourselves. So that \nis part of the revenue into Social Security right now and the Medicare \ntrust fund and all the three big trust funds. We are paying ourselves \n3.1 percent, which is actually greater than a 10-year T-bill \nsubstantially.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. That is a great investment right now. Yeah.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. So we are actually paying ourselves a SPIF, and we \nare still burning through our cash. That is why this board is up, to \nshow you how devastatingly different the number is from just this last \nAugust, how fast the numbers have moved.\n  But even if we go back to 2011, when we were doing these floor \npresentations, we thought we were talking 2038. You would have been 65-\nplus for a few years.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Could have been at Mr. Buck's age.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Yeah. I am not going there.\n  Sorry to the Speaker. We don't mean to be teasing you. Well, \nactually, we do. We are just afraid of it.\n  But this is really important. So if there is someone out there, \nwhether you are on the right or the left, and you actually care about \ngetting your earned benefits, you need to start demanding your elected \nofficials to take it seriously.\n  Number one is: What are you going to do to get this economy to grow? \nBecause that becomes the most powerful thing to fix these numbers.\n  These numbers are rotten and horrible because now we are projecting \nlong-term GDP around 2.2, 2.5. When you start looking at numbers in \nthere, it doesn't work. The math just doesn't work for us.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Schweikert, there is an ad campaign on television \nright now that speaks to this. I think it was on during the Super Bowl.\n  It shows a very dramatic bridge scene and the bridge slowly fades \ninto decay, and it says: This is what will happen to our economy. This \nis what will happen to our infrastructure because of entitlement \nspending.\n  Some folks don't like that term, but we use it here for Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security, and so forth.\n  It says: Demand of the Presidential candidates what their plan is to \nsolve this problem. Call or write your Member of Congress and demand \nwhat their plan is.\n  I have gotten one call. Have you gotten any?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Oh, it is amazing.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. How many people have called your office to say: Mr. \nSchweikert, what is your plan for fixing this?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I think it is zero. And I have actually had this \nexperience and I think Mr. Perry, my friend from Pennsylvania, had this \nexperience where we have held budget townhalls and we have held well \nover a hundred in our district over the last couple years.\n  We walk through the numbers and then have a discussion about it. I \nhave had an individual go to the microphone and basically use a curse \nword and then say: I don't care about my grandkids. I want every dime.\n  Part of the audience laughed. Part of the audience was terrified.\n  Maybe that was a more interesting discussion when it really was about \nyour great-grandkids or your grandkids or your kids.\n  You have to understand that the erosion of these numbers, \nsubstantially because of the growth of participation, utilization of \nthe benefits, and the horrible economic growth, is no longer future \ngenerations. This is us, particularly you. I didn't realize you were so \nold.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. It happens.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Can you see that date on this particular slide? I \nknow you have eagle eyes from flying those helicopters. Our number is \n2030, 2031. Right in there the Social Security trust fund is gone.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. And so what happens on that date?\n  Mr. PERRY. The only thing you have left to pay is from incoming \nrevenues from taxes. So your benefits are decreased by that whatever \nthat amount is at that time. So it probably fluctuates probably \nsomewhere between 25 and 30 percent.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. In some ways, it is actually more complicated, which \nI wasn't going to go there, but let's do it for the fun of it.\n  The Social Security revenues will be subject to the whims of the \neconomy. So you might have 1 month where you are able to pay out more \nand the next month you are paying out less because of the whims.\n  You also no longer have the interest revenue. If I handed you $2.8 \ntrillion today and paid you 3.1 percent, that is what is going into the \ntrust fund today. That is all gone. The interest revenues are gone.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  This is a double whammy we are talking about. That is why you never, \never, ever want to get anywhere near these numbers. You fix it long \nbefore. Because every day we wait, it gets harder to deal with. \nRemember, my calculations are that in about 22 months we start to move \ninto principal balance. We start eating our seed corn. And then, every \nday, the calculations get more difficult.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. You talked about how every day we wait, it gets harder \nto do. I remember giving a presentation similar to this at a retirement \ncommunity in my neighborhood. It was back during one of the first Ryan \nbudgets when we had actually talked about raising the benefit age \nslowly by a couple of months.\n  There was a gentleman there who was in his late fifties. He said: \nLook, I don't want to work another 2 or 3 years. I said: Sir, we are \nnot asking you to do that. He said: What are you asking me? I said: I \nam asking you to work an extra month. I am asking me to work an extra \nyear. I am asking my triplets to work an extra 2, but I am only asking \nyou to work an extra month. Can't you do that? He said: Of course, I \ncan do that. Will that fix things? I said: That will go a long way \ntowards fixing things.\n\n[[Page H706]]\n\n  He got angry that it was that easy and nobody had explained it to \nhim. I said: You are going to get even angrier. If we had done it 20 \nyears ago, it would be a week. If we wait another 20 years, you can \nnever fix it.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. You no longer can say 20 years or a couple of \ndecades. It is 14 years now.\n  I am the proud father of an infant. If you do the calculations, when \nshe reaches her peak earning years, her tax rates will be double what I \npay. And that is already done. We have already done that to our \nchildren.\n  You have got to understand the scale of what we have done. Doesn't \nshe have the right to participate in some of the same earned benefits \nthat we should have earned and hopefully will be there because we are \ngoing to find a way to fix them?\n  It is not like the left gets behind television cameras and screams at \nus or puts up television commercials of a Paul Ryan look-alike pushing \ngrandma off the cliff. That is political rhetoric. They are basically \npulling a scam on you. This is math.\n  I know we get folks in--I don't you know if you have ever had them at \nyour townhalls--saying: It doesn't feel right. But I don't have a \nfeelings button on my calculator. I have said that over and over to try \nto make the point that if you want us to protect your retirement \nfuture, you have got to demand that we step up and do it. It can be \ndone by a series of little things.\n  The reality is that Social Security is easy to fix. You can create a \nlittle smorgasbord of policy. Some might be aged, some might be folks \nwith certain assets and opting out. There are a whole series of \ncreative things to do. You give some optionality to young people. \nBecause those who now are going to live in sort of the ``gig'' economy \nhave the ability to put in 50 cents every time they have a transaction \nor by using the technology of these supercomputers we all carry in our \npocket.\n  Mr. PERRY. Many of your constituents hear, from time to time, whether \nit is the President, people on the other side--and, frankly, people on \nour side--say that we are reducing the deficits. They hear this.\n  If they don't come to your townhall meeting, they say: Well, the \ndeficit is smaller, right? So that is good. What is all this hara-kiri \nabout Social Security and debt. What is all the histrionics?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. We are going to get to that in a second, because you \nhave to understand how much the deficit has gone up this year. We have \na slide somewhere here that is going to tell us that.\n  May I ask the Speaker how much time I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Buck). The gentleman from Arizona has 12 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Let's actually run through these. Let's use our last \n12 minutes and get exactly to your point of where we are at and what \nhas been going on.\n  I put this one up specially for my friends who had fussed and wailed \nand complained about this thing called sequestration and how it was the \nend of the world. Basically, western civilization was going to be \ncollapsed to its knees.\n  What you see is that the red is sequestration and the green is \ndiscretionary spending without sequestration. If you see the blue bars \nthere, that is mandatory spending. That is Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, the new healthcare law, interest on the debt, and other \ntransfer programs. It explodes off the charts.\n  If our friends who complained about sequestration so much cared, they \nwould have talked about mandatory spending: the entitlements. But if \nyou look at the differential between that red and green, it is tiny. \nThe fact of the matter is, this year and next year it is actually gone.\n  Mr. PERRY. I don't think you can completely explain the green part of \nsequestration. As you can see, it moves above the red line on occasion \nabout 2017.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Basically, let's look at 2016 and 2017. There is no \nsequestration. We increased our spending. We blew up the sequestration \ncaps this last fall and last year.\n  Mr. PERRY. We wanted to spend more money.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. So the one thing that was holding us back on \ndiscretionary spending is gone, but under the law, it actually comes \nback in 2018. So that little tiny differential you see on that chart \nbetween the red and the green is sequestration.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Schweikert, would you like to wager a guess as to \nthe likelihood of that reduction staying in law is?\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. It has got to enrage us that if you really cared \nabout the country, you would have the two conversations we are \ndemanding: one, your willingness to change the Tax Code and the \nregulatory code--the things that help grow the economy--and; two, how \nare you going to deal with the mandatory spending--the entitlements--\nthat are blowing off the charts?\n  Mr. PERRY. But the bigger point of this slide, if you will, is that \neven with sequestration, you can see that, first of all, it is not \ndifferent from the normal program spending. It has absolutely nothing \nto do with the huge portion of spending which is mandatory that \neclipses everything we do, regardless.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Mulvaney and I have been having a running \nconversation about how we put together a budget for this coming year. \nOne of the discussions that we have been trying to calculate is, okay, \nthey blew up some of the spending caps last year. It is what it is. But \nif they had paid for that increased spending with reforms in \nentitlements, that is something that goes on and on and on and \nmultiplies out into the future.\n  Actually, it does a little bit to help our future and save the \nentitlements. It has sort of a multiplier effect because it lives in \nperpetuity. It is fascinating, because some of us are trying to pitch \nthat idea of give us a few things that we know actually have a \nmultiplier effect in the future as a way to start to deal with these \nnumbers.\n  I put this chart up. This is last year. We are going to do this real \nquickly. I will have it on the Web site, and I will ask both of you if \nyou are willing to do it, too.\n  You are at your town hall. You have a group walking into your office \ndemanding more money. You have got to understand that happens all day \nlong. Every 15 minutes, there is another meeting of another group that \nwants more money.\n  I will get groups that will come in and say: We want more money. If \nyou would just get rid of foreign aid, we will be just fine. Then you \npull this board out and say, Okay, you see the little red line there? \nThat is every dime of the State Department's budget. That is military \nforeign aid, foreign aid to Israel, humanitarian foreign aid, food aid, \nand all the embassies and their staff, and this and that.\n  It doesn't do anything. It is great rhetoric. It is a shiny object. \nIt does not do anything, unless you are talking about Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, other welfare programs, ObamaCare, interest on the \ndebt.\n  Understand that we are incredibly lucky. Interest on the debt this \nyear was supposed to be somewhere in the $600 billion range. Our \nprojection for the 2016 budget is maybe about $260 billion. We have \nbeen really lucky.\n  Mr. PERRY. It is the only benefit of a weak economy.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. It is also the benefit of a totally accommodating \nFederal Reserve, who sets the price of interest through things like \nquantitative easing, which is nothing more than printing money. They \nhave unnaturally depressed rates.\n  Depressed interest rates is nothing more than the cost of money. One \nof the direct beneficiaries of that has been this body. It has been \nmuch easier for us to run of these huge deficits--which is the annual \ndebt--and the overall debt, simply because it is essentially been free \nmoney for the last 6 or 7 years.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Mulvaney, would you agree that the cheap money, \nthe artificial liquidity, has kept Congress from doing what it knew it \nhad to do in reforming the entitlement programs?\n  Mr. MULVANEY. There is no question. At $16 trillion of debt, roughly, \nwhich is the public debt now, you are talking about interest rates \nbelow 2 percent.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. If you really want to get geeky, it is getting \nshorter because they are going shorter on what they call the weighted \ndaily average.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. The 40-year rolling average is about 6 percent. That is\n\n[[Page H707]]\n\nwhat money ordinarily costs the United States of America. It is about 6 \npercent if you look at it over a generational length of time.\n  If we simply regress to the mean and end up with money costing us \nabout 6 percent, you are talking about more than $1 trillion a year in \njust interest payments.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. It is coming.\n  This goes back to what my friend from Pennsylvania was commenting on. \nWhat do we look like in the year we are in right now? Functionally, we \nare going to be borrowing about $545 billion this year. This was \nsupposed to be one of the good years. Understand that the inflection \ndoesn't happen until 2018, when the debt starts to explode. This was \none of the good years.\n  Do you understand what $545 billion is? No one does. That is a lot of \nzeroes. It is $1.493 billion a day. It is $62 million a hour. But, \nthink of this. My favorite one is that it is $1 million a minute. It is \n$17,000 a second. And understand this goes up in 9 years. It basically \ntriples. This triples in 9 years. So, we are borrowing $17,000 a \nsecond, and that number triples in 9 years. I threw these together \nbecause I figured we would have a little bit of fun here.\n  So, we are holding a townhall. We get some of the groups that come in \nand fuss at us and say: Well, I saw somewhere on some news article that \nsaid you should get rid of subsidies for fossil fuels.\n  First off, it is depreciation, just like every business has, but \nlet's say you took away that depreciation from the production of \nnatural gas and oil. You took it all away.\n  If we are borrowing, functionally, $1.5 billion every single day, and \nyou took it all away, it would buy you 12 minutes and 41 seconds of \nborrowing coverage a day. There are 1,440 minutes in a day, and you \njust came up with a way to cover 13 minutes. It shows you how fake many \nof these rhetorical things are that we hear from the political class, \nparticularly the left.\n  Let's actually take the next step. What about green energy? Did you \nknow green energy has three times the subsidies of fossil fuels?\n  Let's say you took every dime of the $36.7 million day that green \nenergy gets. That buys you almost 35 minutes a day. There are 1,440 \nminutes in a day. We took care of 12 minutes by getting rid of the tax \ndeductions and depreciation for fossil fuels. You got rid of 35 minutes \nand 24 seconds if you got rid of it all for renewables.\n  My point is, much of the rhetorical things we hear from the \nPresident, from our friends on the left, are completely frauds, \nmathematically. We have to understand something very, very simple. We \nare borrowing more than half a trillion dollars this year. In 20 \nmonths, the debt starts to explode.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Mr. Mulvaney, when you have actually been in front of some of your \naudiences in South Carolina, have you ever shown them the chart that \nthis year and next year were supposed to be the good years? It was \nsupposed to be fairly flat, and then it explodes.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Actually, I have been showing them that chart since you \nand I arrived in 2011 because the number has not changed significantly. \nWhen you and I arrived and served on the Budget Committee together in \n2011, we could have told people roughly what the deficit would have \nbeen this year. The projections have not changed.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. And what happened between last August and now that \nall of a sudden--remember, last year, the deficit was about $150 \nbillion lower than this, than we are going to run this year. Multiple \nthings happened:\n  We didn't come close to the economic growth we had built and modeled.\n  The movement of our citizens into certain programs has been greater \nthan expected, and fewer velocity.\n  We say unemployment is this, but when we actually look at the actual \ntax revenues coming from it, there is a disconnect. There is something \nhorribly wrong there. So there is something wrong in economic growth.\n  And then we blew up many of the sequestration caps last year.\n  Well, ultimately, we went from, I think we had a $420 billion, $430 \nbillion deficit last year, which was still stunning, and now we are \ngoing to be $545 billion.\n  Look, these are big numbers. It makes your brain hurt. They are \nuncomfortable. But what you have to appreciate, it is stunning, and it \ngets dramatically worse in 20 months. We hit what was called the \ninflection.\n  I remember reading about this a decade or two decades ago. It is when \nthe baby boom population has been moved in to retirement. And the \nspiking years are moving in, and they are starting to receive their \nearned benefits. Then we start adding a couple of hundred billion \ndollars every year in new borrowing, and it blows off the chart.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/10/house-section/article/H707-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed with an amendment in which the concurrence \nof the House is requested, a bill of the House of the following title:\n\n       H.R. 757.
