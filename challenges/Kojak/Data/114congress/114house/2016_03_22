The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, ``I look with increasing horror, along with \na growing number of other Americans, at the great and bitter division \nthat is taking place in our politics and the cynicism that is the end \nresult of power for power's sake. We are losing sight of civility in \ngovernment and politics. Debate and dialogue is taking a back seat to \nthe politics of destruction and anger and control. Dogma has replaced \nthoughtful discussion between people of differing views.''\n  Mr. Speaker, these words were spoken by then-Governor Jim McGreevey \nin his farewell address to the State of New Jersey in 2004, and I fear \nthat they are truer today than ever before.\n  With Congress back in town for just 3 days before a 2\\1/2\\-week \nbreak, all anyone wants to know is if, not even when, we might actually \nget some real work accomplished for the American people.\n  We are 3 months into the Second Session of the 114th Congress, and \nwhat do we have to show for it?\n  Sadly, our record of accomplishment is short.\n  To top it off, all our constituents are hearing in the media is the \nhateful rhetoric and vengefulness spewing from the mouths of the \ncandidates in the Presidential debates. And now, unfortunately, our \nthird branch of government can't escape the partisanship that is \nchoking our Federal Government.\n  This is not a new struggle for our great democracy. In fact, John \nAdams wrote to his wife about the same issue over 200 years ago. He \nwrote: ``I fear that in every assembly, Members will obtain an \ninfluence by noise, not sense; by meanness, not greatness; by \ncontracted hearts, not large souls.''\n  Adams urged: ``There must be decency and respect, and veneration \nintroduced for persons of authority of every rank, or we are undone. In \na popular government, this is our only \nway . . .''\n  I couldn't agree more. Our constituents, our allies, and this world \ndeserves much more from us. But all hope is not lost.\n  Governor McGreevey finished his farewell address with these wise \nwords: ``I urge you, my fellow citizens, to seek those who will build \nbridges between us, those who do not need to shout in order to be \nheard. We must have leaders who value their words as much as they do \ntheir actions and who, above all, believe in their heart what they say \nand do . . . Demand good and effective government from wise leaders who \nspeak softly, with great ideas, who inspire people to work together for \na common purpose. We, as a Nation, have done this in the past, and I \nknow we can do it again.''\n  As the leaders of this great country, I urge my fellow colleagues in \nthe House, Governors, and candidates alike to hold ourselves to a \nhigher standard, because, as Herbert Hoover once said: ``When there is \na lack of honor in government, the morals of the whole people are \npoisoned.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1497-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1497-H1498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        100TH ROTARY ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Rotary\n\n[[Page H1498]]\n\nClub of Key West, which celebrates its 100th anniversary this April.\n  The Rotary Club was chartered in our Florida Keys community in 1916 \nunder the principle of ``service above self,'' an excellent reminder to \nall of the importance we have of helping our fellow Floridians.\n  The Rotary Club of Key West is compromised of active members of our \nsouth Florida community who find it not only important, but also \nabsolutely necessary to give back to their local neighborhoods. They \nprovide scholarships to local school children, including $25,000 to one \ngraduating senior, and have even established a Rotary Dental Program to \nhelp children who otherwise would not be able to receive dental care.\n  I would also like to recognize Rotary legends Jefferson B. Browne, \nRobert Carraway, Edward B. Knight, Gerald ``Moe'' Mosher, Greg O'Berry, \nJohn G. Parks, Jr., Paul J. Sher, Edward Toppino, Robert Walker, and \nAlton Weekley.\n  Their dedication to remaining loyal to the Rotary Club's vision has \nhelped to shape it into the wonderful organization it is today. We are \nfortunate to have experienced their leadership.\n  Once again, congratulations to the Rotary Club of Key West on an \nadvantageous 100 years. May the next 100 be even more prosperous.\n\n\n              Vasundara Govindarajan, Spelling Bee Winner\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Vasundara Govindarajan of Archimedean Academy, who will be \nrepresenting Miami-Dade County in the Scripps National Spelling Bee \nheld in Washington, D.C., this May.\n  The two-time winner comes from a family of excellent spellers. Her \nolder brother, Vaidya, has even competed on the national stage.\n  Vasundara won the Miami Herald's 76th Annual Spelling Bee with the \nword ``epulation,'' meaning feasting or banqueting--a word not \ntypically found in your average sixth-graders' vocabulary. But \nVasundara is clearly not your typical sixth-grader, and was able to \ntake home the trophy over approximately 150 other students who were \nvying for this prestigious prize.\n  Congratulations, Vasundara, on this accomplishment. We are all very \nproud of you and look forward to watching you represent Miami-Dade \nCounty on the national stage. And don't forget to stop by my office \nwhen you come to Washington.\n\n\n                  Sea Level Rise Solutions Conference\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \nSea Level Rise Solutions Conference, which will be held by the Greater \nMiami Chamber of Commerce this April.\n  The conference brings together members from across Florida to have a \nconstructive dialogue about ways to confront sea level rise in our \ncommunities. Attendees will also have the opportunity to be updated on \nthe South Florida Regional Climate Compact and receive recommendations \nfrom the Miami-Dade Sea Level Rise Task Force on the best ways to \nincorporate new methods to deal with climate change in our daily lives.\n  The individuals who attend this conference have a passionate desire \nto keep our south Florida communities safe and viable for generations \nto come. Sea level rising is an important issue not only in south \nFlorida, but a topic that should be discussed in a bipartisan manner at \nthe national level as well.\n  I commend the attendees of the Sea Level Rise Solutions Conference \nfor their leadership and for taking proactive steps to address rising \nsea levels.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1498-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COAL ASH LANDFILL SAFETY ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, power companies are closing down \nold, air-polluting, coal-fired power plants as we move toward cleaner, \nmore sustainable ways to generate electricity.\n  As these small producing plants close, they leave behind a toxic \nsubstance known as coal ash. The coal ash is a public health hazard if \nit is not disposed of properly. Coal ash is toxic and can cause \nsickness and death. It is a dangerous substance that must be kept out \nof our drinking water. Coal ash contains known carcinogens such as \narsenic, mercury, and lead. That is why coal ash is being regulated by \nthe EPA.\n  As power companies shut down or upgrade their facilities while \nclosing existing coal ash ponds, where much of this toxic material has \nbeen temporarily stored, the need to permanently dispose of this \nhazardous byproduct is growing.\n  We now know that some waste disposal companies have been quietly \nexploiting a loophole in the new EPA rules, which allow them to dump \ntoxic coal ash into municipal solid waste landfills. So far, these \nwaste disposal companies have dumped millions of tons of coal ash into \nunlined municipal solid waste landfills across America. These \nlandfills, which are often located near neighborhoods and schools, are \nsimply not built or constructed or equipped to safely handle this toxic \nmaterial.\n  EPA rules do not require sufficient commonsense protections for \npeople who live nearby these landfills. Unfortunately, many of these \nlandfills are disproportionately located in low-income and minority \ncommunities.\n  Today I introduced the Coal Ash Landfill Safety Act to close the \nloopholes in the EPA rules to ensure that landfills receiving coal ash \nare properly equipped with the necessary safeguards that will protect \nthe public from the health risks caused by drinking water contaminated \nwith the coal ash components.\n  In addition to ensuring that landfills accepting coal ash are lined \nproperly to protect groundwater, the Coal Ash Landfill Safety Act would \nalso protect communities by working to minimize coal ash dust in the \nair, which is also toxic. It will require groundwater monitoring, \nmandate proper cleanup requirements, and require weekly, monthly, and \nannual inspections, thereby keeping the public informed by posting the \nmonitoring data, corrective action plans, and inspection reports on a \npublicly accessible Web site.\n  As we saw in Flint, Michigan, we need to act at the Federal level \nbefore our failure to do so results in irreversible damage to the \nhealth and environment of the communities we represent. I don't want \nAmerican families, regardless of income level, to be unfairly and \nunreasonably exposed to toxic chemicals because dangerous materials, \nsuch as coal ash, are being deposited into inadequately protected \nfacilities in their neighborhoods.\n  Together, we can find sensible solutions to all of these problems \nthat we face, but we must deal with the regulations, the shortcomings. \nWe must protect the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1498-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1498-H1499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO DOLPH SCHAYES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the great life \nof Dolph Schayes.\n  Dolph was born in New York, New York, in 1928, and lived most of his \nlife in Syracuse, New York. At the young age of 19 years old, he \nentered the National Basketball Association, where he went on to have a \ntruly remarkable career.\n  In his over 15 years of playing in the NBA, Dolph earned many records \nand many awards. He was, without a doubt, one of the best players who \never played the game at the National Basketball Association level, and \nhe helped mold the NBA in its early years.\n  While Dolph may be best known for his talents on the court, some of \nhis most impressive moments happened off the court. He was a very \ngiving member of the Syracuse community, working with youth on a \nconstant basis, starting one of the earliest basketball camps in \nAmerica. Dolph's legacy lies not only in the records he holds, but also \nin the many lives he touched.\n  On March 26, just a few days from now, Dolph's jersey will be retired \nand his son, Danny--another great NBA player in his own time--will be \naccepting it on his behalf.\n  I am truly honored to pay tribute to this incredible athlete and man \nwho contributed greatly to the sport and to the community he loved so \nmuch.\n  God bless you, Dolph, for a great life and a great NBA career.\n\n[[Page H1499]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1499-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n              U.S.-INDIA DEFENSE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Holding) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, the United States is fortunate to have \nallies and partners across the world that we work with every day to \ncombat terrorism and our other security challenges.\n  One of these relationships that I work closely on is the strategic \npartnership between the United States and India. Together, the U.S. and \nIndia face a set of common security challenges, and there can be no \nquestion that closer defense and security cooperation between our two \ndemocracies will greatly benefit all of our people.\n  Over the last few years, Mr. Speaker, we have seen substantial growth \nin this partnership, most recently formalized last year with the 10-\nyear renewal of the defense framework. This partnership is also \nhighlighted by forums such as the U.S.-India Defense Technology and \nTrade Initiative. I firmly believe that Congress should be supporting \nand offering more opportunities for the U.S.-India defense partnership \nto succeed.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  That is why today I will be introducing the U.S.-India Defense \nTechnology and Partnership Act. This legislation will cement the \nprogress that has already been made and will lay the foundation for \nfuture cooperation and growth.\n  Additionally, this legislation will elevate India's status by \nshortening the time required for the notification of sale or export of \ndefense articles from the United States to India.\n  It will also bring our defense establishment closer together by \nencouraging more joint contingency planning and will require the U.S. \nGovernment to review and assess India's ability to execute military \noperations of mutual interest.\n  Just as important as efforts like the legislation I am introducing \ntoday, I believe, is Congress' closer examination and oversight of \nother actions that impact the U.S.-India partnership.\n  One that certainly comes to mind, Mr. Speaker, is the delicate and, \nat times, seemingly confused policy with Pakistan. Pakistan has proven \ntime and time again that it is an unreliable partner.\n  While Pakistan has taken some, but very limited, action to disrupt \nterror elements that operate within their borders, their demonstrated \nunwillingness to fulfill and execute counterterrorism efforts should \nleave no question as to their true intentions.\n  So why, Mr. Speaker, last month, did the administration notice a sale \nof eight F-16s to Pakistan? What, I ask, is the benefit of the sale to \nour national security and the security of the region and our partners?\n  This is one question, Mr. Speaker. But the request to use taxpayer \ndollars to finance the sale of these F-16s to Pakistan is entirely \nanother question. What has Pakistan actually done to deserve these \nfighter jets, let alone financing from the United States taxpayers? \nCertainly not enough, in my view, as I firmly oppose the sale from \nstart to finish.\n  Every year since 2011, the administration has been required to \nutilize a waiver to continue providing security assistance to Pakistan. \nWhy, you might ask, does the administration need to continually use a \nwaiver? Well, it is because Pakistan has failed to be an honest and \nreal partner in the efforts to combat terrorism that is exported from \nits borders.\n  On this front, Mr. Speaker, I have joined with Congressman Bera to \nseek a restriction on the availability of security assistance to \nPakistan next fiscal year. We are not seeking to completely prohibit \nthe use of the Presidential waiver--although, I might add, this is a \ndebate worth having here in the House. We are simply asking that 30 \npercent of the funds should not be subject to a waiver. This is a \ncommonsense step that will, hopefully, after years of trying, get the \nPakistani Government to cooperate and meet the requirements set in law.\n  Mr. Speaker, India should know that they have a strong and committed \npartner in the U.S. Congress, and I believe that steps such as passing \nthe appropriations fence I just outlined and passing the U.S.-India \nDefense Technology and Partnership Act would send a strong message and \ncertainly enhance our strategic partnership with India.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us right \nnow to further build an enduring defense and security partnership with \nIndia that will endure for years to come and, indeed, benefit both of \nour great democracies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1499-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1499-H1500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LACK OF LIBERTY AND FREEDOM IN CUBA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, in 2014, President Obama said he \nwanted to go to Cuba if, and I quote, ``I, with confidence, can say \nthat we are seeing some progress in liberty and freedom. If we are \ngoing backwards,'' President Obama said, ``then there is not much \nreason for me to be there. I am not interested in just validating the \nstatus quo.''\n  Well, look at this poster, Mr. Speaker. These are human rights \ndissidents who were rounded up and beaten. If Obama's Cuba policy is \nnot going backwards, I don't know what is, because the oppressive Cuban \napparatus of repression only seems to be emboldened.\n  Mr. Speaker, yesterday in Havana, Raul Castro was asked by a reporter \nif he would release political prisoners in Cuba. Castro looked \nuncomfortable. Why? Because in Cuba, there is no free press. Reporters \nare not allowed to ask real questions to regime leaders.\n  Castro said, well, there are no political prisoners in Cuba at all, \nand if there were, he would free them by nightfall.\n  That's a good one. Well, there are 11 million people imprisoned by \nCastro's communist regime--the entire island.\n  But here is a list, Mr. Speaker, of over 50 political prisoners, and \nthis is a list comprised by the Cuban Democratic Directorate. Some of \nthese individuals have been in jail for over 20 years. Others are \nconstantly detained, released, and rearrested.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to enter this list into the \nRecord.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

No news.\n  On confiscated property, there was no positive announcement about the \nCastro regime paying back Americans who had their properties \nconfiscated.\n  There was no announcement by Castro about improving human rights on \nthe island. Castro denied that human rights violations occur in Cuba. \nAgain, look at this poster.\n  As predicted, Castro also demanded the return of the naval station at \nGuantanamo Bay. This Congress has been very clear that it strongly \nopposes relinquishing GTMO or transferring detainees to the United \nStates.\n  Now, President Obama incorrectly keeps calling the Communist \nstrongman Castro ``President Castro''--wrong. He is not President of \nCuba. There have never been elections. There are no political parties, \nexcept the Communist Party, in Cuba. There are no free and fair \nelections. He is not President. Stop calling a dictator President.\n  The President, our President Obama, proclaimed that this trip to Cuba \nwould be fun. That is his word. It has not been fun for all of the \nCubans who have been beaten leading up to the President's visit. It \nhasn't been fun for all the Cubans who have been prevented from leaving \ntheir homes until the President departs Cuba because they are human \nrights activists.\n  Now let me show you this other poster, Mr. Speaker. This is a poster \nof President Reagan with Gorbachev in 1987. And what happened there? \nPresident Reagan said: ``Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, \ntear down this wall.''\n  In Havana, 2016, President Obama says: Thank you, President Castro, \nfor your spirit of openness.\n  Spirit of openness? And again, President what? He is not a President. \nWhat openness, when press is prohibited in Cuba? What openness, when \nthe Cuban people are jailed for dissenting views? What openness, when \nthe economy is controlled by one entity, the communist regime?\n  America, under the Obama administration, has forsaken those who \nsuffer under Castro's oppression. That is a sad fact. And this will be \nPresident Obama's legacy, Mr. Speaker, the President who abdicated \nAmerica's role as a defender of international human rights, all for a \nnarcissistic play at building a legacy as the President who restored \nAmerica's relations with dictators and tyrants who will do anything to \nundermine our country and harm our interests and our citizens.\n  And that is all there is about Cuba.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1500-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1500-H1501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SMALL PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCY OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2016\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Palazzo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation that addresses the administrative burdens facing small and \nrural housing authorities across this country.\n  The Small Public Housing Agency Opportunity Act of 2016, H.R. 4816, \nbeing introduced by myself, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), \nand the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Ashford), is the House companion \nto Senators Tester and Fischer's S. 2292. If enacted, this bill would \nsimplify inspection and compliance requirements and eliminate excessive \npaperwork for public housing authorities that support fewer than 550 \nhouseholds.\n  Small PHAs represent 80 percent of all agencies but administer only \n20 percent of the units and receive only 10 percent of the public \nhousing and Housing Choice Voucher funds. Under current law, these \nsmall public housing agencies are required to follow the same reporting \nand inspection rules as large, urban housing authorities, even though \nthey have far fewer resources.\n  Speaking from experience with my work as a CFO and deputy executive \ndirector of a small housing authority prior to serving in Congress, \nthere is a big difference between housing needs in small town \nMississippi, Georgia, or Nebraska, and those in cities like New York \nCity. This legislation removes that one-size-fits-all approach and \ngives small housing authorities the flexibility to operate more \neffectively and efficiently.\n  Simply put, small housing authorities are being crushed by the \nregulatory burdens of the Federal Government. It doesn't take a CPA to \nsee the cost significantly outweighs the benefits of HUD mandates and \nregulations.\n  Specifically, this bill limits HUD's inspections of housing and \nvoucher units to once every 3 years, unless the small PHA is classified \nas ``troubled'' by HUD. It eliminates certain paperwork, including the \nsubmission of plans or reports not required of owners and operators of \nSection 8 private properties, and it also eliminates unnecessary yearly \nenvironmental reviews for agencies that are not undergoing new \nconstruction.\n  As we all know, recent Federal budgets have reduced support for \npublic housing, and cuts have disproportionately impacted small and \nrural housing agencies. Deep prorations in the operating funds have \nforced housing authorities to reduce staff and cut services and \nmaintenance.\n  Any revenue source is crucial; that is why this bill also takes a \nbalanced, commonsense look at the inspections, requirements, paperwork, \nand regulations that our directors are doing year round.\n  Five decades ago, President Johnson announced a war on poverty, and \nit was believed during that time that one of the first bills to be \nintroduced in the 89th Congress would be an updated version of the \nHousing and Community Development Act of 1964. President Johnson, in \nhis State of the Union that year, proclaimed a desire for ``a decent \nhome for every American family.''\n  This goal is today, as it was in 1964, a very real one that must be \naddressed. That is why I applaud Speaker Ryan for creating the Task \nForce on Poverty, Opportunity, and Upward Mobility, to strengthen \nAmerica's safety net to help those in need.\n  I also commend Representative Luetkemeyer and the committee for the \nsuccessful drafting and passage of the Housing Opportunity Through \nModernization Act of 2016.\n  We have a model out there for public housing, and we can debate the \npluses and minuses in terms of government efficiency; but at the end of \nthe day, we cannot forget what the main focus here is: affordable \nhousing for America's lowest income families.\n  This bill's exemptions and reforms will not have an adverse impact on \nthe quality of living for these families. On the contrary, by removing \njust a fraction of the burden placed on the backs of our housing \ndirectors, we benefit the lives of the residents. With some directors \nand employees allotting over 30\n\n[[Page H1501]]\n\nhours a week to just one report or program or assessment, we take that \ntime away from the residents.\n  This bill does not aim to reform the entire model or oppress one \nparty involved but, rather, aims to ensure that the time and thousands \nof dollars spent on assessments here and there are absolutely necessary \nand that it ultimately benefits the residents in these units. So this \nbill really does what Congress oftentimes fails to do, which is to \nprovide some much-needed regulatory relief. It simplifies, rather than \ncomplicates, the process.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in this bipartisan effort to ensure \nthat low-income families have a decent home, regardless of their \nlocation. This begins by giving agencies the resources and the \nflexibility they need to better serve their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1501-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              WATER CRISES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again rise to address \nthe water crises that are facing not just California, but our Nation \nand throughout the world.\n  Today, global communities and business organizations have joined \ntogether, and the White House is holding a water summit to raise \nawareness of the 650 million people around the world who don't have \naccess to safe drinking water, urging leaders to focus on ways in which \nwe can increase access to safe, sanitary water. This is appropriate, \nbut it is long overdue.\n  On the Web site, waterday.us, it states: ``Water stress is the impact \na lack of water has on a particular sector or population. Water stress \naffects nutrition, public health, environmental services, housing and \nurban growth, and national security.''\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  And national security is directly related to our ability to grow food \nto ensure that American consumers are independent and have sufficient \nnutrition for their daily consumption.\n  Water, therefore, is a resource issue of the future not only for our \nNation, but throughout the world. These impacts of not having a \nreliable and safe water supply are all too familiar for those of us who \nlive in the San Joaquin Valley in California and my colleagues who \nrepresent that area.\n  So while I believe it is fitting and appropriate that we recognize \nthat there is a nationwide and worldwide issue regarding our water \nresources and how we manage them--with the planet having 7 billion \npeople last year and by the middle of this century another 2 billion, \nor 9 billion people--we need to look at both short-term and long-term \ncomprehensive solutions to our water needs not just throughout the \nworld, but here in the United States, specifically, in California.\n  So I find it extremely disappointing that California's San Joaquin \nValley is not at the forefront of this discussion after 4 years of \ndevastating drought.\n  While I empathize with those in Flint, Michigan, and other areas of \nthe country, like those of us in the San Joaquin Valley, we have been \nfacing water shortages for 4 years; it is getting much worse; and there \nis less national attention being focused on our plight.\n  In the valley, instead of lead poisoning due to the failure of all \nlevels of government, as we have seen in Flint, Michigan, we are \ndealing with waters that have high nitrate levels in drinking water. In \naddition to that, in many places, we don't have access to water at all.\n  The solutions are clear. We need to increase Federal funding for \ninfrastructure to build resiliency during drought periods and reduce \nthe impacts of water quality using all the water tools in our water \ntoolbox.\n  We need to increase coordination between local, State, and Federal \nagencies to reduce the impacts of communities impaired by water quality \nor a lack of access to water.\n  Finally, we need to increase our focus on ensuring that regulations, \nwhere they are in place, achieve their intended purpose while \nminimizing negative impacts that they have with contradictory results.\n  For instance, due to the decisions made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the \nBureau of Reclamation is required to operate pumps in California's \nwater system under what I believe are scientifically flawed provisions, \nbiological opinions, which have lost, as a result, hundreds of \nthousands of acre-feet of water.\n  This year, if the Federal agencies had operated within the \nflexibility provided even in those flawed biological opinions, San \nJoaquin Valley communities could have been provided an additional 2- to \n300,000 acre-feet of additional water. In addition to that, that would \nhave benefited over 400,000 households.\n  As a result of the drought and the inability to capture water that is \nflowing in the system, over 600,000 acres of prime productive \nagricultural land have gone unplanted, and we have seen families \nimpacted. Families that literally do not have access to water have had \nto bottle in water.\n  There is a very certain human toll--the impact--that is taking place \nto provide highly uncertain benefits for species. This is unacceptable, \nit is avoidable, and it is immoral.\n  I urge the Federal agencies to take action to do experimental \nincreases in pumping with increased detection and monitoring so we can \nfind out if, in fact, delta smelt and salmon traveling through the \ndelta are even being harmed by the exact pumping levels under \ndiscussion.\n  So while I appreciate the comprehensive plan the administration is \ntrying to implement to solve our Nation's water crisis, we need short-\nterm solutions now so that farmers, farm workers, and farming \ncommunities in the San Joaquin Valley do not go without a water supply \nunder the Federal project for a third year in a row.\n  Additionally, we must do everything possible to get Federal \nlegislation passed and signed into law that would not only deal with \nour short-term needs, but to deal with our long-term needs as well. We \npassed the House bill last year.\n  We need to get Senator Feinstein's bill passed so we can go to \nconference because, if the Federal agencies don't act--and they have \nnot been doing the job that I would like to see them do--then Congress \nmust act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1501-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1501-H1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING BERT STEPHEN CRANE, A BELOVED LEADER IN THE MERCED COMMUNITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Denham) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the \nlife of a beloved leader in the Merced community, Bert Stephen Crane. \nBert passed away at the age of 84 on Sunday, March 13, 2016, surrounded \nby his loving family.\n  On November 29, 1931, Bert was born to fourth-generation California \nfarmers and ranchers. Raised on a cattle ranch, he was up before the \nSun and out until it came down. During his youth, Bert achieved the \nrank of Eagle Scout as a member of Boy Scout troop 101.\n  At Merced High School, Bert was the drum major in band and played \nbasketball. After high school, Bert studied at Stanford University and \nobtained his bachelor of science degree in agricultural economics from \nUC-Davis.\n  During his college years, Bert met Nancy Magnuson, whom he fell in \nlove with and later married in 1957. They remained married for over 58 \nyears and raised three children who would follow the family tradition \nof ranching and farming.\n  Bert spent most of his life farming walnuts, which he ventured into \nin the early 1970s after his early career in the beef industry. Bert \nwent on to own and operate a successful walnut-processing plant.\n  Bert lived an impressive and inspirational life. He was known to have \nridden horses with Ronald Reagan, was extremely involved in the \ncommunity, and had a passion for health care.\n  He led fundraising events for Mercy Hospital and was instrumental in \nthe development of the Mercy Cancer Center. Bert served on the Merced \nCounty Planning Commission for 28 years. His service to his community, \nagriculture, and research is one of great respect and integrity.\n  Bert valued and treasured the time he was able to spend with his \nfamily above all else. He is survived by his loving wife, Nancy, and \nhis three children and seven grandchildren.\n\n[[Page H1502]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the life of Bert Stephen \nCrane for his unwavering leadership and recognizing his accomplishments \nand outstanding contributions to the community.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the \nlife of a beloved leader in the Modesto community, James ``Jim'' West, \nwho died at the age of 81 on Sunday, March 13, 2016, surrounded by his \nloving family.\n  Jim was born on January 22, 1935, to Donald and Ruby West. He grew up \nin the heart of the Central Valley, Modesto, California, and graduated \nfrom Modesto High School in 1953.\n  Jim furthered his education at Menlo College before attending Kansas \nState University, where he obtained his bachelor's degree in feed \ntechnology.\n  In 1958, Jim joined the thriving and successful company his \ngrandfather had started in 1909, the J.S. West Milling Company. The \nfamily-owned business is known for their production of eggs, feed, and \npropane.\n  Through years of hard work and dedication, Jim became shareholder, \nsecretary, and vice president of the J.S. West Milling Company board. \nJim's reputation as an honest businessman helped build the J.S. West \nMilling Company's successful and trustworthy name.\n  Jim was also dedicated to improving the community he lived in. He was \nactive in several industry and civic groups, most notably as president \nof the Pacific Egg and Poultry Association in 1993 and chairman of the \nAmerican Egg Board in 1997.\n  He was an active member of the Western Poultry Scholarship and \nResearch Foundation, Memorial Hospital Foundation, Delta Blood Bank, \nand Modesto Junior College Foundation. He was also a proud member of \nthe Modesto Rotary since 1969 and later served as president.\n  Jim had a genuine love for the people and the community he worked \ntirelessly to help. He was known for his kindness, generosity, and \nstrong family values. Succeeding Jim are his wife of 44 years, Jessie \nWest, their two sons, and three daughters.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and recognizing the life of \nJim West for his unwavering leadership, many accomplishments, and \ncontributions to the community.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Farenthold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Naval Air \nStation at Corpus Christi as it celebrates its 75th anniversary this \nmonth.\n  NASCC or, as it was once known, the University of Air, has been \ntraining pilots, navigators, aerologists, gunners, and radio operators \nsince 1941.\n  NASCC was founded in 1938 under the 75th Congress to train new pilots \nand technical crew to bolster our Nation's air forces. The air base \nserves the southeastern portion of the United States, from Texas to \nFlorida, and trains naval aviators nationwide along with other pilots \nfrom our foreign allies.\n  Today NASCC is not just a naval base. It includes tenant commands for \nthe U.S. Army, Coast Guard, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n  The Corpus Christi Army depot rebuilds and updates rotary winged \naircraft--helicopters--and is saving our country millions of dollars. \nThe depot facility and other tenants make the base extremely cost \neffective for both the Army, Navy, and taxpayers.\n  The Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol \noperate a variety of aircraft from the base, including predator drones \nsurveilling our border, which is great because we have a new generation \nof pilots interacting with UAVs getting their training at NASCC.\n  NASCC's current commander officer is Captain Randolph F. Pierson, who \njoins a long line of leaders to serve in Corpus Christi.\n  During World War II, it was said there wasn't a naval aviator who \nhadn't earned their wings at the air station. These World War II naval \naviators were critical members of the U.S. military, giving the U.S. an \nedge in battles across the Pacific and over Europe with our superior \nair power.\n  It was American air power, combined with U.S. naval power, that \nplayed a critical role in turning back the tide of Japanese at the \nBattle of Midway.\n  It was American air power that dealt a decisive blow against the \nJapanese in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, winning one of the last \nlargest air battles in history.\n  After World War II, it was American air power that flew food supplies \nto the starving people of Berlin during the Berlin Airlift.\n  This was all accomplished with graduates of the Corpus Christi \nUniversity of Air, NASCC.\n  Today the training program is approximately 18 months and, due to the \nincreased complexity of modern aircraft, it just takes longer. Six \nhundred people per year are trained at the facility and go on to serve \ntheir country in the U.S. Navy and Marines as pilots, engineers, and \ntechnical crew.\n  These folks learn skills through the program that propel them through \na successful life in the military and a successful life in the private \nsector after their service ends.\n  Some of the notable flyers who have earned their wings at NASCC \ninclude former President George H.W. Bush, who was in the third \ngraduating class. He was commissioned just 3 days before his 19th \nbirthday.\n  Naval Air Station Corpus Christi graduates also include several \nMembers of Congress, including fellow Texas Representative Pete Olson, \nRepresentative Joe Wilson of South Carolina, and Senator John McCain of \nArizona.\n  Some NASCC grads are not content to remain in the blue skies of the \nEarth. Many astronauts who led the charge into space after getting \ntheir wings at NASCC include Neil Armstrong and John Glenn.\n  Other notable graduates include game show host Bob Barker, actor \nTyrone Power, Vice Admiral James Stockdale, and Medal of Honor winner \nEdward ``Butch'' O'Hare.\n  The Navy's distinguished flying team, the Blue Angels, were \nheadquartered in Corpus Christi until 1955. Today, CNATRA, the Chief of \nNaval Air Training, now Admiral Bull, based in NASCC, commands the Blue \nAngels.\n  The people of the United States owe much to the graduates of NASCC. \nThese heroes have fought for our country since the construction of the \nbase in 1941.\n  I believe it is important to not only honor the men and women in \nuniform who serve at bases like NASCC and those around the country, but \nalso to honor their families and the civilian workers who make it all \npossible.\n  Due to its importance to our country during World War II and over the \nyears until today, it is my privilege to let you know about NASCC.\n  After 75 years of operation, the Naval Air Station is still training \npilots, still serving the country, and still being a symbol of pride to \nTexas and the entire Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1502-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1502-H1505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PUTIN'S INFLUENCE IN EUROPE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Stewart) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, in the tumult of a Presidential election, a \nlot of important and newsworthy events don't get enough attention.\n  One such event last week was the Czech Republic's release of Ali \nFayyad, a dangerous Hezbollah terrorist who was indicted in 2014 by the \nUnited States for conspiracy to kill officers and employees of the \nUnited States.\n  The United States had requested Mr. Fayyad's extradition to the \nUnited States, and the Czech courts had approved that extradition \nrequest. But the Czech Minister of Justice, who is aligned with \nVladimir Putin, refused to honor that decision and released this \nterrorist.\n  Fayyad has deep ties with the Russian black market for weapons and \nwas an adviser to the former President of Ukraine and a close ally of \nVladimir Putin.\n  It appeared at one point that Mr. Fayyad was exchanged for several \nCzech nationals being held hostage in Lebanon, but journalists have \nsince shown that the hostage situation was a sham staged by his family \nand defense team.\n\n[[Page H1503]]\n\n  This episode is significant for several reasons. First, Mr. Fayyad's \npresence and influence in Central Europe are yet more evidence--as if \nwe needed more--that Iran, through its proxies like Hezbollah, has \ntentacles throughout world.\n  More importantly, the event demonstrates Vladimir Putin's increasing \ninfluence with an important member of NATO. And it is not just the \nCzech Republic.\n  This is a trend, and it is more concerning. Mr. Putin appears to be \nquietly undermining NATO by leveraging his cronies in influential \npositions in a number of European nations.\n  Several months ago I asked the Congressional Research Service to look \ninto the connections between Putin and high-ranking officials in \nEurope, particularly NATO members. The findings are alarming.\n  The report tracks pro-Russian rhetoric and actions of leaders in the \nCzech Republic and Slovakia and Hungary as well as the increasingly \nevident ideological link between Europe's far-right parties and the \nleadership of Russia.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Mr. Speaker, though I won't read the entire report at this time, I \nwill include it in the Record.\n  I say all this, recognizing that Russia is a much more proximate \nthreat to our European allies than they are to us. It would be foolish \nnot to acknowledge that European leaders are in a different position \nthan we are. The democratic institutions that we take for granted are \nstill fragile in many of these countries, and Putin knows that. \nHowever, what makes it all the more important is the fact that we, as \nthe world's superpower, do more than offer simple condemnations of \nPutin's actions.\n  Both the House and the Senate held hearings last year exploring \nRussian propaganda efforts. This was a good start, but now we need to \ndig deeper to understand all of the levels of Russian pressure, \nincluding agents of Russian influence who occupy high political offices \nand own national and regional media outlets.\n  More than anything, we need the President to get off of the sidelines \nand show that he is serious about countering Putin. That could start \nwith a serious effort to determine who cooperated with Russia in \nreleasing Mr. Fayyad, and then issue targeted sanctions on those \nofficials.\n  Mr. Fayyad is likely to continue plotting to harm the U.S., and his \nrelease isn't a simple oversight that we should ignore.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n                                                 December 8, 2015.\n     To: Representative Chris Stewart.\n     Subject: Pro-Russia Viewpoints Among Selected Leaders in \n         Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your request for information \n     about Russian influence in Central and Eastern Europe, with a \n     focus on selected political leaders. It provides additional \n     information about Russian influence through ties with \n     European far-right parties. Please contact me if you have \n     questions or would like additional information.\n     Introduction\n       One of the main ways analysts have to gauge Russian \n     influence in Central and Eastern Europe is by looking at the \n     reactions of regional political leaders to the conflict in \n     Ukraine and European Union (EU) debates about Ukraine-related \n     sanctions against Russia. While some patterns may be \n     discerned, it is difficult to assess the degree to which \n     various data points are directly attributable to Russian \n     influence, as opposed to a variety of other factors and \n     interests. Economic relationships and energy ties can be \n     expressed in monetary amounts, but less straightforward is \n     how to translate such figures into identifiable political and \n     policy influence. Other aspects of Russian influence can be \n     even more difficult to quantify. Russian involvement in \n     political and corporate dealings is not always a transparent \n     process that is reflected in available open source \n     information, frequently making for some degree of speculation \n     when seeking to reach conclusions about the motivations \n     driving various statements and actions.\n       Overall, attitudes toward Russia in Central and Eastern \n     Europe are colored by historical experiences, geographic \n     proximity, economic ties, and energy dependence. Many \n     officials and analysts in Central and Eastern Europe relate \n     that they have not been especially surprised by Russia's \n     actions in Ukraine and assert that their past efforts to \n     convey concerns about President Putin's revanchist ambitions \n     went largely unheeded in the United States and Western \n     Europe. In light of European history, especially the Soviet \n     Union's domination of the region during the Communist era, \n     Russian influence in Central and Eastern Europe is not a new \n     phenomenon brought on in relation to the Ukraine crisis. In \n     2009, for example, analysts alleged that Czech President \n     Vaclav Klaus, influenced by Moscow, worked to destabilize the \n     Czech government and undermine passage of the EU's Lisbon \n     Treaty.\n       As the Visegrad Four (V4) group, Poland, the Czech \n     Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary have attempted to engage in \n     regional cooperation with one another on a range of issues, \n     and to form common positions on foreign policy and EU \n     matters. The countries have struggled to find any group \n     coherence with regard to Russia and the conflict in Ukraine, \n     however. Poland's consistent and forceful advocacy of a \n     robust response to Russia's actions made it something of an \n     outlier in Central and Eastern Europe. Whether owing to a \n     desire to preserve energy and economic ties with Russia, \n     concerns about provoking Russia further, or the perception \n     that Russia's actions in Ukraine are distant and do not pose \n     a direct threat to their countries, the governments of the \n     Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary have tended to be more \n     ambiguous and reserved on the topic. Some observers note that \n     at times the leaders of these countries appear to have \n     prioritized short-term national economic interests over wider \n     strategic concerns.\n       Nevertheless, while many in the V4 countries and elsewhere \n     in Europe may remain skeptical about the wisdom and utility \n     of sanctions as an attempt to deter Russia's actions in \n     Ukraine, the measures have been adopted by the unanimous \n     agreement of all 28 EU member states. Observers assert that \n     this consensus was based on a common assessment by the member \n     state governments that sending a strong message to Russia's \n     leadership through meaningful sanctions was a political \n     imperative outweighing economic disruption and discomfort. \n     Observers further note that action must at times be viewed \n     separately from rhetoric and political ``doublespeak'' that \n     may be aimed at a domestic audience.\n     The Czech Republic\n       Opinions on Russia and the Ukraine crisis among Czech \n     political elites are fractured. At one end of the spectrum is \n     the pro-Kremlin position of Czech President Milos Zeman, \n     which appears to accept Russia's claims about the conflict \n     and opposes all sanctions. In June 2014, Zeman stated, ``I \n     cannot see any reason why to isolate the Russian Federation \n     from the European Union, why to speak about sanctions, \n     blockade, and embargo. There is a chance of increasing the \n     level of our cooperation. . .'' At the other end of the \n     spectrum is the position of the center-right opposition TOP \n     09 party, led by former Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, \n     which has advocated tougher sanctions and providing military \n     aid to Ukraine.\n       In between them is the view characterized by Prime Minister \n     Bohuslav Sobotka of the center-left Social Democratic Party, \n     who accepted sanctions but sought exemptions based on \n     economic interests and called for early removal of the \n     measures. Following the adoption of wider EU sanctions in \n     July 2014, Sobotka stated, ``Neither for the European Union, \n     nor for Russia, is it favorable to get into a drawn-out trade \n     war and that some new economic and political Iron Curtain \n     appears on Ukraine's eastern border.'' There is also a \n     multilateralist view characterized by Foreign Minister \n     Lubomir Zaoralek, who argued that the Czech Republic should \n     belong to the EU mainstream and support the sanctions as an \n     efficient tool.\n       The Czech foreign and defense ministries ``view Russia as a \n     country which is destabilising the European security \n     architecture and . . . making attempts to revise the \n     international order,'' whereas ``the minister for industry \n     and trade sees Russia as a key non-EU economic partner for \n     the Czech Republic, with whom cooperation needs to be \n     enhanced.'' Prime Minister Sobotka has attempted to balance \n     these competing viewpoints, but the splits have left the \n     Czech government without a clear stance on Russia.\n       Two-thirds of the natural gas consumed in the Czech \n     Republic comes from Russia, accounting for nearly 15% of the \n     country's primary energy supply. In the context of sanctions \n     and Russia's economic slowdown, the Czech economy has been \n     negatively affected by a substantial decline in Russian \n     imports of Czech goods and reduced numbers of Russian \n     tourists visiting the Czech Republic. Russia accounts for \n     only 4% of Czech exports and 0.3% of foreign investment in \n     the Czech Republic, however. By contrast, over 80% of Czech \n     exports go to EU countries, and the Czech economy is tied \n     most closely to Germany.\n       President Zeman and Deputy Prime Minister/Finance Minister \n     Andrej Babis, in particular, have been recently cited by one \n     prominent commentator as leading politicians who ``frequently \n     echo or repeat Russian slogans.'' Zeman previously served as \n     prime minister from 1998-2002 at the head of the Social \n     Democratic Party, which he left in 2007, before he became the \n     Czech Republic's first popularly elected president in 2013 \n     (the president was formerly chosen by parliament). The powers \n     of the Czech presidency are largely ceremonial, and the power \n     to lead the government falls squarely on the prime minister. \n     Nevertheless, the president is the commander-in-chief of the \n     armed forces, exerts an influence on foreign policy, and \n     makes a number of formal appointments to\n\n[[Page H1504]]\n\n     the central bank and judiciary. Some analysts assert that \n     Zeman has sought to push the boundaries of his powers to \n     influence government policy and legislation.\n       Although Zeman has also been strongly pro-EU and supported \n     close security ties with the United States through NATO, his \n     history of outspoken statements has labeled him as one of the \n     most pro-Russian leaders in Europe. He has condemned the EU \n     sanctions against Russia, strongly criticized the Ukrainian \n     government's approach to the conflict, and termed the \n     conflict in Ukraine a ``civil war.'' Analysts assert that \n     such statements have countered and undermined the Czech \n     government and foreign ministry and threatened to alienate \n     Czech allies in NATO, including the United States, and its \n     partners in the EU.\n       In May 2015, Zeman, who speaks fluent Russian, defied calls \n     for the diplomatic isolation of Russia by joining Slovak \n     Prime Minister Fico as one of the few European leaders \n     attending the 70th anniversary commemoration of the end of \n     World War II in Moscow. Opposition leaders asserted that the \n     visit seemed ``choreographed by Kremlin propagandists,'' with \n     President Putin commenting, ``I want to say that it pleases \n     us that there are still leaders in Europe who are able to \n     express their opinion, and who follow an independent \n     political line.''\n       While some observers maintain that Zeman is on balance an \n     outspoken personality who is not afraid to speak his mind, \n     others point to his close ties with businessmen connected to \n     Russia as a potential source of influence. Martin Nejedly, \n     the head of Russian energy company Lukoil's Czech subsidiary, \n     and Miroslav Slouf, a lobbyist for Lukoil, reportedly \n     financed much of Zeman's presidential campaign, were part of \n     his campaign team, and remain close advisers. Zeman has also \n     previously asserted that he is a ``long-time friend'' of \n     Vladimir Yakunin, a former KGB agent who was head of Russian \n     Railways and a close associate and ally of President Putin \n     until his retirement earlier this year. Yakunin was included \n     on the list of Russian officials placed under U.S. sanctions \n     following the annexation of Crimea.\n       Andrej Babis is reportedly the Czech Republic's second-\n     richest man, worth an estimated $2.4 billion. Babis, who is \n     of Slovak origin, founded the ANO party (ANO stands for \n     Action of Dissatisfied Citizens in Czech, although ``ano'' \n     also means ``yes'' in Czech) in 2011, initially as a personal \n     political vehicle. Promoting populist, anti-corruption \n     messages, ANO came in second place in the 2013 Czech \n     election, and Babis became deputy prime minister and finance \n     minister in a coalition government led by Prime Minister \n     Sobotka's Social Democrats. Babis has continued to position \n     himself and his party as outsiders to the Czech political \n     establishment, and as a ``movement'' that eludes left-right \n     characterization rather than a political party (ANO belongs \n     to the centrist-liberal Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, \n     ALDE, in the European Parliament). With recent polls showing \n     ANO to be the Czech Republic's most popular party and Babis \n     its most trusted politician, he is considered a leading \n     possibility for prime minister following the 2017 election.\n       The intersection between Babis' continued business \n     interests and his political career has been controversial. In \n     the early 1990s, while an executive with the state-owned \n     trading company Petrimex, Babis took over ownership and \n     control of a newly founded Petrimex subsidiary, Agrofert, \n     using a still-undisclosed source of foreign financing \n     channeled through Switzerland. Reportedly aided by the use of \n     political connections to acquire state-owned enterprises \n     using state-guaranteed loans that were not always paid back, \n     Babis grew Agrofert into an agriculture, food, and chemical \n     giant that is now the Czech Republic's fourth-largest company \n     and has over 200 subsidiaries of its own. Babis has been \n     accused of using his government position to benefit his \n     private business interests, for example in a May 2015 \n     parliamentary vote to continue state subsidies of biofuels, a \n     policy of strong benefit to Agrofert.\n       In 2013, Agrofert acquired the MAFRA media group, housing \n     two of the country's most widely read newspapers, most \n     popular radio station, and a leading television channel. \n     Observers assert that these media outlets have subsequently \n     avoided any criticism of Babis, promoted his activities, and \n     increased criticism of political opponents. Some analysts \n     have argued that Babis combination of political, economic, \n     and media power threatens the stability of the Czech \n     Republic's democratic institutions. In March 2015, Prime \n     Minister Sobotka told his party's congress:\n       ``The problem is, however, that Andrej Babis, chairman of \n     our coalition partner, did not give up his economic and media \n     influence after he became deputy prime minister and finance \n     minister. He now concentrates political, economic and media \n     power whose extent has been unprecedented in this country \n     since 1989. He is at permanent risk of conflict of \n     interest.''\n       Babis' past has also caused controversy. The Czech Republic \n     maintains a ``lustration law'' passed in 1991 to keep former \n     high-level communists and secret police collaborators out of \n     top government posts. Babis has been waging a court battle \n     with Slovakia's Nation's Memory Institute, which oversees \n     communist-era secret police files. With Babis' secret police \n     file having gone missing long ago, the institute presented a \n     case in 2013 piecing together files it asserted as \n     circumstantial evidence that Babis was an informant code \n     named ``Bures.'' In June 2014, a Slovak judge ruled in favor \n     of removing Babis from the list of secret police \n     collaborators after two former agents testified in his \n     defense, finding there was not sufficiently clear documentary \n     evidence of deliberate collaboration. The institute is \n     reportedly continuing the investigation, however, after an \n     appeals court ruled the agents' testimony inadmissible. \n     Allegations of Babis' ties to communist-era security and \n     intelligence agencies are additionally fueled by his close \n     association with Agrofert board chairman Libor Siroky, a \n     former member of a Czechoslovak secret police unit that had \n     close ties with the KGB.\n       Babis has repeatedly criticized the EU sanctions against \n     Russia, and has been variously quoted stating that NATO \n     ``cannot stay on this idea that Russia is the biggest \n     problem,'' ``Ukraine is not ready for the European Union and \n     Ukraine was always under the influence of Russia,'' and, with \n     regard to responsibility for Crimea and the conflict in \n     Ukraine, ``What is true or not true, who knows?'' Babis has \n     asserted that such skepticism is a legitimate part of the \n     European debate and that he and his party are strongly pro-\n     NATO and pro-EU, refuting allegations that he is ``pro-\n     Russian'' or has secretive ties to Russia. Nevertheless, with \n     Babis considered a possible future prime minister of the \n     Czech Republic, his oligarchic profile and communist-era \n     past, combined with his statements on sanctions and the \n     Ukraine crisis, have caused speculation and concern about \n     possible Russian connections and influence.\n     Slovakia\n       Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has been an outspoken \n     critic of EU sanctions against Russia and has pursued cordial \n     relations with Moscow during his time in office. Fico has \n     been prime minister since 2012, and previously from 2006-\n     2010, at the head of the center-left Direction-Social \n     Democracy party (SMERSD). Fico (with Czech President Zeman) \n     was one of only two European leaders to attend events in \n     Moscow in May 2015 commemorating the 70th anniversary of the \n     end of World War II, and returned to Moscow in June 2015 with \n     a government delegation to discuss economic and energy ties. \n     Analysts and commentators asserted that these visits played \n     into Russian propaganda by allowing the Kremlin to show it \n     has partners in Europe who are inclined toward cooperation, \n     undermining U.S. and European attempts to portray Russia as \n     diplomatically isolated.\n       Slovakia is one of the EU countries most exposed \n     economically to Russia: Slovakia depends on Russia for 98% of \n     the natural gas it consumes (accounting for over 27% of the \n     country's primary energy supply), imports oil and nuclear \n     fuel from Russia, and its state budget relies to a \n     significant extent on revenue from transit fees associated \n     with Russian gas (via Ukraine). Slovakia is the main conduit \n     for Russian gas to Europe. In September 2014, Slovakia began \n     providing gas supplies to Ukraine, leading Russia to cut gas \n     flows to Slovakia by a reported 50% the following month. The \n     Slovak military also remains heavily dependent on Russian \n     armaments. At the same time, Russia accounts for only 3-4% of \n     Slovakia's exports, with the vast majority going to other EU \n     countries.\n       Fico drew particular attention in June 2014 when he \n     compared the idea of U.S. and NATO troops being stationed in \n     Slovakia to the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia: \n     ``I cannot imagine that there would be foreign soldiers on \n     our territory in the form of some bases...Slovakia has its \n     historical experience with participation of foreign troops. \n     Let us remember the 1968 invasion. Therefore this topic is \n     extraordinarily sensitive to us.''\n       Analysts assert that Slovak attitudes toward Russia are a \n     complicated mixture of interests and emotions that make it \n     hard to understand and predict Slovak policy toward Russia. \n     Some analysts perceive Fico's Russia policy as an attempt to \n     balance the competing imperatives of relations with NATO and \n     the EU with Slovakia's energy and economic relationship with \n     Russia, while attempting to appeal to public opinion, \n     business interests, and a Russophile wing of his party. For \n     example, Fico has criticized EU sanctions but not blocked \n     them, and he strongly criticized Ukrainian measures that have \n     threatened the flow of gas, but also provided ``reverse \n     flow'' gas supplies to Ukraine. Moscow opposes the ``reverse \n     flow'' of gas from Europe back to Ukraine and considers it \n     illegal.\n       Overall, national economic interests appear to be paramount \n     in Fico's approach. Slovakia did not block the expansion of \n     EU sanctions in July 2014 after securing exemptions for \n     sectors important to its economy (such as the export of \n     automobiles to Russia), but Fico has maintained that his \n     government might ``reject certain sanctions that would hurt \n     national interests.'' Following the adoption of the wider EU \n     sanctions and the announcement of Russia's retaliatory \n     measures, Fico stated, ``Why should we jeopardize the EU \n     economy that begins to grow? If there is a crisis situation, \n     it should be solved by other means than meaningless \n     sanctions. Who profits from the EU economy decreasing, \n     Russia's economy having trouble, and Ukraine economically on \n     its knees?''\n     Hungary\n       Alongside Hungary's commitment to NATO and a close security \n     partnership with\n\n[[Page H1505]]\n\n     the United States, the government of Prime Minister Viktor \n     Orban has emphasized that it has other foreign policy \n     interests, including building closer relations with Russia. \n     Some analysts assert that the Hungarian government appears to \n     be the most ``pro-Russian'' government of the NATO and EU \n     countries. Although Hungary is still a democracy and Russia \n     is not, ideological similarities between Prime Minister Orban \n     and President Putin contribute to cordial relations to a \n     certain extent: both leaders have been organizing their \n     respective states in contrast to the ``liberal, Western \n     model,'' with Orban naming Russia (along with Singapore, \n     China, India, and Turkey) in a July 2014 speech as the type \n     of state model likely to be successful in the future. In \n     addition, Putin's doctrine of ``protecting'' ethnic Russian \n     populations that live outside the borders of Russia closely \n     evokes the nationalist view in Hungary of ethnic Hungarian \n     minorities that live outside the borders of the country. \n     According to some Western observers, Hungary has played an \n     unhelpful role in the Ukraine crisis by advocating greater \n     autonomy for a region of western Ukraine inhabited by \n     approximately 150,000 ethnic Hungarians. Breaking with \n     European attempts to portray Russia as diplomatically \n     isolated, Orban hosted Putin in a state visit in February \n     2015. Orban has been prime minister since 2010, and \n     previously from 1998-2002, at the head of the conservative \n     Fidesz party.\n       Hungary has considerable ties to Russia in the energy \n     sector. Russia provides over 76% of the natural gas consumed \n     in Hungary, accounting for one quarter of the country's \n     primary energy supply, and Hungary was a strong supporter of \n     Gazprom's now-cancelled South Stream pipeline that would have \n     crossed Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, and Slovenia (bypassing \n     Ukraine) to reach Austria and Italy. Russia also supplies the \n     fuel for Hungary's Paks nuclear power plant, which provides \n     about 40% of the country's electricity. Under a controversial \n     deal reached in early 2014, Russia will loan Hungary =10 \n     billion to finance the construction by Russia's state-\n     owned Rosatom of two new units at the Paks plant.\n       Although it joined its EU partners in condemning the \n     annexation of Crimea as illegal, and signed on to the \n     multiple rounds of sanctions imposed against Russia by the \n     EU, Hungary has been among the countries most reluctant to \n     impose sanctions in response to Russia's actions in the \n     Ukraine conflict. In an August 2014 interview, just two weeks \n     after the adoption of expanded sectoral EU sanctions and one \n     week after the announcement of retaliatory Russian measures \n     against European food products, Prime Minister Orban called \n     for a re-think of the EU's sanctions, stating, ``The \n     sanctions policy pursued by the West, that is, ourselves, a \n     necessary consequence of which has been what the Russians are \n     doing, causes more harm to us than to Russia . . . In \n     politics, this is called shooting oneself in the foot.'' \n     Although Russia is Hungary's largest non-EU trading partner, \n     with Hungarian exports to Russia represent less than 3% of \n     Hungary's total exports. The Hungarian economy is tied much \n     more closely to the German economy.\n     Russia and European Far-Right Parties\n       In recent years, there has been an increasingly evident \n     ideological link between European far-right parties and the \n     leadership of Russia. Far-right parties in V4 countries that \n     now take openly pro-Russia positions include: Jobbik in \n     Hungary; the Slovak National Party (SNS) and People's Party \n     Our Slovakia (L'SNS); the Czech Workers' Party of Social \n     Justice (DSSS); Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland (SRP) \n     and Polish Falanga.\n       Elsewhere in Europe, pro-Russia positions are held by: \n     France's National Front (FN); Italy's Lega Nord and the New \n     Force party in Italy; the National Democratic Party of \n     Germany (NPD); the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO); the \n     Flemish Interest (VB) party in Belgium; the Order and Justice \n     (TT) party in Lithuania; Golden Dawn in Greece; the \n     Nationalist Party of Bulgaria (NPB) and Bulgaria's Ataka \n     Party; and the British National Party (BNP).\n       While many of these parties remain well on the fringes of \n     their countries' political scene, Jobbik, FPO, FN, Golden \n     Dawn, Lega Nord and TT have had significant electoral \n     successes in winning seats in national parliaments and the \n     European Parliament.\n       Analysts assert that supporting far-right parties serves as \n     a way for Russia to work against European unity. Among other \n     elements of far-right ideology (typically including some \n     combination of extreme nationalism, ``law and order'' and the \n     preservation of ``traditional'' conservative or family \n     values, and anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic, or anti-Islam \n     sentiments), most of these parties tend to be anti-\n     establishment and anti-EU. Some can be characterized as anti-\n     NATO/U.S. or isolationist, and some focus on problems with \n     neighboring countries. Jobbik, for example, in addition to \n     promoting strongly anti-Roma, anti-Semitic, xenophobic, and \n     anti-Western stances, promotes the idea that Slovakia and \n     Romania are enemies of Hungary due to the ethnic Hungarian \n     minorities living across the border in those countries.\n       Although direct evidence of Russian financial support for \n     far-right parties remains for the most part difficult to \n     identify, there is a widespread belief that Russia has \n     covertly funneled money to parties such as the FN and Jobbik. \n     In November 2014, news outlets reported the discovery that \n     the FN had received a potentially illegal =9 million loan \n     from a Russian bank with close ties to President Putin. \n     Jobbik has also long been under suspicion of receiving \n     Russian (and Iranian) money, and the party's finances have \n     been questioned in the Hungarian Parliament and investigated \n     by the Hungarian government. After publishing an annual \n     budget of approximately $10,000 per year for 2004-2008, \n     Jobbik ran a well-financed campaign in the 2009 European \n     Parliament election and reportedly spent over $100,000 in the \n     2010 national election, when it won nearly 16% of the vote. \n     Analysts argued that the sudden increase in funding could not \n     have been due to domestic contributions. As Jobbik began \n     running a nationwide party operation, it also abandoned its \n     previous anti-Russian rhetoric to advocate both good \n     relations with Russia and Hungary leaving the EU to join \n     Russia's Eurasian Union. Jobbik now receives a state \n     allowance allotted to parties in parliament and has an \n     official budget of over $2.3 million. Suspicions of \n     additional private financing from abroad persist, however. A \n     potentially key figure in Jobbik's ties to Moscow is Bela \n     Kovacs, a Jobbik Member of the European Parliament who played \n     a central role in the party's rise in 2009 and has been a \n     vocal supporter of Russia in the European Parliament. In \n     October 2015, the European Parliament granted a request by \n     the Hungarian government to lift Kovacs' immunity from arrest \n     in order to face allegations of spying for Russia.\n       Russian support for far-right parties is not merely \n     financial. The Russian government has also been proactive in \n     offering organizational expertise, political know-how, and \n     media assistance to parties on Europe's far-right. Russian \n     support has reportedly included establishing and coordinating \n     pro-Russian parties, non-governmental civil organizations, \n     and think tanks, and providing support to friendly media \n     outlets.

Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the Supreme Court will \nhear arguments in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell, and today, I \nstand in support of the Little Sisters.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an order of Catholic nuns who serve the elderly \npoor in 31 countries. We talk a lot about public service up here. Well, \nthese are the people who live it. They are the definition of public \nservice. In fact, I had the honor of hosting two of the Sisters at the \nState of the Union address this January, and I was amazed to hear all \nthe good work that they do.\n  So the last thing the Federal Government should do is make their jobs \nharder, but that, unfortunately, is exactly what this administration is \ndoing. Under the healthcare law, the Department of Health and Human \nServices is insisting on a regulation that requires the Sisters to \noffer benefits that violate their religious beliefs.\n  The administration claims to have offered them an ``accommodation,'' \nbut it is just a fig leaf. So this is the choice that they are facing: \neither violate your faith, or pay up to $70 million a year in fines.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no good reason for any of this. A full one-\nthird of the American people are exempt from this regulation, so why \ninsist that the Sisters, of all people, follow it? There are other ways \nto protect people's health that do not violate people's faith.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is clear to anyone with eyes to see that this \nregulation is a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. A \nbroad bipartisan majority in Congress voted for that law, and what \nCongress said was this: the burden is not on your faith to obey \ngovernment mandates; the burden is on the government to respect your \nfaith.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is the very meaning of religious liberty. That is \none of our founding principles, and that is why we should do everything \nwe can to let people live out their faith. That is why many colleagues \nof mine and I have joined in an amicus brief asking the Court to grant \nthe Sisters the relief that they deserve; and that is why I am here \ntoday: to stand in defense of the Sisters, to stand in defense of the \nlaw, and to stand in defense of religious liberty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1506-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TODAY NIAGARA FALLS WILL RECLAIM ITS WATERFRONT\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, today the people of Niagara Falls will \nreclaim what was taken from them 50 years ago: access to, arguably, the \nworld's greatest waterfront, Niagara Falls.\n  Since 1964, the Robert Moses State Parkway has cut off the city from \nits waterfront. The highway is one of several ill-conceived projects \nrammed through cities 50 years ago that have kept western New York from \nrealizing its full economic potential.\n  Three years ago, I issued a report that detailed the role of the New \nYork Power Authority, which planned the parkway, evicted homeowners, \nand owns the land on which it sits, justifying the New York Power \nAuthority's responsibility to fix what they had broken.\n  Shortly thereafter, work began on the removal of the southern \nportion, and now, as we proposed, the New York Power Authority will \nfund the next phase, a $42 million project that takes down the parkway \nand builds up this city.\n  Two weeks ago, I stood with Mayor Paul Dyster to demand the complete \nremoval of the parkway. With today's announcement, Niagara Falls will \nreclaim its waterfront and all of the promise that comes with it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1506-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE LIFE OF DEPUTY CARL KOONTZ\n\n  (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life \nof Deputy Carl Koontz, who was shot and killed Sunday while serving a \nwarrant.\n  A 3-year veteran of the Howard County Sheriff's Department, he was \nmore than a deputy; he was a husband to Kassie, a father to baby Noah, \na son, and a friend to his many fellow law enforcement officers.\n  Yesterday, hundreds of Hoosiers lined the procession route from \nIndianapolis back to his hometown of Kokomo to pay their respects and \nhonor his sacrifice.\n  He was only 27 years old, and in his short life he served Howard \nCounty with courage and distinction. He was passionate about his job as \na deputy, particularly his role as a school resource officer for the \nNorthwestern School Corporation, where he was a role model as well as a \nprotector of Hoosier children.\n  I would also like to recognize Sergeant Jordan Buckley, who was also \nshot and injured, and wish him a speedy recovery.\n  Law enforcement officers and first responders put their lives on the \nline each and every day.\n  In memory of Deputy Koontz, I would ask everyone to please stand and \nthank all of our officers, the courageous law enforcement officers and \nfirst responders, for their service and sacrifice because on Sunday, \nDeputy Koontz paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1506-6", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1506-H1507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CELEBRATING SALLIE BALDWIN HOWARD'S 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize my colleague and \nfriend, former North Carolina State Senator Earline Parmon, who \ndeparted this life last week on Super Tuesday.\n  Earline was a true trailblazer, public servant, and humble leader. \nShe was Forsyth County's first Black State senator. She also served \nmore than a decade in the North Carolina House and on the Forsyth \nCounty Board of Commissioners.\n  Earline was instrumental in helping victims of North Carolina's \neugenics program receive restitution, and she did so much more. She \ndedicated her life to fighting for justice and fighting for our \ncommunities.\n  I was more than honored when Earline joined my staff as my outreach \ndirector, expanding her territory to serve North Carolina's 12the \nCongressional District.\n  She was loving, kind, and respected. She broke barriers, and she was \ninspirational. Earline Parmon has left an indelible mark on North \nCarolinians across our State and Nation. I have known Earline for many \ndecades, and I am proud to have called her my friend and one of my \nclosest confidantes.\n  Her legacy will continue to live on for generations to come. We \nsalute her and her service to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1508-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MIDDLE EAST CHRISTIANS FACE EXTINCTION\n\n  (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of Holy Week, one of the \nmost important time periods for the Christian faith.\n  Sadly, in too many places around the world, Christians are under \nattack simply because of their religious beliefs. The stories of rape, \nassault, and murder are heartbreaking.\n  Just look at some of the numbers from the Middle East. In 2003, there \nwere 1\\1/2\\ million Christians in Iraq. Now that number is down to \n275,000 and falling. In the very land where Jesus once walked, \nChristians are becoming extinct.\n  This Holy Week, may we, as the people's House, reaffirm our \ncommitment to fighting Christian persecution abroad. May we not become \ndiscouraged or angry, and may we keep fighting to encourage religious \ntolerance in the Middle East and all around the world.\n  And, Mr. Speaker, may we remember what is written in the Gospel of \nJohn: ``The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not \novercome it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1508-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ONE OF AMERICA'S WORST FOREIGN POLICY MISTAKES\n\n  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in solemn observance today of the 13th \nanniversary of the week that one of the worst foreign policy mistakes \nof the 21st century was made, the invasion of Iraq, March 20, 2003.\n  The human cost of the invasion: 4,491 U.S. servicemembers who gave \ntheir lives and countless more who were injured or who came back with \ndifficulties facing the challenges of everyday life.\n  Iraqi deaths were between 151,000 and 500,000, including many \ninnocent women and children, and millions more were driven from their \nhomes.\n  The economic cost of the war in Iraq: $1.7 trillion are the estimates \nof that cost, money that was taken out of the hands of U.S. taxpayers, \naway from our roads, bridges, infrastructure, and schools to send to \nIraq. And the national security cost of that colossal mistake: namely, \nthe creation of ISIS and, in fact, arming ISIS with weapons that were \npaid for by American taxpayers, supplied to the failed Iraqi military.\n  ``When will we ever learn?'', in the words of the late, great Pete \nSeeger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1508-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LIVINGSTON PARISH NEWS\n\n  (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, in recent months, Livingston \nParish has lost two important leaders. On October 26 of last year, Jeff \nMcHugh David passed away.

Together they had nearly 90 years of newspaper experience.\n  The Livingston Parish News was established in 1898. It has a 118-year \nhistory. During that history, it has been awarded over 600 State and \nnational awards for its journalism excellence.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Livingston Parish News covered important events like \nthe 1983 floods, which resulted in the Comite diversion authorization, \nand the LIGO project, which recently discovered for the first time ever \ngravitational waves.\n  It is really an amazing newspaper that has done a phenomenal job. \nThey have 1,200 subscribers and over 60,000 online subscribers.\n  The past 6 months have been a challenging time for the paper. Jeff is \nsurvived by his son, McHugh David, who carries on his father's legacy \nof the Livingston Parish News, as Leesha calls him behind his back, \nMcCutie.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I recognize and honor these men's service and \ncontribution to our community and to the great State of Louisiana.

Mr. Speaker, a picture is worth a thousand words. \nThis poster shows President Obama with the Che Guevara image behind \nhim, coming soon to a T-shirt near you.\n  Che was a sadistic murderer and killer who executed Cubans during his \nreign of terror. Che, along with Fidel and Raul Castro, is responsible \nfor the suffering, misery, and oppression of the people of Cuba.\n  But it seems that some people just don't care. Yesterday President \nObama said in an interview that he would be happy to meet with Fidel \nCastro, and President Obama believes that Raul Castro ``truly wants \nchange in Cuba.''\n  Really? What is stopping Castro from holding free and fair elections? \nLet's start with that little change.\n  This continued effort to legitimize this regime and its atrocities is \nappalling. It is appalling for those people who love freedom. It is \nappalling for those who have been political prisoners in Castro's \ngulags.

The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for \n1 hour.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, \nI yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nPolis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on House Resolution 653, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule \nforward on behalf of the Rules Committee.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2745, the Standard Merger \nand Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015, or the SMARTER \nAct.\n  The rule also provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and \ncontrolled by the chair and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nand also provides a motion to recommit. I would like to point out that \nthe Rules Committee put out a call for amendments, but none were \nsubmitted for consideration.\n  Yesterday the Rules Committee received testimony from the chairman \nand ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, \nCommercial, and Antitrust Law. A subcommittee hearing was held on this \nlegislation and it was marked up and reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. The bill went through regular order and enjoyed discussion \nat both the subcommittee and full committee level.\n  H.R. 2745 is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the \nAmerican Hospital Association because it is a matter of basic fairness \nand reducing uncertainty.\n  This legislation makes two key changes to the procedures by which the \nFederal Trade Commission litigates merger cases. First, it requires the \nFTC to satisfy the same standards that the DOJ must meet in order to \nobtain a preliminary injunction in Federal Court.\n  Second, it requires the FTC to litigate merits of contested merger \ncases in Federal Court under the Clayton Act--just as the DOJ does--\nrather than before its own administrative tribunals.\n  Currently the FTC is authorized to obtain preliminary injunctive \nrelief, whereas the DOJ must satisfy the generally applicable test for \nobtaining preliminary injunction in Federal Court if it wants to block \na merger. Courts have sometimes held that there is a lower burden on \nthe FTC to obtain an injunction than the DOJ would have to face under \nthe traditional test.\n  Additionally, if the FTC loses a preliminary injunction in Federal \nCourt, it is able to litigate the merits of the cases in an \nadministrative proceeding ultimately adjudicated by its commissioners. \nHowever, the DOJ does not have this power.\n  The SMARTER Act addresses these disparities, as recommended by the \nAntitrust Modernization Commission.\n\n[[Page H1510]]\n\n  Parties to a merger should not be subject to different treatment and \nstandards based on the reviewing antitrust enforcement agency. \nAntitrust agencies are charged with reviewing transactions efficiently \nand fairly in order to ensure that competition is preserved. But \ncurrent law leaves the impression that there is a divergence of \nprocedure and that whether or not a merger can proceed depends on which \nagency reviews that particular transaction.\n  Importantly, this bill does not make it easier for mergers to be \napproved. H.R. 2745 does increase fairness and efficiency by ensuring \nthat the antitrust enforcement agencies are not imposing unequal \nburdens on the merging parties.\n  I thank the full committee, Chairman Goodlatte, Chairman Marino, \nCongressman Farenthold, and their staff for their work bringing these \nimportant reforms today. Again, as we look forward, I would encourage \nall to support this rule and the underlying legislation as it will \nbring some streamlined modern efficiencies to this program as we go \nforward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  That was complicated. My colleague from Georgia, Mr. Speaker, \nexplained a lot of stuff. There were definitely a lot of big words in \nthere, and words that we do not use too often in Colorado.\n  It seems to me that this bill is designed to make it easier for very \nbig companies to merge and reduce the oversight in making sure that \nthose big mergers do not hurt consumers. Most mergers do not even go \nthrough this. I think it was in our Rules Committee yesterday where Mr. \nMarino testified it was maybe 3 percent of mergers. So only if both \ncompanies are very, very, very big companies, multinational \nconglomerates, then it goes up for review. This bill says that maybe \nthere should be a little less review. I think even the proponents say \nthere still should be review. There are several government agencies \ninvolved.\n  But it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that what this bill is really \ndoing--the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules \nAct of 2015--it almost takes a few breaths to even say it. It is one of \nthe longer bill titles that I have heard, very technical--it is really \nthe stalling on the floor of the House bill until the Republicans can \nfigure out a budget. That is exactly what we are doing here, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  I would hope that, as we stall, we could offer more substantive bills \nthat we could do in the meantime. This bill, the Standard Merger and \nAcquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules bill, is really, truly a \nsolution in search of a problem.\n  Where does this bill come from?\n  I am certainly very pro-business. I founded several businesses before \nI came here. I took a long and hard look at this bill today. I am all \nfor streamlining government processes, but I just can't imagine what \nproblem we are even trying to solve here. I don't know. I wonder where \nthe idea for this bill came from. Maybe it came from a town hall. I \nknow a lot of the best ideas that I get start from my constituents and \nsmall businesses back home. That was the argument we heard very \npassionately orated when we talked about brick kilns for an entire week \nthe other week.\n  Maybe Members are fighting for people back home. Maybe a constituent \napproached somebody in Mr. Collins' district and said: We truly wish \nreview processes for the larger corporate mergers were streamlined; \nsomething must be done about the FTC's administrative adjudication \nauthority.\n  Maybe that was the call that was resounding in town halls across the \ncountry, but it did not come up in any of mine. In Colorado's Front \nRange it simply was not the issue that my constituents were raising, \nbut I will certainly give my colleagues the benefit of the doubt. \nPerhaps there is a groundswell for addressing the FTC's administrative \nadjudication authority for the largest companies and their mergers that \nsimply has not reached Colorado. Perhaps that is the case.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is an important point I want to make. Time is very \nprecious here on the House floor. Taxpayers are paying for this time. \nIn fact, apparently tomorrow will be the last day. This will be the \nlast bill we vote on before we all get sent home for a 3-week vacation. \nWe have very limited time to pass bills that benefit the American \npeople.\n  Six years ago, nearly to this day, the House took this workweek in \nlate March and passed a little something called the Affordable Care \nAct. Now, that might not be popular with my friends on the other side \nof the aisle, but it certainly was consequential. In fact, 15 million \nmore Americans have coverage today because of what we did this same \nweek 6 years ago. We passed the first major piece of healthcare reform \nin a generation. Like it or not, we had conviction, and we passed bills \nthat helped Americans every day solve problems.\n  Now here we are 6 years later and we are debating a measure that \nhelps a few large corporations merge with each other to become even \nlarger. Look, if we want to help American business, let's find a \nbackbone, let's look at tax reform, let's look at comprehensive \nimmigration reform, let's invest in our infrastructure and in our \nschools to have a better prepared workforce. Be courageous. Let's \npresent solutions to problems, not solutions in search of a problem.\n  Here we are passing yet another bill the Senate won't consider and \nthat will never become law, and then go reward ourselves with 3 weeks \nof vacation. Look, maybe someday this bill will help one conglomerate \npurchase another conglomerate, or save them a few dollars in legal fees \nalong the way.\n  Is that exciting, Mr. Speaker, to you? Is that something that \nresounds across our country or would even contribute one iota to our \ncountry's economic growth?\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill does not solve any of the problems this \nCongress needs to take on.\n  What should we be doing this week?\n  We should be talking about making college more affordable. We should \nbe talking about growing our economy, investing in infrastructure, \nreforming our bloated Tax Code, and simplifying taxes. We should be \ntalking about passing a budget.\n  Mr. Speaker, most households have a budget. My household has a \nbudget, but this Congress does not have a budget. Instead of having a \nbudget, everybody is going on a vacation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill does not find a solution to the 11 million \nundocumented people in our country and fix our broken immigration \nsystem. This bill does not secure our borders or does not make college \nmore affordable. It is a shame that we are spending an entire week \ndebating this nonsolution in search of a problem that maybe some years \nhence will help one large company merge with another and reduce their \npaperwork to the detriment of the public interest and consumer interest \nin the American people.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I think it is interesting. It does not help. As we come down here and \ndebate--and this is a floor to do that, Mr. Speaker--let's just be very \nclear, this does not help companies merge. I am not sure why we are \nputting forth a statement that helps companies merge. It simply takes \nand it streamlines the process so that you are not having two divergent \npaths in which the scrutiny of a merger takes place.\n  If we want to at least be faithful to the bill, which is what this \ndoes, it does not make substantive changes to antitrust law. Rather, \nthis legislation standardizes the process between the two antitrust \nenforcement agencies.\n  Look, I grew up in north Georgia, and there were a lot of times \nespecially--I have had some small businesses, and I appreciate the \ngentleman from Colorado, but I bet there are many times in his \nbusinesses that the things that you do every day, it is like being a \npart of a family. It is doing chores, it is doing the work that needs \nto be done. It may not hit the front page of the paper, it may not be \nthe glamorous piece that anybody would want to talk about. Those things \nare getting discussed and those things are moving forward. Maybe not at \nthe pace that some would like to see, but we are moving forward with \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page H1511]]\n\n  The question is if a bill that simply streamlines and provides some \nefficiency that even this current Department of Justice assistant \nattorney general for the antitrust division stated, I don't think that \nthere is a real practical difference in how courts assess the factual \nlegal basis for enjoining a merger challenged by the FTC on the one \nhand or the Department on the other.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Basically, we are doing some of the administrative work that needs to \nbe done to lay the groundwork so that we don't have divergent opinions, \nso that we don't have two processes out there. If that is not exciting \nenough, then I am sorry. There are a lot of things that we do that do \naffect business, that do affect the streamlining of government. There \nare a lot of things that I would like to see us work on and that we are \ncontinuing to work on.\n  On this issue of ``will the Senate take it up or not?'' I, frankly, \nMr. Speaker, don't care. If they don't want to do their job, that is \ntheir problem. If they have other agendas, then that is their problem. \nThat is why there are two separate bodies on the Hill--there is the \nHouse, and then there is the Senate. We must work in tandem when we \ncan, but we also must work with our own individual agendas to move \nforward what, in our perspective, is a conservative agenda for this \ncountry.\n  The other thing that is very concerning is--and there are a lot of \nissues here, and I appreciate the gentleman's speaking, Mr. Speaker, \nabout where ideas come from. I am very concerned--and I know the \nSpeaker is as well--about where ideas and processes come from for bills \nhere. The best place, as the gentleman stated, is from back home--being \nwith members and being with constituents and being with the businesses \nand being with the school groups and being with the folks in the places \nwhich we come from. I am born and raised in my district. As is the old \nsaying, good Lord willing, by August, it will have been 50 years I will \nhave lived in my district. I know my district and have gotten to know \ntheir concerns.\n  Do I believe there are a lot of things we can do up here? Yes, but I \nget to go home to my district, and I get to listen to people. I will be \nhappy to read my schedule for the next few weeks while I am in the \ndistrict, and if that sounds like a vacation to you, maybe we will have \na different opinion on what a vacation looks like, because I am going \nto be going to businesses which, over the past few years, have been \nhurt by a healthcare policy that was put in place, and they don't know \nif they can hire new members. They have had to downsize--they have had \nto stop progress--and they are just being, all the time, encircled with \nregulations that keep them from hiring and from providing good jobs in \nthe Ninth District of Georgia.\n  I don't know about what others do on their time back in their \ndistricts. I go to talk to school groups who ask the question: What do \ntheir futures look like with an ever-increasing pile of debt? They look \nat their futures, and they ask: What is this country? They look at the \nfuture around the world when they see attacks, such as this morning in \nBrussels, and they ask where their place is in the world. What is \nAmerica's role? These are the kinds of things that are discussed on my \ntime when I am in the district.\n  I believe we could work up here every day, and I will be supportive \nof that; but when I go back home to the district, when it is scheduled \nfor us as Members to go home, then, frankly, maybe there is just a \ndefinitional difference in vacations. For me, it is to go home and \nlisten and to be a part and to, yes, spend some time with my family. At \nthe same point in time, every day, I get up and go out and talk to the \ndistrict, and I talk to these people who have issues with Washington, \nD.C.: with their tax burdens, with their regulatory burdens, with their \nhealthcare burdens, and with all of these supposed fixes.\n  Many times, like I said, I believe the Republican majority, in the \nlast 5 years, has had to undo and fix the problems that were so \nforcefully allocated. We have got a banking system in our district that \nis still having trouble with banks being able to make loans, banks \nbeing able to do the things that they are supposed to be doing to help \nour business community, because they are strangled with regulatory \nburden.\n  You see, these are the issues that we can discuss here, and I \nappreciate the argument. Also, as we go back to the bill before us, \nsometimes it may not make the front page of whatever you read, but when \nyou have two agencies that do, basically, a similar function in the \nmerger arena and when they do it differently--and even the current \nDepartment of Justice and the chairwoman for the mergers and \nacquisitions were looking at this and were saying that this just needs \nto be better--this bill is a positive step forward. As we move forward \nto the debate that will happen this afternoon, I look forward to the \ndebate of the committee as it discusses the ins and outs of this bill.\n  Before we go any further, I think we just need to be honest with the \nAmerican people and say that these are ideas that are worth having and \nthat also, when we are back in the districts, their ideas are worth \nhaving, because that is where the best ideas come from. That is where \nour homes are, and that is who we represent up here. It is never a \nburden to go home. Many times, it is a burden to come up here and fight \nagainst values that you have in your district that are not valued on \nthe other side of the aisle. That is the burden that we will continue \nto fight. We will continue to stand as a conservative bearer on this \nside to say that this is a government that needs to work for the people \nand not at the people. That is the biggest difference that you will see \non this floor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I think the American people deserve to know what Members of Congress \nare doing to earn their salaries.\n  This week--3 days--this bill is the only bill under a rule that this \nCongress is even considering. Let me tell you how Congress calculates \ndays, Mr. Speaker, because most Americans think, ``Okay. A day, maybe I \ngo to work at 9 o'clock and come home at 5 o'clock. That is a day.'' \nLet me tell you that Congress has a different definition of a day for \nMembers of Congress.\n  Monday, we started at 6:30 p.m.--not a.m. but p.m. Now, Mr. Collins \nand I got to come in at 5 p.m. to start. We started early. Mr. Collins \nand I worked an extra hour and a half. I asked the Speaker if Mr. \nCollins did, and he did start at 5 o'clock with me. We worked an extra \nhour and a half; but you, Mr. Speaker--I don't think you started until \n6:30. That is when the votes occurred.\n  On Tuesday--that is today--that is a real day. I will give you that. \nWe are working on Tuesday. I started this morning at around 8 o'clock, \nand I fully expect we will go until 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock. That is a \ngood day. That is good. I can be proud of that for my kids that I \nworked a good day and can tell anybody back home.\n  Tomorrow, Wednesday--this day, we are working today. I would ask my \ncolleague from Georgia: Does the gentleman know what time we expect to \nfinish tomorrow? I would ask Mr. Collins if he knows what time we are \nscheduled to finish tomorrow.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. It is the majority leader's prerogative, as \nthe gentleman from Colorado is well aware.\n  Mr. POLIS. What is that?\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. After the final votes are cast tomorrow, it \nis the majority leader's prerogative, as the gentleman from Colorado is \nwell aware.\n  Mr. POLIS. I heard it was around noon or, maybe, 12:30. I think I \nheard a lot of Members discussing whether they could catch their \nflights at around 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock. I don't know if they are \ngoing off to the Caribbean for their vacations or what. So, in this \nweek, in which the Republicans are claiming we are working 3 days, I \ncall it 1 day--Tuesday--and maybe half a day on Wednesday and maybe an \nhour or two on Monday.\n  Look, that is not the kind of job that the American people expect us \nto do here. They want us to work full days. Why aren't we here all \nweek? Why aren't we bringing up more than one bill? Fine. This bill can \nhave its day in\n\n[[Page H1512]]\n\nthe Sun, and, as Mr. Collins said, not every bill is glamorous. Maybe \nthere are some really big companies that want to be merged with other \nreally big companies, and they feel it is too much paperwork to do it. \nLet's discuss it. Let's do that in a half a day. I mean, let's do that \non Monday. Instead of coming in at 6 o'clock, maybe we come in at noon \nand sleep until 11 o'clock--that should be late enough for Members of \nCongress to sleep--and debate it for a few hours. Then let's do \nsomething else on Tuesday. Let's do a budget on Tuesday. Let's do \nsomething about the Zika virus on Tuesday. Let's do something about the \nPuerto Rico virus on Tuesday. On Wednesday, let's get to work and do \nmore, right? I mean, let's roll up our sleeves and get to work. Let's \nnot go home at noon.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have a very exciting motion I will be able to make \nhere. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to \nthe rule to prohibit the House from starting a 2-week recess tomorrow \nunless we do our job and pass a budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent to insert that amendment in the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Now, this is very exciting, Mr. Speaker, because I am \ngiving my colleagues an opportunity. As to this previous question vote, \nif we vote it down--a ``no'' vote--it will mean ``Congress, don't go on \nvacation. Do your job and pass the budget.'' A ``yes'' vote means ``go \non vacation, and forget about a budget.'' With this motion that I am \nintroducing here, if we defeat the previous question, I am really \ncalling on Members of Congress to account as to whether they think we \nshould do our job or whether we should go home after making it easier \nfor very big companies to merge.\n  I hope that the answer is the one that the men and women who are \nlistening at home would agree is the logical answer: that we should \nstay here and do our jobs. We will see here in a few minutes what my \ncolleagues want to do: whether they agree with me that we should stay \nhere and do our jobs or whether they think that we should allow bigger \ncompanies to have facilitated mergers and then go home.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. I am \ninterested in whether the gentleman from Colorado has any more speakers \nor if he is ready to close.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close.\n  I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  It is interesting, Mr. Speaker, that my good friend and colleague Mr. \nCollins from Georgia said that maybe this bill is important, that maybe \nit is one of those things that might not be glamorous but that has to \nbe done, that it is important. Yet I think it speaks volumes, Mr. \nSpeaker, that not a single person even showed up to this debate besides \nMr. Collins and me, who have to be here. No Republicans who, I guess, \nsupport this bill and no Democrats--and there might even be some \nDemocrats, I think, who support this bill or oppose this bill--I mean, \nno one even came.\n  That is because everybody knows this bill is not going anywhere. The \nSenate won't consider it. The President won't sign it. The American \npeople have not been crying out for it. Big multinational corporations \nare perfectly able to merge today as long as they are not blocked by \nthe FTC or the DOJ for antitrust. This bill doesn't solve any problems. \nNot a single Republican even came to the floor to argue about why we \nneeded this bill, with the exception, of course, of my good friend and \ncolleague Mr. Collins and me, who have to be here because we are \nrunning the debate.\n  What does that mean when even the proponents of this bill don't even \ncome here to tell us why they want it? I think it shows a certain moral \nbankruptcy, Mr. Speaker, and it exposes the veneer off the fact that \nthis is, simply, a time-stalling bill because Republicans don't have a \nbudget, and they want us to go on vacation right away.\n  Look, as to this bill that is being considered, I will address some \nof its merits. It would alter the process in which the Federal Trade \nCommission acts to regulate mergers and guarantee a competitive \nmarketplace and protect consumers. I am sure there are valid and \nimportant arguments on both sides of this bill. The FTC was created in \n1914 as an independent, bipartisan agency, and it has unique tools to \nlook after consumers in order to make sure that when two large \ncompanies merge that it doesn't hurt consumers. Of course, because the \nFTC and the DOJ have overlapping responsibilities, there are issues \nbetween them. If there is a pressing problem, I would be happy to \nconsider this bill under an open rule.\n  Now, what does that mean?\n  It means that I believe--and the Democrats on the Rules Committee \nyesterday made a motion to this effect--that we should allow Democrats \nand Republicans to offer amendments on this bill to say: Do you know \nwhat? Maybe there is a problem. Maybe we need to improve it. Maybe we \nneed to change it. Do you know what? That motion for an open rule was \nvoted down on a partisan vote.\n  Perhaps that is the reason, Mr. Speaker, that no Republicans or \nDemocrats bothered to come in on this bill, because the Republicans \nhave locked us out of participating. They have locked out the \nDemocratic and Republican rank-and-file Members, who represent great \ndistricts across our country, like from Texas and California and New \nYork and Wisconsin--Democrats and Republicans. No one with any good \nideas can even try to make this bill better. No wonder people aren't \nbothering to come to the floor in droves. It is because their ideas--\nand they are good ideas, and good ideas even come from Republicans, Mr. \nSpeaker--are locked out of inclusion in this bill.\n  Do you know what? In 2007, Congress established the Antitrust \nModernization Commission, which released 80 recommendations for \nrevisions to antitrust law and policy. Of those recommendations, one of \nthem advocated for the elimination of the FTC's administrative \nadjudication authority, and another proposed the adoption of a uniform \npreliminary injunction standard. Those are two things that are in this \nbill. To date, Congress has not considered the other 78 ideas that came \nout of this obscure Commission that were reported back that only affect \nthe world's largest companies that merge with one another.\n  If we had an open rule, I could bring forward some of those other 78 \nideas. If this is such a pressing problem and if we need to spend our \nfull day in session here this week in talking about making it easier \nfor corporations to buy one another, why not go all out and allow a \ndiscussion of the other 78 ideas that the Antitrust Modernization \nCommission recommended?\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a half measure that is a solution in search of a \nproblem. Instead of debating bills like the one here today, we should \nbe tackling problems that the American people sent us here to work on. \nWe should work an honest workweek rather than an hour on Monday, a full \nday on Tuesday, a half a day on Wednesday, and take Thursday off and \ntake Friday off. The American people deserve an honest week.\n  They deserve us to get the budget done. Just like our households have \na budget, Congress deserves a budget. I am sure, in the past, my \ncolleague and many others have reminded us that Democrats, at times, \nhave also failed to produce budgets. I am saying neither side is \nperfect. I am not proud that the Democrats, in the past, have failed to \nproduce a budget, but what we are talking about today are the \nRepublicans who are failing to produce a budget.\n  I remember very distinctly that, when the Democrats had difficulty \nproducing a budget, the Republicans said: How dare you. Produce a \nbudget. Our households rely on budgets. Why can't the Congress have a \nbudget?\n  That was one of the arguments that my colleagues made to the American \npeople, and the American people, for that reason and perhaps others, \ngave control of this body to the Republicans. Now here we are with the \nRepublicans, who, instead of producing a budget, are sending every \nMember of Congress home on vacation for 2\\1/2\\ weeks after working a \nvery taxing 1\\1/2\\-day week, making it easier for multinational \ncorporations to merge.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we can do better. As I mentioned earlier, when we do \ndefeat\n\n[[Page H1513]]\n\nthe previous question on the vote, the amendment I have offered into \nthe Record will amend the rule to prohibit the House from starting our \nvacation tomorrow, unless we do our job and pass a budget.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule, vote ``no'' \non the underlying bill, and, instead, work to pass a budget and find \nsolutions to the big problems that we were sent here to face, like \nimproving our national security, like securing our border and replacing \nour broken immigration system into one that reflects our values as a \nNation of laws and a Nation of immigrants, one that makes prescription \ndrugs more affordable and improves upon the Affordable Care Act, \nimproves our schools, invests in infrastructure, and so many of the \nother issues that I hear about from my constituents at our town halls, \non the phone, and in letters.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and the underlying \nbill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  I always try to be positive. There is one thing I do agree on with my \nfriend from Colorado just now, and that is that we can do better.\n  We can do better about explaining what is actually going on here and \ntalking about it in derisive terms, especially about a bill in which \nthere was--I serve on the Judiciary Committee--there was one amendment \nbrought to committee. This bill seems to be fairly tight because there \nseems to be general agreement here.\n  There was one committee amendment brought to the committee, and it \nwas withdrawn. Then there was an amendment process put out.\n  It is interesting that, from this Antitrust Modernization Commission, \nthere were 78 other ideas. And then, when my friend just spoke about \nthe fact that, if we had an open rule on the floor, they might bring up \n78.\n  I would just ask him where was he yesterday. We have talked about \nshowing up for work. Maybe he didn't punch in last night. He could have \nbrought 78 amendments last night to the Rules Committee. He chose not \nto.\n  So we can do better. We can honestly discuss the procedures and the \nfact that right now, while he and I are on the floor discussing this \nrule and preparing for this rule, the rest of the 433 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives--432 now--I think we still have one open \nseat--are in committees right now.\n  They are meeting constituents. They are marking up bills. They are \ngoing through regular order, which is the Republican Congress' way of \ndoing the people's business.\n  Also, as we have already discussed, whether the Senate signs \nsomething or not--then he brought up the fact that the President would \nnever sign this piece of legislation.\n  Well, let's just remind the people what the administration doesn't \nalso sign. They won't also sign the Keystone Pipeline, which takes away \njobs from Americans.\n  He won't also sign a refugee bill that actually would just put an \nextra measure of protection for protecting the American homeland from \npossibly infiltration through the refugee program. They refuse to sign \nthat.\n  Yet, we will have the results of the world looking at that. He won't \nsign that, Mr. Speaker. The administration doesn't seem to want to hold \nIran accountable for the testing that it is doing with its missiles.\n  So we can discuss what this administration doesn't want to sign. I \nthink using that as an excuse not to move a bill is an abdication of \nresponsibility.\n  So as we look forward, again, I have never thought anything that I do \nup here, especially when it comes to my office or in committee work, \nwas not working.\n  I think, frankly, it is sort of disrespectful to the folks who come \nto our offices and meet with us or the committee work that we do to say \nthat the only ``work'' is here before the cameras making speeches. If \nthat is what work is about up here, maybe we have just found the \nproblem with this Congress.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, parties to a merger should expect and receive the \nsame treatment and processes, regardless of the reviewing antitrust \nenforcement agencies.\n  These parties should not be subject to attempts to extract \nconcessions or threat of administrative litigation by the FDC simply \nbecause that is the agency reviewing the merger.\n  The underlying bill preserves key standards of review while removing \ndisparities. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this rule \nand H.R. 2745.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 653 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     section:\n       Sec. 6. It shall not be in order to consider a motion that \n     the House adjourn on the legislative day of March 23, 2016, \n     unless the House has adopted a concurrent resolution \n     establishing the budget for the United States government for \n     fiscal year 2017.\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1513-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1513-H1514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 4742) to authorize the National Science Foundation to \nsupport entrepreneurial programs for women.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4742\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Women in \n     Entrepreneurship Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) women make up almost 50 percent of the workforce, but \n     less than 25 percent of the workforce in science, technology, \n     engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions;\n       (2) women are less likely to focus on the STEM disciplines \n     in undergraduate and graduate study;\n       (3) only 26 percent of women who do attain degrees in STEM \n     fields work in STEM jobs;\n       (4) there is an increasing demand for individuals with STEM \n     degrees to extend their focus beyond the laboratory so they \n     can be leaders in discovery commercialization;\n       (5) studies have shown that technology and \n     commercialization ventures are successful when women are in \n     top management positions; and\n       (6) the National Science Foundation's mission includes \n     supporting women in STEM disciplines.\n\n     SEC. 3. SUPPORTING WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURIAL PROGRAMS.\n\n       Section 33 of the Science and Engineering Equal \n     Opportunities Act (42 U.S.C. 1885a) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (10);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (11) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(12) encourage its entrepreneurial programs to recruit \n     and support women to extend their focus beyond the laboratory \n     and into the commercial world.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia). Pursuant to \nthe rule, the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) and the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on H.R. 4742, the bill now under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today to offer a bipartisan bill Ms. Esty and I introduced, \nH.R. 4742, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act.\n  We were also joined by the chairman and ranking member of the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee, Congressman Lamar Smith and \nCongresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, who are original cosponsors of \nthis measure.\n  I am pleased that the consideration of this bill occurs during \nWomen's History Month. Our bill amends the Science and Engineering \nEqual Opportunities Act to authorize the National Science Foundation to \nuse its entrepreneurial programs to recruit women and to extend their \nfocus beyond the laboratory and into the commercial world.\n  The bill also includes a number of findings regarding women in \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, also known as \nthe STEM fields.\n  One finding in this bill notes that only 26 percent of women who \nattain degrees in STEM fields ultimately work in STEM jobs. We want to \nimprove these statistics, and we believe this bill is a step in the \nright direction.\n  Again, I am happy to collaborate with my colleague, Congresswoman \nEsty, on this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 4742, the Promoting Women in \nEntrepreneurship Act. This bill would expand the mission of the \nNational Science Foundation to support and strengthen women \nentrepreneurs. I drafted this legislation because we can and we must do \nmore for women in science, technology, engineering, and math, the so-\ncalled STEM fields, to extend their efforts beyond the laboratory and \ninto the commercial world.\n  Women have the potential to be remarkable entrepreneurs, job \ncreators, and innovators. Unfortunately, women remain an underutilized \nforce for starting small businesses that sustain the middle class.\n  Women make up roughly half of the labor force. But according to the \nDepartment of Commerce, women only own 30 percent of private businesses \nin the United States.\n  Why is it that women aren't starting their own businesses more often? \nThe sad truth is that women still face significant barriers to \nentrepreneurship, including limited access to capital, a lack of women \nmentors in STEM fields, often difficult or unmanageable expectations \nfor work-life balance, and a subconscious bias against women in STEM.\n  Now, an increasing number of women are earning STEM degrees. However, \nwomen are still largely underrepresented in all STEM fields, including \nsignificantly the ones that have the highest entrepreneurship rates.\n  For example, in 2012, women earned only one in five Ph.D.'s granted \nby U.S. institutions in computer science. We must do better at \nincreasing representation of women in all STEM fields.\n  Now, I may be biased, but my own State of Connecticut is a great \nexample of how far women can go with a STEM background.\n  We have women engineers who are designing life-support packs for our \nastronauts at the International Space Station. We have women scientists \nconducting cutting-edge research in STEM cell work at Yukon and at \nYale.\n  We have women inventors and entrepreneurs making life-changing \ndiscoveries and literally altering the course of history. We have \nwonderful local companies with women entrepreneurs, such as Bedoukian \nResearch and Jonal Labs, who are not only creating quality products, \nbut are fostering the next generation of women leaders in STEM. I think \nwe might have had one in the gallery who was excited about our \nintroduction of this bill.\n  It is not enough to promote women in STEM careers. We must also work \nto increase the number of women who become entrepreneurs. The benefits \nof encouraging and supporting women entrepreneurs could be tremendous.\n  According to the Department of Commerce, between 1997 and 2007, \nprivately held women-owned businesses added 500,000 jobs. During that \nsame period, other privately held firms lost over 2 million jobs.\n  Women have unique experiences and perspectives to bring to the table. \nWe simply cannot afford in this increasingly global economy to overlook \nthe valuable and talented resource of over half our citizens.\n  We must do more to promote women entrepreneurs and to better support \nwomen who are commercializing great ideas, starting small businesses, \nand creating jobs.\n  I know, when I hear from the women and the men who are part of my \nSTEM advisory committee in Connecticut about the challenges and, yet, \nthe great opportunities that women in the STEM fields have to create \nthe next new exciting business, develop the next new cure to help \nAmericans.\n  H.R. 4742 would help do that by supporting programs focused on \nhelping more women, commercialize great ideas, start businesses, \nstimulate 21st century careers, and strengthen the middle class.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee, Mrs. Comstock, Ranking Member Johnson, and Chairman Smith, \nfor working with us together on this bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded not to make reference \nto occupants of the gallery.\n\n[[Page H1515]]\n\n  \n\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and \nfor her work on this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, innovation rises up from all parts of this country. One \nof the main purposes of the Innovation Initiative is to empower people \nto make new discoveries and guide our country into the future. When we \ndo that, we ensure America remains a global leader and everyone in \nAmerica and abroad benefits.\n  We have two bills today to build innovation from the ground up, \nfocusing on future women leaders in America. Because when you look back \non history, you see women at the forefront.\n  You look at Grace Hopper, who was one of the first programmers of our \nearliest computers. Stephanie Kwolek invented Kevlar. Shirley Ann \nJackson laid the foundation for amazing advancements in communication, \nlike fiber optic cables and portable fax machines.\n  These are all women who fueled positive disruption with their ideas. \nThis is the positive disruption America needs to prosper.\n  So we should encourage a learning environment where young women \ncontinue to have the opportunities to explore the interests in STEM \nsubjects.\n  Today we will pass a bill by Congresswoman Barbara Comstock to enable \nretired NASA astronauts, engineers, and scientists to work with female \nSTEM students who will lead the next generation.\n  We are also voting to authorize the National Science Foundation to \nwork with its entrepreneur programs to recruit more women who can be \nthe top innovators in the lab and beyond.\n  With these two items, the Innovation Initiative continues to empower \nthe American people for the sake of the American people, removing \nobstacles to success while bringing innovation into government.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 4742, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, for over the past year, STEM education has been a \ncritical part of many debates we have had here on the House floor.\n  We have discussed it in the context of reauthorization of critical \neducation programs and with respect to how it can drive American \ninnovation in research and technology.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  The discussion we are having here today--a dialogue as to how we can \nencourage more women who wish to pursue a course of study in STEM \nfields to follow through beyond the classroom and build successful \ncareers in science, math, and technology fields--is very important for \neconomic growth in this country and to ensure young women help pioneer \nnew innovation in this country for generations to come.\n  We have heard the statistics, Mr. Speaker. Women make up half of the \nU.S. workforce and half of the college-educated workforce, yet only 26 \npercent of women who attain degrees in STEM fields end up working in \nSTEM jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why I rise today in strong support of this \nsimple, commonsense legislation. By encouraging entrepreneurial \nprograms to recruit and support women to extend their focus beyond the \nlaboratory and into the commercial world, we can take a significant \nstep in the right direction.\n  Further, by having this debate and discussion here today and by \nencouraging all of our best and brightest to pursue the education and \ncareer path of their dreams, we are taking a necessary step to include \nthis as part of our ongoing dialogue with respect to the delivery of \nSTEM education in our classrooms and what it will take to develop \nAmerican innovation for future generations.\n  I would like to commend Representative Esty and Representative \nComstock for their efforts on this legislation. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to support it.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, as the mom of a daughter with a biology \ndegree major and with a master's degree in forensic science who is now \nworking in the STEM fields, I ask that my colleagues support this \nbipartisan legislation to promote women in the workforce and in STEM \nfields.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4742 the \n``Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act.''\n  As a Senior Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security who \nsits on the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, \nand Security Technologies, I know well of the need to encourage and \ntrain women to thrive in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and \nMathematics (STEM) fields.\n  Promoting diversity in the STEM professions is more than just an \nidea; it requires an understanding that there is a need to have a \nprocess that will ensure the inclusion of all minorities and women in \nall areas of American life.\n  Studies have found that women make up almost 50 percent of the \nworkforce.\n  Studies note that 23 percent of STEM workers are women; however, \nwomen make up 48 percent of workers in all occupations.\n  Only 26 percent of women who do attain degrees in STEM fields work in \nSTEM jobs.\n  According to the most recent available data women are less likely to \nfocus on the STEM disciplines in undergraduate and graduate studies.\n  In 1991, women received 29.6 percent of computer science B.A.'s, \ncompared to just 18.2 percent in 2010.\n  Jobs in computer systems design and related services, a field \ndependent upon high-level math and problem-solving skills, are \nprojected to grow 45 percent between 2008 and 2018.\n  There are approximately 6 million women and minority owned businesses \nin the United States, representing a significant aspect of our economy.\n  My home city of Houston, Texas, the energy capital of the world, \nknows the importance of professionals in the STEM industries.\n  It has been reported that the highest-paying STEM occupations are \npetroleum engineers with an annual salary of $147,520, architectural \nand engineering managers with an annual salary of $138,720, natural \nsciences managers with an annual salary of $136,450, computer and \ninformation systems managers with an annual salary of $136,280, and \nphysicists with a reported annual salary of 117,300.\n  There is an increasing demand for individuals with STEM degrees to \nextend their focus beyond the laboratory so they can be leaders in \ndiscovery and commercialization.\n  Women deserve a fair shot in the STEM programs in this nation.\n  In addition, I believe that work needs to be done to modernize key \ncontracting developmental programs designed to increase opportunities \nfor women, minorities and low-income individuals who pursue STEM \ndegrees and STEM job training.\n  I support programs at the National Science Foundation that have \nworked to reduce the current barriers and ensure women have the support \nthey need in the STEM fields.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should encourage women to pursue degrees and careers \nin the STEM fields so we can continue to compete in the global economy.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4742, the \nPromoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act. Now more than ever STEM fields \nare dictating the way business in the United States is conducted. The \nsuccessful commercialization of technology has expanded opportunities \nfor those with STEM degrees. It is imperative that we promote women as \npart of this crucial expansion in order to promote equality in the \nadvancing technological age.\n  A Harvard Business Review article released last March described the \ntop biases pushing women out of STEM fields. To women in any workplace \nthis comes as no surprise. The constant need to prove ourselves more \ntimes over than our male counterparts, the tightrope of navigating a \nmasculine workspace while holding true to our feminine identity and, \nthe general isolation of being a woman in a male-dominated field are \nall too common in today's workplaces. In my District, Wayne State \nUniversity has a program called GO-GIRL, Gaining Options-Girls \nInvestigate Real Life. The mission of this program is to increase the \ncompetence and confidence of adolescent girls by engaging them in \nexperiences that promote an interest in STEM education while building \ntheir capacity to pursue STEM-related careers. While programs like this \nare currently helping girls nationwide, we must continue the progress \nthat has been made and expand upon our success.\n  The Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act amends Section 33 of the \nScience and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act by including a key \nphrase that ``encourage[s] its entrepreneurial programs to recruit and \nsupport\n\n[[Page H1516]]\n\nwomen to extend their focus beyond the laboratory and into the \ncommercial world.'' The commercialization of STEM fields has created a \nvast new sector of jobs and careers, a sector that must include women \nprofessionals. This Act does just that, ensuring the inclusion of women \nin one of America's most important and fast developing industries.\n  I would like to close by saying that I am proud of our chamber for \ncoming together to ensure that women continue to achieve success in \nSTEM fields. I also want to thank my colleagues for considering two \nbills today that highlight the importance of reaching out to young \nwomen who otherwise may not be inspired to pursue a career in a STEM-\nrelated field.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4742, the Promoting \nWomen in Entrepreneurship Act. I thank my Science Committee colleagues \nMs. Esty, who authored the bill, and Research and Technology \nSubcommittee Chairwoman Comstock for their initiative on this issue.\n  H.R. 4742 authorizes the National Science Foundation (NSF) to use its \nexisting entrepreneurial programs to recruit and support women and help \nthem develop their research and technology ideas for the marketplace.\n  STEM education is critical to our country's economy and global \ncompetitiveness. A well-educated and trained STEM workforce promotes \nour future economic prosperity.\n  These STEM workers have the potential to develop technologies that \ncould save thousands of lives, jump-start new industries, or even \ndiscover new worlds.\n  That's why I authored with Ms. Esty the STEM Education Act, a new law \nthat strengthens science, technology, engineering and mathematics \neducation efforts at federal science agencies. It also, for the first \ntime, expands the definition of STEM to include computer science. The \nbill was signed by the President last October.\n  Unfortunately, studies show that only 26 percent of women who attain \ndegrees in STEM fields work in STEM jobs.\n  H.R. 4742 encourages NSF to tackle this problem. It enhances women's \nability to translate their enthusiasm, scientific expertise and \nresearch ideas into tangible products and businesses.\n  Inspiring American students to seek science and math careers is a \ngoal shared by Republicans and Democrats alike. Some of the most \nenergizing and exciting moments of my Science Committee chairmanship \nhave been interactions with young people who want to pursue STEM \nstudies and careers.\n  At various Committee hearings and robotics competitions in my \ndistrict, I have encountered motivated, talented young people who want \nnothing more than an opportunity to pursue their dreams. And, in some \ncases, change the world with their ideas.\n  Their passion for learning and science reminds me of why I enjoy \nserving in Congress and on the Science Committee.\n  I again thank Ms. Esty and Chairwoman Comstock for their work on this \nbill. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 4742.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4742.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1516-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1516-H1518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    INSPIRING THE NEXT SPACE PIONEERS, INNOVATORS, RESEARCHERS, AND \n                     EXPLORERS (INSPIRE) WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 4755) to inspire women to enter the aerospace field, \nincluding science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, through \nmentorship and outreach.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4755\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS are virtual mentoring programs \n     using commercially available video chat programs to pair \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration mentors with \n     young students anywhere in the country. NASA GIRLS and NASA \n     BOYS give young students the opportunity to interact and \n     learn from real engineers, scientists, and technologists.\n       (2) The Aspire to Inspire (A2I) program engages young girls \n     to present science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \n     (STEM) career opportunities through the real lives and jobs \n     of early career women at NASA.\n       (3) The Summer Institute in Science, Technology, \n     Engineering, and Research (SISTER) program at the Goddard \n     Space Flight Center is designed to increase awareness of, and \n     provide an opportunity for, female middle school students to \n     be exposed to and explore nontraditional career fields with \n     Goddard Space Flight Center women engineers, mathematicians, \n     scientists, technicians, and researchers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

This plan shall--\n       (1) report on existing activities with current and retired \n     NASA astronauts, scientists, engineers, and innovators;\n       (2) identify how NASA could best leverage existing \n     authorities to facilitate and support current and retired \n     astronaut, scientist, engineer, and innovator participation \n     in NASA outreach efforts;\n       (3) propose and describe a program specific to retired \n     astronauts, scientists, engineers, and innovators; and\n       (4) identify any additional authorities necessary to \n     institute such a program.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nVirginia (Mrs. Comstock) and the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. \nEsty) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on H.R. 4755, the bill now under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise again to offer another bill, H.R. 4755, the \nINSPIRE Act. I am pleased to lead this effort along with the chairman \nand ranking member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \nLamar Smith and Eddie Bernice Johnson, as well as Congresswoman Esty.\n  This bill authorizes the NASA Administrator to encourage young women \nto study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, known as \nthe STEM fields, and to pursue careers that will further advance \nAmerica's space science and exploration efforts through support of NASA \ninitiatives, such as NASA GIRLS, Aspire 2 Inspire, and the Summer \nInstitute in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Research, SISTER.\n  The goal of NASA GIRLS is to create a virtual mentoring project that \noffers a one-of-a-kind experience to middle school students using \nonline capabilities. I should mention there also is a NASA BOYS.\n  NASA's vision for Aspire 2 Inspire was to reach out to young girls \nand present some of the science, technology, engineering, and math \ncareer opportunities through the real lives and jobs of early career \nwomen at NASA.\n  The SISTER program is designed to increase awareness of and provide \nan\n\n[[Page H1517]]\n\nopportunity for female middle school students to be exposed to and \nexplore nontraditional career fields with Goddard Space Flight Center \nwomen engineers, mathematicians, scientists, technicians, and \nresearchers.\n  According to NASA, 58 women have traveled in space. Forty-nine of \nthose have flown with NASA. Most Americans are familiar with Sally \nRide, the first American woman in space. We all remember that special \nmoment when this true trailblazer literally raised the bar of \nachievement to new heights. She accomplished this milestone in 1983.\n  In a lecture she gave at Berkeley later, Ride said she saw an ad for \nbeing an astronaut in the student newspaper. She said: ``The moment I \nsaw that ad, I knew that's what I wanted to do.''\n  Now, imagine how so many young girls can now see so many other women \nand be exposed to that kind of leadership.\n  We cannot discuss female firsts in space without also discussing Mae \nJemison, who was the first African American woman in space, also an \ninspired leader.\n  She was inspired by Sally Ride's achievement; so, she applied to the \nastronaut program in 1983. It was 4 long years before she received the \ncall from NASA, and she was selected as one of 15 candidates out of \nroughly 2,000 applicants.\n  Her trip to space was aboard the Endeavor in 1992. She served as a \nmission specialist on STS-47, which was a cooperative mission between \nthe U.S. and Japan, during which 44 life science and materials \nprocessing experiments were conducted. STS-47 also happened to be the \n50th shuttle mission for NASA.\n  Later in 1995, it was Eileen Collins who became the first female to \ncommand and pilot a spacecraft, STS-63. She also commanded two more \nspace missions, one in 1997 aboard STS-84, and one in 2005 aboard STS-\n114.\n  This mission, STS-114, was another first, as she became the first \nastronaut--male or female--to fly a space shuttle through a 360-degree \npitch maneuver so that individuals inside the International Space \nStation could inspect the belly of the shuttle for damage.\n  When asked to give advice for future astronauts, Collins stated: ``My \nadvice to young people is go into the field you are most interested in. \nIf you love your job, you'll do well in your job.''\n  I know, Mr. Speaker, from my Young Women Leadership Program, where we \nare able to get young girls in junior high and high school to come and \nhear from young leaders, hearing from these young astronauts--which we \nhave been privileged to hear from often about all their work and the \nmany different areas that they work in--has been one of the most \npopular programs.\n  There are many other women who have contributed to America's space-\nrelated endeavors, and we want to continue to make sure that that path \nis widened for them.\n  These women are physicists, chemists, pilots, astronauts, doctors, \nbiologists. The list goes on. According to the women@nasa Web site \ntoday, there are more opportunities than ever before to join as we \nreach for the stars.\n  I urge you to visit the Web site--it is women.nasa.gov--to learn \nmore. It is in these areas in the sciences that we can help ensure \nAmerica remains a world leader.\n  These are the jobs for the 21st century that we very much want young \nAmerican women to be engaged and involved in. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 4755, the Inspiring the Next Space \nPioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and Explorers Women Act.\n  This bill calls on the NASA Administrator to support initiatives that \nencourage girls and young women to study STEM fields and pursue careers \nin aerospace.\n  Unfortunately, women are still underrepresented in many STEM fields, \nincluding aerospace, but NASA is working hard to change that.\n  They have developed a number of innovative programs that aim to \ninspire and encourage young girls and women to pursue STEM degrees and \nSTEM careers.\n  These include the NASA GIRLS program, the Aspire 2 Inspire program, \nand the Summer Institute in Science, Technology, Engineering, and \nResearch, or SISTER, program.\n  The NASA GIRLS program is a virtual mentoring program where middle \nschool students are mentored by NASA employees online.\n  The Aspire 2 Inspire program is another online program where girls \nand young women can watch films of women who have exciting careers at \nNASA. This program gives young girls a firsthand look at what a STEM \ncareer at NASA could actually entail.\n  The Summer Institute in Science, Technology, Engineering, and \nResearch, the so-called SISTER program, is an intensive 1-week program \nwhere middle school girls can explore careers in science, technology, \nengineering, and math fields with NASA women researchers.\n  It is almost impossible to overstate the value of exposing young \nstudents to STEM role models who look like them.\n  I have seen the impact that a single encounter can have on a young \nperson when I helped arrange a direct link between an astronaut and \n3,000 students in my district when he was in the International Space \nStation.\n  It was electric and exciting and inspired everyone in that room to \nthink about reaching beyond what they had seen and what they knew.\n  Without these sorts of experiences, students, especially young girls, \nmay think careers in STEM fields are not available to them.\n  I am particularly supportive of this bill because it has a focus on \nmiddle school girls. Research has shown that this is a crucial time to \nengage girls in considering pursuing careers in science.\n  I have to say I myself got inspired to pursue more about science \nwhen, as a middle schooler, I was at camp and joined my fellow campers \nstaring up at the Moon for the first spacewalk and landing on the Moon. \nSo I know the impact that this can have on a 12- or 13-year-old.\n  H.R. 4755 instructs the NASA Administrator to support these programs \nand other programs that encourage women and girls to study science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math, as well as to pursue careers in \naerospace.\n  The bill also calls on NASA to submit a plan to Congress on how it \ncan best facilitate and support current and retired astronauts, \nscientists, engineers, and innovators to engage girls studying STEM at \nthe K-12 grade levels.\n  Although retired astronauts, scientists, and engineers can help \ninspire the next generation of NASA scientists, early career women--\nastronauts, scientists, engineers and innovators--are really \ninstrumental to the success of this plan.\n  It is really invaluable for young women to have experiences \ninteracting with role models who are close to their age who are \npursuing careers in the STEM fields.\n  I really want to thank my Committee on Science, Space, and Technology \ncolleagues--the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) for her \nleadership on this bill; the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. \nClark); the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), the \nranking member; and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the \nchairman--for joining together in bringing this bill to the floor \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bill. Seeing as we \nhave no other speakers on this side, I am prepared to close.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, while overall employment is only projected to grow by 10 \npercent between 2008 and 2018, careers in STEM-related fields are \nexpected to grow at a much faster rate of 17 percent over that same \ntime period.\n  Unfortunately, current statistics show that women are less likely to \nfocus on STEM-related studies in college and, of the women who pursue \nthese areas of study, only 26 percent will ultimately work in STEM-\nrelated fields.\n  Recognizing the need not only for more women in the workforce, but \nfor women to be leaders in the workforce, particularly in the STEM \nfields, I established the Young Women Leadership Program, which I \npreviously mentioned, where we have been so thrilled\n\n[[Page H1518]]\n\nto be able to have astronauts come and speak and other people in the \nscience and STEM-related fields and aerospace.\n  This has been an effective tool in guiding young women into STEM \nfields. I appreciate the opportunity today to join with my colleague, \nthe gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty), to support both of these \nbills.\n  I ask you to support H.R. 4755, the Inspiring the Next Space \nPioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and Explorers Women Act, or INSPIRE \nAct.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4755, \nthe Inspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and \nExplorers Women Act (INSPIRE Act).\n  As a senior member of the House of Representatives who has served on \nthe House Committee on Science I am well aware of the excellent work \nthat NASA has done to bring diversity to the space program.\n  Houston, where my district is located, is proud that the Johnson \nCenter calls our city home.\n  Earlier this year, I offered two amendments that were adopted for \ninclusion in H.R. 2262, the SPACE Act, which improve diversity in \nfuture space programs.\n  One Jackson Lee Amendment facilitates the participation of HBCUs, \nHispanic Serving Institutions; National Indian institutions, in \nfellowships, work-study, and employment opportunities in the emerging \ncommercial space industry.\n  The second Jackson Lee Amendment requires work with small business \nconcerns owned and controlled by women and minorities.\n  One of the most enduring difficulties faced by underrepresented \npopulations in the STEM field is a lack of awareness and understanding \nof the connection between STEM and employment opportunities.\n  In 2012, a survey found that despite the nation's growing demand for \nmore workers in science, technology, engineering, and math grows, the \nskills gap among the largest ethnic and racial minorities groups remain \nstubbornly wide.\n  Blacks and Latinos account for only 7 percent, of the STEM workforce \ndespite representing 28 percent of the U.S. population.\n  I have worked hard to help small business owners to fully realize \ntheir potential.\n  That is why I support entrepreneurial development programs, including \nthe Small Business Development Center and Women's Business Center \nprograms.\n  Statistics show that women remain underrepresented in the science and \nengineering workforce, although to a lesser degree than in the past, \nwith the greatest disparities occurring in engineering, computer \nscience, and the physical sciences (NSF, Science & Engineering \nIndicators, 2014).\n  Female scientists and engineers are concentrated in different \noccupations than are men, with relatively high shares of women in the \nsocial sciences (58 percent); biological and medical sciences (48 \npercent); relatively low shares in engineering (13 percent); computer \nand mathematical sciences (25 percent) (NSF, Science & Engineering \nIndicators, 2014).\n  According to the U.S. Labor Department, although women make up nearly \n50% of the total U.S. workforce their representation in science and \nengineering occupations is much less. 39 percent of chemists and \nmaterial scientists are women; 27.9 percent of environmental scientists \nand geoscientists are women; 15.6 percent of chemical engineers are \nwomen; 12.1 percent of civil engineers are women; 8.3 percent of \nelectrical and electronics engineers are women; 17.2 percent of \nindustrial engineers are women; and 7.2 percent of mechanical engineers \nare women.\n  These statistics show that measures need to be taken in order to \npromote women participation in the fields of science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics and to pursue careers in aerospace.\n  H.R. 4755 is intended to establish paths for success at NASA for \ngirls and boys, such as establishing. The following programs: NASA \nGIRLS and NASA BOYS, virtual mentoring programs, that give young \nstudents the opportunity to interact and learn from real engineers, \nscientists, and technologists; Aspire to Inspire (A2I) program, which \nengages young girls to present science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics STEM career opportunities through the real lives and jobs \nof early career women at NASA; and Summer Institute in Science, \nTechnology, Engineering, and Research (SISTER) program at the Goddard \nSpace Flight Center, which is designed to increase awareness of, and \nprovide an opportunity for, female middle school students to be exposed \nto and explore nontraditional career fields with Goddard Space Flight \nCenter women engineers, mathematicians, scientists, technicians, and \nresearchers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass H.R. 4755.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, science, technology, engineering and \nmath are critical to America's future prosperity.\n  Women are unfortunately underrepresented in STEM careers. Despite \nrepresenting nearly half of the college-educated and total U.S. \nworkforce, women account for less than 25 percent of America's STEM \nworkforce.\n  Supporting women's involvement in the fields of aerospace and space \nexploration should be an important part of NASA's mission.\n  Current NASA programs such as NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS are important \nand give young students the opportunity to interact and learn from real \nNASA engineers, scientists, and technologists.\n  They provide virtual mentoring that use commercially available video \nchat programs to pair NASA innovators with young students across the \ncountry.\n  H.R. 4755 builds upon this success. It leverages NASA's talent pool \nof current and retired astronauts, and early career female scientists, \nengineers, and innovators to inform and inspire young women to pursue \ntheir dreams in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. One \nday, these young people will push the boundaries of space.\n  Space can be a catalyst for inspiring young girls to enter the STEM \nfields. By doing our part to support their engagement in space with \nthis legislation, we are investing in the futures of our daughters, \nnieces, and grandchildren.\n  I again want to thank the bill sponsor, Research and Technology \nSubcommittee Chairwoman Comstock for her leadership on this topic. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4755.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1518-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1518-H1522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1330\n OCMULGEE MOUNDS NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK BOUNDARY REVISION ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 482, introduced by Representative Sanford Bishop of \nGeorgia, would redesignate the Ocmulgee National Monument in Georgia as \nthe Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park and adjust the boundary of \nthe historical park to include approximately 2,100 new acres.\n  Additionally, the bill directs the Department of the Interior to \nconduct a special resource study to determine the feasibility of adding \nthe Ocmulgee River corridor to the National Park Service. The study \nwill also examine the national significance of the site, as well as the \nbest methods and means for ensuring protection and interpretation of \nthis area.\n  This bill passed out of the committee by unanimous consent, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time he may consume to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 482, the Ocmulgee \nMounds National Historical Park Boundary Revision Act of 2016.\n  First, I want to thank the coauthor of this legislation, my friend \nand colleague, Representative Austin Scott. He has been a tireless \nadvocate on behalf of this legislation, and we would not be where we \nare today without his help, advice, and collaboration.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Rob Bishop and Ranking Member \nGrijalva of the full House Natural Resources Committee for their work \nin bringing this bill to the House floor this afternoon.\n  Chairman Tom McClintock and Ranking Member Niki Tsongas of the \nFederal Lands Subcommittee have been extremely helpful, and I want to \ncommend them and their staffs, especially Terry Camp and Brandon \nBragato, for their efforts.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are few, if any, historic sites in the United \nStates that have evidence of continuous human habitation from so long \nago, when the first nomadic people came to North America to hunt Ice \nAge mammals and began to settle the Macon Plateau.\n  It is what makes the Ocmulgee National Monument so unique. On its 702 \nacres, one can find archeological evidence from these first nomads, the \nmound builders of the Mississippian Period, British traders of the late \n17th century, and the Civil War.\n  Our bipartisan legislation consists of three parts. First, it will \nexpand the boundaries from approximately 702 acres to over 2,800 acres, \nproviding protection to additional archeological resources, linking two \nnoncontiguous areas, and improving the site's connection to the city of \nMacon-Bibb, Georgia.\n  Most of the land will be donated from nonprofit associations and \ngovernment agencies. Property would also be acquired only from willing \ndonors or sellers, subject to the availability of funding.\n  Second, the bill will change the name from Ocmulgee National Monument \nto Ocmulgee Mounds National Historic Park, which would increase name \nrecognition and draw additional visitors from across the country.\n  Finally, H.R. 482 would authorize a resources study to explore the \npossibility of expanding the park even further and include additional \nopportunities for hunting, camping, fishing, and other recreational \nactivities.\n  The legislation enjoys widespread local support, including Macon-Bibb \nMayor Robert Reichert, the Macon-Bibb Chamber of Commerce, the Macon-\nBibb Business Bureau, the Macon-Bibb Commission, the Macon-Bibb \nEconomic Development Commission, the Ocmulgee National Park and \nPreserve Association, and the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five \nCivilized Tribes: Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and \nSeminole.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support of this \nlegislation.\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                 Macon-Bibb County, June 12, 2015.\n     Re HR-482 Ocmulgee Mounds National Historic Park Boundary \n         Revision Act of 2015.\n\n     Hon. Tom McClintock,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental, \n         House Committee of Natural Resources, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Niki Tsongas,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Public Lands and \n         Environmental, House Committee of Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McClintock and Ms. Tsongas: Please accept \n     this letter as an enthusiastic endorsement of HR-482! \n     Ocmulgee National Monument became a part of the National Park \n     Service in the 1930's after an archeological excavation \n     revealed evidence of continual human habitation since the \n     last ice age, 12-14,000 years ago. In addition, Native \n     Americans built an earthen floor council chamber which is now \n     1,000 years old and is one of the best surviving examples of \n     their culture.\n       On behalf of the 155,000 people living in Macon-Bibb County \n     and the 122,799 people from 48 states and 41 countries \n     covering six continents that visited the Ocmulgee National \n     Monument last year, I am writing to urge you to support HR-\n     482 when it comes before your subcommittee on June 16. Its \n     passage would:\n       Expand the park boundary to more than 2,000 acres from its \n     current 700 acres; and include additional artifacts and sites \n     which deserve federal protection; (There is no federal \n     funding for land acquisition; this bill merely authorizes \n     inclusion of additional property that may be voluntarily \n     contributed or acquired with private funds into the boundary \n     of the Park.)\n       Change the name from Ocmulgee National Monument to \n     ``Ocmulgee Mounds National Historic Park'' to better describe \n     the site;\n       Authorize a resource study (again to be privately funded) \n     to determine if the Park could be incorporated, along with \n     other properties, into a Natural Preserve along the Ocmulgee \n     River to provide hunting and fishing opportunities and \n     promote environmental education, health and wellness, and \n     public enjoyment.\n       The expansion and reclassification of the National Monument \n     went through a very highly-publicized community input \n     process, and it was overwhelmingly supported by thousands of \n     people from our community, our region, and our state. We know \n     the people of Georgia are excited and anxious to take this \n     step and have this treasure in their backyard, both for their \n     own enjoyment and for the enjoyment of their families, \n     friends and visitors.\n       The expansion of the Ocmulgee National Monument would be a \n     very positive development for our entire region, and it is \n     one of several initiatives Macon-Bibb County is undertaking \n     to provide additional green space\n\n[[Page H1520]]\n\n     and passive recreational opportunities within our community. \n     This effort is so important to us. It is one of our top \n     projects detailed in our new government's first Strategic \n     Plan,\n       HR-482 will be a significant part of, not only preserving \n     and protecting our heritage, but also, developing miles of \n     trail, greenspace, and a park along our Ocmulgee River. Your \n     support of this legislation will dramatically improve Middle \n     Georgia, and I hope it will receive your favorable \n     consideration,\n       Thank you.\n           Yours truly,\n                                            Robert A. B. Reichert,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Ocmulgee National\n\n\n                                   Park & Preserve Initiative,\n\n                                         Macon, GA, June 12, 2015.\n     Please support HR 482: The Ocmulgee Mounds National \n         Historical Park Boundary Revision Act of 2015.\n\n       Dear Members of the House Subcommittee on Federal Lands: \n     The Ocmulgee National Park & Preserve Initiative (ONPPI) is a \n     community-based group of Middle Georgia citizens working \n     together to further protect the current Ocmulgee National \n     Monument and eventually expand the current site into the \n     first National Park and Preserve east of the Mississippi \n     River. I am writing on behalf of myself and our 190 members \n     to urge your support of HR 482: The Ocmulgee Mounds National \n     Historical Park Boundary Revision Act of 2015, when it comes \n     before the subcommittee on Tuesday, June 16th.\n       HR 482 would: 1) expand the current park boundary from \n     approximately 700 acres to over 2,000 acres; 2) change the \n     name from ``Ocmulgee National Monument'' to ``Ocmulgee Mounds \n     National Historical Park''; and 3) authorize a resource study \n     to determine if the park should be expanded further to \n     consolidate existing public lands, protect hunting, and \n     fishing, and provide additional opportunities for education, \n     recreation and public enjoyment.\n       The Ocmulgee National Monument was authorized by Congress \n     in 1934 to protect a unique Native American cultural \n     landscape that the National Trust for Historic Preservation \n     has declared as ranking among the nation's richest \n     archaeological areas. Unfortunately, when the park was \n     created during the Great Depression, only a fraction of the \n     area could be preserved and many significant resources were \n     left unprotected. The current bill seeks to fulfill the \n     original intent of Congress by preserving a larger portion of \n     the area.\n       This legislation has already received the endorsement of \n     over 15 local governments, chambers of commerce, and other \n     civic organizations in Georgia as they all recognize the \n     potential economic impact for their community and the state. \n     In addition, resolutions of support have been passed by \n     Oklahoma's Muscogee Creek Nation, as well as the Inter-Tribal \n     Council of the Five Civilized Tribes (Cherokee, Chickasaw, \n     Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Seminole Nations), \n     representing more than 500,000 Indian people across the \n     United States.\n       As you may know, Georgia's National Park units are major \n     drivers of the state's recreation and tourism economy. In \n     2013, they attracted nearly 7.5 million visitors and \n     generated over $375 million in visitor spending. The National \n     Parks receive just 1/15th of 1-percent of the federal budget, \n     or around $3 billion annually, yet the parks generate over \n     $30 billion in economic activity related to travel, tourism, \n     and outdoor recreation, drawing visitors from around the \n     globe to local gateway communities.\n       HR 482 will honor the ancestral story of the Muscogee Creek \n     and other southeastern Native peoples, will promote tourism \n     and boost economic growth, and will provide new opportunities \n     for education and public enjoyment. For these reasons, we \n     urge you to co-sponsor and support passage of this bill.\n       Thank you for your kind consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Brian P. Adams,\n\n                                    President, Board of Directors,\n     Ocmulgee National Park & Preserve Initiative.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                September 1, 2015.\n     Hon. Tom McClintock,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Federal Lands, House Committee on \n         Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Niki Tsongas,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Federal Lands, House \n         Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McClintock and Ranking Member Tsongas: I \n     write in support of H.R. 482, the Ocmulgee Mounds National \n     Historical Park Boundary Revision Act of 2015, This important \n     piece of legislation would, if enacted: 1) rename and give \n     National Historical Park status to the Ocmulgee National \n     Monument; 2) considerably expand the park's boundaries; and \n     3) commission a special resource study of the Ocmulgee \n     corridor that focuses on how best to protect and develop this \n     area of land in the future, and in such a way as to allow for \n     expanded recreational activities such as hunting and fishing.\n       Because of its rich archeological significance--which \n     chronicles the history of man and womankind from the last Ice \n     Age, through the Mound Builder period, and onwards to today--\n     this land should be preserved so that future generations can \n     learn from, and enjoy, its cultural treasures. And for many \n     southeastern Native peoples, including the Muscogee (Creek), \n     who were forcibly removed from these lands and relocated to \n     the West, this land is of inestimable value. In fact, in \n     October of 2014, the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five \n     Civilized Tribes (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee \n     (Creek), and Seminole Nations), representing over 500,000 \n     Indian people throughout the United States, voiced its \n     support of the measures in this Act.\n       Accordingly, I urge you to help ensure that this \n     legislation is enacted.

Niki Tsongas,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Federal Lands, House \n         Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McClintock and Ranking Member Tsongas: I am \n     writing at the request of Congressman Austin Scott and \n     Congressman Sanford Bishop, in my capacity as Governor of \n     Georgia, to express my support for H.R. 482, the ``Ocmulgee \n     Mounds National Historical Park Boundary Revision Act of \n     2015'' and to request your careful consideration and approval \n     of this legislation.\n       The Ocmulgee National Monument, authorized by Congress in \n     1934 and created by land donations in 1936, preserves the \n     unique Native American history of the southeast, documenting \n     17,000 years of human presence in the region, from the last \n     Ice Age, up through the era of the Mississippian mound \n     builders, and on into the periods of Spanish exploration, \n     English colonization, and the early American frontier. In \n     addition to this incredible history, Georgia's national park \n     units are important drivers of a State recreation and tourism \n     economy that is valued at roughly $24 billion annually.\n       The bipartisan bill now before Congress will achieve \n     numerous goals supported by the State, including the \n     following.\n       Enhanced historical preservation for exceptional cultural \n     resources in a place described by the National Trust for \n     Historic Preservation as ranking among the nation's richest \n     archaeological areas, thereby honoring the ancestral story of \n     the Muscogee Creek and other southeastern Native peoples.\n       Re-designation of the unit as a National Historical Park, \n     increasing the park's name recognition and the region's \n     standing as a national and international travel destination, \n     and enriching recreational amenities and the quality of life \n     for Georgia residents and military personnel stationed at \n     nearby Robins Air Force Base; all in keeping with actions \n     outlined in Georgia's Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor \n     Recreation Plan (SCORP).\n       Augmented protection within an extended area of important \n     wildlife habitat and natural resources that has been \n     identified as one of the highest priority landscapes for \n     conservation under Georgia's State Wildlife Action Plan \n     (SWAP).\n       Authorization of a special resource study of the Ocmulgee \n     River corridor between the cities of Macon and Hawkinsville \n     that will, among other things, provide a mechanism for \n     examining options to safeguard public hunting areas and \n     hunting as an important recreational activity, as well as \n     ways that conservation of public hunting lands might \n     contribute toward enhancing base-compatible land use along \n     the eastern boundary of Robins Air Force Base, ensuring its \n     continued viability as a regional military and economic hub; \n     all in conformity with resolutions passed by both chambers of \n     the Georgia General Assembly in 2004 (Georgia HR 1256 & SR \n     755), urging ``. . . the Congress of the United States to \n     consider creating a national preserve . . . to protect land \n     and other natural resources and promote hunting and fishing . \n     . . in a continuous corridor of the Ocmulgee and Altamaha \n     Rivers . . .''\n       Responsiveness to resolutions and letters in support of \n     H.R. 482 submitted by the following entities:\n       the City of Macon--Bibb County Commission & Mayor,\n       the City of Centerville Council & Mayor,\n       the City of Perry Council & Mayor,\n       the City of Hawkinsville Commission,\n       the City of Warner Robins Council & Mayor,\n       the Wilkinson County Board of Commissioners,\n       the City of Jeffersonville & Twiggs County Development \n     Authority,\n       the Middle Georgia Regional Commission,\n       the Peach County Development Authority;\n       the Greater Macon Chamber of Commerce,\n       the City of Hawkinsville--Pulaski County Chamber of \n     Commerce,\n       the Georgia Small Business Lender Board of Directors,\n       the Houston County Development Authority,\n       the Historic Macon Foundation,\n       the City of Macon--Bibb County Urban Development Authority,\n       the Southeast Tourism Society,\n       the Macon-Bibb County Convention & Visitors Bureau,\n\n[[Page H1521]]\n\n       the Macon Economic Development Commission, and\n       NewTown Macon;\n       as well as resolutions passed by the following tribal \n     governmental organizations in Oklahoma representing over \n     500,000 Indian people throughout the United States:\n       the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, and\n       the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes.\n       In closing, companion legislation to H.R. 482 has been \n     introduced in the United States Senate (S. 1696) by senior \n     Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson and co-sponsored by Georgia's \n     junior Senator David Perdue (S. 1696). In view of this \n     extraordinary level of support, I ask for your assistance in \n     gaining the timely enactment of H.R. 482.\n           Thank you for your consideration.\n     Nathan Deal.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Greater Macon\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                    Macon, Georgia, June 11, 2015.\n     Hon. Tom McClintock,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental \n         Protection, House Committee of Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McClintock: I am writing in strong support of \n     H.R. 482, the Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park \n     Boundary Revision Act of 2015 which states that the Ocmulgee \n     National Monument shall be known and designated as ``Ocmulgee \n     Mounds National Historical Park''.\n       The boundary of the Historical Park will be revised to \n     include approximately 2,100 acres and will provide protection \n     of important archaeological resources. This revision will \n     provide additional recreational opportunities, leading to \n     increased visitation thus more economic impact. Macon \n     citizens are understandably proud to have this grand park \n     within the city limits, and are thankful that city leaders \n     realized the importance of the mounds back in 1936. That was \n     the year that the Ocmulgee National Monument was established \n     as a memorial to some of the original settlers on the North \n     American continent. We believe that adding the word \n     ``mounds'' to the monument's name will help Americans more \n     quickly understand the monument's connection to the \n     Mississippians and later, to the Creeks. After all, it is \n     ``mounds'' that attract visitors who come to learn about the \n     cultures that were here hundreds of years before the \n     Europeans came.\n       Recently the National Park Service did an economic impact \n     study based on Ocmulgee's 2014 visitation and determined that \n     the park had a $6,887,000 impact on our local community. \n     Macon and its people are proud of the Monument, and we \n     believe that this change will help encourage even more \n     tourism and economic activity in the area.\n       The Chamber fully supports H. R. 482 and appreciates your \n     support as well.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James M. Dyer,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes\n\n\nA Resolution Supporting United States National Park Service's Expansion \nof Ocmulgee National Monument and Requesting Congressional Enactment of \n                         Authorized Legislation\n\n                          Resolution No. 14-31\n\n       Whereas, the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized \n     Tribes (ITC) is an organization that unites the tribal \n     governments of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee \n     (Creek), and Seminole Nations, representing over 500,000 \n     Indian people throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas, the ITC strongly supports actions of its member \n     nations to preserve and to protect historic properties and \n     traditional cultural properties within respective ancestral \n     homelands in the American Southeast; and\n       Whereas, the historic Ocmulgee Old Fields, an expansive, \n     culturally defining historic landscape on the Fall-line of \n     the Ocmulgee River at Macon, Georgia is of significant \n     importance to the Muscogee (Creek) people; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress, in recognition of the \n     significance of the many historic Muscogean properties \n     existing within the Ocmulgee Old Fields region, in 1934, \n     authorized the United States National Park Service to \n     establish the Ocmulgee National Monument as a means to \n     preserve the historic landscape; and\n       Whereas, in 1966 the Ocmulgee National Monument was listed \n     on the National Register of Historic Places; and\n       Whereas, in 1997 the National Park Service designated the \n     Ocmulgee National Monument as a Traditional Cultural Property \n     and the first recognized Traditional Cultural Property east \n     of the Mississippi River; and\n       Whereas, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, \n     was amended in 1992 to ensure that Tribes are provided a \n     meaningful role in federal decisions under Section 106 of the \n     Act; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service has now introduced \n     legislation within both houses of the United States Congress \n     requesting authorization to extend its protective stewardship \n     over a broader area of the historic Ocmulgee Old Fields \n     through its proposed incorporation of 2100 acres of the \n     Ocmulgee Old Fields landscape into the Ocmulgee National \n     Monument; and\n       Whereas, the Government of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation has \n     determined that the proposed National Park Service expansion \n     of the Ocmulgee National Monument boundary within the \n     historic Ocmulgee Old Fields region is consistent with and is \n     in accord with preservation interests within the Ocmulgee Old \n     Fields; and\n       Whereas, the Government of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation has \n     supported the proposed National Park Service expansion of the \n     Ocmulgee National Monument and is now engaged in active \n     support for legislation pending in Congress to authorize said \n     action.\n       Now therefore be it resolved that, the ITC does hereby \n     support the proposed National Park Service expansion of the \n     geographic boundaries of the Ocmulgee National Monument \n     within the historic Ocmulgee Old Fields region and hereby \n     requests of the United States Congress deliberate and quick \n     action toward enacting authorizing legislation.\n\n\n                             CERTIFICATION\n\n       The foregoing resolution was adopted by the Inter-Tribal \n     Council of the Five Civilized Tribes meeting in Durant, \n     Oklahoma on this 10th day of October, 2014, by a vote of 5 \n     for, 0 against, and 0 abstentions.\n     Bill Anoatubby,\n       Governor, The Chickasaw Nation.\n     Gary Batton,\n       Chief, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.\n     Bill John Baker,\n       Principal Chief, Cherokee Nation.\n     George Tiger,\n       Principal Chief, Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\n     Leonard M. Harjo,\n       Principal Chief, Seminole Nation of Oklahoma.\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. In short, I believe that H.R. 482 will \nstrengthen the current Ocmulgee National Monument and bolster the \neconomy and cultural life of Georgia, and beyond. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), my friend and the \ncosponsor of this measure.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 482, the Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park Boundary Act of \n2016.\n  I would like to thank my colleague, Congressman Sanford Bishop of \nGeorgia. We have had many meetings in Washington, as well as back in \nthe district, on this particular issue. Certainly I have enjoyed \nworking with him on it.\n  Today's vote marks an important milestone in many years of effort to \nbring about increased recognition and enhance cultural preservation of \nthe Ocmulgee National Monument.\n  The Ocmulgee National Monument was originally authorized by Congress \nin 1934 to protect the Old Ocmulgee Fields, which includes a network of \nvery well-preserved Indian mounds of great historical importance. The \nhistory of the fields can be traced back to Native Americans who first \ncame to the site during the Paleo-Indian period to hunt Ice Age \nmammals.\n  The park is unique in that it vividly displays the story of many \nstages of prehistoric cultural development, including the Mound Builder \nperiod, and highlights the important role of agriculture in the region.\n  I am proud to represent this area of middle Georgia, along with \nCongressman Sanford Bishop. Our offices have worked, along with many \nregional community partners, to advance this goal.\n  By expanding the current Ocmulgee National Monument from 700 acres to \nover 2,000 acres and redesignating the area as a National Historic \nPark, this legislation will provide significant economic, educational, \nand cultural benefits to middle Georgia.\n  Additionally, H.R. 482 will reauthorize a study for future expansions \nand include increased opportunities for hunting, fishing, camping, and \nother recreational activities.\n  The expansion of the Ocmulgee National Monument area provides for \ncritical preservation of additional archeological locations through the \nOld Ocmulgee Fields. Because of its significant historical and \narcheological importance, the future Ocmulgee Mounds National Historic \nPark must be preserved.\n  The expanded park also will generate additional tourism in middle \nGeorgia, while educating visitors on the fascinating history of the \nmany civilizations that have thrived in the region. However, it should \nbe noted that the property in the proposed expansion area would be \nacquired only from willing donors or sellers using private\n\n[[Page H1522]]\n\nfunds, and that no Federal dollars will be used to achieve expansion.\n  I want to take this time to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member \nGrijalva, as well as all the members of the House Committee on Natural \nResources, for their work to bring this legislation to the floor today.\n  I want to close by noting that this legislation is a true example of \nwhat can be achieved when local, State, and Federal leaders work \ntogether towards a common goal.\n  The Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park Boundary Act was created \nfrom the ground up with many letters of support from the Macon-Bibb \narea and well over 3,000 comments from individuals and community groups \nin support of the expansion. Without this collaboration at every level, \nnone of this would be possible.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 482, the Ocmulgee \nMounds National Historical Park Boundary Act of 2016.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, due to its rich and diverse history, it is really only \nfitting that the future Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park be \npreserved as a lasting memorial to the native cultures, historic \nstructures, and priceless natural resources that reside on the land.\n  I want to thank Representative Sanford Bishop, who worked in \npartnership with Representative Austin Scott--both of Georgia--for \ntheir work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its \nadoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to recommend this bill \nto the House, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 482, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1522-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1522-H1523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AMENDMENT TO COLTSVILLE NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK DONATION SITE\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 2857) to facilitate the addition of park administration at \nthe Coltsville National Historical Park, and for other purposes, as \namended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2857\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock) and the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. \nTsongas) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2857, introduced by Representative John Larson of \nConnecticut, modifies a condition that the Park Service acquire 10,000 \nsquare feet of space in East Armory to allow the NPS to acquire that \nspace within any part of the Colt Armory Complex in Hartford, \nConnecticut.\n  Coltsville was the home of Samuel Colt's industrial enterprise, the \nColt Firearms Company. In Hartford, Samuel Colt developed the use of \nthe assembly line and highly mechanized techniques. Colt Manufacturing \nnot only transformed the firearms industry, but was a major contributor \nto the industrial revolution by pioneering the use of interchangeable \nparts and precision manufacturing.\n  This small modification to current law would provide the Park Service \nflexibility in selecting a location for park administrative offices and \nvisitor services at the Coltsville site. I am grateful for Mr. Larson's \nhard work to establish the Coltsville Historical Park, and urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of its passage today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Thanks to the leadership and hard work of my colleague, \nRepresentative Larson of Connecticut, Congress established the \nColtsville National Historical Park at the end of 2014.\n  The law that established the park authorized the National Park \nService to utilize a 10,000 square foot building known as the East \nArmory for the purposes of park administration. However, during the \nplanning phase for establishing this new park, local stakeholders and \nthe Park Service have determined that the Colt Armory Complex is better \nsuited for this purpose. This bill simply makes that change and \nauthorizes the use of the Colt Armory Complex.\n  I support this simple fix to the enabling legislation that responds \nto the on-the-ground dynamics of this particular park, and I want to \nthank the majority and my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee \nfor expedited review of this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts for yielding this time. And I say, with a note of \npride, that Lowell, Massachusetts, served and continues to serve as a \nmodel for urban national parks upon which we based Coltsville becoming \na national historic park.\n  I want to thank Chairman McClintock also for his words. Both he and \nRepresentative Tsongas have outlined what this does. This has been \ngreat work by a number of people on this committee in a nonpartisan \nway.\n  I would just add, Mr. Speaker, that in Chairman McClintock's brief \nhistory of Coltsville, that Samuel Colt died in 1862, and not many \npeople realize this. So it was actually Elizabeth Colt, though she \ncould not vote at the time, who was in charge of what was one of the \ntop five corporations in America at that time.\n  As the chairman alluded to, it was, as a lot of New England was, the \ncenter of the industrial revolution. It is also where Mr. Ford came to \nstudy and looked at the assembly line. And Pratt & Whitney did \ninternships, the famous Pratt & Whitney aircraft company, and it \nspawned the bicycle, the automobile, and the typewriter, all of which \ncame from the great city of Hartford at the time.\n  I want to thank the neighborhood for the collaborative effort, but \nespecially the Governor of the State, Governor Malloy, for his hard \nwork; former-Mayor Segarra; Mayor Luke Bronin, the current mayor; Park \nSuperintendent James Woolsey, who, as Representative Tsongas rightly \npointed out, when they went to the site and looked at the spectacular \nsite, in the review, realized that there was a better way to facilitate \npeople seeing it and locating a section in this historic brownstone \narea, which this technical change in the legislation allows them to do.\n  As Representative Tsongas said, this was done in an expedited manner, \nso I\n\n[[Page H1523]]\n\ngreatly appreciate the work of the committee on this, and the staff of \nthe committee as well.\n  Chairman Bishop has been a strong supporter of this from the start \nand, I daresay, as we struggled to get this legislation passed for \nalmost a decade, it was his leadership and that of Ranking Member \nGrijalva that brought this to fruition.\n  So this is, again, yet another demonstration of what can happen when \neverybody pulls together. And certainly, on the 100th anniversary of \nour National Park Service, to preserve this historic landmark and to do \nit in a manner that is consistent with making sure that our national \ntreasures here, whether they be our enormous national parks in the West \nor on the East Coast, a number of our treasures, historic treasures.\n  I would note that, at the confluence of a national historic river, a \nBlueways and Greenways national historic endeavor, that this national \npark is located. It is that confluence and the work of this committee \nin recognizing the historic achievement of Samuel and Elizabeth Colt \nthat we are so dearly proud of, not only in Hartford, but across this \nNation.\n  I thank, again, Chairman McClintock, and I want to thank, again, my \ndear friend, the ranking member, Ms. Tsongas.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would only add that I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues across the aisle on those reforms to restore \nthe free market principles that made America the manufacturing capital \nof the world, so that those great days that gave birth to success \nstories like Colt and the prosperity they meant for our Nation can be \nreproduced in this generation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4119, introduced by the gentleman from Mississippi \n(Mr. Palazzo), authorizes the Park Service to convey to the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, Post 5699, 1\\1/2\\ acres located within the Gulf Islands \nNational Seashore in Jackson County, Mississippi, in exchange for a \n2.2-acre parcel of land opened by the VFW post.\n  This bill benefits both the VFW post and the Park Service, as it \nprovides the VFW post with permanent access to their facility via a \nlong driveway currently owned by the Park Service, while adding land \ncontiguous to Gulf Islands National Seashore. I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of its passage today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 4119 is a simple, bipartisan bill that authorizes the exchange \nof two small parcels of land to provide needed access for our veterans \nin Mississippi.\n  The Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5699 is located adjacent to a \nportion of Gulf Islands National Seashore. And while have having a \nnational park in your backyard is a desirable condition, the post has \nfound themselves landlocked and in need of direct access to their \nfacility.\n  To solve this issue, the Gulf Islands National Seashore Land Exchange \nAct will exchange approximately 2 acres of land owned by the VFW with \n1.5 acres owned by the Federal Government. The acreage acquired by the \nVFW will be used to establish a short driveway directly to the post, \nwhile the land given in exchange to the Federal Government will be \nmanaged as part of Gulf Islands National Seashore.\n  This exchange is supported by both the VFW post and the National Park \nService and is a simple and logical solution to a local issue. I am \npleased to see the National Park Service and the VFW working together \nto form a solution for this issue.\n  I urge all Members to support this commonsense, bipartisan bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he \nmay consume to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), the \nsponsor of this bill and my friend.\n\n[[Page H1524]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4119, the \nGulf Islands National Seashore Land Exchange Act.\n  The Gulf Islands National Seashore is a national park that draws \nmillions of visitors to the islands in the northern Gulf of Mexico. It \nincludes the Mississippi barrier islands of Petit Bois Island, Horn \nIsland, East and West Ship Island, and Cat Island, as well as the Davis \nBayou Area.\n  I am proud to have this important park and its natural beaches, \nhistoric sites, and wildlife sanctuaries within my district.\n  The Gulf Islands National Seashore has been a part of the Mississippi \nGulf Coast community since Congress established the park in 1971. Since \nthat establishment, the Gulf Islands National Seashore has worked \nclosely with the Mark Seymour Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW Post 5699. \nIn fact, the post has shared a road with the seashore for the better \npart of the last 30 years.\n  The Gulf Islands National Seashore Land Exchange Act would make \npermanent a 30-year easement that has provided an access road and \ndriveway for the VFW. In exchange, the VFW will give the Gulf Islands \nNational Seashore some of its acreage, which includes wetlands.\n  The Gulf Islands National Seashore and the VFW both strongly support \nthis land exchange, but the Department of the Interior needs \ncongressional approval before it can make the land exchange official. \nThat is why, Mr. Speaker, I encourage the House to pass this bill \ntoday.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Tsongas, \nas well as Subcommittee Chairman McClintock, and the Committee on \nNatural Resources, for their support and help in bringing this bill to \nthe floor and seeing it across the finish line.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, if only the budget were this easy.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and \npass the bill (H.R. 4472) to amend title IV of the Social Security Act \nto require States to adopt a centralized electronic system to help \nexpedite the placement of children in foster care or guardianship, or \nfor adoption, across State lines, and to provide grants to aid States \nin developing such a system, and for other purposes, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4472\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Modernizing the Interstate \n     Placement of Children in Foster Care Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) when a child in foster care cannot return safely home, \n     the child deserves to be placed in a setting that is best for \n     that child, regardless of whether it is in the child's State \n     or another State;\n       (2) the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children \n     (ICPC) was established in 1960 to provide a uniform legal \n     framework for the placement of children across State lines in \n     foster and adoptive homes;\n       (3) frequently, children waiting to be placed with an \n     adoptive family, relative, or foster parent in another State \n     spend more time waiting for this to occur than children who \n     are placed with an adoptive, family, relative, or foster \n     parent in the same State, because of the outdated, \n     administratively burdensome ICPC process;\n       (4) no child should have to wait longer to be placed in a \n     loving home simply because the child must cross a State line;\n       (5) the National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise \n     (NEICE) was launched in August 2014 in Indiana, Nevada, \n     Florida, South Carolina, Wisconsin, and the District of \n     Columbia, and is expected to be expanded into additional \n     States to improve the administrative process by which \n     children are placed with families across State lines;\n       (6) States using this electronic interstate case-processing \n     system have reduced administrative costs and the amount of \n     staff time required to process these cases, and caseworkers \n     can spend more time helping children instead of copying and \n     mailing paperwork between States;\n       (7) since NEICE was launched, placement time has decreased \n     by 30 percent for interstate foster care placements; and\n       (8) on average, States using this electronic interstate \n     case-processing system have been able to reduce from 24 \n     business days to 13 business days the time it takes to \n     identify a family for a child and prepare the paperwork \n     required to start the ICPC process.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATE PLAN REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 471(a)(25) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 671(a)(25)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``provide'' and insert ``provides''; and\n       (2) by inserting ``, which, not later than October 1, 2026, \n     shall include the use of an electronic interstate case-\n     processing system'' before the 1st semicolon.\n       (b) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter \n     beginning on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     and shall apply to payments under part E of title IV of the \n     Social Security Act for calendar quarters beginning on or \n     after such date.\n       (2) Delay permitted if state legislation required.--If the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that State \n     legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) is \n     required in order for a State plan developed pursuant to part \n     E of title IV of the Social Security Act to meet the \n     additional requirement imposed by the amendments made by \n     subsection (a), the plan shall not be regarded as failing to \n     meet any of the additional requirements before the 1st day of \n     the 1st calendar quarter beginning after the first regular \n     session of the State legislature that begins after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act. For purposes of the preceding \n     sentence, if the State has a 2-year legislative session, each \n     year of the session is deemed to be a separate regular \n     session of the State legislature.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4472, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Indiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are a number of key points I would like to \nemphasize to explain how this legislation came to be and why I believe \nit is so important at this critical juncture.\n  First, my wife, Jenny, and I have four young children of our own. As \na parent, I know I speak for millions when I say that every child \ndeserves to grow up in a stable, loving home.\n  When the bond between parent and child is broken and children cannot \nsafely return home, they deserve to be placed in a setting that is best \nfor them, regardless of whether that is a home within their State or \nacross a State line. However, due to various factors, children are \nlanguishing in the child welfare system, waiting to be placed with an \nadoptive family, a relative, or foster parents in another State.\n  One contributor is the fact that today, in order to place a child \nwith a grandparent across a State line, caseworkers must literally \nprint out hundreds of pages of paperwork, package it up, and mail case \nfiles to another State. The receiving State responds in kind, \ncompleting their portion, and then mailing the case file back. It is an \nantiquated process that, on average, takes more than 5 months to \ncomplete. At a time when communities, courts, and caseworkers across \nthe country are already overwhelmed, this inefficient, paper-based \nplacement process is simply unacceptable.\n  For children, the sooner we get them placed into a forever home, the \nbetter. I say this as someone with experience. Before entering \nCongress, I provided pro bono legal services for adoptive couples. \nThese situations I have seen can be extremely hard on all parties, but \nnone more so than the child.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Statistics show that the \nlonger a child remains in the child welfare system, the less likely \nthey are to have successful outcomes later in life.\n  When proven interventions that can help these children present \nthemselves, I believe it is our moral imperative to act. It is this \nbelief that led to the solution we are discussing here today.\n  The Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care \nAct would incentivize States to connect to an electronic interstate \ncase processing system that has already been tested in a handful of \nStates, including my home State of Indiana and the District of \nColumbia.\n  These pilot programs achieved substantial reductions in the time it \ntook to place these children into forever homes, reducing the time a \nchild waited by 30 percent. For a child, that means a month and a half \nless time being shuffled from foster home to foster home and from being \ntaken in and out of school without a set routine.\n  In one pilot scenario, Indiana had an emergency request to place a \nchild with a relative in Florida. Use of the system allowed both pilot \nStates to exchange their case information the very same day, which, \nunder the current system, could have taken weeks.\n  In another scenario, an urgent matter came to Florida's attention \nwhere a placement was breaking down and the child needed to be moved.\n  The way the interstate placement process currently works, this child \ncould have been sent back into the overloaded foster care system and \nback into temporary care arrangements for another couple of months. \nInstead, Florida's use of this electronic system made a long-term \nplacement of the child possible within 48 business hours.\n  We can expect to see more of these positive results as use of this \nelectronic system is expanded.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join Congressman Todd Young in leading \nH.R. 4472, the Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in \nFoster Care Act.\n  I joined my friend from Indiana in introducing H.R. 4472 because it \nwould help us make progress on an important issue: reducing the \nbarriers and delays that continue to exist when the best new home for a \nchild is in a different State than the unsafe home the child had to \nleave.\n  Given that my Congressional District has one of the highest \npercentages of grandparents raising grandchildren in the Nation, \nfollowed closely by two other Congressional Districts in Illinois, \nchild welfare issues are very personal to my constituents, to Chicago, \nand to my home State.\n  Removing barriers that delay or prevent interstate child placements \nis a long-time, bipartisan goal within Congress. This bill addresses an \nimportant factor in those delays: the ability of State computer systems \nto link up to process the paperwork. The current paper-based system is \nantiquated and slow.\n  As part of an HHS pilot project, seven States and the District of \nColumbia currently participate in the National Electronic Interstate \nCompact Enterprise, or NEICE, an online tool that allows State office \nsystems to talk to each other and process interstate placements more \nquickly. I am very proud of the fact that Illinois is one of these \nStates.\n  An early evaluation found that this system reduced waiting times for \naffected children by about one-third. Ten other States have already \nannounced plans to join the exchange over the next 2 years. H.R. 4472 \nwould accelerate the number of participating States in the short run \nand ensure that all States participate in the long run.\n  The Director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family \nServices, George Sheldon, often emphasizes that we need to operate in \nkid time, not adult time, meaning that we need to recognize the urgency \nof restoring permanency for children in child welfare, rather than \nallowing adult bureaucracy to impede permanency.\n  Modernizing the technology to increase efficiencies and quicken \nplacements is common sense and respects the urgency of finding \npermanent, loving homes for children.\n  I am grateful to Mr. Young of Indiana for ensuring that the bill \nexpands\n\n[[Page H1526]]\n\nupon existing progress on modernization within States and includes \ntribal foster care systems.\n  This is a good bill. I thank Mr. Young and his staff for their \nexcellent work. I am indeed pleased to join them.\n  I urge support to move forward on H.R. 4472.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague, Mr. \nDavis, and his staff for their hard work and his leadership on this \neffort.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the State of \nIndiana (Mrs. Walorski), who represents Notre Dame country. She is a \nhardworking Member from my home State.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Modernizing the \nInterstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act.\n  This bill will reduce the amount of time kids wait to be adopted, \nplaced with relatives, or placed with foster parents when they are \ngoing to a home in another State.\n  The current paper-based process keeps children waiting while \ncaseworkers mail physical documents. This bill incentivizes States to \nconnect to an electronic system that has been pilot-tested in a handful \nof States, including my home State of Indiana.\n  Getting at-risk kids into a stable, permanent environment as quickly \nas possible is critical to allowing them to thrive and reach their full \npotential. Each day they spend waiting for paperwork to be mailed back \nand forth is time wasted unnecessarily.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Young of Indiana, for his \nleadership on this issue. I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. \n4472 and do everything possible to get our most vulnerable children \nplaced in a safe environment.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, while we are discussing H.R. 4472, reducing the time \nthat it takes to process a child who might come from a different State \nfor adoption or foster care placement, there are other issues of child \nwelfare, one that I will mention.\n  The issues of child welfare have a long history of bipartisanship. In \naddition to the Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in \nFoster Care Act, I hope to engage my colleagues in addressing the \nsubstance abuse needs of families involved in child welfare.\n  Aside from neglect, alcohol and other drug use is the number one \nreason for removal from the home. More specifically, approximately one-\nthird of cases list alcohol or other drug use as the reason for the \nchild's removal.\n  What is exciting is that we have good, clear empirical evidence that \ncertain strategies have demonstrated effectiveness. Specifically, these \nquality interventions help children and families affected by substance \nabuse experience fewer days in care, higher reunification rates, less \nrecurrence of child maltreatment, and better permanency over time.\n  I am preparing to introduce a bill that scales up these successes \nfrom smaller targeted interventions into full-scale interventions while \nbuilding the research to better inform Federal policy overall.\n  My bill does two key things. First, it dedicated staff under Title \nIV-E for the coordination of substance abuse prevention and treatment \nservices with child welfare services.\n  Secondly, it creates grants to expand the lessons learned from the \nresearch on smaller scale efforts to the State level, funding \nadditional research to improve related Federal policy.\n  My home State of Illinois has led the Nation in addressing substance \nabuse issues in child welfare. We know that we need to do more to \naddress this problem. We know that it works. And, of course, I look \nforward to being engaged in the development of programs and activities \nthat would further enhance that kind of success.\n  Again, I want to thank Mr. Young for his tremendous work on H.R. \n4472.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nDoggett). He is one of the outstanding members of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  I want to salute the gentleman and Mr. Young for their bipartisan \ninitiative here that would eliminate some of the current paperwork \nbarriers that are preventing abused and neglected children from being \nquickly placed in safe, loving homes, which happen to be on the other \nside of a State border. Their coming together in this bipartisan \ninitiative is constructive in helping some of the most vulnerable \nchildren in America.\n  It is unacceptable for children who already face so many challenges \nto have to deal with this additional hardship because the process, as \nit exists now, just is not working.\n  Based on the experience we have had with those States that were \ninvolved in a pilot program, we know that waiting times there were \nreduced by almost one-third.\n  I think, with that experience, we can move forward under this bill \nfor an electronic information exchange that will work and will improve \nthe times that these young people face.\n  While this bipartisan step is a welcome one, it should also serve as \na reminder to us of all the work that remains.\n  Last week the National Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and \nNeglect Fatalities, a commission that was created with legislation that \nI authored back in 2012, issued its final report entitled ``Within Our \nReach: A National Strategy to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect \nFatalities.''\n  However you count them and however you may focus on the data needed \nto adequately describe this problem, there are far too many children in \nAmerica today who do suffer, including many who actually are killed, by \nabuse and neglect.\n  Our committee, much in the tradition of this piece of bipartisan \nlegislation, has addressed these issues on a bipartisan basis in the \npast. I hope that we can do the same with the report of the Commission, \nthat we can move forward to consider some of its recommendations, like \nits unanimous recommendations.\n  This was a bipartisan Commission appointed by President Obama and by \nHouse and Senate Democratic and Republican leaders. They came together \nwith unanimous recommendations on a number of pieces of legislation, \nsuch as the importance of renewing the home visiting programs that go \nout and work with young parents that strengthen families and help them \nbe the kind of parents they want to be.\n  We need an ongoing conversation here about foster care financing. The \nreauthorization of programs like the Promoting Safe and Stable Families \nProgram is coming up this year, and the Home Visiting Program, fully \nknown as the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting \nProgram, is up for renewal this next year.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I hope we can find ways to work together to \nadvance what has been done here and to advance specific legislation \nthat will help reduce the number of children that suffer from abuse and \nneglect.\n  I must note, though, that at the same time this legislation was \napproved in our committee, under the Republican budget, the Social \nServices Block Grant was terminated. I hope that is not done by the \nCongress as a whole.\n  The Social Services Block Grant is a major source of funding for \nprevention of child abuse and neglect today, used by State and local \ngovernments to focus on prevention with far too little focus on \nprevention overall.\n  One of the major conclusions of this Commission on Child Fatalities \nis that we focus our attention so much on the end, after the abuse has \noccurred, and not on the beginning, to try to prevent abuse. We need to \nfocus on prevention. So at the same time this bill was approved, that \nsupport was cut.\n  Hopefully, Congress will reject the bill to eliminate the Social \nServices Block Grant and we can come together to find more resources to \ndo what must be done to prevent us from just lurching from one tragedy \nto another and help stabilize and support families working to see that \nchildren are protected. I thank the gentlemen again for their effort.\n\n[[Page H1527]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  I want to associate my remarks with those just made by Mr. Doggett \nrelative to continuing the Social Services Block Grant funding, which \nhas provided a tremendous amount of resources, and continues to do so, \nfor social welfare programs, including those affecting children.\n  I also want to associate myself with the comments made relative to \nthe Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities. It just \nhappens that one of the judges from my district, the presiding judge of \nthe Child Protection Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County, \nserves on that commission and, of course, had some findings that were \ndifferent than the commission report.\n  I think we need to consider all of those things as we move forward. \nBut I am pleased to note that we are indeed making progress dealing \nwith the issues of child welfare.\n  Again, I want to commend Mr. Young and his staff for their work on \nH.R. 4472. I am pleased to join, and urge strong support for it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral bill was developed through a yearlong \nprocess, consulting with key stakeholders to make sure that there would \nbe broad support. It involved a whole lot of painstaking work from \nstaff members on the committee, both Republican and Democrat, and from \nMr. Davis, who I commend once again for his leadership on this issue, \nand his staff.

The \n     bill complements our efforts to transform the ICPC by \n     promoting policy changes and providing funding so that states \n     may connect to the NEICE. Once fully operationalized, the \n     NEICE will also be a valuable tool for addressing societal \n     challenges that put children at risk, including the opiate \n     and heroin epidemic, illegal rehoming of children, and sex \n     trafficking.\n       Thank you again for introducing and co-sponsoring H.R. \n     4472, and for your steadfast leadership to improve the lives \n     of children waiting for safe, permanent families. We strongly \n     support your efforts to modernize the interstate placement of \n     children through this legislation, and intend to work \n     vigorously for its passage.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Tracy Wareing Evans,\n       Executive Director, APHSA.\n     Mical Anne Peterson,\n       President, AAICPC.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Children's Home Society,\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, January 19, 2016.\n     Congressman Todd Young,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Young: Children's Home Society of America \n     (CHSA) is proud to support the efforts of Congressman Young \n     as he proposes to modernize and expedite the ability of \n     states to place children across state lines and into forever \n     homes.\n       The Modernizing and Interstate Placement of Children in \n     Foster Care Act will replace an antiquated paper based system \n     enabling not only greater efficiencies in the legal process \n     of placing children but also create greater transparency and \n     accountability in the overall process. By utilizing a \n     nationwide computer based system, states will actually save \n     money by reducing the administrative costs associated with \n     complying with the ICPC, expedite communication between \n     states and their placement systems and most importantly, \n     reduce the time that children spend in the foster care \n     system.\n       CHSA looks forward to supporting Congressman Young as he \n     understands that no child should have to wait to be placed in \n     a loving home simply because they must cross state lines.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Sharon Osborne,\n\n                                                      Board Chair,\n     Children's Home Society of America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                            Strong\n\n\n                                               Families, Inc.,\n\n                                   Gainesville, FL, March 4, 2016.\n     Re Support for H.R. 4472, Modernizing the Interstate \n         Placement of Children in Foster Care Act.\n\n     Hon. Todd Young,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Danny Davis,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representatives Young and Davis: First, many thanks \n     for introducing and co-sponsoring H.R. 4472, Modernizing the \n     Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act. As the \n     Immediate Past President of the Association of Administrators \n     of Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, it \n     generates much excitement to see this legislation introduced. \n     In a past position, I was the ICPC Compact Administrator for \n     the State of Florida and had the opportunity to help develop \n     the prototype for the electronic transmission process now \n     realized through NEICE. It was our dream in Florida that one \n     day this system could become a national reality. Good or bad, \n     I must also confess that the acronym NEICE was my suggestion \n     so in a couple of ways I feel like a parent to NEICE.\n       There is no doubt in my mind that implementation of this \n     system in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the \n     U.S. Virgin Islands will change the lives of thousands of \n     children who await placement with relatives or adoption \n     finalization in another state. The additional uses for NEICE \n     are subject only to the minds of those who can identify other \n     possibilities such as combating human trafficking cases and \n     unregulated custody transfers (rehoming).\n       Thank you again for introducing and co-sponsoring H.R. \n     4472, and for your steadfast leadership to improve the lives \n     of children waiting for safe, permanent families. The child \n     welfare community strongly supports your efforts to modernize \n     the interstate placement of children through this \n     legislation, and intends to work vigorously for its passage.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                        Stephen Pennypacker, Esq.,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 4, 2016.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Todd Young,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Young and Senator Grassley: The Child \n     Welfare League of America offers its endorsement of your \n     legislation, H.R. 4472 and S. 2574, The Modernizing the \n     Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act.\n       We have long recognized the critical role that interstate \n     placement of children has played in the timely placement of \n     children in foster care and kinship care as well as its \n     importance in promoting adoptions. Over the years it has \n     become increasingly clear that these placements have been \n     delayed to the significant detriment of children in need of \n     permanence.\n       The recent efforts by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services through the National Electronic Interstate Compact \n     Enterprise or NEICE pilot project has demonstrated \n     significant speed up in these interstate placements with some \n     children seeing there wait times reduced by weeks and months. \n     In addition, the system has reduced cost and paper work. The \n     six pilot states that utilized NEICE demonstrated wait times \n     reduced by 30% with participating states savings of $1.6 \n     million per year in reduced copying, mailing, and \n     administrative costs.\n       We solute your leaders on this legislation and are equally \n     pleased by the bipartisan spirit as represented by the \n     original co-sponsorship of Congressman Davis, Congresswoman \n     Brooks, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Franken and Senator \n     Peters.\n       Thank you for your work and advocacy on behalf of children.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Christine James-Brown,\n\n                               President/CEO, Child Welfare League\n                                                       of America.\n\n[[Page H1528]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n         American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, American Academy \n           of Assisted Reproductive Technology Attorneys,\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 2016.\n     Hon. Todd Young,\n     Longworth House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Young: I write as the President of the \n     American Academy of Adoption Attorneys to enthusiastically \n     endorse H.R. 4472 on behalf of our organization. H.R. 4472 is \n     a bill that provides swift stability and permanency to \n     vulnerable children who are being placed in foster/adoptive \n     homes or with guardians across state lines.\n       Drafted in 1960, the Interstate Compact on the Placement of \n     Children (``ICPC'') exists to ensure protection for children \n     in interstate placements. The ICPC requires every placement \n     to be scrutinized for legality and appropriateness. It \n     requires that children remain in the state of origin for \n     weeks, or even months, while the required paperwork is mailed \n     from the placing state ICPC's office to the new parent's home \n     state's ICPC office.\n       The ICPC is well meaning, but by its very nature, slows \n     down the process due to the paperwork and mailing burdens. A \n     uniform legal framework offers valuable protections, but such \n     protections must be weighed against the significant burden it \n     imposes on children and families. With the advances in \n     technology that have been used by other state and federal \n     agencies for over a decade, the process can be significantly \n     shortened and the most vulnerable members of our society can \n     be provided permanency in stable loving homes. The \n     centralized electronic system created by the passage of H.R. \n     4472 will be a victory for children, by expanding an \n     electronic pilot program to all state and U.S. territories.\n       The pilot program has been an unqualified success. Since \n     the pilot program was launched, the placement time for \n     children placed through those pilot states has been reduced \n     by 30 percent. Placement time has been reduced by 11 days. As \n     a truly centralized system evolves, the efficiencies should \n     be better and better.\n       The current slow ICPC process causes weeks, and sometimes \n     months, of children languishing in their states of original \n     residence. Social science and neuroscience research has \n     confirmed that children need stable families to thrive. The \n     paperwork barrier to quick foster/adoptive placements creates \n     unnecessarily delays. One month in the life of a child at \n     this vulnerable stage is an eternity. Further, the delay \n     caused by an outdated mailing system can result in \n     significant developmental issues and treatment costs. In many \n     instances, such treatment costs are incurred by local, state \n     and federal governments. Prospective parents willing to \n     provide homes to children in need of families have been \n     subjected to placement processes that are extraordinarily \n     difficult, risky, expensive and time consuming; often \n     requiring months of persistence and intervention by members \n     of Congress. Most significantly, the number of unparented \n     children able to find families has been severely limited \n     while the life potential of those fortunate enough to find \n     families through foster care, guardianship and adoption has \n     been impaired by weeks and months of needless delay.\n       Reform must begin with our government's acknowledgement \n     that every child has a fundamental human right to be raised \n     in a permanent loving family and that foster care, \n     guardianship and adoption are an important means for \n     providing such families to children living outside of \n     parental care. Additionally, by eliminating this unnecessary \n     delay, H.R. 4472 will reduce the treatment costs incurred by \n     local, state and federal governments.\n       We have come together as a community of child advocates to \n     identify a process that will reform interstate adoption. We \n     welcome the opportunity to discuss our request with you and \n     members of your staff. Please note, the changes we are \n     endorsing would have little budget impact. We look forward to \n     working with you in support of swift passage of this bill.

The new National Electronic \n     Interstate Compact Enterprise (NEICE) will change policies \n     and provide funding to enable states and counties to connect \n     to the NEICE to exchange data and documents across state \n     jurisdictions so that our agencies may meet the unique needs \n     of foster care children who may reside in another state. The \n     proposed data exchange will enable state and counties more \n     efficiently meet federal mandates for the timely services, \n     placement and permanence of children in the foster care \n     system, and will improve outcomes for children in foster care \n     and their families.\n       Thank you again for introducing and co-sponsoring H.R. \n     4472. Please contact Tom Joseph, Director of CWDA's \n     Washington Office, should you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Frank J.

BURIAL OF CREMATED REMAINS IN ARLINGTON NATIONAL \n                   CEMETERY OF CERTAIN PERSONS WHOSE SERVICE IS \n                   DEEMED TO BE ACTIVE SERVICE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2410 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(c)(1) The Secretary of the Army shall ensure that under \n     such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the cremated \n     remains of any person described in paragraph (2) are eligible \n     for inurnment in Arlington National Cemetery with military \n     honors in accordance with section 1491 of title 10.\n       ``(2) A person described in this paragraph is a person \n     whose service has been determined to be active duty service \n     pursuant to section 401 of the GI Bill Improvement Act of \n     1977 (Public Law 95-202; 38 U.S.C. 106 note) as of the date \n     of the enactment of this paragraph.''.\n       (b) Applicability.--\n       (1) In general.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \n     apply with respect to--\n       (A) the remains of a person that are not formally interred \n     or inurned as of the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) a person who dies on or after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (2) Formally interred or inurned defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``formally interred or inurned'' means \n     interred or inurned in a cemetery, crypt, mausoleum, \n     columbarium, niche, or other similar formal location.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n\n[[Page H1529]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and add extraneous material on H.R. 4336, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge all Members to support H.R. 4336, \nas amended.\n  This bill, which was introduced by our colleague, the gentlewoman \nfrom Arizona (Ms. McSally), would ensure that Active Duty designees, \nincluding women Air Force pilots, are eligible for inurnment with full \nmilitary honors at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Active Duty designees are members of civilian groups who served \nalongside the regular Armed Forces during World Wars I and II. These \nbrave men and women were often located in combat zones, where they \nrisked their lives to protect the freedom that we should never take for \ngranted.\n  Their contributions to the war effort was so vital that they have \nbeen granted the most prestigious title our Nation can bestow--that of \nveteran. As such, they are eligible to be laid to rest in any cemetery \nadministered by the National Cemetery Administration of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  However, Arlington National Cemetery is run by the Department of the \nArmy. Between 2002 and last year, the Army inurned Active Duty \ndesignees with military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. \nUnfortunately, last March, then-Secretary McHugh, reversed this policy, \nwhich means that many of those courageous individuals can no longer \nchoose to be laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  H.R. 4336, as amended, would reverse this decision and require the \nArmy to provide Active Duty designees inurnments with military honors \nin Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is our duty as a Nation to ensure that those who have \nserved our Nation are treated with the utmost respect and dignity, \nespecially after they pass on.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4336, as amended.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4336, as amended.\n  Arlington National Cemetery has been called our Nation's most \nhallowed ground. Since the first military burial took place on May 13, \n1864, Arlington is the final resting place for over 400,000 Active Duty \nservicemembers, veterans, and their families.\n  H.R. 4336, as amended, would overturn a recent change in Army policy \nand restore the right of the Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War \nII, or WASP, to be buried in Arlington. These brave women volunteered \nfor duty, and their service made a major contribution to our victory in \nWorld War II.\n  In addition, H.R. 4336 would restore the right of others who assisted \nin the war and whose service and sacrifice was recognized with the \nenacting of the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977.\n  I applaud my colleagues, Representatives Martha McSally and Susan \nDavis, for introducing this important bill and leading the fight, a \nfight that has widespread support and bipartisan support, to recognize \nthe service of these brave women and others who helped us defeat the \nAxis Powers in World War II.\n  That we are bringing this to the floor during Women's History Month \nis a fitting tribute to women who served our Nation in the past and the \nwomen who today serve in our Active Duty forces. This is a matter of \njustice and a matter of fairness.\n  In 2009, we recognized the service and sacrifice of these brave men \nand women when we awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the Women \nAirforce Service Pilots. Today, we have the opportunity to do it again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally), the sponsor of this \nlegislation, a combat veteran herself, a pilot of the A-10 Warthog from \nthe Second District of Arizona.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in wholehearted support of \nH.R. 4336, the Women Airforce Service Pilot Arlington Inurnment \nRestoration Act. This is the right thing to do.\n  I want to thank the chairman for quickly moving this through the \ncommittee and to the floor, and Chairman Thornberry for signing off on \nit, so that we could do the right thing to allow these amazing women \nand these pioneers who went before us and who opened the door for so \nmany of us women in the military to serve, that they could be laid to \nrest in a place of honor and a place of rest for the most hallowed, the \nmost amazing men and women who have served and gone before us. The fact \nthat these women were denied this right is unconscionable and, quite \nfrankly, infuriating when we heard about it.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the WASPs. The WASPs during World \nWar II raised their right hand and said: I will support.\n  We needed pilots, we needed men and women to do whatever it took for \nthe war effort. So these women went through training--1,074 of them \nwent through training. An additional 28 actually already had flying \nexperience and were directly brought in. So it was actually 1,102 that \nsaid: I am going to be a pilot. I am going to support the effort.\n  General Hap Arnold, at the time the head of the Army Air Corps, had \nintended that they be militarized. They went through military training, \nthey marched, and they slept in barracks. They went through everything \nthat the men alongside them did. The intent was to be militarized. The \nonly reason they weren't militarized was because of hang-ups and sexism \nabout the role of women in the military back then. Heaven forbid we \nhave women military pilots. We couldn't handle it back then.\n  These women served anyway. They flew 60 million miles ferrying \nairplanes all over the theater. They towed targets for the ground \ngunners to practice shooting at targets. They trained male pilots to \nthen head off to the war effort. Thirty-eight of them perished in \ntraining in the line of duty. Yet they still were in this quasi-\ncivilian military status. They had no veterans benefits. They were \npassing the hat around to support getting their bodies back to their \nfamilies. There was no recognition at the time, but they still served.\n  At the end of the war, they were discharged and told to go home--the \nmen needed the cockpits. It wasn't until 1977 that this Congress passed \na law finally giving them veterans' rights so that they would be \ntreated as veterans. After the fact, they were given honorable \ndischarges and they were given the medals that they deserved at the \ntime.\n  We thought that this was finally over, the fight was over, that they \nwould be recognized for all that they deserved, and they would be able \nto be laid to rest with full military honors. But a bureaucratic, \ntechnocratic glitch created another door that shut to them.\n\n  This is an extraordinary example, by the way, of somebody taking \naction to bring a wrong to our attention and for us to be able to make \nit right.\n  I want to highlight Elaine Harmon, who passed away, as one of the \nWASPs. She passed away last year. I met with her family and I read her \nhand-written will. She wanted to have her ashes in Arlington. She \nrequested it. We thought that they were allowed, so the family put in a \nrequest. It wasn't until they got a letter back saying, ``Denied, WASPs \nare not allowed in Arlington,'' that they didn't just accept that no.\n  In the legacy of Elaine Harmon--and, by the way, these women were \nfeisty; they were strong; they were not going to take no for an answer. \nIn that spirit, her children and her granddaughter--and Erin Miller is \nwith us in the gallery today--said, ``We are not going to take no for \nan answer. We are going to get awareness on this, and we are going to \nget my grandmother and the WASPs the right that they deserve.''\n  I first heard about this through the media in early January. We \nsprung into action working with our colleague, Susan Davis, getting \nsponsors.\n\n[[Page H1530]]\n\nWe are over 190 right now. This has been fast-tracked through the \ncommittee in order to allow them to be laid to rest there. Elaine \nHarmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in her granddaughter's closet. We \nneed to make this right as quickly as possible.\n  Let me just say, Mr. Chairman, this isn't just about the pioneers \nthat we read about in history books. These WASPs were personal mentors \nto me. When I first went through combat training, we didn't really have \nany women we could look up to, and these amazing women came alongside \nme as wing-women to encourage me and to mentor me. I had three of them \nsitting in my front row at my chain of command ceremony when I took \nover command of an A-10 squadron. Dawn Seymour, Ruth Helm, and Eleanor \nGunderson, they personally supported and encouraged me along the way. \nIt is because of their service that the doors were opened for those of \nus in the military to serve. It is ridiculous that Arlington would \nclose the gates to them at the very time they were opening up all \npositions to women in the military.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  This is the right thing to do. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis legislation, especially during Women's History Month. The least we \ncan do is allow the WASPs, including Elaine Harmon, to be laid to rest \nin Arlington as quickly as possible. Let's get this passed today. Let's \nget it through the Senate and onto the President's desk so that she can \nbe laid to rest.\n  As for the rest who remain who choose to have their ashes laid to \nrest in Arlington, this is their right. The only reason they were not \nActive Duty at the time was due to sexism. It is time for us to shut \nthis remaining door and give them this final resting place.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to not make references \nto occupants of the gallery.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), who is on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for acknowledging the Women Airforce Service Pilots.\n  My father was a P-47 fighter pilot in World War II, and he was able \nto access the benefits that were due him in terms of his military \ncareer. It is only fitting now, during Women's History Month, that we \nbegin to finally get the opportunity for the WASPs to be interred at \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  I acknowledge my colleague Representative McSally, in her great \nservice to this country, and my colleague Tammy Duckworth, a combat \nhelicopter pilot. I also acknowledge the veterans who serve on our \nVeterans' Affairs Committee's staff.\n  We recently had a ceremony with Brigadier General Wilma Vaught. She \nwas the first woman to reach the brigadier general status and was the \nfirst woman to deploy within the Air Force bomber unit. She is an \ninspiration to us.\n  One of the important reasons for doing this bill now is that we \nlearned recently during a hearing in the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nthat women are the fastest growing group of veterans but that, often, \nour women veterans do not access the VA benefits, including health \nbenefits and cemetery benefits, to which they are entitled. We need to \nencourage women who have served the country. You have served us, and \nnow it is our turn to serve you. We need to encourage our women \nveterans to come forward for the benefits they deserve.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona, and I thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for bringing this bill forward. It is an important \nbill, and it is a great time to do it.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Sixth District of Colorado (Mr. Coffman), another combat veteran \nand a member of our Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4336.\n  In Colorado Springs, Colorado, a monument stands to honor the Women \nAirforce Service Pilots, or WASPs. With this legislation, we salute \nthem today, and we recognize that we neglected to salute them for far \ntoo long.\n  During World War II, more than 1,000 WASPs flew over 60 million air \nmiles. Without official military recognition, families were forced to \npay out of pocket to send 36 fallen comrades home. After the war, the \nUnited States continued to deny them military status despite their \nextraordinary service to our country.\n  Today, we can help correct some of that injustice. H.R. 4336 would \nrestore the right for these women to be buried at Arlington. These \nwomen paved the way for the women in uniform today. They endured \ngender-based discrimination for years, and they served and died just as \nother members of the military did. I believe they belong in Arlington.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for giving \nme this opportunity to stand up here during Women's History Month and \nto say this is a bipartisan piece of legislation that is well done and \noverdue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud that there were women who went before me who \nwere brave and who were courageous and who did all of the jobs that \nwere asked of them in a manner that was of high standard. They gave and \nsacrificed on my behalf, and now we have the opportunity to eliminate \nsome of the last vestiges of disparate treatment or secondary \ntreatment, or treating them as second-class citizens.\n  I rise in support of this legislation, and I congratulate my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle for having brought this to our \nattention and for giving us the opportunity to express our support.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham), a veteran himself and the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial \nAffairs on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am here to urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant piece of legislation that recognizes the services of certain \ngroups of men and women who have valiantly served their country.\n  When the GI Bill Improvement Act became law in 1977, it contained \nlanguage that was championed by Senator Barry Goldwater and by \nLouisiana's own Lindy Boggs that deemed certain groups of women, \ncivilians, and foreigners who served the United States as Active Duty \nin order to qualify for benefits administered by the VA. Ultimately, \nnearly 35 groups have been made eligible for benefits through that law. \nThese include the Women Airforce Service Pilots, the U.S. merchant \nseamen who served on blockships in Operation Mulberry on D-Day, male \ncivilian ferry pilots, U.S. civilians of the American Field Service, \nand many, many more.\n  In recognition of their service, the cremated remains of these groups \nmay be inurned in all cemeteries under the jurisdiction of the VA. \nHowever, Arlington National Cemetery is under the jurisdiction of the \nDepartment of Defense, not of the VA. This bill recognizes all of the \nindividuals who are eligible to have their cremated remains inurned in \nArlington National Cemetery to include groups that have been given \nveteran status in the GI Bill Improvement Act, including the WASPs.\n\n  Decades after Congresswoman Boggs championed this legislation, I am \nproud to continue Louisiana's long tradition of support for these \ngroups by cosponsoring this bill.\n  I thank, most greatly, Congresswoman McSally for introducing this \nvery important piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it. It is long past due that we recognize these women and men \nwho have served this country.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom the 12th District of Illinois (Mr. Bost), a marine and a member of \nour Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. BOST. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, World War II was a time when Americans came together to \ndefend this Nation against evil. Entire families enlisted in this \neffort, which included many brave and dedicated women of the Women \nAirforce Service Pilots, or WASPs.\n\n[[Page H1531]]\n\n  The WASPs flew military aircraft in noncombat roles, and they served \nas instructors for male pilots. When the WASP program was created, it \nwas intended that these women would receive full military status. \nSadly, this goal has not been achieved. That is why H.R. 4336 is so \nimportant. It overturns a previous Army directive and restores the \nburial rights in Arlington National Cemetery for WASP veterans.\n  I ask that all of my colleagues join me in supporting these women's \nrights of putting them in the place they need to be and in receiving \nthose full military benefits.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from the Second District of Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, during the peak of World War II, Sandy Thompson, now a \nHouston resident, left her teaching job and received her aviation wings \non September 11, 1943. She had just volunteered for the Women Airforce \nService Pilots, known as the WASPs.\n  These pilots had towed targets for live antiaircraft practice. Think \nabout that, Mr. Speaker. They are in the air, and these young teenagers \nare learning how to shoot antiaircraft guns and to aim them at the \ntargets behind these female pilots who are pulling these--a dangerous \noccupation. These pilots helped deliver planes to overseas bases, and \nthey tested new aircraft that was used in the Pacific and used in \nEurope, and, of course, they trained male pilots who went overseas.\n  Of the 1,000 women who were WASPs, 38 were killed during their \nmissions, and 16 of these original pilots of World War II now live in \nmy State of Texas.\n  They were considered civilians until 1977. Then Congress gave them \nveteran status. In 2002, the WASPs were allowed to be cremated and have \ntheir ashes placed in Arlington National Cemetery--right down the \nstreet from this building. Now bureaucrats have decided that these \nveterans are not worthy of a proper military burial, and they have \nrevoked the burial rights at Arlington because of space. This is \ndisgraceful, shameful, and is a sorry excuse to dishonor them.\n  Find space to permanently honor these women. As a former member of \nthe United States Air Force Reserves, I urge that we show respect to \nthese pilots--give them proper burials, and pass this legislation.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Fudge).\n  Ms. FUDGE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank all of the men and women who have \nsacrificed and served this Nation.\n  I can't imagine why any person of sound mind would deny women the \nright to the same benefits, to the same recognition that men get who \nserve this Nation. I would think that not one person would deny them \nthis right. I cannot imagine why those who serve would have to fight \nfor the dignity that each and every single person who serves this \ncountry should have.\n  I support this legislation, and I support the people who support it. \nAnybody who doesn't should not be in this building.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from the 27th District of the Lone Star State, Texas (Mr. \nFarenthold).\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, it shouldn't take an act of Congress for these women to \nbe inurned in Arlington National Cemetery. We have heard from numerous \npeople on both sides of the aisle that this is simply the right thing \nto do. The Army should have just said, ``Yes, let's get them buried \nthere.'' The President should have used his pen and phone and ordered \nthe Army to do it if they wouldn't. Guess what. We are here now, and it \nis going to take an act of Congress, and it is going to be a very \nstrong act of Congress. I can't imagine not passing this out of this \nHouse unanimously, and I suspect we will see similar results in the \nSenate.\n  The remains of this woman should not have to rest in her \ngranddaughter's closet. They should be inurned in Arlington now. I urge \nmy colleagues to pass this bill unanimously. I urge the Senate to act \nquickly. I urge President Obama to sign this into law. It is, simply, \nthe right thing to do. We have just got to do it.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  In recent hearings, many of the service organizations have indicated \nthat this was one of their top priorities. Women have served in every \nsingle war in this country, and they deserve the same benefits and \nrecognition as men.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important and timely bill in \norder to honor those brave women and others whose efforts were \nessential in the victory of World War II.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Again, I encourage all my fellow colleagues to support H.R. 4336, as \namended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n4336, ``Women Airforce Service Pilot Arlington Inurnment Restoration \nAct of 2016'' which directs the Department of the Army to ensure that \nthe cremated remains of persons who served as Women's Air Forces \nService Pilots are eligible for interment in Arlington National \nCemetery with full military honors.\n  I support this legislation sponsored by Congresswoman Martha McSally \nof Arizona, because the women who have devoted their lives to the armed \nservices deserve appropriate recognition and praise for their \nsacrifice.\n  This important bill provides the remains of a person who dies on or \nafter the date of the enactment of this Act, and whose service has been \ndetermined to be active duty, eligibility for inurnment in Arlington \nNational Cemetery.\n  The Secretary of the Army shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' \nAffairs and the Committees on Armed Services of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate a report on the interment and inurnment \ncapacity of Arlington National Cemetery.\n  With respect to the unique and iconic meaning of the cemetery to the \nUnited States, the Secretary of the Army determines necessary \nconsiderations for additional expansion opportunities beyond the \ncurrent boundaries of the cemetery.\n  The Secretary of the Army must submit the estimated date the cemetery \nwill reach maximum interment and inurnment capacity.\n  The Secretary of the Army has the ability to redefine eligibility \ncriteria for interment and inurnment in the cemetery.\n  Implementation of the arrangements necessary to facilitate the burial \nof the cremated remains should be a priority.\n  It is our responsibility to ensure that the suitable recognition is \nprovided to Americans who have devoted their time and physical \nassistance towards our freedom.\n  This bill actively displays our gratitude towards all who \nparticipated in the armed services.\n  Even after death, we reflect on their contributions with our hearts \nand minds for those who put themselves in harm's way to protect our \nnation.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 4336.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4336, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Ms. McSALLY.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nrecognition of Pennsylvania's Wildfire Prevention Week, which will be \nobserved through this Saturday.\n  As chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation and \nForestry and the Representative of Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional \nDistrict, which includes the Allegheny National Forest, I know how \nquickly simple brush fires can get out of control at this time of the \nyear, often devastating acres of forest. In Pennsylvania, it is \nestimated that nearly 7,000 acres of State and private land are burned \neach year. Additionally, nearly all brush fires, an estimated 85 \npercent, occur in the months of March, April, and May.\n  Because of the prevalence of fires at this time of the year, I also \nwant to praise the efforts of our fire departments across the \nCommonwealth. These men and women, the vast majority of whom are \nvolunteers, volunteer their time and service to their communities and \noften put their lives on the line to save property and homes impacted \nby fires which grow out of control.\n  Nearly all wildfires are caused by human activity, which is why it is \nso important that we continue to educate the public on commonsense ways \nto stop them before they start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1535-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1535-H1536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COUNTDOWN TO EARTH DAY 2016\n\n  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, to mark this first week of spring, this week \nI launched a Countdown to Earth Day 2016 across our congressional \ndistrict, a district that encompasses the largest watershed in the \nentire Great Lakes, that flows into Lake Erie.\n  With greater rainfall causing rising nutrient runoff and with \nmillions of people and livestock inhabiting this watershed, the \npersistent and growing challenge of algal blooms into Lake Erie \nthreatens our precious freshwater supply.\n  This 21st century challenge is one we must meet. Thus, each week \nuntil Earth Day, April 22, I intend to focus on practical ways citizens \ncan help to restore our ecosystem.\n  This week our focus is people helping pollinators, as pollinators--\nbees, butterflies, hummingbirds--are key to abundant plant growth in a \nregion that needs less erosion, more wetland filtration, better land \nand plant management. And one of three foods you eat is dependent on \npollinators.\n  Citizen plantings of staple garden standards such as parsley, dill, \nfennel, and other herbs contribute to pollinator support and ecosystem \nhealth. They are landing pads for the growth of caterpillars and other \nbeneficial insects.\n  Everyone can help. For that reason, I encourage all Americans to get \noutside, enjoy the new spring, restore our environment, and plant \nhelpful herbs in your gardens and properties to pass\n\n[[Page H1536]]\n\non a healthier ecosystem to the next generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1536-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TERRORIST ATTACK IN BRUSSELS\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as passengers boarded their early \nmorning flights and commuters boarded the train to work, multiple bombs \nexploded in Brussels.\n  Days after Belgian law enforcement captured alive ISIS terrorist \nSalah Abdeslam, one of the suspected ringleaders in the Paris attacks, \nISIS terrorists struck again. At least 30 civilians were murdered and \nmore than 200 others were injured.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that the U.S.' current strategy against \nISIS, which has allowed terrorist organizations to retain havens from \nwhich to plan and launch attacks for nearly 2 years, is inadequate. \nEmpty words claiming progress, containment, and success are \nmeaningless.\n  The latest attack is not surprising. Attacks will come to our soil if \nour leaders continue to refuse to define the enemy--radical Islam. \nJihadists have promised to bring terror to the United States. They will \ndeliver on that promise if we do not use our full resources to \neliminate them. They are at war with us. Whether we are at war with \nthem is still very unclear.\n  So as we mourn for the people of Belgium, the United States should \nwork with all free people to eliminate this evil group, this terrorist \ngroup, ISIS.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1536-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING DAVID PRINGLE FOR 37 YEARS OF SERVICE TO AFLAC INSURANCE \n                                COMPANY\n\n  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia.

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this \nSpecial Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, in 1981, we started a national celebration \nin the United States honoring women. Congress passed legislation which \nauthorized and requested the President to proclaim the week of March 7, \n1928, as Women's History Week.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Throughout the next 5 years, Congress continued to pass joint \nresolutions designating a week in March as Women's History Week.\n  In 1987, Congress passed a new statute which designated the entire \nmonth of March, 1987, as Women's History Month.\n  Between 1988 and 1994, Congress passed additional resolutions \nrequesting and authorizing the President to proclaim March of each year \nas Women's History Month.\n  Since 1985, Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama have issued a series \nof annual proclamations designating the month of March as Women's \nHistory Month.\n  We have so many women all throughout our country and each one of our \ncongressional districts who have gone above and beyond and have etched \ntheir place into history through their outstanding service to their \ncommunity and their country.\n  We have women who serve in our military, who are teachers in our \nclassrooms, women who are first responders, artists, and \nbusinessowners.\n  I certainly wouldn't be able to be where I am today, standing here in \nthis Chamber, if not for all the women in my life, especially my two \ndaughters, Mikayla and Arianna.\n  There are two women who have strong New York-1 roots. One is from \nSetauket. Anna Strong was an American patriot and a member of the \nCulper Spy Ring, George Washington's military intelligence unit.\n  As part of George Washington's network of spies, she literally put it \nall on the line for liberty during the American Revolution, hanging \ndifferent garments on her clothesline as a signal to other patriots on \nthe movements of the British forces throughout Long Island.\n  Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was the First Lady to our 35th President, \nJohn F. Kennedy. Jackie O was born on the east end of Long Island in \nSouthampton. In addition to her role as First Lady, she is also \nremembered for her contributions to the arts and historic preservation.\n  In each one of our districts, we can personalize what Women's History \nMonth means to our individual districts because etched in the history \ngoing back in generations there is so much sacrifice to be able to not \nonly take care of their families, but to advance their communities and \ntheir country.\n  The freedom and liberty that we cherish here in this Chamber would \nnot be possible without the sacrifices of so many whom we honor \nthroughout the year at different times, but it is the month of March in \nparticular that we take an extra special pause to say thank you.\n  Before I served in Congress, I served in the New York State Senate. \nDuring my time there, there were countless measures to be supported \nensuring that women are protected and given access to opportunity, \nsecurity, and prosperity. As one of our colleagues, Virginia Foxx, \nrecently pointed out, every issue is a woman's issue.\n  In 2012 and 2013, while serving in the State senate, I had the \nopportunity to\n\n[[Page H1537]]\n\nvote in favor of the New York State Senate's Women's Equality Agenda, \nwhich passed the senate in both years.\n  It was a robust package of legislation to help with various \nprotections, including what I am supportive of: equal pay for equal \nwork.\n  I also voted to create a workforce training program within the \nDepartment of Labor. I fought for this program because, with the \ncurrent state of the economy, many women and their families are \nstruggling.\n  This program would help women to obtain higher paying jobs and give \nthem access to better opportunities to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  In State houses all across this country and local governments as \nwell, there are opportunities to provide more of a chance for that \nwoman and her family to be able to achieve truly the American Dream.\n  But sometimes government, regulations, and laws can block and prevent \nthat access, access to educational opportunities, the ability to maybe \nown your own small business and grow it into something greater.\n  It is our duty, whether you are serving as a village mayor or a local \ntown supervisor or if you are a Member of the United States Congress, \nto seek out opportunities to best represent those for whom we are \nelected to be their voice and ensure that they are given maximum \nopportunity to succeed.\n  I am pleased to be joined this afternoon by Mrs. Diane Black, who is \nan amazing, exceptional woman in her own right.\n  I am sure that, at some point, there will be a Women's History Month \nSpecial Order in this Chamber a couple of generations from now where \nthey will be talking about all of your outstanding service. You have \nnot only served your district well, but have served our entire country \nwell.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black).\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Mr. Zeldin, \nfor yielding to me.\n  I have been sitting here listening to the gentleman's words, and I \nwill say that I am honored to have the gentleman here talking about the \nwomen in his life, particularly his wife and his two daughters, and \nwhat the future may bring for them.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is often said that every issue is a woman's issue, \nand it is true. I know Representative Zeldin just made that comment.\n  When we talk about tax reform for our small businesses, this directly \nimpacts 30 percent of small businessowners who are women.\n  When we talk about repealing ObamaCare's harmful 30-hour rule that is \ndepressing hours and wages, we do so with the knowledge that the \nmajority of those harmed by this rule are women.\n  When we talk about preserving and protecting the American Dream for \nfuture generations, we do so with the hope that young girls like my two \ngranddaughters would be able to live a life that they choose for \nthemselves, not that someone else chooses for them.\n  For me, this topic is deeply personal. I spent the first years of my \nlife living in public housing, the daughter of parents with no more \nthan a ninth grade education. I know how matters of poverty acutely \nimpact women because I lived it.\n  I came from a background where people didn't always know how to \ndream, and as a result, I was prepared to settle for a life of unfilled \npotential.\n  I had started to believe that, as a young woman growing up in the \n1950s and 1960s who literally lived on the other side of the track, \nthat maybe the American Dream wasn't for me.\n  But, in time, Mr. Speaker, doors of opportunity were opened that \nhelped me realize a plan for my life that was greater than I could ever \nimagine.\n  I became the first person in my family to earn a college degree. I \nfulfilled my desire to become a registered nurse, and I became \nprivileged to serve the State of Tennessee in the legislature and now \nin Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have traveled to far corners of the world, and I have \nseen the struggle that women endure for access to education, a \npaycheck, and for real independence.\n  I am also keenly aware that only here in this country is this story \nof mine possible. Only here could someone like me go from living in the \nhalls of a public housing complex to serving in the Halls of the United \nStates Congress. That is why we call it the American Dream.\n\n  On this Women's History Month, we must resolve to ensure that stories \nlike mine aren't unique. The work we do here in Congress must reach \ntoday's young women with the truth that they have God-given gifts \nwaiting to be used and that the American Dream is theirs to share in as \nwell.\n  I again thank Congressman Zeldin for bringing us together for this \nimportant conversation.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. I thank Mrs. Black for her important words and again for \nall her service.\n  One of the things that I will forever be inspired by with regard to \nMrs. Black's service here in this Chamber is how much she values family \nand the strength of a strong family and the need for champions at all \nlevels of government to fight on their behalf.\n  I mentioned earlier my two daughters, Mikayla and Arianna, identical \ngirls. They are 9\\1/2\\. They are finishing fourth grade. When they were \nborn, they were less than a pound and a half. They were born 14\\1/2\\ \nweeks early.\n  I was actually in Iraq in 2006, and a Red Cross message came out and \nsaid that my wife, Diana, went into labor and the babies weren't going \nto make it. It was a sad time. It was the 22nd week.\n  The doctors at Georgetown University Hospital were amazing. Somehow \nthey managed to keep my daughters alive for 3 more weeks. They were \nborn in the 25th week.\n  These girls went through more in their 3\\1/2\\ months in the hospital \nthan I would ever wish upon anyone to have to experience. You learn a \nlot about prayer.\n  I hope this is okay. We probably accepted prayers in about 16 \ndifferent religions during that experience. We would see these twins on \none side of our girls, and the twins might be growing faster than ours. \nWe might say to ourselves why aren't our girls growing as quickly as \nthose two. But then on the other side there might be triplets, and you \nare watching parents mourn the loss of one of their triplets.\n  You learn to count your blessings, understanding that it is not about \nyou. It is about them. Thanks to the miracle of prayer and modern \nmedicine, they were able to come home.\n  They were on about a dozen medications each and heart monitors. It \nwasn't easy. They didn't hit 8 pounds until they were about 13 months \nold. But these girls were so strong. What they experienced during their \ntime in the hospital was absolutely amazing to me and my wife.\n  They had multiple surgeries while they were there. There was a time \nwhere one of my daughters went into what is call septic shock, which \nhas a 80, 90 percent mortality rate. While she was in septic shock, she \nhad a stroke.\n  The doctors actually recommended that my wife and I discontinue \ntreatment. Mikayla wasn't getting any better, but she wasn't getting \nany worse for about 24 hours, up to this point where the doctors were \nrecommending that we discontinue treatment and let her go.\n  We decided that, if she was going to keep fighting, we would keep \nfighting with her. We elected to do this really risky brain surgery. My \nwife and I went to her and said goodbye. We went to the waiting room \nexpecting the worst and hoping for the best.\n  The doctors came to us when surgery was done and said that Mikayla is \nnot out of the woods yet, but things went better than expected. With a \nwhole lot of fight, strength, prayer, and a lot of amazing medicine and \nexpertise at that hospital, they are doing great. They are doing great.\n  Now, Mikayla ended up getting some early intervention when she was \nyounger. My two daughters are equals with their peers. They have caught \nup to them. Just think of how many opportunities were provided to these \ngirls from the moment they went into the hospital to today to be able \nto survive and to succeed.\n  Now, there are a lot of decisions that get made here in this Chamber \nthat impact women, future women leaders of our country, young girls and \nboys who aren't old enough to vote.\n  Yet, some of the most important consequences of the decisions made in \nthis\n\n[[Page H1538]]\n\nChamber impact not just the women of today, but those of tomorrow who \ndon't even have a vote.\n  There are women in this Chamber now. I have a few freshman colleagues \nwho come to mind. And there are several women who were elected.\n  Elise Stefanik is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. She \njust turned 31 years old.\n  Martha McSally is the first female fighter pilot in American military \nhistory. She is serving here now as a freshman. I believe a happy \nbirthday is in order to her.\n  I would say maybe happy 27th birthday, if you are listening. I don't \nwant to get myself into trouble, but happy birthday to Martha.\n  Mia Love is the first Black Republican woman, but she is Mormon and \nHaitian. She is all sorts of firsts and is inspiring so many.\n  All of the three women I have just mentioned--and there are more that \nI could mention--are inspiring my daughters' generation to aim high \nbecause you may be a veteran, you might become a teacher, you might \nsome day be an elected official or an artist or a businessowner.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  It is good to have role models. That is why I speak about Anna \nStrong, an American patriot, who is part of that story of how our \nNation was founded. Or, as I mentioned, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who \nwas born in the First Congressional District of New York.\n  The decisions that we make here in this Chamber impact that next \ngeneration not even old enough to vote. So when we talk about the \neconomy and budgets and debts and deficits, do you know what? I am not \nas concerned about the person who is part of making that decision or \nhas a voice as much as a strong passion and emotion for that young girl \nwho is going to be inheriting the consequences of passing the buck off \nto people who aren't even old enough to vote.\n  I spoke of my daughters, I talk about health, I talk about prayer, I \ntalk about education, and the decisions that are made in this Chamber, \nin State houses, and local governments that provide opportunities for \nthe business owners and the teachers while we pause on Women's History \nMonth to honor those who have come before us. It is every day while we \nserve, every day that we serve, that we should pursue those \nopportunities in any way possible for anyone around now or that future \ngeneration.\n  I am proud to say that the highest ranking Republican woman in the \nUnited States of America is standing right next to me. We all deeply \nadmire Cathy McMorris Rodgers on so many levels for her outstanding \nleadership in this Chamber. I know that some of the women's names I \njust mentioned who now serve here, or my daughters who are looking for \nrole models in life, that so many look up to you as they do Mrs. Black, \nwho spoke just before you.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. \nMcMorris Rodgers).\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding. I appreciate his service and his leadership on behalf of the \npeople of New York and for being an advocate to make history move \nforward for women.\n  As we walk these halls of Congress, it is hard to miss the bronze and \nmarble reminders of women who blazed the trail before us. We follow \ntheir lead, remember their struggles, and enjoy the rights and freedoms \nthey have helped us secure. Perhaps the most lasting tribute we can \nmake for them is through our effort to make history for the next \ngeneration of trailblazers.\n  Friends, we are nearing the end of Women's History Month, and I have \nreflected on the words of our beloved First Lady Nancy Reagan, who \npassed away earlier this month: ``Feminism is the ability to choose \nwhat you want to do.'' Her words remind me just how much young girls \nneed role models. They need to be able to look up to courageous women \nin every field who inspire them to dream so that they can say: She's \ncool. That's what I want to do, too.\n  Women like Dr. Shelley Redinger, the Superintendent of Spokane Public \nSchools in Spokane, who has been on the forefront of significantly \nimproving graduation rates. She represents the school district by \nserving on several community boards, yet still finds time to visit or \nteach a class in one of the district's 50 schools.\n  Women like Dr. Patricia Butterfield, the dean of the WSU College of \nNursing, who is recognized both in nursing and health sciences as a \nregional, national, and international scholar, and takes time to \ninspire her own students to have a sense of discovery.\n  Women like Brooke Martin, a 15-year-old from eastern Washington, who \n3 years ago developed the idea for iCPooch to solve her dog's \nseparation anxiety using video chat. After coming in second in a \nprestigious science competition, her invention is now sold on three \ncontinents.\n  It is my honor to represent these inspirational women. As the second \nchairwoman of the House Republican Conference, it is a privilege to \nserve alongside my passionate, accomplished, and talented House \nRepublican colleagues, who are as diverse as the regions we represent.\n  Renee Ellmers and Diane Black were nurses.\n  Mimi Walters was a stockbroker.\n  Martha McSally was a colonel in the Air Force and the first female \nfighter pilot.\n  Barbara Comstock juggled starting a family with completing law school \nbefore she became chief counsel of the House Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform.\n  Susan Brooks was a U.S. attorney in Indiana, prosecuting high-profile \ncases of mortgage fraud and online child exploitation.\n  Virginia Foxx was the first in her family to go to college. She later \nearned a master's degree and a doctorate in education and served as \npresident of a community college.\n  Kay Granger was the first woman to be elected mayor of Fort Worth and \nis the first and only Republican woman elected from Texas to the House \nof Representatives.\n  Marsha Blackburn was the first woman to sell books door to door for \nSouthwestern Company. After working her way up in the company, Marsha \nleft to build a small business of her own.\n  Vicky Hartzler was raised on the farm, served in the Missouri State \nHouse until taking time off after adopting a baby daughter, and then \nbecame the second Republican woman elected to Congress from Missouri.\n  Jaime Herrera Beutler is the first Hispanic in history to represent \nWashington State in the House, and her daughter is the first child to \nsurvive Potter's Syndrome.\n  Lynn Jenkins was raised on a dairy farm, and she is a certified \npublic accountant.\n  Cynthia Lummis was the youngest woman elected to the Wyoming \nLegislature.\n  Candice Miller served as Michigan's first female secretary of state.\n  Kristi Noem left college early to help run her family's ranch after \nher father died, but later earned her bachelor's degree in 2012, while \nserving in Congress.\n  Martha Roby worked at a law firm, and she is one of the first two \nwomen elected to Congress from Alabama.\n  Ileana Ros-Lehtinen is the first Cuban American Latina elected to \nCongress.\n  Ann Wagner was the United States Ambassador to Luxembourg.\n  Jackie Walorski wore many hats. She was a television reporter, a \nmissionary, and even the executive director of her local Humane \nSociety.\n  Elise Stefanik, at 30, was the youngest woman ever elected to \nCongress.\n  Mia Love is the first African American Republican woman to serve in \nthe House.\n  Amata Radewagen is the first woman elected to serve in Congress from \nAmerican Samoa.\n  Each story is unique and incredible, and our presence in Congress is \na reminder that all issues are women's issues.\n  For women in every corner of the country, we care about achieving a \nbetter life for ourselves and our children.\n  As Congresswoman Blackburn so aptly put it: It is a poetic \ncoincidence that Mrs. Reagan passed away during this month of \nremembrance. She will go down in history as one of the most influential \nand consequential first ladies in American history, and a permanent \nfixture in our memories.\n  The onus is now on us as women leaders to show girls across this \ncountry\n\n[[Page H1539]]\n\nthat with hard work, they can achieve anything. No dream is too big and \nno goal too farfetched. We take seriously this responsibility to \nencourage and empower the next generation of female leaders with how we \ninteract, how we present ourselves as leaders, and the policies we \nchoose to pursue.\n  That is why House Republicans are building an agenda to restore a \nconfident America, where every American feels secure in their lives and \nin their futures. Let's focus on a bright future for every American, \nevery woman, to live courageously, follow their hearts, see potential \nin others, and be risk-takers. That is where women can keep making \nhistory for generations to come.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. McMorris Rodgers for being a \nstrong leader, a trailblazer, and a role model to many women who serve \nhere in this Chamber and to, I am sure, countless women inside of her \ndistrict and all around this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), \nwho was referenced by Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, for her role taking on \nincredible responsibility inside of our Justice Department ensuring \nthat America and her community was safe. She continues her service here \ntoday as an important leader and voice in this Chamber.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New \nYork for yielding, and I thank him for leading this Special Order. I \nwant to also thank and commend him for his service to our country in \nhis many years of service in the armed services.\n  I rise today in honor of Women's History Month, as have those who \nhave gone before me.\n  One hundred years ago, the very first woman was elected to Congress. \nHer name was Representative Jeannette Rankin. She was elected by the \npeople of the great State of Montana to serve in the House of \nRepresentatives. This was even a few years before women were given the \nright to vote in this country.\n  Since then, 313 women have served in Congress as United States \nrepresentatives, delegates, or Senators. So think about that: 100 years \nand only 313 women have been elected to represent their home districts \nand States in this country.\n  I am very proud to be here with the gentlewoman from Tennessee, and \nwe just heard from the gentlewoman from the State of Washington, and I \nam proud to be one of these 313 women.\n  When I was elected, I joined my colleague from Indiana, Jackie \nWalorski, and we were, in fact, the first Republican women elected to \nrepresent the State of Indiana in 53 years. It had been 53 years since \na representative--her name was Cecil Hardin--represented the western \npart of our State. She served in Congress for 10 years from 1949 to \n1959.\n  One hundred years after Representative Rankin made history by winning \nthe first congressional seat held by women, women like me are still \nmaking history by running and winning elected office. Today, I serve in \nthe House of Representatives with 84 women. As you have just heard, we \nare as diverse as the places we represent. Yet, as I talk to my \ncolleagues, we all agree on one thing: We have much more work to do. \nEven though there are a record number of women in Congress, we are \nstill just 20 percent of the total.\n  We are not alone, however, in that gender disparity. From Congress to \nState legislatures, to governors and mayor's offices, women represent \nabout one in five elected officials. That figure has remained \nrelatively consistent since the 1990s. We have plateaued.\n  It is not just in Congress. That same gender disparity can be seen at \nthe Emmy Awards, in the executive boardroom, and in the newsroom.\n  This Women's History Month, instead of just focusing on all of the \nincredible accomplishments and achievements of the women that have come \nbefore us, I also want to mention for a short time about our hopes and \nour goals for the future, our dreams for what women will be able to \naccomplish in the next 100 years.\n  More women are now earning college degrees--associate's, bachelor's, \nand doctoral--than men today. These women, as they graduate, are \nactually more likely than their male counterparts to have a job lined \nup. These young women are the future history makers who will work on \nthe front lines to fight cancer and to find a cure to cancer. They will \nserve with dignity in this Chamber and they will serve in leadership \nlevels at all levels of government. They will be the women who will \nlead in the board room, and they will be the women who will build the \nnext generation of technology.\n  We know that there are women coming behind us who will be making a \ndifference. I look forward to future Women's History Months when we can \ntalk about those women and what they have achieved.\n  Again, I want to thank Mr. Zeldin for giving us the opportunity to \ntalk about women, both past, present, and future.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Brooks for being here. \nHopefully, for all of those young girls who come home from school and, \nas part of their routine, they are watching C-SPAN right now, looking \nfor inspiration on what to do with their life--high school, college--\nyou try to figure out what the right path is for you and you search \naround for role models.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  I can only imagine how many women have asked the gentlewoman: How? \nWhat is the path? Tell me. There really isn't one path to get to this \nChamber or to be that teacher or that veteran; but the gentlewoman has \npursued a path that, I am sure, inspires so many in her home district, \nand I greatly thank her for her service to our country.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. I thank the gentleman.\n  I must say that, certainly, when I started my path right out of \ncollege, I would not have ever guessed that I would have been here in \nthe United States House of Representatives. I think, when people \napproach you and ask you to consider this type of public service, I \nhope that a lot of young women look to the women who are here and see \nthat we have been able to do it and that they can as well.\n  It is an honor to serve with the gentleman.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. I would also venture to guess, during the gentlewoman's \ntime as a prosecutor in our judicial system, that there have been \ncountless women whom she has seen firsthand who have searched for that \nadvice on how to go through that really tough challenge in their lives \nand their feeling vulnerable or trapped but with that strength of \ncharacter of knowing there is someone around to help them out of tough \ntimes.\n  The gentlewoman's experiences throughout that path must give her an \nincredible perspective for those women who might, right now, be in \nabusive relationships or who have suffered something traumatic in their \nlives and don't know where to go. They feel trapped.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. I have to tell the gentleman that I think \nthere have been a number of women role models in my life, women who \nhave served as judges--Federal judges, State court judges--who have \nbeen tremendous mentors to the women of the bar. I have been an \nattorney for 30 years, and there is a sisterhood of those who practice \nlaw and who work to uphold the laws. We work together to try to support \neach other, not just in the courtrooms but on our professional career \npaths. They are women like Federal Judge Sarah Evans Barker, who is \nabout to retire, and another Federal judge, Sue Shields, who was the \nfirst female judge in the State of Indiana. She was the first female \njudge at the State court level, and then she also served on the Federal \nbench as a magistrate.\n  They have been strong role models and have helped us as lawyers to \ndeal with our colleagues or with those we are bringing up through the \nranks and offering that hand up as they have offered that hand up to \nme. We are, often, trying to make sure that women can overcome whatever \nobstacles they might have in continuing their career paths.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. I am witnessing, firsthand, the gentlewoman's giving back \nmany times over. I thank her for participating in honor of Women's \nHistory Month and for all she does in creating her own legacy and \ntrailblazing herself, which I am sure will be spoken about for many \nyears to come.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. I thank the gentleman.\n\n[[Page H1540]]\n\n  I only hope to make Cecil Harden's legacy proud, who served from 1949 \nto 1959, as a Member who is severing in this great Chamber from the \ngreat State of Indiana.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, as Mrs. Brooks departs, I think of Cathy \nMcMorris Rodgers' words in that this has been an inspiring hour. I just \nthink of these three women who are standing before me and what they \nhave accomplished. Gosh.\n  I now yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black). I thank \nher for being here and for making this an important hour and important \nmessage on so many different levels.\n  Mrs. BLACK. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of recognizing someone who mentored me \nwhen I was back in the State senate and had the honor of serving there \nwith a Lieutenant Governor who was a very fine man and who is retiring.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding in order for me to recognize him \nand to let him know how much we have appreciated his service to the \nState of Tennessee. I thank him for his mentorship to me as a young \nsenator back at the State level.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. I can only imagine how many stories the gentlewoman might \nhave along the way of the people with whom she came in contact.\n  Mr. Speaker, for me, my parents were divorced and remarried, so I \ngrew up with four parents. I went through a few divorces with them. \nNow, my grandparents were married for over 71 years. If they lost \neverything--if they didn't have a home, if they didn't have any money, \nif they didn't have any friends--and if they only had each other, they \nwould have been happy. They found success in life as soon as they had \nfound each other.\n  Before the gentlewoman leaves, I just want to let her know how much \nso many Members of this Chamber appreciate everything she does. \nWhatever it is that she has experienced or encountered in life in her \npath to get here today, she makes the most of every minute of being in \nthis Chamber on behalf of keeping our families strong, and I value that \nvery much.\n  Mrs. BLACK. I thank the gentleman for that. I appreciate his saying \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, my family is number one in my life. I have two \ngranddaughters, and I am hoping that everything that I teach them--that \nincludes cooking and sewing and fishing--they will remember fondly as \nthey grow into young women as well. I encourage them to be all that \nthey can be, and I think, given their strong personalities that I see \nright now, we are going to see them as being leaders when they grow up \nas well.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. After this hour is over, at another time, maybe the \ngentlewoman can give me advice, since I have two 9-year-old girls at \nhome, as to what is in store for me in 2 or 3 years. I hear these \nvicious rumors that things might change.\n  Mrs. BLACK. I will tell the gentleman, no matter what phase they go \nthrough, they will always be your little girls. The thing that the \ngentleman needs to do, every day, every night, every moment, is just \nlet them know how much he loves them, and they will grow up to be fine \nyoung women.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. If they ever give me a hard time, I will say that Diane \nBlack told me that this was only going to be temporary.\n  Mrs. BLACK. You send them to see Mama Black.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. All right. Hopefully, I won't be doing that as a last \nresort. I might make that plan A.\n  Mrs. BLACK. I have a feeling that the gentleman is going to be quite \na good daddy--that he is and that he will be--as they grow through \nthose difficult years, which all little girls do; so the gentleman will \nhave those years. Just remember, on the other end, they will come out \nto be beautiful young women.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. I thank the gentlewoman. In all seriousness, she really \ndoes provide inspiration for so many in how much she values a strong \nfamily.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Ted Poe, who is well respected in this \nChamber for not just his straight talk and his intellect, but as \nsomeone who is a fierce champion of American security and of our \nConstitution. It is obvious that he also has a soft spot in his heart \nfor the importance of honoring those in our lives and in our country \nwho have come before us and who serve today to make this place extra \nspecial.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here, as the gentleman says, to \nrecognize the people who have influenced our lives. Of course, we are \ntalking about the women who have influenced our lives to help us be \nwhat we turned out to be. I want to talk specifically about some Texas \nwomen whom I consider to be a rare breed. They are tenacious, strong-\nwilled, nurturing, and also kind.\n  One of those is my mother. I am blessed that my mom and dad are both \nalive. They are 90 years of age. My mom was a Red Cross volunteer \nduring World War II. She met my dad. He was in World War II, in \nGermany, coming back to the United States. He was being re-equipped for \nthe invasion of Japan. They met at a Wednesday night prayer meeting. We \ncall that ``church'' in Texas. They got married, and they have been \nmarried now for 70 years. She not only started out as a volunteer, but \nshe has done all remarkable things, including being a schoolteacher, \nraising my sister and me, and doing other wonderful things.\n  In the State of Texas, we are proud, as other States are. We have \nmany modern-day influential women, including former First Ladies Laura \nBush and Barbara Bush and our late Governor, Ann Richards. These women \nwere influential, powerful, and successful in their own right, but they \nwere not the first of their kind. There was another generation of \npioneers who came before them, women like my grandmother, Lady Bird \nJohnson, and Ma Ferguson, who paved the way for future generations of \nTexas women.\n  My grandmother, really, was more influential in my life than were my \nown parents. She lived to the age of 99. She raised me to be in public \nservice, and I always have been in public service because of her: I \ntaught school; I was in the Air Force Reserves; I was a prosecutor; \nthen I was a judge and a Member of Congress--all because of my \ngrandmother. She taught me many lessons, and she made it very simple. \nNot only did she inspire me to be in public service--I took that good \nadvice--but she said, until the day she died, that she had failed, for \nmy grandmother was, as we say in the South, a Yellow Dog Democrat. She \ncould not believe that I had crossed over to the other side and become \na Republican, and I am not sure that she ever forgave me for being a \nRepublican.\n  She was a strong-minded, no nonsense individual. She used to always \nsay, ``There is nothing more powerful than a woman who has made up her \nmind,'' and that is true. For a woman who has made up her mind, get out \nof the way. We find that true even today. That has proven to be one of \nthe most valuable lessons she ever taught me.\n  President Lyndon Johnson was a hard-nosed politician, but his \ncontributions to Texas as President were really surpassed, in my \nopinion, by his dogged First Lady or, as we called her, Lady Bird \nJohnson. She was one of the finest Southern and politically astute \nwomen we have ever had in the State of Texas. While she is best \nremembered for her love of the environment and the preservation of our \nnatural resources, she was no wallflower in the business and political \nworld either. She was her husband's strongest supporter and was with \nhim, giving advice, step for step, throughout his entire career while, \nat the same time, carving out a path for herself in the business world. \nShe turned a debt-ridden Austin radio station into a multimillion-\ndollar broadcast empire. Her resume reads like that of a superwoman.\n  Among her many achievements, she played a pivotal part in shaping \nlegislation by lobbying and speaking before Congress in support of the \nhighway beautification bill, better known as Lady Bird's Bill. She \noversaw every detail in the creation of the Presidential library, which \nbecame a model for other Presidential libraries today. Of course, she \nserved faithfully, and often in awe of her colleagues, as a regent of \nher alma mater, the University of Texas.\n  Every spring--this time of the year--people head up from Houston to \nAustin on Highway 290. They see the wildflowers, and there are \nbazillions of them everywhere at this time of the year. Every \nbluebonnet we see throughout Texas Hill Country and every tree\n\n[[Page H1541]]\n\nwe plant here at home, along a place called Will Clayton Parkway, is a \ntribute to Lady Bird Johnson and her determination that we are going to \nkeep Texas beautiful.\n  Before there was a Lady Bird, Texas was home to another fiery, \ninspirational woman. You may have never heard about her. Her name was \nMa Ferguson. The year was 1899--over 100 years ago--when Miriam Amanda \nWallace married James Ferguson, who later became the Governor of Texas. \nMa Ferguson served as the first lady of Texas from 1915 until 1917, \nwhich was about 2\\1/2\\ years, until Pa Ferguson got himself in a little \ntrouble. He was impeached by the State of Texas and the legislature \nduring his second term and was barred from ever running for office \nanywhere again.\n  Then Ma changed history. She did the unthinkable and ran for Governor \nof Texas--as a woman. Texas had only been run by men before, but Ma \ndidn't care--she was going to run. She ran on a platform of two \nGovernors for the election of one. Of course, Ma was not in prison like \nPa was, but, apparently, they did work together. She ran against Klan-\nsupported Felix Robertson in the Democratic primary and claimed victory \nwith the Democratic nomination. Back in those days, there were no \nRepublicans in Texas. Everybody was a Democrat. The handful of \nRepublicans never admitted it. Winning the Democrat primary was \ntantamount to winning the general election in November. Ma later became \nthe first female Governor of Texas and only the second female Governor \nof the whole United States. She defeated a little known candidate in \n1924 called George Butte, a Republican.\n  The two Fergusons became known as ``Ma and Pa,'' and--no surprise--Ma \nran the show. However, Ma's Governorship was tainted by the criticism \nof her loose policy of pardoning people in the penitentiary. She was \nnot above her critics--she pardoned thousands of inmates during her \nGovernorship. To many, the motive behind the pardons was a little \nquestionable, and allegations of bribery, ultimately, led to her next \nGovernor's race and its defeat. After she lost the next election, Ma \ncontinued her political fight, and she regained her Governor's seat in \n1932--again, for a second term.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  One of her best achievements was the signing of Texas House Bill 194. \nIt established the University of Houston as a 4-year institution.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I went to the University of Houston Law School. I \nam glad it got established. Ma would be proud to see the University of \nHouston today. The Ferguson name lived long after the retirement of \nboth Ma and Pa.\n  My grandmother, Lady Bird Johnson, Ma Ferguson, Ann Richards, and the \nBush women came from a generation of women that were strong and \ninfluential. They possessed the grace of an angel, yet led with both \nforceful and effective political genius.\n  Few women of their later generation worked outside of the home, but \nfew men succeeded without the backing of those ladies. These women did \nit all. They effortlessly backed their husbands while changing the \nworld all at the same time.\n  March, this month, is Women's History Month. So it is time we honor \nthose women who lived years and years ago, honor those women who lived \nback during the Greatest Generation's time and, of course, the women \nwho live today.\n  All those women now are in every profession, as stated earlier, \nincluding the legal profession, acting as judges and prosecutors and, \nnot only that, Members of Congress, Members of Cabinets, and ladies \nthat give a lot of their time and money to the community. So we are \nthankful for them.\n  I appreciate the time that the gentleman from New York has given me \nso we could talk about some of these iron-willed, strong-willed women \nthat have made up their minds.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  I would imagine anyone who was wondering what Women's History Month \nwas all about should just listen to your remarks as you pay exceptional \ntribute to some amazing women from your home State of Texas who all \nleft a mark not only in your life, but in others' lives as well.\n  These are women who, I am sure, are getting celebrated all throughout \nyour State and this country not just by you, but by others as well.\n  In my home State of New York, it is tough. They give us a month and \nhere tonight they give us an hour. There really are so many different \nwomen who gave us this opportunity to take us to today where the two of \nus can stand here on this particular House floor and speak to each \nother about such an important topic that apparently 25 years ago didn't \neven happen. It wasn't even until the early 1980s that we even started \nrecognizing a women's history week.\n  So here we are, and I am glad that you are part of it. I can see that \nthere is a lot of inspiration from women in your life.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York.\n  I agree with him. A month is really not enough time to celebrate and \nhonor women in our history that just made a big difference in a lot of \npeople's lives.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of people here in this \nChamber who all find different issues that interest them that they \nfocus heavily on and move the ball forward in a very positive way.\n  The one thing that I have experienced during my time serving here--\nand I am in my first term and serve on the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee--is that, as the subcommittee chairman of the Terrorism, \nNonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, what I have experienced is \nthat you do a lot to keep America safe, to keep the women and men of \nyour district and this country safe.\n  So I really do appreciate your service. Because this is not just \nabout reflecting on service in the past, but challenging ourselves to \ndo even more and to provide more opportunity forward.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee \n(Mrs. Black), who has a very special guest here she would like to \nrecognize.\n\n\n                     Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey\n\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I recognize Tennessee's Lieutenant Governor \nRon Ramsey, who is going to be retiring after his years of service.\n  Today I rise to honor my friend, Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey, on \nhis upcoming retirement from the Tennessee State Senate. It is not an \nexaggeration to say that Lieutenant Governor Ramsey changed Tennessee \nhistory. He was, after all, our first Republican Lieutenant Governor in \nover 140 years.\n  His legacy will be one of preserving that which makes Tennessee \nspecial: our low tax burden, our commitment to fiscal responsibility, \nand our tradition of defending life.\n  It was among one of the great honors of my professional career to \nserve as chairman of the State Republican Caucus under his leadership \nand to partner with him as we laid the groundwork for the conservative \nsupermajority that we enjoy today in Tennessee.\n  I will never forget being in the Senate Chamber the moment that \nLieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey was elected. He came to the well of the \nSenate floor and, before doing anything else, paid honor to God, \ntelling all of us in the room and everyone else watching that it is to \nHim we owe our very being.\n  He then thanked his family, including his wife, Sindy, who has served \nTennessee with distinction as our Second Lady for nearly a decade.\n  In that moment, Lieutenant Governor Ramsey reminded all of us of his \npriorities. He loves our State. He loves public service. But as anyone \nwho knows him can attest, his faith and his family are of the greatest \nimportance. I will always be thankful to him for setting that example.\n  Mr. Speaker, it should be noted that Lieutenant Governor Ramsey arose \nto his post in the State leadership shortly after a dark time in \nTennessee history, which saw the very public failings of legislators on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  He was an example of character and personal integrity at that moment \nwhen we needed it the most and, in time, he made us believe that \ngovernment could do right by its people. Lieutenant Governor Ramsey \noften reminded us, ``It matters who governs.'' Indeed, it does.\n\n[[Page H1542]]\n\n  As we reflect on where Tennessee has come from and where we are \nheaded, we can say with certainty that our State is stronger because of \nRon Ramsey's leadership. I count it a privilege to call him my friend.\n  I wish him, his wife Sindy, and his beautiful family all the best in \nthis next chapter of their lives.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, as we come toward the end of our hour \nremembering and celebrating the women who have come before us and who \nserve today, trying their hardest to create more opportunities going \nforward, I would like to mention eight young ladies from the First \nCongressional District of New York who I was proud to nominate to \nservice academies this year:\n  Taya Coniglio, Skylar Grathwohl, and Gabriella Franco were nominated \nto the U.S. Naval Academy.\n  Ally McFayden and Dana Fasano were nominated to the U.S. Merchant \nMarine Academy.\n\n  Chelsea Chamberlin, Isabella Cortes, and Emma Fasolino were nominated \nto the U.S. Military Academy.\n  These eight young ladies have stepped up wanting to raise their hand \nto defend our country. Going off to a service academy comes with an \nobligation to wear that uniform and serve on Active Duty afterwards.\n  For anyone who signs up post-9/11, you understand what it is that you \nare signing up for. To just think that these young ladies were 2, 3 \nyears old on September 11, 2001, all that they know is the post-9/11 \nAmerica and world. Yet, they are signing up to want to serve our \ncountry as officers.\n  There are over 2 million women veterans. So as we consider \nlegislation in this House, I cosponsored H.R. 1356, the Women Veterans \nAccess to Quality Care Act, which assists our women veterans.\n  While we try to provide more access to health care for our women \nveterans, there are many opportunities available to us that still have \nnot yet been achieved and pursued to victory.\n  Women make up 15 percent of the U.S. military's Active-Duty personnel \nand 18 percent of the National Guard and Reserve forces.\n  H.R. 1356 will improve VA facilities for women veterans, hold VA \nmedical facility directors accountable for performance measures, ensure \nthe availability of OB/GYN services in VA medical centers, and calls \nfor a GAO study on the VA's ability to meet the needs of women \nveterans.\n  Whether it is the eight young ladies I mentioned who wanted to go to \nU.S. service academies or those who are currently, as we stand here, \nover in harm's way in the Middle East and elsewhere, away from their \nfamilies and who have sons and daughters here at home--and they may not \njust be on their first deployment. They may be on their fourth or fifth \nor sixth deployment.\n  When they come home, whether they come home in one piece, whether \nthey come home with the physical or mental wounds of war, whether they \nneed assistance pursuing educational or vocational opportunities, I \nwant to thank our women veterans for their service to our Nation.\n  We honor all women during this hour, but I wanted to close by paying \nan extra special tribute and thank you to our women veterans and, once \nagain, to all of the women in my life.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1542-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1542-H1545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORLD WATER DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the \ngentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for 30 minutes.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome the Congressman and \ndoctor, Dan Benishek, from Michigan's First District, which encompasses \nMarquette and Mackinac Island and Traverse City, to name a few famous \ntowns and island. I welcome him to participate this evening as well as \nour other colleagues from the Great Lakes.\n  I rise tonight to mark the occasion of World Water Day. As such, I \nwould like to discuss the Great Lakes, an American freshwater treasure, \nirreplaceable on our globe. Actually, it is the largest source of \nfreshwater in the United States and represents about 20 percent of the \nworld's freshwater supply.\n  The district that I represent, which is a little south of Michigan, \ndown in Ohio, sits nestled across Lake Erie's entire south coast, \nextending from Cleveland all the way west to Toledo and encompasses all \nof Ohio's ports but for one.\n  There should be a sign, actually, on the Ohio Turnpike nearby that \nmarks our shoreline as the step-off point, since Lake Erie is the most \nsouthern of all the lakes, as the largest body of freshwater on the \nface of the Earth.\n  I see our dear colleague, the co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force \nwith me, Congressman Mike Kelly of Erie, Pennsylvania, who has joined \nus. It is also a great port city, nestled along these Great Lakes.\n  Let me begin by saying, since the passage of the Clean Water Act in \n1972, Lake Erie itself has been on a path to recovery. It got very sick \nback in the 20th century.\n  Point sources of pollution, such as inadequate wastewater treatment \nfacilities and infrastructure and industrial outfalls have been slowly \ncoming. Since back then and the passage of the Clean Water Act and the \nestablishment of Earth Day, they have been coming into EPA compliance.\n  One needs no further proof in tracking the rebirth of America's \nsymbol, the bald eagle, than to really track Lake Erie's health. Lake \nErie is the shallowest of the lakes; and, therefore, it is kind of the \ncanary in the coal mine. What happens there will happen in the other \nlakes subsequently.\n  The bald eagle had actually become an endangered species by the time \nof the 1970s, and only two eagles were left on our great lake, Lake \nErie. There were no eaglets being born.\n  Due to the Clean Water Act's passage and literally the banning of DDT \nand the repair of many of the industrial outfalls, which we are still \nworking on, and the combined sewer overflows, what happened, as we \nmoved into the 21st century, was human progress.\n  Today hundreds of baby eaglets are being born across Lake Erie, and \nthey are flying other places around the country. Amazingly, the bald \neagle has been taken off the endangered species list. So progress is \npossible. Humans can really repair the environment if they are \ndedicated to us.\n  For those of us who live in Lake Erie's western basin, which is the \nfar western part of the State, the health of our lake is a living \nreality and access to freshwater has become the background noise of our \ndaily lives, becoming more pronounced when tragedy strikes, as it did \nmost recently in Flint, Michigan, and Sebring, Ohio, with lead in \nfreshwater.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Our region works and plays with a new normal that includes very \nfrequent water quality reports now, updates on beach postings--whether \nyou can swim or not--water utility fee increases, and a general concern \nabout a troubling set of scientific questions that still go unanswered.\n  Unfortunately, this administration has not recognized these concerns \nand seeks to cut Federal support to Great Lakes States by $148 million \nfor next year. Some would call that an oxymoron; it makes no sense in \nview of what is happening across our region, but it is happening.\n  This evening--and I am going to yield to my colleagues before I get \ninto these topics--I would like to address the water infrastructure \nneeds of the Great Lakes, harmful algal blooms, which literally shut \ndown the city of Toledo's water system a year-and-a-half ago, denying \nfresh water for 3 days to citizens, to businesses, and to institutions \nin that region because of something called microcystin, which is the \ntoxic part of certain types of algal blooms which we are trying to \naddress. So harmful algal blooms will be one of my topics.\n  Another topic will be the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which \nis so important to all of us in helping to improve our Great Lakes.\n  Stopping the Asian carp is another topic.\n  The next topic will be the Great Lakes navigation system itself, an \nantiquated system that has to be updated for this 21st century.\n  Finally, I will discuss the harbor maintenance fund. These are all \nmajor issues across the Great Lakes region, which we would like to \nplace on the Record this evening.\n\n[[Page H1543]]\n\n  I would like to ask my colleagues to join me. Congressman Benishek, I \nthank you again so very much for being a leader for the Great Lakes and \nfor coming down this evening.\n  I now yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek).\n  Mr. BENISHEK. I thank Ms. Kaptur very much for setting up this time \nfor us to come together on the floor to talk about the importance of \nthe Great Lakes. I also thank Mr. Kelly for being here as well.\n  It is nice to know there are some issues that are truly bipartisan. I \nbelieve that protecting our Great Lakes is really one of those.\n  The Great Lakes are a vital part of our life in Michigan, \nparticularly my district. I have more Great Lakes frontage than any \nother district in the country. I have three Great Lakes in my district \nwith over 1,500 miles of frontage on three of the Great Lakes. We have \nmore shoreline than any district in the country other than the State of \nAlaska, but that is all saltwater up there.\n  I do not think there is a person in my district who does not consider \nthe lakes a vital part of their lives, whether it is fishing or \nswimming or sailing or kayaking or just plain sitting by the water. We \nlove our lakes. It is a pure Michigan experience. I encourage you all \nto visit.\n  Since coming to Congress, one of my top priorities has been working \nto keep the Great Lakes clean so that future generations may also enjoy \nthem. I want my grandkids and their kids to experience the joy of their \nfirst local fishing derby on a summer day or going ice fishing with \ntheir buddies in the winter. The joys of living on or near the Great \nLakes inspire us all to ensure that they stay clean for future \ngenerations.\n  However, we treasure our Great Lakes not only for their beauty and \nrecreation they provide, but the incredible value they provide to our \neconomy. In Michigan alone, outdoor recreation generates $18.7 billion \nin consumer spending and supports nearly 200,000 jobs.\n  Protecting the Great Lakes requires action on many fronts, which only \nmakes sense. As Ms. Kaptur said, these five Great Lakes represent more \nthan 20 percent of all the fresh water in the world. That is why I have \nworked along with so many other of my midwestern colleagues to provide \nadequate funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, something \nthe President always seems to cut back on in his budget.\n  This bipartisan effort, which must be renewed every year to guarantee \nthat this important program continues, gives local communities across \nthe Great Lakes the ability to clean up local beaches, preserve natural \nwildlife habitats, and to restore local watersheds, among many other \nuseful products for the Great Lakes.\n  In my district alone, GLRI funds support projects like the Grand \nTraverse Bay Watershed Protection Project and the Beaver Island \nArchipelago Invasive Species Initiative. These programs help protect \nthe Great Lakes while at the same time providing a boost to the local \neconomy.\n  The Soo Locks also have a major impact on our economy. Maintaining \nthe integrity of the current lock system and ensuring the construction \nof a second lock is vital for both our national economy and our \nnational security. Some people do not even realize that these locks \nexist. They are basically the Panama Canal of America. Much of the iron \nore that is made into steel, which a lot of the industry in America \ndepends on, passes through this lock. It would cause a major crisis if \nit should fail.\n  I am proud to have led a trip with other Members of Congress to the \nSoo Locks last summer to raise the importance about the importance of \nthese locks. While we have secured funding for a new Economic \nReevaluation Report from the Corps of Engineers, we must continue to \nraise awareness about the importance of this project while we await the \npublication of this report.\n  Another issue that concerns all of us in the Great Lakes region is \nthe threat of invasive species. From sea lampreys to quagga mussels \nthat are already present in the Great Lakes, to the Asian carp which we \nare currently trying to prevent from gaining access, invasive species \npresent a constant threat to this precious resource.\n  I have worked closely with the gentleman from California (Mr. \nThompson) to reorganize the Congressional Invasive Species Caucus, and \nwe are working to make invasive species a priority in this Congress.\n  While I will be leaving Congress at the end of this term, it is my \nhope that we can continue to work together this year in a bipartisan \nand constructive manner to protect the Great Lakes. I am willing to \npartner with anyone who is willing to do that. I thank Ms. Kaptur for \ndoing this Special Order hour.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank Congressman Benishek very, very much. I thank him \nfor his leadership on Great Lakes issues. That is a vast district that \nhe represents and one that is vital to our country. I thank him for \nparticipating this evening.\n  Before I yield to Congressman Mike Kelly of the Third District of \nPennsylvania, I just want to say that the region that we are talking \nabout, the Great Lakes, actually, if it were a country on its own, \nwould be the third largest economy in the world. We are talking about a \nvast and important part of our Nation with more fresh water than any \nother part of the continent.\n  The Great Lakes navigation system, including the Soo Locks that \nCongressman Benishek referenced, encompasses this vast region, and the \nSeaway that is a part of this that was actually built by President \nEisenhower--it was built back in the 1950s--constitutes through the \nlocks the shortest distance between the heartland of America and the \nports of northern Europe and many other global destinations.\n\n  Most people have never been through the Soo Locks because we tend to \nmove commerce through the locks. We have some tourism, obviously, but \nit really is a busy industrial corridor and has the lowest cost \ntransportation. Waterborne transportation is the lowest cost mode of \ntransportation. So you have the big containers and so forth that move \nthrough the Seaway, and then we have the interlake trade, which is \nheavily industrial, as Congressman Benishek referenced.\n  In recent years, the number of passages through the locks that go all \nthe way from Duluth all the way out through Massena, New York, going \nthroughout these Great Lakes, this whole system has averaged about \n10,000 vessels per year. That is down a bit from prior years because \nwhat has happened is the vessels got larger and they could carry more \nfreight. But the system exists. It operates every day.\n  The ports and channels of the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Seaway \nSystem support over 226,000 jobs in both the United States and Canada \nbecause the Seaway is operated by both countries, and it brings a total \nof $33.5 billion in business revenue to the United States and Canada \nannually. For Ohio, our largest trading partner is Canada, and some of \nthose goods move across the water.\n  In the United States alone, the system supports over 128,000 jobs and \nproduces a total of $18.1 billion in business revenue annually. Over \n42,000 of these jobs are direct jobs in the iron ore and steel \nindustry, which Congressman Benishek referenced. The Great Lakes region \nproduces 90 percent--90 percent--of America's iron ore, and the Great \nLakes region also manufactures 58 percent of automobiles on the roads \nin the United States and Canada. I think Congressman Kelly knows a \nwhole lot about the automobile industry. So this manufacturing and \ncommodity supply chain can only function through the Great Lakes \nnavigation system, which needs modernization.\n  I am more than pleased to yield to the co-chair of the Great Lakes \nTask Force here in the House of Representatives, the very esteemed \ngentleman from Pennsylvania's Third District (Mr. Kelly) centered at \nErie.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentlewoman. I often refer to \nthe gentlewoman not as Representative Kaptur, but as ``Our Lady of the \nLakes'' because, truly, we share a lot of the same concerns when it \ncomes to an absolutely incredible gift from God that has been given to \nus. It is in our stewardship now. It was put in our care and custody \nwith the idea that we are going to pass it on to the next generation in \nbetter shape than what we received it.\n  I think when we look at the Great Lakes, there are so many things you\n\n[[Page H1544]]\n\ncan say about the Great Lakes. Oftentimes it is hard to sit back and \nsay, what is it exactly that the Great Lakes represent?\n  We have already said it is one-fifth of the world's fresh water, not \none-fifth of America's fresh water, not one-fifth of the continent's \nfresh water, but one-fifth of the world's fresh water.\n  It is 6 quadrillion gallons of fresh water. I have absolutely no idea \nwhat that figure would look like other than this: if you were to look \nat the lower 48 States and you were able to pour the water from the \nGreat Lakes over the lower 48 States, it would cover it to a depth of \n9\\1/2\\ feet.\n  So when you put it in that perspective, all of a sudden it starts to \nmake sense and you start to focus on it, and you say this truly is a \ngift from God. This is truly a gift that we have to look after.\n  Too often it is said, well, you know, just let things go, because if \nyou let them go, they will usually work out on their own.\n  My goodness, nothing could be further from the truth. We have seen \nthe great damage to the Great Lakes, and we have also seen that over \nthe years we all of a sudden have become very much aware of it.\n  I would just like to say in the district that I represent, \nPennsylvania's Third District, Erie, Pennsylvania, Presque Isle was on \nthe list, and it was one of those things that said this is an area of \nconcern. So the attention was turned to what do we have to do to save \nPresque Isle.\n  Now, in 2012 it was the first one of these properties that was taken \noff the list of concern through the efforts of not only the Erie \ncommunity, but through the efforts of Congress, and also through the \nefforts of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.\n  Now, we stand here today, and as I have said, I have always referred \nto the gentlewoman as ``Our Lady of the Lakes.'' There is nothing more \nprecious to us than this great amount of water that we have, potable \nwater. If we were to turn our backs on it or for some reason to think \nthat it is not important or that it is not critical or that it is not a \ngift from God that has been put in our care and custody and is up to us \nto protect, then we have fallen far from where we are as a people and \nas a nation.\n  I would like to read one excerpt. A friend of mine named Art Grayhead \nis an Army veteran, Special Ops guy. He is also a Native American. To \nhim, the Great Lakes represent not only a body of water, but also \nsomething precious and also something that has a much deeper religious \nmeaning. He gave me a book called ``The Living Great Lakes.'' It is \nwritten by Jerry Dennis. I am going to read it because I think it is \nworded so magnificently by Mr. Dennis:\n\n       To appreciate the magnitude of the Great Lakes you must get \n     close to them. Launch a boat on their waters or hike their \n     beaches or climb the dunes, bluffs, and rocky outcrops that \n     surround them, and you will see, as people have seen since \n     the age of the glaciers that these lakes are pretty darn big. \n     It is no wonder they are sometimes upgraded to the ``Inland \n     Seas'' and the ``Sweetwater Seas.'' Calling them lakes is \n     like calling the Rockies hills.\n\n  So when you see them and conceptualize in your head what it is that \nwe are talking about and what it is that we are concerned about and \nwhat it is that has been put in our care and custody, none of us can \never turn away and say: ``This doesn't fall on our watch'' or ``We \ndon't have to worry about the Great Lakes.''\n  We have to worry about the Great Lakes, we have to guard the Great \nLakes, and we have to pass it on to the next generation so they, too, \ncan enjoy all the benefits from it.\n  We talk about the economic consequences and the environmental \nconsequences. There is nothing in the life of everyday Americans that \nis more important than our Great Lakes.\n  I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio. She certainly has \nfought this battle for a long, long time. She has always been a great \nchampion of the Great Lakes. So many of our Members who live around the \nGreat Lakes champion it every day. But it is not just for us, it is not \njust for those States around the Great Lakes. It is for every single \nAmerican. I thank the gentlewoman so much for her concern, her \ndedication, and more than anything her passion.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank Congressman Kelly so very much. I thank him for \nhis passion and for participating this evening and for all the effort \nhe puts forward on our Great Lakes Task Force to try to elevate this \nregion of the country as so vital to our future.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  And when the gentlemen were talking about Great Lakes and the word \n``lakes,'' there are some people who have said they should have been \nnamed the Great Seas.\n  I had an experience with schoolchildren a few years back. I loaded up \na schoolbus with children who came from a region that wasn't close to \nthe lake, and I took them out to Lake Erie. Their first reaction was \nactually fear when they saw how big it was. They said: Oh, the ocean.\n  So, it isn't like a little puddle jumper. These lakes are vast. You \nhave described them well. Most Americans have not visited them, so they \ndon't have a complete understanding of how massive these lakes really \nare. There is nothing else like them on the face of the Earth.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I can remember as a child my parents \ntaking us to Lake Erie for summer vacation. I had no idea what I was \ngoing to see, but as we got closer to Erie, my dad said: See, Mike, \nthere it is. There is the lake. I said: It looks like it is going to \ncome crashing on us.\n  Because, you know, as you get closer to those bodies of water, as the \nhorizon, the water and the sky meet together, and as you are \napproaching it, it looks like: My goodness, I can't imagine anything \nthis big.\n  In the eyes of a child, I looked at it and I was completely taken \naway. I couldn't believe it. That has only increased as I have aged and \nI have watched that marvelous, marvelous gift from God that we have and \nthat we have to protect.\n  Again, I thank the gentlewoman. It is always a pleasure being with \nher on the floor talking about our Great Lakes. It is always a pleasure \nworking with her. The passion she has to protect our Great Lakes is \nabsolutely incredible.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. The gentleman has the same passion.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Yes, ma'am.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. This is a moment I am glad that is actually being \nbroadcast because we are down here tonight on a bipartisan basis \ndiscussing a vital resource that this Nation shares with Canada. We \nwork well together. Most of the news is about how Members of Congress \ndon't work together, they don't do this, and here we are participating, \nafter hours--we are not required to be here--and we are talking about \nsomething we believe to be truly irreplaceable for our country.\n  I thank the gentleman for his leadership, and I will share this story \nwith him.\n  When I was a little girl, I still remember the seventh grade when our \ngrandparents and parents took us to Erie, Pennsylvania, to Presque \nIsle. I remember that. It was such a big deal. It was a long trip from \nToledo, Ohio, to Erie, Pennsylvania, and I still remember our relatives \nthere and understanding how big that waterway really is, how we went \nswimming at Presque Isle back in those days--the 1950s, I guess.\n  So I have always had an affinity for Erie, Pennsylvania, remembering \nback to those early times and what a good time we had. The people of \nErie were so hospitable.\n  It is great to have the gentleman as a leader in the Great Lakes Task \nForce and coming down here this evening to make time for the Great \nLakes. I thank him very much. I thank him for his concerted leadership \nand all he has done to be a champion not just for Presque Isle, not \njust for Lake Erie, but for our entire Great Lakes system.\n  I yield to gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), the vice chair of \nthe Great Lakes Task Force, who has come to Congress with all this \nenergy and intelligence and capacity to make a difference for the \ncountry. And then what was handed him in this last 2 months was the \nterrible tragedy in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, with lead in the \nwater pipes and the water system there. So many people in Flint are so \nunnecessarily ill and the community is damaged. All of America wants to \nhelp Flint.\n\n[[Page H1545]]\n\n  I thank Congressman Kildee so much for coming down tonight.\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her \nleadership. Congresswoman Kaptur has always been a great ally for me \nand even my predecessor, my uncle, on working to preserve and protect \nthis incredible natural asset that we have--the Great Lakes.\n  Listening to Congresswoman Kaptur and Congressman Kelly refer to your \nchildhood, we all--those of us from the Great Lakes region--remember \nand recall, from our childhood, our introduction to the Great Lakes.\n  The very shape of my home State of Michigan is defined by the lakes. \nLake Huron is on the east, Lake Michigan is on the west, a touch of \nLake Erie, and, of course, Lake Superior to the north. It defines the \nshape of our State.\n  As a child, I still remember the first time experiencing the lakes, \nand they did seem as though they were something that were so big, they \nwas almost impossible to comprehend. But it was also something that, as \na child, I took for granted. We all took for granted that the lakes \nwould always be there, that they would always be pure, that they would \nalways be clear and cold--the way we recalled them as children.\n  Of course, what we come to know, as policymakers, is that we can't be \nput in a position to take that for granted. We have to actively protect \nthat incredible gift that has been handed to us simply as a creation of \nGod. We have this enormously special stewardship.\n  Two things I want to point out that I think are part of the \nstewardship responsibility that we have to and for the Great Lakes. \nOne, of course, is to defend the lakes against any threat that might \nmanifest now or might manifest generations from now, whether that is \nworking to protect the lakes from invasive species like Asian carp or a \nvery special obligation that I think we have right now, working with \nour friends across the border on the Canadian side, and that is to \nprotect the lakes from unnecessary and unwarranted threats.\n  There has been, in the planning stages, the possibility of a nuclear \nwaste storage facility that would be on the eastern shore of Lake \nHuron. It would be six-tenths of a mile from the shore of that lake. I \nam pleased to see that our friends within the new Canadian Government \nhave sort of taken a pause to reevaluate whether that site is the best \nsite. Of course, my position and the position of many Members of \nCongress, Democrats and Republicans, has been that there is a special \nline that we must draw when it comes to protecting the lakes.\n  We have a chance to ask that--in this case, the Canadian Government, \nand specifically the Ontario Power Generation--they reconsider the \nlocation of a nuclear waste storage facility so that now, 100 or 200 \nyears from now, if some event may occur that would release some of that \nmaterial, we would never put the lakes at risk.\n  That is something that we can do. It is a tangible set of steps that \nwe can take. But it is just an example of the special responsibility \nthat I know I now have as a Member of Congress representing the Great \nLakes region.\n  It is not until you are sworn into office and take an oath to uphold \nthe Constitution and represent the people that you live with back home \nthat you come to understand the magnitude of that responsibility, \nespecially for maintaining the lakes.\n  Of course, the other point that Congresswoman Kaptur mentioned is \nthat we also have a special responsibility to continue to take \nadvantage of the fact that we have been given this gift, and we have to \nuse it in a way that is sustainable but also allows us to use the pure \nand clear lake water in a way that protects us.\n\n  Of course, the very bad decisions that were made at the State \ngovernment level that led to the crisis in my hometown of Flint were \ndecisions to move temporarily away from using lake water for our \ndrinking water to using river water in the Flint River as our primary \ndrinking water source. It is almost unimaginable that that would \nhappen, considering that we are literally surrounded by the greatest \nsource, the largest source of surface freshwater on the planet and that \na community would temporarily use that drinking water.\n  It also makes the point that the protections of our water resources \nare special protections that we have to make sure are adhered to. This \ncrisis in Flint, or any other crisis, such as the issue that I know \nCongresswoman Kaptur is very familiar with--you may have already \naddressed the algal bloom that you dealt with in the lake that affected \ndrinking water in Toledo and other places--we have a special \nresponsibility to make sure that we are, through our Environmental \nProtection Agency and State environmental quality agencies, \naggressively defending the Great Lakes, not just to maintain their \nnatural beauty, not just to maintain them as recreational assets, but \nto make sure that, when we use that water for something as fundamental \nas drinking water, we know it will always be safe and protected.\n  I want to thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on the issue of \nthe Great Lakes and for including me as a part of this bipartisan \neffort to make sure that we always take care of this unique and special \nstewardship responsibility to protect the greatest freshwater source on \nthe planet.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank Congressman Kildee so very, very much for coming \ndown. He has his hands full in trying to repair the damage in Flint. We \nrespect him so much for the leadership he has shown there, because that \ncould happen anywhere. Sadly, it happened in Flint, Michigan, and he \nand the delegation and the entire Great Lakes region have really \nprovided stellar leadership.\n  We all are here to try and help him and the citizens of Flint. He is \nfocusing national attention on the importance of water infrastructure \nand what can happen when systems age. You have brought this to the \nattention of the American people. We can all learn from the experience \nin Flint.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for coming to the floor tonight to \ndiscuss the important challenges that still remain in the Great Lakes \nof water infrastructure improvement, addressing the harmful algal \nblooms, making sure there is significant support in the Great Lakes \nRestoration Initiative, stopping the Asian carp from coming into the \nGreat Lakes, improving our Great Lakes navigation system, and making \nsure that the harbor maintenance trust fund is available for the Great \nLakes.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1545-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1545-H1549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MAJOR OVERHAUL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nDeSantis) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I don't think there is any question that, \nif you go anywhere in this country, the American people believe that \nthis town, Washington, and this institution in particular need a major \noverhaul.\n  The Founding Fathers conceived of a system in which individual \nAmericans, individual citizens would stand for election and they would \ngo up as representatives of the people, but they were no better than \nthe people. They didn't live under different rules than the rest of the \npeople. They were not part of a ruling class, but, really, part of a \nservant culture. That was the idea.\n  Well, we have come a long way. Washington, D.C., is really the bane \nof the existence for many, many people in our society. It hinders our \neconomy. You have people here who engage in self-dealing. It is not \nacting consistently with how this system was envisioned.\n  So there are a lot of things I would like to do:\n  I think Congress needs to be forced to live under all the laws they \npass and enact for other people.\n  I think you need to get rid of a lot of the perks that Members of \nCongress get, including pensions for Members of Congress.\n  But I think if there was one thing that, I think, really cries out \nfor reform, it is that we need to have term limits for Members of \nCongress. I don't think there is any way you are ever going to be able \nto overhaul this culture unless we do that.\n  There was a time when people would get elected and the Founders \ndidn't think anyone would want to be here that long. You would go, you \nwould serve, then you would go back and live under the laws that you \npassed and continue your pursuits as a citizen. Well, somewhere along \nthe line, that really changed. Then people come in,\n\n[[Page H1546]]\n\nand it is almost like that is the main thing that they focus on: just \nstaying here, sometimes in perpetuity. People have served 40, 50 years, \nand I don't think that that has turned out well for our country.\n  I think if you had term limits, I think you would really open up the \nprocess for new blood. I think people would come in here with a \nreformer spirit, new ideas, and really be part of a reform movement in \nWashington, D.C.\n  It is often said: Well, gee, term limits. But the American people get \ntheir choice. They get to vote in the election. The fact of the matter \nis, the way that our electoral system works, millions and millions of \nAmericans have no functional choice simply because maybe their district \nis only going to elect someone from one party. Maybe you have the power \nof incumbency that just makes it so that challengers are never going to \nbe able to get traction.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  The whole campaign finance system is orchestrated to benefit \nincumbents, so we don't really just have where the American people have \na choice. I think you have a structured choice, which typically leads \nto only one outcome. So I am not really somebody that thinks that this \nis all just that the American people are so happy that people are \ngetting returned here all the time.\n  Another, I think, objection that some people said for term limits is \nthat: Well, gee, if you term-limit people, you have new people in who \ndon't necessarily know how the system works. It is just going to be all \nthe staff that are going to run it or the lobbyists that are going to \nrun it.\n  I have got news for you. That is pretty much what happens already. I \nmean, a lot of these omnibus bills, those get done by staff behind \nclosed doors. Staff wields a lot of power on these committees. And \nthese are not elected individuals. Many of them work hard. I respect a \nlot of them, but they are exercising, in many ways, authority that \nshould be exercised by the Members, themselves. So I think that problem \nis real, but I think it is already here.\n  I think if you had new people coming in, I think a lot of those \npeople would probably want to bring in some of their own staff that \nwould be more reflective of their ideas and principles rather than rely \non people that have been here a long time who really become accustomed \nto a system that is not working very well.\n  I am proud to have cosponsored the bill to enact term limits on \nMembers of the House and Members of the Senate. We do three terms for \nthe House, and two terms for the Senate. So if someone wants to serve \nin the House then serve in the Senate, they could serve 18 years. That \nis a long time, and I think you would be able to really do some good \nthings during that period.\n  I think what it does is it really shifts the focus of somebody that \ncomes here, because right now, if you get elected to the House, you are \non the low end of the pecking order in terms of seniority. I mean, you \nalmost have to just sit around here for 10, 15, 20 years to be in a \nposition where you could really make a huge difference. I think what \nthat does is that creates a culture in which people want to stay here, \nand that is kind of the main thing that happens once you get here.\n  I think, if you had term limits, the main thing that people would be \nthinking about is: Okay. You know you are term-limited. Your time is \nlimited. Let's make the most of that. I think you would see a lot of \npeople really, really perform much better. You would have people who \ncould come in as freshmen and have more of an impact because the system \nwouldn't be dominated by seniority. There would be less favoritism, \nless backroom dealing. So I think it is a very, very positive reform.\n  We have been voting on random things here lately. I think it would be \ngreat if we could come here and offer some reforms to the system, \nconstitutional reforms, like term limits, like a balanced budget \namendment, like an amendment making Congress live under the laws that \neverybody else does. I think that would be a breath of fresh air for \nthe American people.\n  Here is the thing. We talk about how we have the division and the \nrancor in our politics, and even in this institution; but if you look, \nterm limits is something that, regardless of party, regardless of \nideology, regardless of age, regardless of gender, regardless of race, \nAmericans support in overwhelming numbers.\n  So I think that is an example of where the American people are \nactually very united for this. But when you have the governing class in \nWashington, that is where the divisions are, because many people don't \nwant to see those types of reforms here.\n  But there is agreement throughout American society, and so if we want \nto start having a more unified country, we should be listening to the \nAmerican people. When they are speaking loudly and consistently over \n20, 25 years that term limits is something they want, we should heed \nthat call, and we should be voting on that, and we should enact it, \npassing it out of the House, passing it out of the Senate, and then \nsending it to the States for ratification. What a win-win it would be, \nboth for this institution, to show the American people we are \nlistening, and then, obviously, it would be a very positive reform to \nhave enacted.\n  I am really happy that, as new people come in, that they have the \nreformer's spirit. One of the guys who just got elected this last \nyear--it is pretty clear when people get up here whether they are in it \nfor the right reasons or not, and I think there are probably few people \nin the whole House who have been more dedicated to reform and making \nthis institution serve the American people rather than rule over the \nAmerican people. It is a great honor for me to be able to yield to my \nfriend from Iowa (Mr. Blum), the chairman of the House Term Limits \nCaucus.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida (Mr. \nDeSantis) for hosting this Special Order on term limits and giving me \nthe opportunity to speak on this most important subject.\n  Albert Einstein once said that the definition of insanity is doing \nthe same thing over and over and over again, yet expecting different \nresults. That quote sums up Washington, D.C. We keep sending the same \npeople back here over and over and over, yet we expect things will \nimprove; we expect things will change.\n  Congressional approval ratings, if you haven't checked, are in the \nsingle digits. It is clear that the American people aren't happy with \nthe job we are doing. They want change in Washington, D.C.\n  But, if we truly want to change Washington, we need to heed Albert \nEinstein's advice. We need to send different people here. We need to do \nthings differently.\n  Changing the way Congress operates should start with enacting term \nlimits. I firmly believe congressional term limits would restore the \npublic's confidence in the legislative branch and return this body back \nto the design intended by our Founding Fathers.\n  I have just been here, as my friend, Mr. DeSantis said, for over a \nyear, and I can confidently say that term limits for our politicians \nwould be a huge step forward in changing the culture here in \nWashington, D.C., and I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \nreform.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the first elected office I have ever held. I am \na career small-business person. In the private sector, if we don't \nlisten to our customers, we go out of business.\n  In Congress, our customers are the American people, and they are \nstrongly in favor of term limits. Recent polls show overwhelming \nsupport. Over 75 percent of Americans want term limits. This support, \nas Mr. DeSantis said, crosses party lines, with strong majorities from \nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents alike.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has not listened to our customers. \nLegislation to institute term limits continues to sit in committee, \nwithout receiving a vote. While many Members of Congress profess \nsupport for term limits back in their districts, when their plane \ncrosses the Potomac, something seems to change.\n  One of the first things I did after being sworn in was to launch the \nbipartisan Term Limits Caucus, along with my colleague from Texas (Mr. \nO'Rourke). I also cosponsored legislation from my colleagues, the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Salmon) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nDeSantis), limiting House Members to serving no more than three terms \nand\n\n[[Page H1547]]\n\nSenators to serving no more than two terms.\n\n  I did this because, as someone coming to Congress from the private \nsector, I believe Washington suffers from a lack of fresh, innovative \nideas. Also, Washington suffers from a lack of political courage on the \npart of career politicians to implement those changes.\n  The root of our problem is that our politicians are incentivized by \nthis system to care more about staying in office rather than doing what \nis best for the country.\n  Most candidates campaign for the U.S. House and they say something to \nthe effect, ``Washington, D.C., is broken. Washington, D.C., is broken. \nIt must change.'' They say this during the campaign. Most come here for \nthe right reasons, but, over time, the system grinds them down. The \nspecial interests get their proverbial ``nose under the tent,'' and \nbefore long, special interests own a Congressman.\n  It seems to me, the only special interest group not represented in \nWashington is ``We, the People.'' The end result is most become part of \nthe very problem they came to Washington, D.C., to fix.\n  Our Founding Fathers never intended for public service to be a \ncareer. Serving in Congress was supposed to be a temporary sacrifice \nmade for the public good, not a profitable, long-term profession \ntreated like a family business.\n  By limiting terms politicians can serve in office, we can realign the \nincentives. When Members of Congress know they will only serve for a \nshort amount of time, they will be incentivized to actually tackle the \nbig problems facing America today: tackling our $19 trillion debt that \nis growing, tackling the looming insolvency of Social Security and \nMedicare, and tackling the securing of our borders and the ever-growing \nFederal bureaucracy that stifles economic growth and holds down wages \nfor your average American.\n  Mr. DeSantis, I recognize the long odds of Congress voting to place \nterm limits on themselves. As I often say, that is much like asking \nturkeys to vote for Thanksgiving, and we know how that would end up. \nBut I will keep pushing Congress to act, because it is what the \nAmerican people want.\n  In the meantime, there are some positive active developments at the \nState level that I would like to highlight.\n  Florida recently became one of the first States to officially call \nfor an Article V constitutional term limits convention thanks to the \nhard work of Florida activists and fantastic groups like U.S. Term \nLimits. I commend the Florida Legislature and hope other States will \nsoon follow suit.\n  As President Reagan once said, a ``convention is a safety valve \ngiving the people a chance to act if Congress refuses to.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I am not here to criticize individual Members of \nCongress, and not all of my colleagues who have been in office for \ndecades are part of this problem; but it is time Congress listened to \nour customers and gives our customers what they want: a vote on term \nlimits. It is the right thing to do, and it may be our last and best \nchance to restore trust in government and make Congress work for the \nAmerican people once again.\n  Once again, I thank Mr. DeSantis for the opportunity to discuss this \nmost important subject. I urge my colleagues to listen to the American \npeople and join the Term Limits Caucus and cosponsor term limit \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Iowa.\n  The thing is that you bring up a good point. It is very difficult to \nget people to want to term-limit themselves. So you and I are on a bill \ntogether that tries to be reasonable about it and say: Look, you know, \nwe are willing to compromise to get term limits. You have Members who \nhave been here for 12, 14 years and they are trying to put themselves \nin a position for a chairmanship, whatever, and they joined under \ncertain rules, they kind of played the game, and they are preparing for \nmaybe this to be the pinnacle of their career. I get why someone in \nthat situation would not want to do it.\n  Our proposal says: Okay. Let's do term limits, but then we will phase \nit in as new Members come. So that is a kind of a gradual term limit \nenactment, and within a short while you would have term limits across \nthe board. I mean, that is something that is a reasonable compromise to \ndeal with some of the Members that have misgivings.\n  I think my friend from Iowa points out, I mean, if this were \nsomething that were to be done via Article V of the Constitution and \nsubmitted through the States around Congress, that would be enacted in \na New York minute. I mean, that will sail through every State \nlegislature without question, and you would end up having term limits.\n  So I think there are two different routes to take, but I think \nknowing that there is a desire for this, I think it would be good for \nthis institution to say: Okay. We hear you. Let's debate it; let's put \neveryone on record. Then the American people can hold people \naccountable accordingly.\n  That is really, I think, what is frustrating. It would be one thing \nif term limits just failed every year, but, really, it gets bottled up \nevery year because people don't want to be on record against term \nlimits. I think that those days need to be over.\n  I ask my friend from Iowa, as you go around your district--you have \nRepublicans, Democrats; you have a very politically diverse district--I \nmean, is there anybody who is out there saying don't do term limits?\n  Mr. BLUM. In 3 years of campaigning, I have not yet, Mr. DeSantis, \nmet one person in my district in northeast Iowa that is against term \nlimits. Everyone wants us to hold a vote on term limits.\n  And I consistently say this gets buried in committee because the \nworst nightmare of anybody in this body is to have to go on record as \nvoting against term limits because, as I said in my speech, they go \nback to their districts and they say they are for reforming Congress.\n  They are against the pension program. They are against first-class \nair travel. They are against $1,200-a-month luxury car leases. They are \nagainst becoming lobbyists when they retire from this body. They say \nthey are for term limits. Their plane crosses the Potomac. They get in \nthis body. They don't want to vote on those things because I think they \nare not really against them.\n  People are tired of that. They are seeing through it. They are \ndemanding that we have this vote. All we ask--all you are asking, all I \nam asking--is let's get this out of committee. Let's have a vote on \nthis floor and see what happens. It may fail, but at least we got the \nvote; at least the people in my district and in your district in \nFlorida were represented and had the chance to have a voice.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  I think this is an overwhelmingly bipartisan issue. I am Republican, \nand my district is Democratic. But Democrats want a vote on term limits \nas well.\n  I come from the private sector, Ron, and we listen to our customers. \nOur customers are the American voters, the American citizens.\n  We are not listening to them. We are ignoring them. I think we are \nseeing it now in this political season, that people are upset with what \ngoes on in Washington, D.C.\n  Our approval rating--and it has been well earned--is in the single \ndigits. I think it would go so far if we would just hold some votes and \ntry to reform this body because people often tell me: Before you tell \nme to reform the way my family spends their money, why don't you clean \nup your own House first? I couldn't agree with them more.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. I think that, if we were to approach it and say that we \nneed to do term limits, we have to make sure Congress lives under the \nsame rules, no special treatment under ObamaCare, none of that, let's \neliminate the pensions for Congress--and the thing is you brought up \npeople being lobbyists after they are in Congress.\n  If you did term limits, guess what. Then you are going to increase \nthe supply of former Members of Congress. So being a lobbyist wouldn't \nbe as lucrative because there would be a lot more people who are out \nthere.\n  I think actually more people would say: Maybe I will go back to my \nhome State and start working in business there and maybe have to come \nto terms\n\n[[Page H1548]]\n\nwith some of the laws that I imposed on the private sector and see how \nthat works.\n  So I think it would be good for the performance in office, but I also \nthink, as Members left office, it probably would drive more people to \nthe actual private sector rather than being inside the Beltway because \nyou will just have too many former Members and I don't think the pay \nwill be as lucrative.\n  Right now, I don't know if this is accurate, but I have seen \nstatistics where it is upwards of 80 percent of people who serve in the \nCongress go on to be lobbyists in Washington. So you understand the \nsystem, then you go out and are lobbying to grease the skids in that \nsystem. That is not the way I think that we want this system to be \noperating.\n  So let me ask you this: In terms of getting a vote, what do you think \nwe need to be doing to impress upon other colleagues so that we can \nstart to develop some momentum to try to get a vote on this?\n  Mr. BLUM. Some of them need to lose their reelection campaigns. I \nhave consistently said, Ron, that true change never comes from inside \nthe Beltway in Washington, D.C. It always comes from out in America.\n  What we need are grass-roots activists, people that follow what we \nare doing, to call, to email, and to text to let our Representatives \nknow that you want a vote on term limits.\n  As a Representative, and I am sure you would agree that those matter. \nWe listen. I listen. We track every phone call, and I get a report at \nthe end of the day saying:\n\n       Here is who called from your district, and here is what \n     they wanted.\n\n  So it makes a difference. Change never comes from in Washington, D.C.\n  I would also like to follow up on another point that you made \nearlier. It was a great point, and that is seniority.\n  I came here as a freshman 14 months ago and I quickly found out that \neverything in Congress is based on seniority. Not to take anything away \nfrom these fine people that have been here a long time, they have \nworked very hard, they have paid their dues, and it is nothing \npersonal, but people wonder why change can't happen in Washington, D.C.\n  It is because we have the same people running the show year in, year \nout, term in, term out, because it is based on seniority.\n  A young person like my--well, I shouldn't say young. A young \npolitician--I am 60 years old--doesn't really have a chance to impact \nchange much because the power structure is all based on seniority here.\n  I wish they would look at seniority out in the real world, in the \nprivate sector. What did you do to build a company? What did you do to \neducate children? What did you do in the medical community?\n  That seniority should count as well, just not your time spent in this \nbody. So that is a great point. That is why I think things don't \nchange. We need change. Change is good. We need new ideas and fresh \nideas and people with political courage.\n  Another thing that has been a little bit disappointing to me is the \nlack of political courage, to take a stand and to plant the flag even \nif it is going to be unpopular in the district. If you think it is the \nright thing to do, go for it. Have political courage.\n  People have said to me: How do we know you won't change if we send \nyou to Washington?\n  I have consistently said: Because I am not afraid to be unelected. I \nwant to be reelected. I will work hard. I will want to win a second \nterm. But I am not afraid to lose an election.\n  We need more people like that, Ron. We need people who don't want to \nstay here a lifetime and turn this, the United States Congress, into a \nfamily business.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. It is interesting with the seniority discussion. I was \nin the Navy. In the military, your time in service matters for pay \npurposes and other, but along the line you have to actually promote. \nYou have to earn a promotion.\n  So there will be some people who are commanders, O-5s, who have been \nin for--I don't know--I guess you could probably get that after 12 or \n13 years. And then there are some people who are lieutenant commanders, \nO-4, who have been in 20 years.\n  Well, if you have been in 20, you have more seniority in the sense \nthat you have been there longer, but the person who achieved the higher \nrank through merit is superior to you in the military chain of command. \nI think the problem with the way the congressional system operates is \nit is purely based on years staying here.\n\n  Some of the best Members who have ever served here have served for \n30, 35 years. So this is not uniform. But I think, if you compared the \ngood that those Members have done with the negatives of all the other \nfolks who have just made this their fiefdom, I think the negatives \noutweigh the positives.\n  I think that Congressman Blum is right. Ultimately, the American \npeople need to force this issue. Part of it is calling the offices. I \nreview the phone calls every day, too.\n  I think one of the most effective things is in a public forum to just \npointblank ask a Member of Congress if they will vote for Salmon's bill \nor Ron DeSantis' term limit bill and put them on the Record.\n  The more people that are on the Record as for it, it makes it easier \nfor us to then take the case to the leadership and say that we need to \ndo this.\n  I think it would be a breath of fresh air. I think people are so \nfrustrated and so sick of the same old games being played in Washington \nthat, if we started coming out with some of these reforms, leading with \nterm limits, I think people would be reading the newspaper and shaking \ntheir heads and saying: Really? These guys are finally getting it.\n  Really, this is something that, if you take the long view when you \nare doing the right thing like that, then voters will have more \nconfidence in your views on other things.\n  So maybe you are interested in tax reform. Maybe you are interested \nin welfare reform. Guess what. You are doing term limits. You are doing \nthose things. I bet you a lot of voters would be less cynical about \nwhat you are trying to do on a whole range of issues.\n  So I think it would be a win-win both in terms of structural reform, \nbut also potential policy reforms down the line.\n  Let me ask my friend from Iowa: Is there anything else you want to \nadd to the discussion? I really appreciate your time. I think it has \nbeen worthwhile. I think we need to keep fighting the good fight.\n  Mr. BLUM. I agree with you. We will always storm the hill, my good \nfriend, and plant that flag, regardless of how many times we need to do \nit.\n  But I would just like to mention some of the bills I have been \ninvolved with:\n  Eliminating first-class airline travel for congressional Members paid \nfor by taxpayers. Most of the people in my district have never flown in \nfirst class. There is no reason I should be flying first class on \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Eliminating the $1,200-a-month luxury car leases that we can lease \nback in our districts. That is more than most house payments in \nnortheast Iowa. It would eliminate that.\n  We need to eliminate the congressional pension program. We need to \neliminate the ability to become a lobbyist after you have served in \nthis body.\n  We need to tie our pay to the pay of the average American. The \naverage American has not had a pay raise in over 20 years. The average \nAmerican's pay has gone backwards.\n  This body's pay should go backwards just like the average American's. \nThe words used in polls is that we are out of touch. I wonder if this \nbody is not out of touch, if we are not tone deaf. We need to be tied \nto the average American.\n  I recently introduced a bill that, if we didn't balance the budget, \nthen we would get a pay cut; if it is not balanced next year, we get a \ndeeper pay cut; and if we keep not balancing it, we are going to end up \nmaking no money. Maybe this way it will get through everyone's head \nthat this is a serious issue and we need to balance the budget.\n  I agree with you, Ron, that any of these reforms voted on would go so \nfar, I think, to the American people to say:\n\n       Finally, finally, Washington, D.C. is listening to us. They \n     finally get it.\n\n  The frustration is palpable in my district. It probably is in yours. \nPeople are really upset. They say that they don't listen, the laws \ndon't apply to us like they do the rest of Americans.\n\n[[Page H1549]]\n\n  I couldn't agree more. As a citizen, I am every bit as frustrated as \nwell. So you can always count on me to storm the hill with you, my \nfriend.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. I appreciate it. In your bill, when you said, hey, \nbalance the budget or else face a pay cut, I signed up on that \nimmediately. I think that is a great idea.\n  We need to have personal skin in the game because what happens is, \nwhen you are here in Washington, particularly dealing with spending and \ndebt, it is a lot easier politically for most Members to just put it \noff on the next generation.\n  These are people that can't vote you out of office. They are not \ngoing to call your office and complain about it. So it is usually the \npath of least resistance to do that.\n  So there is not a lot of immediate skin in the game short of us \neventually having a debt crisis. Obviously, we don't want it to come to \nthat. We want to make responsible decisions now.\n  So I applaud you for that. I thought that was a very thoughtful \nreform. I am happy to be signed up with you. Term limits, as part of a \nlarger government reform package, I think would be a home run. I look \nforward to working with you on it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1549-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1549-H1550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ISSUES OF THE DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends, Congressman \nBlum and the future Senator DeSantis, for great words and great \ninsights.\n  Mr. Speaker, I first want to answer a couple of questions that people \nhave had about a couple of votes that my friends, Justin Amash and \nThomas Massie, and I had.\n  One is on H.R. 4742. It is described to authorize the National \nScience Foundation to support entrepreneurial programs for women.\n  Since my wife and I have been blessed with three beautiful daughters, \ninside and out, all three of them absolutely brilliant--these type of \nthings are important to me--but I note that it says, ``studies have \nshown that technology and commercialization ventures are successful \nwhen women are in top management positions.''\n  It also puts into law that the requirement that, under the Science \nand Engineering Equal Opportunities Act, it is required that the \nNational Science Foundation encourage its entrepreneurial programs to \nrecruit and support women to extend their focus beyond the laboratory \nand into the commercial world.\n  Now, it just seems like--and I know these are incredibly well \nintended. Both H.R. 4742 and H.R. 4745 are very, very well intended. \nWonderful people put them forward. I understand that.\n  But just from my experience and from the common sense I hear as I get \nall over east Texas, it just seems like Washington is always a step \nbehind or--an old saying--a day late and a dollar short.\n  Now we are $19 trillion short. But we want to take time from our $19 \ntrillion in debt to demand that the National Science Foundation \ndiscriminate based on gender.\n  There may be some young boy who needs encouragement from a tough \nfamily situation, but this program is designed to discriminate against \nthat young, poverty-stricken boy and to encourage the girl. Forget the \nboy. Encourage the girl.\n  It just seems that, if we are ever going to get to the dream of \nMartin Luther King, Jr., that he spoke just down the Mall, he wanted \npeople to be judged by the content of their character and not by the \ncolor of their skin.\n  I know after race has been an issue that needed attention, then \ngender appropriately got attention, because the whole Constitution of \nthe United States, when it is properly read verbatim, means men, women, \nrace, creed, color, national origin, and gender.\n  Those things are not supposed to matter. It just seems like, when we \ncome in and we say that it is important that for a while we \ndiscriminate, we end up getting behind.\n  And then probably 25 years from now boys are going to have fallen \nbehind in numbers, and then we are going to need to come in and say: \nActually, when we passed that bill forcing encouragement of girls and \nnot encouraging of little boys, we were getting behind the eight ball. \nWe didn't see that we were going to be leaving little boys in the \nditch, and now we need to start doing programs to encourage little \nboys.\n  We are always going to be behind until we get around to saying from \nthis House floor that we don't care where you are from, we don't care \nwhat your gender is, and we don't care what you like look. You may be \nas homely as Abraham Lincoln. We don't care what you look like.\n  We don't care about the color of your hair or the lack of hair. We \ndon't care. We want you not to have an equal outcome, but to have an \nequal opportunity to excel, and then let the best person do the best \njob and excel. That is what has made free market systems work so well.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  I was reminded to check out a lady that is known as Madame Curie, \nMarie Sklowdowska Curie, Madame Curie. It says she was born in Warsaw, \nthen the Kingdom of Poland.\n  Her achievements included the development of the theory of \nradioactive isotopes and the discovery of two elements: polonium and \nradium. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted \ninto the treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotopes; she \nfounded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw; and she won the \nNobel Peace Prize for her work in radiation.\n  So as I think about it, it has got to be millions and millions of \nlives that this brilliant woman, Madame Curie, has saved because of her \nwork. She died early at 66 because of her work in the laboratory--she \nhad aplastic anemia, apparently from her work with radioactive \nisotopes--but the lives that woman saved by her work in the laboratory.\n  However, if our bill, H.R. 4742, had been in law back in Poland or \nFrance as she tried to move forward, the Science Foundation there would \nhave been required to tell Madame Curie: Do you know what? You are \npretty good in the laboratory, but under this law from the wisdom of \nCongress, we are supposed to tell you to go into commercial enterprise \nand make a whole bunch more money because you are better off not being \nin the laboratory but being out in the commercial world because you \nwill be a better businessperson than men. You need to get out there.\n  I thank God that there wasn't a program like this that distracted \nher. This brilliant, caring woman basically gave her life to save many, \nmany millions by the phenomenal work she did in the laboratory.\n  But according to the bill that we passed today, we are requiring the \nScience Foundation to encourage entrepreneurial programs to recruit and \nsupport women to extend their focus beyond the laboratory and into the \ncommercial world. Thank God that is not what Madame Curie did.\n  We did have another bill. Part of the program is good for boys and \ngirls, but then there is a part, Aspire to Inspire, that engages young \ngirls to present science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \ncareer opportunities, et cetera.\n  And on the next one, provide an opportunity for female middle school \nstudents. We don't want to provide an opportunity under this bill for \nboys. Let the boys fight, let them get into gangs; but the women, the \nyoung girls, that is who we want to encourage.\n  In section 3, NASA shall--not just may, but shall--encourage women \nand girls to study science, technology, and engineering.\n  I was inspired in a little town in Mount Pleasant, Texas, growing up \nby people who encouraged boys and girls equally. We had some very, very \nsmart girls and we had some smart guys. Our teachers really didn't care \nwhether we were boys or girls. They wanted us to work hard and they \nwanted us to excel. They were incredibly good teachers, and I learned \nso much. I learned so much in math that in college algebra at Texas \nA, I didn't have to open my book but for 15 minutes for the final. \nThat is all I had to do for the\n\n[[Page H1550]]\n\nwhole semester because of the incredible bases I got in math from my \nseventh grade teacher, Ms. Edwards, and my high school math teachers \nwere terrific.\n  But, anyway, I hope that we can get beyond pandering and try to get \nto the point where we, as a Congress, will say: We don't care what you \nlook like. The things you can't help, how you look, your gender, we \ndon't care about those. We want you to have an equal opportunity with \neverybody else.\n  I hope and pray that is the direction we go.\n  I also hope and pray that those who are suffering in Europe, in \nBrussels, after the horrendous attacks by radical Islamists, will be \ncomforted by friends and by God himself. For those who have lost loved \nones, we need to reach out to the families and be for them, with them, \nand encourage them. But the best legacy we could provide would be to \nstop the insane efforts to win over radical Islamists by trying to be \nthis phenomenal friend to them.\n  An article today by Greg Botelho from CNN says, and these are the \nhighlights: ``A U.S. official speculates ISIS is `trying to make an \ninternational statement' by attacking the home of NATO, the EU.''\n  He also points out: ``Two explosions rock the Brussels airport, \nanother rips through a subway station in the Belgian capital.''\n  This article from CNN, unfortunately, says: ``While jarring, the \ncarnage wasn't altogether surprising. Belgium has been going after \nterrorist threats for months, as illustrated by last week's capture of \nEurope's most wanted man, Salah Abdeslam, in a bloody raid in \nBrussels.''\n  Apparently if you stand up against radical Islam to stop these people \nwho would take us back to the Dark Ages of despotism, book burning, and \nhorrors of basic slavery if you don't believe as you are told, we will \nbe better off if we can be nice to them.\n  We have an administration that said Iran is the biggest supporter of \nterrorism in the world, so we think maybe if we cut a deal where we \nrelease to them $100 billion to $150 billion, that they will surely \nstart being nice to us.\n  And those Castros, Fidel and Raul Castro, down in Cuba, they have \nbeen dictators. They have tortured, they have been horrendous in the \nharm that they have brought to the people of Cuba.\n  How do we know, even though people like Sean Penn and others have \ntold us how wonderful it is, they have the best health care in the \nworld?\n  Well, it turns out, actually, they are really wanting to get to the \nUnited States. It turns out they are wanting to come in droves to the \nUnited States because it is not so good living under a dictator like \nthe Castros.\n  What the President has done, unknowingly, is put his stamp of \napproval on a dictatorship that has been incredibly brutal, just as \nthis administration did to the terrorists in charge in Iran. People \nwill further suffer, just as they have in the last few days while \nthe President visited Cuba.\n\n  The administration in charge in Cuba, the dictators, were brutalizing \npeople who had the gall to come out and want to act as if they had \nfreedom of speech and freedom of assembly. One poor woman was beaten, \nstripped naked, and dragged off to jail. Apparently that is okay under \nthe new approach of the U.S. administration if we are trying to \noutreach to them and they are wanting our outreach to go better.\n  The fact is it is one thing to have relations commercially with \nanother country, but when we, as the United States, the freest country \nthat has ever existed until we began to lose our freedoms here more \nrecently, when we yield to dictators, to terrorist leaders like in \nIran, the world suffers. We have been given a massive responsibility by \nbeing the freest and, up until recently, possibly the most powerful \ncountry in the world.\n  China has come on strong. Others have nuclear weapons that will use \nthem and want to use them. Our position is in jeopardy. To whom much is \ngiven of them, much will be required. We should be more faithful so \nthat when a country like Nigeria begs help to deal with radical Islam \nand Boko Haram, we should not have to hear from a Catholic bishop in \nNigeria that the Obama administration is demanding that they change \ntheir laws to embrace same-sex marriage against their religious \nbeliefs, appropriate for abortion even when it violates their religious \nbeliefs, chide the leader of Kenya or other countries to give up their \nreligious beliefs, and follow the amoral teaching of whoever happens to \nbe in charge in America.\n  There are consequences for using the power of the United States to \nbully other countries and to allow them to suffer immeasurably while we \nact haute as if, because of their Christian beliefs, they are not as \nworthy as those in the United States that do not follow Christian \nbeliefs.\n  More Christians are suffering and being persecuted, but Jesus said: \nYou will suffer for my sake.\n  As we see also in Israel in the latest attack there, people are \nsuffering and being killed. FOX News had this article regarding the \nPeninsula Group based in Tel Aviv. There is massive suffering at the \nhands of radical Islam.\n  As Europe suffers dreadfully at the hands of radical Islam and at the \nhands of people who have poured into their countries illegally due to \ntheir naive but permissive policies, the last thing they need to hear \nis from the United States President that they need to be careful, not \nto be biased or prejudiced against the radical Islamists that want to \nkill them and have killed their family members, because according to \nthis administration, the far bigger danger is bias against those who \nwant to kill us and eliminate our civilized way of life. God help us \nall.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/22/house-section/article/H1550-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Donald M.
