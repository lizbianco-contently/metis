The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, I introduced the Information \nTechnology Modernization Act, a bill that will make our government more \ntransparent, more efficient, more responsive, and more secure.\n  Dangerously, many Federal Government agencies, as we have seen, rely \non technology systems that are decades old and hinder digital \ninteragency collaboration. As a result, government services are less \nefficient than they could be, and Americans' personal data is put at \nhigher risk every year that goes by without critical system upgrades. \nThis was the experience for almost 2 million employees of our Federal \nGovernment.\n  I am partnering with the White House and U.S. Chief Information \nOfficer Tony Scott to propose a new way to invest in upgrading the \ngovernment technology infrastructure that serves the American people \nand this institution.\n  My bill authorizes a one-time investment of $3 billion into a \nrevolving fund that will be overseen by an independent review board. \nThe fund will invest in large-scale, rapid systems upgrades deemed to \nbe in the greatest need and that would provide the greatest impact on \nserving the American people.\n  Once an upgrade is completed, the receiving agency will then begin \npaying back the fund over time, using the savings achieved from greater \nefficiency. In such a way, this one-time investment of $3 billion will \nsupport at least a minimum of $12 billion--that is 400 percent more--\nworth of upgrades in the first 10 years alone, after which it would \ncontinue to fund upgrades into the future.\n  This is a novel approach for government, though it has been employed \nsuccessfully in the private sector, where it has a proven track record. \nTony Scott himself, Mr. Speaker, implemented a similar program when he \nwas the chief information officer at Microsoft, which was successful \nand resulted in significant long-term savings.\n  Additionally, the fund will ensure that upgrades make use of the \nlatest and best practices from Silicon Valley, including shared \nservices, cloud hosting, and agile development. This will enable \nagencies to create new user-friendly apps and services, and facilitate \nthe sharing of data between agencies to root out fraud and waste. It \nwill promote the use of systems that are secure and prevent \ncyberattacks.\n  My bill will also ensure transparency by requiring all upgrade \nprojects to provide regular status updates on a publicly available \ndigital dashboard.\n  I want to thank all those who signed on as original sponsors, Mr. \nSpeaker, and I want to say that I had discussions last night with Mr. \nIssa, the former chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee. I think he is going to cosponsor this bill with me, and we \nwant to see this bill be a bipartisan bill.\n  I have also talked to ranking members on my side of the aisle in each \nof the relevant committees: Mr. Cummings, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Serrano, Mr. \nConnolly, Ms. Duckworth, Ms. Robin Kelly, and Mr. Ted Lieu, all of whom \nare excited to support this piece of legislation.\n  Again, this is a totally nonpartisan bill looking for government \nefficiency and safety and transparency for the American people. I hope \nthat my friends on both sides of the aisle who care deeply about making \ngovernment as effective and transparent as possible, as well as \neliminating fraud and inefficiencies, will partner with us by \ncosponsoring this bill and helping to bring it to the floor as a \nbipartisan measure overwhelmingly supported by this House.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan work we have done together already to \nencourage innovation in the use of technology in Congress, particularly \nthe hackathons I have hosted with Leader McCarthy and his predecessor, \nMr. Cantor.\n  Let's work together. Let me say that again. Let's work together to \nexpand that effort to the executive branch and make sure that the \nFederal Government can and is serving the American people effectively \nand transparently.\n\n[[Page H1640]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1640-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING FLORIDA HEROINES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the many generations \nof women who have shaped our Nation and thank them for their invaluable \ncontributions.\n  As the first Hispanic woman elected to Congress, I am grateful and \ninspired by their legacy. These women have influenced public policies, \nbuilt institutions, and contributed to a stronger economy. Without \ntheir contributions, our society would be less lively, our culture more \nimpoverished, and peace would be less stable. We need to respect their \ngreat achievements by continuing the job.\n  I share the hopes and aspirations of all women across America who \nwish to make the lives of our daughters, sisters, aunts, and mothers \nmore equitable. I have always been committed and dedicated to advancing \nthe role of women in our society, and I work toward policies that would \nassist them and their families. That is why I have joined the \nbipartisan Congressional Women's Caucus and have supported extensive \nlegislation and programs fighting domestic violence and women's access \nto a quality education.\n  Today I would like to pay tribute to some of the more energetic \nchampions of women's rights from my area of south Florida: Roxcy O'Neal \nBolton, Helen Aguirre Ferre, Julia Tuttle, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, \nand Judge Bertila Soto.\n  Roxcy Bolton has had an impressive career by advocating for equal \nrights in the workplace and also by creating the first rape treatment \ncenter in the country, located in my hometown of Miami. She also \nfounded Women in Distress, the first women's rescue center in Florida. \nRoxcy has received numerous accolades and is an iconic and loved figure \nin our community.\n  Congratulations, Roxcy.\n  Helen Aguirre Ferre is another pioneer. She is an award-winning \njournalist and communications consultant who was recently inducted into \nthe Florida Women's Hall of Fame. As the chair of the Board of Trustees \nof Miami Dade College--my alma mater--Helen is committed to promoting \neducation and establishing policies that would help students across our \ncommunity.\n  Congratulations, Helen.\n  Julia Tuttle, known as the mother of Miami, made history as the only \nfemale founder of a major U.S. city when she helped establish the city \nof Miami many years ago. Julia's vision and perseverance have long been \ntraits that south Floridians have worked to carry on since the founding \nof our great city of Miami.\n  Tuttle's mantel of leadership is heavy, but it has been carried on by \nso many others.\n  Marjory Stoneman Douglas made another kind of south Florida history \nwhen she worked tirelessly to save her beloved Everglades. Her iconic \nbook, ``The Everglades: River of Grass,'' helped awaken so many to the \nneed of preserving this one-of-a-kind ecological wonder and led the \nfight to establish the Everglades National Park.\n  Judge Bertila Soto is a modern-day heroine. She is a fellow graduate \nof my alma maters, Florida International University and the University \nof Miami. She was named chief judge of Florida's 11th Judicial Circuit.\n  Bertila is both the first Cuban American and the first woman to helm \nthe largest judicial circuit in the State. Her energy and understanding \nof complex legal issues have driven her to success. Every day that \nJudge Soto is hard at work, she is not only living, but making south \nFlorida history.\n  Congratulations to Bertila.\n  I also want to honor our female pilots of World War II, the Women \nAirforce Service Pilots, also known as the WASPS. They were responsible \nfor removing the barriers for women in the military today. And I know \nthis because my daughter-in-law, Lindsay, was afforded the opportunity \nto join the Marine Corps and fly combat missions both in Iraq and \nAfghanistan thanks to these women pioneers.\n  South Florida has been home to some of these remarkable heroines like \nRuth Shafer Fleisher, Shirley Kruse, and Bee Haydu, as well as Frances \nRohrer Sargent and Helen Wyatt Snapp, who have passed away.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to recognize all of these outstanding \nwomen, past and present. May these role models continue to remind girls \nand young women that nothing can hold them back from realizing their \ndreams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1640-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1640-H1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEROIN AND OPIOID OVERDOSES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, the chart that is being set up next to me \nhere depicts graphically one of the most sickening trends in terms of \nan increasing cause of death in the United States, which is heroin and \nopioid overdoses.\n  On the top, the map shows data from 2004 from the Centers for Disease \nControl, when 7,500 Americans lost their lives to overdose deaths. In \n2014, that number has grown to 27,000.\n  The red shaded area is high-intensity areas of death of up to 20 per \n100,000 in the population. The blue is 10 or less. And in 2014, as you \ncan see, the red is slowly but inexorably taking over the entire \ncountry.\n  This is a crisis which, again, affects every part of our country, \nwhether it is rural, suburban, or urban. It affects Republican \ndistricts. It affects Democratic districts. And it is time for our \nNation to recognize that this needs to be treated the same way we would \nany natural disaster or public health emergency in the country.\n  In 2016, we know these numbers are, in fact, going to get worse.\n  The Office of Chief Medical Examiner in the State of Connecticut \nreleased their 2015 numbers a few weeks ago, and the number grew in the \nState of Connecticut by 20 percent, to 723 deaths in 2015.\n  Just this morning in the local press in southeastern Connecticut, a \n25-year-old was found dead in a motor vehicle on Route 12 outside the \nGroton Navy Base, and a young man, an 18-year-old, was found dead in \nNorwich just a couple of days ago.\n  It is time for us to listen to the folks who are on the front lines--\nthe police officers, the addiction counselors, and the folks that are \ndealing with this program bringing people to life with Narcan--and \nunderstand that we need a new approach to solving this incredibly \ndangerous crisis for our Nation.\n  The good news is that the Senate, a couple of weeks ago, passed the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act 94-1. It is a good bill. It \nmakes some smart changes in terms of the overprescribing of \npainkillers. It deals with the disposal of the proliferation of \npainkillers that is far too great in the Nation today. It also talks \nabout changing protocols in the FDA, HHS, DOD, VA, all of the agencies \nof the Federal Government that deal with folks suffering from pain. \nUnfortunately, though, the bill does not contain a single penny of \nemergency assistance which the police departments across the country, \nthe addiction counselors across the country are begging for.\n  In the House, there is a bill, H.R. 4473, which does provide \nemergency supplemental appropriations this year to try and get \nresources so that folks who are dealing with this crisis and families \nthat are dealing with this crisis are actually going to get real help. \nAnd this bill has been endorsed by 21 organizations, from the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the police and the cops and the firefighters who are \nout there saving people's lives right now with Narcan, and also the \naddiction counselors who, again, do not have adequate detox facilities \nand beds to deal with the carnage that is happening all across this \ncountry.\n  The Republican majority leader announced last week that in May, the \nHouse will take up the Senate bill. I wish it was this month. I wish we \ncould move with the urgency of a natural disaster like a fire or \nhurricane or tornado striking parts of our country that causes \ndevastation much less than what these maps depict. However, the fact \nthat there is going to be some movement is some sign of hope.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  But it is important to remember it is not enough to just pass \nauthorizing language that is about trying to change policy without \nfunding, because the folks who are dealing with this problem, who are \nwatching us like a\n\n[[Page H1641]]\n\nhawk because they are dealing with this problem, like that young man \nwho was found dead last night, understand that resources are needed, \njust like in any other natural disaster or public health emergency \nfacing this country.\n  Again, we need to turn this map around. We need to change this so \nthat, again, the devastation that is being caused in families of middle \nclass, upper class, lower income families across the country is going \nto stop.\n  There are real-life solutions that the folks who are at the front \nlines are prepared to move forward. They are on standby. What they are \nwaiting for is this Congress to move forward with the real resources \nthat we would deal with as a great Nation in terms of any other \nepidemic or any other massive public health or health emergency in this \nNation.\n  We need to include H.R. 4473. We need to listen to the 21 \norganizations that deal with this problem all across America so that we \nget real help out on the streets of America and not just give lip \nservice to solving this critical problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1641-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING THE MEMORY OF CAPTAIN JAMES T. DEAN, JR.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory \nof Captain James T. Dean, Jr., an Army veteran from the Vietnam war.\n  Jim was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1944. In 1962, he joined the \nArmy and graduated from Officer Candidate School at Fort Sill, \nOklahoma. He served in Korea with a Sergeant missile unit before being \ndeployed to a beautiful place during an ugly time. He served in Vietnam \nfrom January 1968 to September 1969, serving with the 2nd Battalion, \n40th Field Artillery, of the 199th Light Infantry Brigade.\n  A proud redleg, Jim received the Bronze Star with ``V'' device for \nheroism in ground combat, the Bronze Star with two oak leaf clusters \nfor meritorious achievement in ground operations against hostile \nforces, the Purple Heart for wounds received in action, along with \nnumerous other awards and decorations for his service.\n  Following his service, Jim and his wife, Carla, moved to Naples, \nFlorida, where he started several businesses before returning to his \ntrue passion, horticulture.\n  Jim worked for the city of Naples as the assistant parks and parkway \nsupervisor. He was proud to have played a significant role in the \nNaples-scape project to beautify the city.\n  He was a civic leader, serving on the board of the Greater Naples \nBetter Government Committee as well as the Marco Island Kiwanis. He was \nan ordained elder within the Presbyterian Church, and he and Carla were \nmembers of the Collier County Republican Executive Committee.\n  Jim also battled bladder cancer and, with Carla and other friends, \nformed the Bladder Cancer Foundation of Florida to raise awareness.\n  Sadly, Jim succumbed to bladder cancer and passed away last month, on \nMarch 23. His name will not appear on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial \nwall; however, make no mistake about it, like too many other survivors, \nJim was a casualty of the war due to his exposure to Agent Orange.\n  Recently, the National Institute of Medicine forwarded to the VA that \n``there is limited or suggestive evidence of an association between \nchemicals of interest and bladder cancer.''\n  Adding bladder cancer to the list of medical conditions that qualify \nveterans for a presumption of exposure to Agent Orange would allow \nveterans easier access to critical healthcare benefits.\n  Unfortunately, it is too late for Jim, but many Vietnam veterans \ncontinue to suffer from this disease. I call on VA Secretary McDonald \nto approve this designation so our Vietnam war veterans can receive the \nhelp that they have so solemnly earned.\n  I know I speak on behalf of the entire Congress and a grateful Nation \nto express our deepest condolences to his widow, Carla; daughter, \nMichelle; and his many friends and loved ones. I pray for God's mercies \nupon them as they cope with their pain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1641-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              BUDGET CUTS AT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this week in 2 days is April 15, the day \nthat our income taxes are due. We have seen that day difficult enough \nunder the best of circumstances, be made even more difficult, \npurposely, for millions of Americans. My Republican friends have \ndecided to take out their differences with the IRS, their opposition to \ntaxation, by deliberately torturing the American taxpayer.\n  Ours is the largest tax system in the world that relies primarily on \nvolunteer compliance. Each 1 percent where people decide not to comply \ncosts the Treasury $30 billion. Now, most, in fact, do comply, but an \never-increasingly complex tax system makes compliance difficult.\n  It should be noted that it is not the IRS that makes the Tax Code \ncomplicated; it is Congress that is constantly changing that Code. \nSometimes it is so late in meeting its obligations with tax changes \nthat the Service doesn't even have time to print the forms on time.\n  In order to help citizens with Congress' complex tax system, the \nInternal Revenue Service runs the largest consumer service operation in \nthe world. Last year, it was a disaster. Well, this process has been \ndeliberately sabotaged by the Republican approach to the agency budget. \nIt has 30,000 fewer employees than it had in 1992, down 13,000 from \n2010, despite the fact that the Code gets more complex and there are \nmore people filing returns every year.\n  Congress should have been a constructive partner in streamlining, \nmodernization, with new computers, but the IRS budget prevents it from \nmodernizing information technology. It still uses applications that \nwere running in the early 1960s. And you cannot completely computerize \nthe simple task of answering phone calls and talking to taxpayers.\n  When you visit the IRS offices, as I have, you find employees who are \nsad and angry that they are unable to meet the needs of the taxpayers. \nThey don't like getting somebody who has been on hold for 20 or 30 \nminutes and then not having the time to work with them to answer their \nquestions. It frustrates the taxpayer, and it breaks the heart of our \nemployees.\n  Now, it is no secret that some people forget or cheat on their taxes, \nbut Congress has not equipped the IRS to do the audits necessary to \nactually collect the money that is due. This year, when we have a big \ndeficit, there will be $300 to $400 billion of taxes that are due and \nowing but won't be paid. Yet Congress is deliberately trying to make it \nworse. They have 12,000 fewer enforcement staff, a reduction of 23 \npercent, and I am going back to a Ways and Means Committee where one of \nthe proposals would cut that budget another $500 million. It is not \nfair to the taxpayer, it is not fair to our employees, and it makes it \nhard to fund the needs of our Nation.\n  People talk around here about running government like a business. \nWhat business undercuts, underfunds, and slashes its accounts \nreceivable department? They may think it is good politics to make the \ntaxpayer experience as miserable as possible, but it is ultimately bad \njudgment, poor politics, and a disservice to the American people as we \nundercut the ability to fund essential government services.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have been looking for scandal within \nthe IRS. Whatever problems they uncover or imagine, the real scandal is \nhow they are treating the American public and the people who work for \nthem at the vital service of the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1641-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1641-H1642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). The Chair \nrecognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 195th \nanniversary of Greek independence.\n  Citizens of Greece have always been a proud people in body, mind, and \nspirit. From Pericles, Greek statesman and general, dubbed ``the first \ncitizen of\n\n[[Page H1642]]\n\nAthens''; to Plato, who laid a groundwork in philosophy so vast that \nthe entirety of European philosophical tradition is said to simply be a \nfootnote to his work; to Count Ioannis Kapodistrias, the first head of \nstate of an independent Greece, Greeks have been exceptional and \ncontinue to be exceptional, Mr. Speaker.\n  I am almost certain that Thomas Jefferson cast an eye across the \nAtlantic towards Greece when he uttered these words in 1821: ``The \nflames kindled on the Fourth of July 1776 have spread over too much of \nthe globe to be extinguished by the feeble engines of despotism. On the \ncontrary, they will consume these engines and all who work them.''\n  I am blessed to be of two cultures, Mr. Speaker, that have been \nbeacons of liberty for all of civilization: the place of my birth, the \nland of the free and the home of the brave, the United States of \nAmerica; and the land of my ancestors, the birthplace of democracy, the \nHellenic Republic.\n  Many Greeks fought for years, holding on to their heritage, their \nculture, their faith. Bishop Germanos of Patras raised the emblem of \nfreedom for Hellenes, the flag bearing a white cross and nine blue and \nwhite stripes representing the nine letters, ``Eleftheria,'' which \nmeans freedom.\n  Eight years of bloodshed and battle led to the Treaty of Adrianople, \nthe formal declaration of a free and independent Greece.\n  Greece was the world's first advanced civilization, one that provided \na cultural heritage that has influenced the world. Firsts in \nphilosophy, mathematics, politics, sports, and art all stemmed from a \nfree Greece.\n  Liberty and justice, freedom to determine the path of one's own life, \nthese are human desires and were embodied by Greece throughout their \nfight for independence. Those unyielding Hellenes paid life and limb \nfor those desires, and generations of Greeks for decades to come owe \ntheir ancestors thanks.\n  As George Washington once said: ``Liberty, when it begins to take \nroot, is a plant of rapid growth.'' This held true in Greece in 1821, \nas it did in America in 1776.\n  ``Freedom or Death,'' Eleftheria i thanatos, was the battle cry of \nthe revolutionaries nearly 200 years ago. It rings true today.\n  Freedom is a powerful and beautiful notion. The Greek people achieved \nthat for themselves 195 years ago, and I am proud to celebrate in \nmemory of those who fought bravely to shed the shackles of the Ottoman \nEmpire.\n  Greece has its own unique challenges today but, also, a history of \nresilience and ability to climb its way out of turmoil. As centuries-\nlong allies, we must continue to creatively come up with solutions to \nhelp Greece control the flow of refugees arriving on its shores.\n  I am encouraged by the growing cooperation and collaboration that our \nclosest allies in the Eastern Mediterranean are proving this year. The \ntrilateral agreements between Greece, Cyprus, and Israel are a \nrefreshing reminder that we stand united with our allies in the fight \nfor security, stability, and prosperity in a volatile region.\n  We celebrate Greek independence to reaffirm the common democratic \nheritage we share, and, as Americans, we must continue to pursue this \nspirit of freedom and liberty which characterizes both of our great \nnations.\n  Zito I Ellas.

But, before that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to just very \nbriefly reflect on a trip I just took to visit with our troops in the \nMiddle East, in Iraq and elsewhere.\n  I have been to Iraq about 10 times. I think one of the fundamental \nresponsibilities we have, as Members of Congress on both sides of the \naisle, is not just to talk about supporting our troops, but to go into \nthe theater, visit with them, and learn firsthand the challenges they \nface.\n  Every time I visit with our troops, when I come back, I think the \nsame thing: that we are so blessed to live in a country that gives us \nthe right to agree with the decision to put people in harm's way, we \nhave the right to disagree with that decision, and we have the right to \nremain silent, but no American has the right to forget even for a day \nthe sacrifices that those men and women are making for us every single \nday.\n  We owe them our support and our awareness for the work that they do \nand, more importantly, supporting their families who are here and \nsupporting our troops when they return as veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, Friday, April 15, is a day of two deadlines. That is the \ndeadline most Americans know by which they must pay their Federal \nincome taxes. Everybody understands that deadline, and Americans don't \nhave a choice but to comply with that deadline.\n  The other deadline is that that is the day by which Congress must \npass a budget, and it is up to the Republican majority to produce that \nbudget and bring that budget to the floor for a vote.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican majority will miss that deadline and \nfail the American people in our fundamental responsibility to earn our \npay by passing budgets.\n  That is what we are put here to do: to debate priorities and pass \nbudgets; yet, this deadline will be missed. Failing to pass a budget by \nthe deadline is a fundamental failure to the American people.\n  I will say, however, that, in this case, a missed budget may be a \nlittle better than the bad budget that Republicans have originally \nproposed. It is a budget that fundamentally fails the middle class.\n  It is a budget, as proposed, that gets rid of the Medicare guarantee. \nIt is a budget, as proposed, that slashes $6.5 trillion in \nfundamentally important priorities to the middle class in making sure \nthat their kids are well educated, making sure that we are rebuilding \nAmerica with infrastructure and trying to reduce traffic jams, \nrebuilding our bridges and our tunnels, and modernizing our airports. \nIt is a budget that undermines the middle class. It is a budget that \nfails the middle class.\n  Now, I understand the need for us to reduce spending, and I have \nsupported significant reductions in spending in my time in Congress.\n  But what this budget does is it takes away from the middle class in \norder to further enrich the most powerful: the special interests.\n  That is why people are so angry out there. They understand that \nWashington has to do more with less, but not give more to people who \nalready have the most.\n  That is what the Republican budget does. That is the architecture of \nspending tax dollars that must be paid by April 15.\n  You take away from the middle class and you give more to people who \nare doing pretty well already, people who are doing so well that they \ncan hire all sorts of friends to do their work here in Washington and \nmaybe even contribute to some super-PACs. I think that is wrong.\n  People are angry because not only are our priorities wrong, but they \nsee very little evidence of a Congress, under Republican leadership in \nthe Senate and the House, that is doing its job.\n  They are angry because the Republican Senate won't even debate and \nvote on a Supreme Court nomination. You can vote for it. You can vote \nagainst it. They won't even vote on that nomination.\n  That is a failure to do the job that they are paid to do. They are \nangry because the majority here in the House of Representatives won't \ndo their job and pass a budget.\n  As I said before, Mr. Speaker, maybe no budget is better than a bad \nbudget, but both represent failure for the American people.\n  The Pew Research Center did a study just several weeks ago that said \nthat, for the first time since the Depression, to be in the middle \nclass in America is to be in the minority. About 49 percent of \nAmericans are in the middle class. The rest are either richer or \npoorer.\n  An economy grows best when the middle class is strongest. We need to\n\n[[Page H1643]]\n\nfulfill our responsibility to that middle class by doing what they will \npay us to do on April 15: just do our jobs and pass a budget that \ninvests in their growth, in their families, in their children, and, as \nI opened, invests in our troops, our national security, and makes sure \nthat every veteran in America is taken care of. Those are the \npriorities we have in our budgets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1643-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Those who participate must commit to changing a nutritional \nbehavior over the course of 1 month.\n  This year, the Bald Eagle Area School District, my alma mater, won \n$500 through the competition. District officials say families \nparticipating in the challenge cut soda from their diets and increased \nconsumption of water, while others packed salad for lunch instead of \nopting for fast food.\n  I commend the students, the staff, and residents of all Centre \nCounty's school districts for participating in this unique challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1643-9", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE MEMORY OF BILL ROSENDAHL\n\n  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. HAHN.

I remember how brave he was in the face of \nadversity. He became a fearless supporter of the Los Angeles LGBT \ncommunity, and he left behind a legacy of fighting for HIV and AIDS \nresearch and an end to discrimination.\n  Bill was one of the most selfless and kindhearted individuals I have \never known. That heart made him an incredible advocate and a beloved \nchampion for the people he represented.\n  I visited Bill recently in hospice and had a chance to hold his hand \nand tell him stories about when we served together on the city council \nin Los Angeles.\n  I will never forget his joyfulness, his gregarious laugh that never \nfailed to put a smile on my face.

It \nis from all of these perspectives that I am deeply disturbed by recent \ntests in Galesburg, Illinois, that show a high contamination of lead. \nEven more alarming is that 5 percent of our children tested have \nelevated levels in their small bodies.\n  If this happened to one of my kids, I can tell you I would ask for \nimmediate answers and immediate action; and these families and these \nchildren deserve no less.\n  Last Friday, I met with Galesburg city officials, and I urged them to \napply for the low-interest Federal loans to replace the lead pipes that \ngo to 4,700 homes in Galesburg. In addition to that, I support \nlegislation that would call for improved reporting, testing, and \nmonitoring of lead levels.\n  As a Congresswoman, as a mom, as a grandma, I say to all responsible \nhere: It is time. It is past time. No more excuses. No more delays.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nrecognize Veterans Legal Institute, an organization that resides right \nin the middle of my district serving our veterans in Orange County, \nCalifornia, since 2014.\n  It is a nonprofit organization and provides pro bono legal assistance \nto our veterans on a myriad of issues, for example, on some of the \neducation issues going on using their GI Bill and housing--because we \nhave so many of our veterans, as you know, that are homeless--with \nrespect to health care, getting into those VA hospitals and to the \nagencies, and, of course, with respect to employment.\n  The organization's ongoing efforts have become an important factor in \nhelping us to bring veterans along and to ensure that they are an \nintegral part of our community.\n  Veterans Legal Institute is committed to providing our everyday \nheroes with the resources and the support that they deserve, and I \nbelieve that we must do our part by supporting organizations such as \nVeterans Legal Institute so that they can effectively serve this \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1644-7", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1644-H1645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HAWAII STATE TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n  (Mr. TAKAI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TAKAI.

Mr. Speaker, households across America have budgets. \nPeople sit around the kitchen table trying to make the hard choices, \nfiguring out should they send their kid to summer camp, can they afford \nto go out to dinner more often, can they afford a family trip.\n  Businesses have budgets. I was in the private sector before I came \nhere, and we had to have those tough discussions and discuss where we \nwere going to reinvest and where we were going to cut.\n  But, apparently, for the Republicans, they say that our country \nshouldn't have a budget. The time is running short in which the \nRepublicans can present and pass a budget for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Shouldn't America have a budget just as it has had in the past, just \nas families across our country have, and just as businesses have?\n  What is it that they are trying to hide? Can they not make the \nnumbers match without privatizing Social Security and Medicare? Are \nthey trying to hide huge tax increases for the middle class?\n  We will never know unless the public pressure is so great that the \nRepublicans feel that they have to present a responsible budget before \nour body. I hope we see it soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1645-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Denham) laid before the House the \nfollowing communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 2016.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 672 provides for \nconsideration of H.R. 2666, the No Rate Regulation of Broadband \nInternet Access Act.\n  The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided between the \nmajority and the minority of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  The Committee on Rules made in order three amendments that were \nsubmitted to the committee, all three of which were submitted by the \nminority.\n  Finally, the rule affords the minority the customary motion to \nrecommit, a final opportunity to amend the legislation should the \nminority choose to exercise that option.\n\n[[Page H1646]]\n\n  H.R. 2666, the No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act, \nwas introduced by Mr. Kinzinger, a member of the House Energy and \nCommerce Committee, to address the issue of an out-of-control \nindependent agency, the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC.\n  The bill is targeted and does one thing only. It prohibits the \nFederal Communications Commission from regulating the rates charged for \nbroadband Internet access.\n  In February of 2015, the Federal Communications Commission voted on a \nparty-line vote to adopt rules that reclassify broadband Internet \naccess as a title II telecommunications service, reversing their \npreviously stated position that they would not reclassify the Internet \nunder title II, and, in fact, afterwards, the President himself \ninterjected into the debate and demanded that the Commission reconsider \nand that they do so.\n  The rules prevent blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization of \nthe Internet. This reclassification poses a serious risk for the \nregulation of rates charged by providers for the delivery of Internet \nservice, a move that has never before been taken by the government.\n  Under the Federal Communications Commission's unprecedented use of a \n100-year-old statute to regulate the Internet under its net neutrality \nrule, the Commission gave itself the authority to regulate the rates \nthat Internet service providers charge to consumers for service.\n  In response to this power grab by the Commission, the Energy and \nCommerce Committee held oversight hearings. That resulted in the \ndrafting and passage of the legislation before the House this week, \nwhich is intended to prevent the Federal Communications Commission from \nusing reclassification of broadband Internet service to engage in rate \nregulation, whether that be directly through tariffing or indirectly \nthrough enforcement actions.\n  Rate regulation--or even the threat of rate regulation--out of the \nFederal Communications Commission creates massive uncertainty for \nInternet service providers. Because of this, Internet service providers \ncould slow or stop altogether the investment and will be less likely to \noffer specialized or unique pricing offers to their consumers.\n  As the Federal Communications Commission consolidates more and more \npower to regulate the Internet--and make no mistake, the Federal \nCommunications Commission is very eager to regulate the Internet--\nproviders will have fewer and fewer avenues for providing consumer \nservice plans and packages.\n  The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Tom Wheeler, \nand President Obama have both stated that net neutrality rules would \nnot result in the FCC regulating rates.\n  Yet, less than a year after the rules were adopted in March of 2016 \nduring an Energy and Commerce hearing, Chairman Wheeler admitted that \nthe FCC should and will have the authority to regulate broadband rates \nunder these new rules.\n  Like all government agencies, the Federal Communications Commission \ncan't help itself. It sees an unregulated space--the Internet--and it \njust can't allow it to go on without government control.\n  Under net neutrality, the Federal Government will have the ability to \ncontrol the Internet. Let me say that again. Under net neutrality, the \nFederal Government will have the ability to control the Internet.\n  Even if this current Federal Communications Commission chooses not to \nregulate the rates charged, the Commission's net neutrality rules \npermit future FCC commissioners to do exactly that.\n  These rules from the Federal Communications Commission have the \npotential to cost well north of 43,000 jobs, according to a recent \nstudy commissioned by the United States Telecom Association. The bill \nbefore us this week will take a step toward protecting the Internet \nindustry from those job losses.\n  I urge my colleagues to support today's rule and support the \nunderlying legislation to protect consumers from an out-of-control \nFederal bureaucracy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the \ncustomary 30 minutes.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have just days before the legally mandated budget \ndeadline. Yet, instead of debating your budget, Mr. Speaker, my budget, \nMr. Speaker, anybody's budget, Mr. Speaker, we are debating whether to \ncodify existing FCC policy.\n  There is limited time to provide a budget for our country. Households \nacross our country have budgets, and businesses have budgets. Unless \nthere is an announced change to the schedule in bringing Congress to \nwork on Friday and Saturday and Rules Committee convening today or \ntomorrow, it seems like Congress will miss the deadline for the budget \nand perhaps never produce a budget.\n  Now, folks on the other side will say that there have been years \nDemocrats didn't produce a budget, and that is true. But Republicans \nran to take over this body, saying: We are going to do better. We are \ngoing to produce a budget. Republicans have had the chance, and there \nis not even a vote on the budget.\n  I am going to offer later in this debate a motion to defeat the \nprevious question. If that passes, Mr. Speaker, I will be able to offer \nan amendment to the rule to bring up the budget resolution.\n  I hope it does. I hope there are enough Democrats and Republicans in \nthis Chamber who are outraged by the failure of the Republican \nleadership to allow the Republican and Democratic Members of this body \nto present and vote on their budgets.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  We have historically had a very open process around budgets. There is \nusually five or six budgets that come before the House and we try to \nget to one that passes. There have been years where I think they have a \nking of the hill process and whichever one gets the most votes can \nbecome the budget.\n  But it looks like, rather than any of those debates or give Members \nwho have thoughtfully been preparing the budgets from the Republican \nStudy Group or from the progressive Democratic coalition the chance to \npresent their budgets, along with the Republican and Democratic members \nof the Budget Committee, I think the Republicans are saying: we don't \nwant to have those tough decisions about where to cut or where to tax; \nwe would rather just pretend like our country is in good fiscal order \nand spend the day discussing codifying FCC policy rather than \ndiscussing what the American people sent us here to do--how to balance \nthe budget, restore fiscal stability, and pass a budget.\n  There is another missed opportunity here today. When talking about \nbroadband--if that is what we are going to talk about--in districts \nlike mine in Colorado, we have communities that simply don't have \nreasonable access to the Internet. I talk to constituents in Evergreen \nand Conifer in Grand County every day, rapidly growing communities, \nwhere people only have access to speeds that were more relevant to the \n20th century rather than the 21st century. I remember I visited a \nschool in Grand County where the district has an initiative to provide \nevery child with a Chromebook computer and the computer science teacher \nthere didn't even have high-speed access from his own home.\n  Access to broadband is essential for our economy, particularly our \nrural economy like those in my district. It is essential for the \neducation of our kids, for a vibrant private sector, for civil society, \nand democracy. While the FCC and the Department of Commerce have some \ntools in place, there is not nearly the tools they need or the \nresources to make our Nation competitive coast to coast by making sure \nthat every American has access to broadband.\n  Bills that try to codify regulations certainly have their place. I \nwould argue it is probably not when we are 48 hours from reaching a \nbudget deadline. But I want to make sure that even if we are going to \nspend time discussing codifying FCC policy, that we have the more \nimportant discussion about how we can make sure that broadband access \nis available to our rural communities, such as the ones that I \nrepresent.\n  Democrats and Republicans largely agree on some of the goals of this \nbill.\n\n[[Page H1647]]\n\nIn fact, I think there is a missed opportunity to have worked on a \nbipartisan version that likely could have passed on suspension. There \nare a number of amendments under consideration, and it is my hope that \nsome of the consumer protection issues can be addressed through that.\n  But I think the big picture here, Mr. Speaker, is we are just 2 days \naway from Congress' own deadline for passing a budget with no budget in \nsight. If we can defeat the previous question, we can immediately move \nto consider the budget. I call upon my Republican and Democratic \ncolleagues to do that. As we look at broadband, which I am hopeful that \nwe can do after this deadline passes--I am happy to revisit this bill \nif my motion to defeat the previous question passes and we move into \nthe budget debate--I will be happy to resume this debate next week. I \nhaven't seen any particular reason that we have to try to cram in \ncodifying FCC regulations around broadband in the 48 hours before our \nown budget deadline expires.\n  So let's get back to talking about the budget. It is never easy. The \nRepublicans have certainly talked about how they wanted the country to \nhave a budget. Well, the country is not going to have a budget unless \nCongress gets to work debating it and passing it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  I rise to oppose the rule on this legislation, not necessarily \nbecause this is a bad bill--I do think it is a vague solution in search \nof a nonexistent problem--but I oppose the rule for another reason, and \nthat is because I thought that since we were going to bring this bill \nto the floor anyway, even though it is unnecessary, even though \nChairman Wheeler of the FCC has said that the FCC does not intend to \nregulate rates on broadband, I thought maybe I would at least try to \naccomplish something productive and offer an amendment to solve a real \nproblem that the American people are seeing in front of them every day \nright now. That is the problem of television ads, political ads, that \ndo not truly identify their source.\n  Under section 317 of the Communications Act of 1934, the FCC requires \nbroadcasters to put on the ad the true identity of the people running \nthe ad. This makes a lot of sense. The idea is that when you see \nsomebody trying to influence your vote or to influence your attitude \nabout a particular public issue, that you should understand who is \nactually trying to influence you.\n  But because of dramatic changes in the way campaign laws are \nimplemented and because of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, \nwhat has happened is that we now have ads run by organizations like \nAmericans for Kittens and Puppies, and that doesn't do the American \nvoter, the American consumer, any good. They don't understand who is \nactually paying.\n  What my amendment would have done, had it been made in order by the \nRules Committee, it would have basically restated the law that exists \nand say the FCC should regulate these ads by requiring the true \nidentity. Right now they are relying on a 1979 staff interpretation of \ntrue identity. They are saying we need to put the sponsor of the ad on \nthe ad, but the sponsor of the ad, again, is a nebulous, vague, title \norganization that nobody knows who they are.\n  What we would like to do is say you have to put on the ad who is \nreally paying for it. So instead, for instance, if you had an ad in \nsupport of sugared soft drinks and it was being paid for by Coca-Cola, \nunder this interpretation you could put the ad agency that actually put \nthe ad on the air and nobody would know that Coca-Cola was actually \npaying for it.\n  The people, again, are seeing this every day on their television \nscreens right now. These laws and interpretations have resulted in \nendless sums of anonymous money coming into the system trying to \ninfluence the outcomes of our elections. That is not what Congress \nintended. Despite having the authority to do it, the FCC has refused to \ntake action to close this loophole.\n  My amendment would have restated the original Congressional intent \nand would send a message to the FCC that it is time to act. This \namendment would have been germane, it would have been within the rules \nof the body, and, most importantly, it would have been supported by the \nvast majority of Americans: Republicans, Democrats, and Independents \nwho want us to reform our campaign finance system so that it is on the \nup and up, so people understand who is trying to influence them and \nalso to end the influence of big money in politics.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Kentucky an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. I wish that the Rules Committee had made that amendment \nin order, but they didn't, so I will oppose the rule and urge my \ncolleagues to do so.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman from \nColorado how many additional speakers he has?\n  Mr. POLIS. I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. BURGESS. In which case, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up the Republican budget resolution and \nallow for consideration of alternative budget proposals under a similar \nprocess to that which we have used every year in recent history. It is \ntruly time for the Republicans to stop the partisan game and finally \nconsider a budget before this Friday's legally mandated deadline.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, Americans get it. Households have to balance \ntheir budget, businesses have to balance their budget. Not talking \nabout it and putting your head in the sand is only a recipe for \nincreased debt and increased liability for future generations of \nAmericans.\n  The fact that we are spending $400 billion or $500 billion more than \nwe are taking in--of course we might not know about that for the next \nyear until after the fact if we don't have a budget--the fact that we \nhave enormous unfunded liabilities in Medicare and Social Security \ndoesn't go away just because Republicans ignore the topic and refuse to \nhave a debate on balancing our budget.\n  I am proud to sponsor a balanced budget amendment. I think that by \nworking together, Democrats and Republicans can restore fiscal \nresponsibility to our Nation.\n  How can we do it?\n  Well, I will tell you how we can't do it. We can't do it by 48 hours \nfrom the deadline to pass a budget by discussing obscure bills to \ncodify FCC regulations with our valuable floor time.\n  It starts with an honest discussion. It starts with Democrats and \nRepublicans offering their budgets. I have been proud in the past to \nsupport bipartisan budgets that have come to this body. I have \nsupported and opposed some of the Democratic budgets that my colleagues \nhave offered, but we have to have that discussion on the floor. The \nwork doesn't do itself and the problem doesn't go away when Republicans \nchoose to ignore it.\n  I wish our budget deficit was as easy to solve as simply ignoring it. \nWouldn't that be convenient if we could simply ignore the budget \ndeficit and it would go away? Wouldn't it be convenient if we could \njust ignore the national debt and it would go away? Wouldn't it be \nconvenient if we could ignore the damage to agencies that an \nindiscriminate sequester has caused and it would simply go away?\n  I like that line of thinking, Mr. Speaker. Unfortunately, it is \ncompletely unrealistic. The American people realize it is completely \nunrealistic. That is why when America looks to Congress and says: we \nhave these discussions in our households about our budget, and \nbusinesses have these discussions. Why can't you, Mr. Speaker?\n\n[[Page H1648]]\n\nWhy can't you? That is the reason the Congressional approval rating is \nso low.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the \nprevious question. I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying \nbill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, back in the late 1990s, in the middle of what was called \nthe dot-com boom, my predecessor, the then-majority leader of the House \nof Representatives, Richard Armey, came and spoke to the Dallas Chamber \nof Commerce. The purpose of his discussion that day was to talk about \nthe dot-com boom that the economy was experiencing.\n  He confessed that the Internet was the gosh darnedest thing, no one \nhad ever seen anything like it, but he cautioned us. As business \nleaders that day, he cautioned us. He said: Look, when the government \ndoesn't understand something, the first thing it will want to do is \nregulate it, the next thing it will want to do is tax it, and you have \nthen effectively killed it.\n  Mr. Speaker, it wasn't an accident that I used in the opening \nstatement the language that under the proposed rules from the FCC, the \nFederal Government will have the ability to control the Internet. That \nis a significant and important fact. If you allow the Federal \nGovernment to control the Internet, you have effectively damaged the \npromise of the Internet to the point where it will no longer function \nfor its citizens the way it was intended to function: as a free and \nopen process.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is pretty simple. Today's rule provides for \nconsideration of a bill to rein in the Federal Government that is all \ntoo eager to regulate every aspect of our lives.\n  H.R. 2666 will protect the Internet from government regulation and \nallow it to continue to thrive without interference.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Kinzinger for his work on this \nlegislation, and I want to thank the committee for the work that they \ndid in getting this legislation to the floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and ``yes'' on the \nunderlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n            An Amendment to H. Res. 672 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     section:\n       Sec. 2. At any time after the adoption of this resolution \n     the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, \n     declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole \n     House on the state of the Union for consideration of the \n     concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 125) establishing the \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2017 \n     and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal \n     years 2018 through 2026. The first reading of the concurrent \n     resolution shall be dispensed with. All points of order \n     against consideration of the concurrent resolution are \n     waived. General debate shall not exceed four hours, with \n     three hours of general debate confined to the congressional \n     budget equally divided and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget and \n     one hour of general debate on the subject of economic goals \n     and policies equally divided and controlled by Representative \n     Tiberi of Ohio and Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York \n     or their respective designees. After general debate the \n     concurrent resolution shall be considered for amendment under \n     the five-minute rule. The concurrent resolution shall be \n     considered as read. No amendment shall be in order except \n     amendments in the nature of a substitute. Each such amendment \n     shall be considered as read, and shall be debatable for one \n     hour equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an \n     opponent. All points of order against such amendments are \n     waived except those arising under clause 7 of rule XVI \n     (germaneness). If more than one such amendment is adopted, \n     then only the one receiving the greater number of affirmative \n     votes shall be considered as finally adopted. In the case of \n     a tie for the greater number of affirmative votes, then only \n     the last amendment to receive that number of affirmative \n     votes shall be considered as finally adopted. After the \n     conclusion of consideration of the concurrent resolution for \n     amendment and a final period of general debate, which shall \n     not exceed 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the \n     chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the \n     Budget, the Committee shall rise and report the concurrent \n     resolution to the House with such amendment as may have been \n     finally adopted. The previous question shall be considered as \n     ordered on the concurrent resolution and amendments thereto \n     to adoption without intervening motion except amendments \n     offered by the chair of the Committee on the Budget pursuant \n     to section 305(a)(5) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     to achieve mathematical consistency. The concurrent \n     resolution shall not be subject to a demand for division of \n     the question of its adoption.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of \n     January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 671 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H.

The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule for H.R. 3340, the FSOC Reform Act, and for H.R. 3791, \nthe Raising Consolidated Assets Threshold Under Small Bank Holding \nCompany Policy Statement. House Resolution 671 provides structured \nrules for both bills. The resolution provides each bill 1 hour of \ndebate that is equally divided between the chair and the ranking member \nof the Financial Services Committee. Additionally, the resolution \nprovides for the consideration of one amendment to each bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution and the underlying \nlegislation.\n  The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, \nwhich is dedicated to identifying threats to the stability of the \nAmerican financial system. The FSOC is supported in this mission by the \nOffice of Financial Research, which was also created by Dodd-Frank.\n  The OFR is armed with subpoena power to compel vast amounts of \nnonpublic, sensitive information from institutions across the financial \nsystem. The OFR feeds this data to the FSOC, which is empowered to \ndesignate banks, as well as nonbank institutions, as ``systemically \nimportant financial institutions,'' or SIFIs. This designation \nsignificantly increases the regulatory burdens that are faced by these \ninstitutions, and they have far-reaching effects on the entire \nfinancial system. The impact of excessive regulation trickles down to \ncustomers, resulting in higher borrowing costs that may stop Americans \nfrom realizing their dreams of homeownership, of purchasing cars, of \npursuing higher education, or other goals.\n  Despite the vast power that the FSOC and OFR have, neither \norganization is subject to the annual appropriations process. The OFR \nis funded through assessments on banks, and it pays for the FSOC \nthrough these funds. As such, the FSOC is insulated from the \ntransparency and accountability that Congress would give to normal \norganizations by virtue of this self-funding mechanism. This has, \neffectively, shielded the FSOC from any congressional oversight.\n  The FSOC Reform Act would, simply, fix those problems. It does not \nreduce the FSOC's budget or the OFR's, but it would require that they \nbe under annual appropriations. It would also require occasional \nreports to Congress on their expenses, objectives, and performance \nmeasures. Congressional approval of FSOC's budget would encourage \ntransparency with regard to FSOC's methodology for designating SIFIs. \nIt would also make it clear what their objectives are and what they see \nas concerns for our financial system. I believe this bill will actually \nincrease the transparency of the process, and it will make sure that we \nlook out for the financial security of the American financial system.\n  The bill also requires the FSOC to engage in a public notice and \ncomment period before issuing any new rules and regulations. These \nchanges will put the FSOC in line with other agencies that have to \nengage in public notice and comment periods before they provide new \nrules and regulations.\n  I thank the sponsor of H.R. 3340, Representative Tom Emmer of \nMinnesota, for introducing this important legislation that will \nincrease the oversight and transparency to ensure we have a safe and \ncompetitive financial market in the United States.\n  The other measure for consideration under the rule is H.R. 3791, \nwhich is a bill sponsored by Representative Mia Love of Utah.\n  Last year, Congress passed and the President signed legislation \nproviding relief to community banks by increasing the Federal Reserve's \nSmall Bank Holding Company Policy Statement threshold to include small \nbank holding companies with up to $1 billion of consolidated assets. \nThis was in response to the small banks' difficulty in accessing \ncapital as a result of significant changes in the regulatory landscape.\n  This bill provides further relief by expanding the Fed's policy \nstatement to include small bank and savings and loan holding companies \nwith up to $5 billion of consolidated assets. This will provide needed \nrelief for about 400 small bank and thrift holding companies. The $5 \nbillion level matches the threshold that was offered in the last \nCongress by the current ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, my fellow Ohioan, Democratic \nSenator Sherrod Brown. He did that in S. 798, so this should not be \ncontroversial. It is bipartisan. Democrats and Republicans have been \nfor this.\n  Since the second quarter of 2010, around the time that the Dodd-Frank \nAct was passed by Congress, the community banks' share of U.S. \ncommercial banking assets has declined at a rate that is almost double \nthat experienced between 2006 and 2010. What is happening in our \nfinancial system is that the big are getting bigger, and the small are \ndisappearing. That is why it is important to give regulatory relief to \nsome smaller community banks that are caught in the middle. According \nto the FDIC, there were more than 18,000 banks in the 1980s as compared \nto just 6,400 in the first quarter of 2015, and we are currently losing \ncommunity banks at a rate of one every day.\n  Increasing the eligibility threshold to $5 billion will ensure that \nsmall bank and savings and loan holding companies will be able to issue \ndebt and raise capital so that the community banks can continue to \nprovide financial services to the customers they serve and increase \ntheir involvement in promoting economic growth in their local \ncommunities.\n  It is important to note that this bill maintains the requirements \nthat these\n\n[[Page H1650]]\n\nholding companies meet regulations related to nonbanking activities, \noff-balance sheet activities, and publicly registered debt equity. The \nlegislation also maintains a safeguard that allows the Federal Reserve \nto deny an increased debt level to any bank holding company it deems at \nrisk of failure.\n  Together, these bills will help ensure that powerful regulators act \nin a transparent manner and are accountable to Congress, and they will \nprovide needed relief for community banks that are attempting to \nsurvive in a difficult environment.\n  I look forward to debating these bills with my colleagues, and I urge \nsupport for the rule and the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank my friend, the gentleman from Ohio, for yielding me the \ncustomary 30 minutes for debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule that is providing for the \nconsideration of both H.R. 3340, the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil Reform Act, and H.R. 3791, the Raising Consolidated Assets \nThreshold Under Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, and for \nother purposes.\n\n  These partisan financial services bills, in my opinion, would weaken \nand politicize the institutions that were created after the financial \ncrisis to identify and guard against systemic risk in our financial \nsystem; and they will allow even larger bank holding companies to \nleverage themselves with debt when financing the purchase of other \nbanks.\n  In reviewing this legislation, I have to ask myself: Are the memories \nof my Republican friends really so short that they do not remember the \npain that our Nation went through only a few short years ago?\n  The financial crisis of 2008, by everybody's statement, was the worst \neconomic downturn that this great Nation has faced since the Great \nDepression. It left millions out of work and millions out of their \nhomes. Yet, instead of supporting efforts to ensure that a collapse of \nthis magnitude never happens again, the majority has chosen to weaken \nthe very protections that are designed to prevent such a crisis. This \nis even more appalling when you consider that we are still dealing with \nthe fallout from the crisis. Just this week, Goldman Sachs agreed to \npay $5 billion to settle claims that it misled mortgage bond investors \nduring the financial crisis. I was pleased to see that a portion of its \nrepayment is going to go to low-income and moderate-income housing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I guess we really shouldn't be surprised by the actions \nof my friends in the majority. With the kinds of bills that have come \nto the floor under this Republican Congress, whether they be to roll \nback environmental protections, 60-plus repeals of the Affordable Care \nAct, or to deny access to women's health care, I guess it is not a \nsurprise that now my Republican friends are bringing up legislation to \nhelp the big banks and strip away the protections to prevent another \nfinancial crisis.\n  I am also left wondering: Why are we debating a rule for these bills \ntoday at all? I would like to remind the majority--and I will now and \ntwice again before I yield back my time--that, by law, this body must \nproduce a budget resolution by Friday of this week. Despite this \nrequirement, we still have no budget or a clear path to one. I ask the \nquestion: Where is the budget?\n  I pause here to yield to my friend from Ohio if I could get his \nattention just for a moment. I know the gentleman is on the Committee \non Financial Services. We serve together on Rules, but I am not in the \nmajority and am not privy to what may happen this Friday. I am just \ncurious: Since the gentleman is in the majority, what is the gentleman \nhearing, if anything, regarding our having a budget by this Friday?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for \nyielding.\n  I am hearing that negotiations are ongoing, and I am hopeful that we \ncan have a budget by this Friday. There is a bit of disagreement, even \ninside our Conference, about how to move forward on the budget as far \nas the numbers. But there are a lot of discussions ongoing, and I am \nhopeful.\n  I support passing a budget. I have voted for a budget since I have \nbeen here. We have passed budgets every year since I have been here. We \nhave not passed the deadline yet for this budget. I am hopeful that we \ncan get it done, but it is an ongoing negotiation.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend's response.\n  I urged that yesterday in the Rules Committee. Aside from your \nsubcommittee holding a hearing this Thursday at 3, we were advised by \nthe chair that there would be no further business of the Rules \nCommittee.\n  So I assumed, if that is the case, that we won't be going back to the \nRules Committee. And I am sure that the budget, if it were to be here \nby Friday, would require a rule.\n  Despite all of these things, I empiricize the fact that it doesn't \nappear that we will have a budget by Friday.\n  Mr. Speaker, here is how we got to this point: last fall Republicans \nand Democrats came together to pass a bipartisan budget agreement. Now, \nhowever, Republicans are refusing to support their party's own budget \nproposal.\n  Now, I understand what my friend said about negotiations going on, \nand that is good. It would be helpful if those negotiations were going \non with Democrats in the room as well.\n  I was very optimistic, as I am sure all of us were and, to a relative \ndegree, still are, when Speaker Ryan promised to end Republican \nobstructionism and return to regular order. I felt very optimistic \nabout that.\n  It seemed that the now-dubbed do-nothing Congress is back and, with \nit, total dysfunction on the Republican side of the aisle. The \ndysfunction is so bad that Republicans cannot even agree to a budget \nnumber that they have already agreed to.\n  Now, Democrats don't want to weaken the financial protections keeping \nour economy stable and strong. Instead, Democrats are ready to pass a \nbudget that creates and helps create jobs and grow the paychecks of \nhardworking Americans.\n  We would like to work in a bipartisan way, and we would assuredly \nlike to work in a way that would bring us to the work that is needed to \nbe done in a positive manner.\n  If only the Republican Conference could stand up to the extreme \nfaction in their own party to work with us, then we could get this \nbusiness done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I have no more \nspeakers. If the gentleman from Florida wants to close, I will reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  These financial services bills are not what the American people want. \nThese are bills that big banks want.\n  Instead of debating and passing a budget, which we are required to do \nby law by the end of this week, as I have said, the majority has \ndecided that we should spend what precious legislative time we have \nleft debating bills that would roll back vital protections to the \nsystemic health of our financial system.\n  So now not only is the dysfunction in the Republican Conference \nputting one of this institution's most basic functions in jeopardy, \nwhich is passing a budget to fund the government, but, to add insult to \ninjury, the majority has decided now is the best time to debate putting \nour entire financial system in jeopardy by rolling back measures \ndesigned to protect it.\n  I might add that there is an appellate decision that is not on this \nmeasure, but on another that we dealt with earlier. I don't understand \nwhy we are going forward on these measures when we know, in fact, that \nthey aren't going to go anywhere in the other body.\n  Mr. Speaker, in my judgment, the American people deserve better.\n  So since Congress is required to pass a budget by Friday of this week \nand there is absolutely little sign that the Republican majority \nintends to fulfill that responsibility, well, Mr. Speaker, I want to \ngive my friends on the other side of the aisle the opportunity to end \nthe obstructionism and meet their and our obligation to pass a budget.\n\n[[Page H1651]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up the Republican budget resolution and \nallow for the consideration of alternative budget proposals under the \nsame process we use every year.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Huizenga of Michigan). Is there \nobjection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and \ndefeat the previous question and vote ``no'' on the rule and the \nunderlying bills.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  I appreciate the comments of my colleague. I can assure him we are \nworking hard on a budget resolution. Although we cannot notify the \ncommittee of any upcoming meeting because we don't know when it will be \nbecause we don't know when the negotiations will be, I am hopeful that \nthat will happen and we will actually end up having a budget that will \nbe passed before the deadline.\n  So, again, I am hopeful, but none of us can control that ourselves. \nThe negotiations are ongoing.\n  I would just say that these two bills and the rule don't do anything \nto undermine our financial stability. The first bill puts the FSOC and \nthe OFR on budget. It requires that they have appropriations every \nyear.\n  You might be familiar with the appropriations clause of the U.S. \nConstitution: ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \nConsequence of Appropriations made by Law . . .''\n  So we just want the normal constitutional checks and balances that \nexist in every other agency to exist here, to increase the transparency \nand accountability for what these agencies do.\n  So the first bill puts FSOC and OFR on budget. It requires \nappropriations to be passed. It also requires periodic reports on what \ntheir goals and objectives are and how their meeting goes. That is kind \nof a no-brainer.\n  Again, Senator Sherrod Brown, the Democrat minority ranking member on \nthe Senate Banking Committee, has a bill that--I'm sorry. It is the \nsecond bill. I apologize.\n  It makes sense to do this, to put them on appropriations.\n  The second bill is a bill that raises the limit for small financial \ninstitutions, community banks, up to $5 billion. We are talking about \n400 banks. It is not the biggest banks.\n  In fact, the biggest banks in America are almost a trillion dollars. \nWe are talking about $5 billion in consolidated assets in banks and \nsavings and loans.\n  These are community-based financial institutions. There are about 400 \nof them. They are struggling right now. We are losing a community bank \na day in this country. We need to make sure that we do everything that \nwe can to help those community banks continue.\n  I know that is a bipartisan effort to do that. This may not be the \nexact way that the other side of the aisle wants to move forward on \nthat.\n  I offered to the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee \nyesterday in the Rules Committee that I would be happy to work with her \non some other method.\n  If she thinks she wants to use an activity test, if she wants to \nrequire some kind of loans to assets, if she wants to require some kind \nof capital in this, I would be happy to work with her because we have \nto help our community banks. I know that is a bipartisan feeling.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from Florida that I know \nthat the other side of the aisle feels the same way. We may have a \ntactical disagreement, but we all feel that way. So I would love to \nwork on that.\n  In the meantime, I hope my colleagues will support both these bills \nand the underlying rule. I urge my colleagues to support the rule and \nthe underlying bills.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 671 Offered by Mr. Hastings\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     section:\n       Sec. 3. At any time after the adoption of this resolution \n     the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, \n     declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole \n     House on the state of the Union for consideration of the \n     concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 125) establishing the \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2017 \n     and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal \n     years 2018 through 2026. The first reading of the concurrent \n     resolution shall be dispensed with. All points of order \n     against consideration of the concurrent resolution are \n     waived. General debate shall not exceed four hours, with \n     three hours of general debate confined to the congressional \n     budget equally divided and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget and \n     one hour of general debate on the subject of economic goals \n     and policies equally divided and controlled by Representative \n     Tiberi of Ohio and Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York \n     or their respective designees. After general debate the \n     concurrent resolution shall be considered for amendment under \n     the five-minute rule. The concurrent resolution shall be \n     considered as read. No amendment shall be in order except \n     amendments in the nature of a substitute. Each such amendment \n     shall be considered as read, and shall be debatable for one \n     hour equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an \n     opponent. All points of order against such amendments are \n     waived except those arising under clause 7 of rule XVI \n     (germaneness). If more than one such amendment is adopted, \n     then only the one receiving the greater number of affirmative \n     votes shall be considered as finally adopted. In the case of \n     a tie for the greater number of affirmative votes, then only \n     the last amendment to receive that number of affirmative \n     votes shall be considered as finally adopted. After the \n     conclusion of consideration of the concurrent resolution for \n     amendment and a final period of general debate, which shall \n     not exceed 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the \n     chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the \n     Budget, the Committee shall rise and report the concurrent \n     resolution to the House with such amendment as may have been \n     finally adopted. The previous question shall be considered as \n     ordered on the concurrent resolution and amendments thereto \n     to adoption without intervening motion except amendments \n     offered by the chair of the Committee on the Budget pursuant \n     to section 305(a)(5) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     to achieve mathematical consistency. The concurrent \n     resolution shall not be subject to a demand for division of \n     the question of its adoption.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee\n\n[[Page H1652]]\n\n     on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller) and the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Payne) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3586, the Border \nand Maritime Coordination Improvement Act. I believe that this bill \nwill provide the Department of Homeland Security the tools and the \nauthority to find efficiencies to improve operations amongst all of its \nvarious components.\n  In 2003, the Department of Homeland Security was cobbled together \nfrom 22 different offices and agencies--a very huge logistical and \nmanagement challenge. We knew that there would be significant growing \npains before that agency would function well and as a unified \ndepartment.\n  Each component of the Department, be it Customs and Border Protection \nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the U.S. Coast Guard, has a \ntendency to sort of operate in their own silo, without the coordination \nrequired to make border and maritime security efforts as successful as \nthey should be and can be.\n  This has had a negative effect, actually, on logistics, on \ncommunications, and, most importantly, on operations. In an attempt to \nadopt a better structure with a goal of enhancing border security and \nmaritime security operations, this legislation, Mr. Speaker, authorizes \njoint task forces on border security.\n  The goal of these task forces is to improve border security outcomes, \nand this legislation provides explicit authority to guide the task \nforce operations and to allow this pilot concept to be utilized to \nsecure our borders.\n  While this concept is not unique, we intentionally provided a sunset \ndate for the joint task force authority to give the next administration \nthe opportunity to come back to the Homeland Security Committee and to \nthe next Congress to demonstrate that this organizational structure has \nreally contributed to border security, and it is not just simply \nanother layer of bureaucracy.\n  The second part of this bill, Mr. Speaker, requires the Department to \ntake a very hard look at potential efficiencies in its maritime \nsecurity efforts. During my time as the chair of the Subcommittee on \nBorder and Maritime Security, we held hearings with CBP that address \nsome of the overlap and the redundancies in the maritime environment, \nparticularly with the units of the Coast Guard and the CBP Air and \nMarine Operations that, in many cases, are in very close geographic \nproximity.\n  This bill also requires CBP's Office of Field Operations, the Air and \nMarine Operations, and the Coast Guard to evaluate their role in the \nmaritime and supply chain security to ensure that their missions are \nconsistent with our current threats and to find ways to consolidate \noperations, where possible. We think these steps are commonsense, and I \ncertainly think that they will help save our taxpayers a number of \ndollars, and, most importantly, improve operations and coordinations \nfor our homeland security.\n  Again, finding creative ways to fund the staffing and infrastructure \nneeds at our Nation's aging ports of entry was really the driving force \nbehind another piece of this legislation, which is the permanent \nauthorization of CBP's Public-Private Partnership program, which is \nalso included in this legislation.\n  Allowing public and private sector port of entry operators and others \nto enter into agreements with CBP to fund small-scale infrastructure \nexpansion or to fund overtime needs will improve security and, as well, \nincrease the flow of commerce that is so vital to our economy.\n  I want to specifically thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), who\n\n[[Page H1662]]\n\nwill be speaking in just a moment, for offering the amendment, Mr. \nSpeaker, during the markup regarding the authorization of public-\nprivate partnerships. His leadership on this issue has been absolutely \nvital to bringing this legislation to the floor today.\n  I certainly also want to thank Chairman Shuster and Representative \nBarletta from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for \nworking so diligently with us on this particular provision.\n  Lastly, this bill authorizes the Department's Office of Biometric \nIdentity Management, or OBIM as we call it, for the first time. Since \n2003, biometrics have been a very important part of the Nation's border \nsecurity efforts.\n  The biometric service OBIM provides is not limited to any one \ncomponent. It is a department and a government-wide asset. For that \nreason, we believe that it should not be located in a single component, \nlike the CBP, where the information could, again, be siloed to the \ndetriment of other Department of Homeland Security components. In order \nfor biometrics to be used to their very fullest potential, we think we \nneed to appropriately fund and modernize the data systems that power \nthe matching and the collection of biometric information.\n  Mr. Speaker, our borders can and should be secured. We believe that \nthis bill provides a framework to really help organize the Department \nfor success and to improve the coordination of border and maritime \nsecurity components whose job it is to secure our great Nation.\n  Lastly, I would like to also thank the ranking member of our \ncommittee, Mr. Thompson, and the ranking member on our subcommittee, \nMr. Vela, as well as all of their staffs, for working with us in the \nspirit of bipartisanship to strengthen our security.\n  I ask our colleagues to support this commonsense bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3586, the Border and Maritime Coordination \nImprovement Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation aims to improve the unity of effort \nbetween the various DHS components charged with securing our land and \nmaritime borders. H.R. 3586 also seeks to push out border security to \nmitigate threats at the earliest possible point. Collaboration and \ncooperation are vital to ensuring our efforts are efficient and \neffective.\n  H.R. 3586 allows the Department to leverage the capabilities of its \ncomponents, such as Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Coast \nGuard, to improve its approach to our border and maritime security.\n  The bill requires the Department to assess the use of its resources, \nair and marine assets, and personnel deployed both domestically and \nabroad in order to identify opportunities to better coordinate and \nstreamline its operations and ensure the success of its border and \nmaritime security missions.\n  H.R. 3586 also formally authorizes the DHS Secretary's Border \nSecurity Joint Task Forces, which utilize Department component \npersonnel and capabilities, to secure the land and maritime borders of \nthe United States.\n\n  These tasks were launched in May of 2014 through the Secretary's \nSouthern Border and Approaches Campaign and represents a more \ncollaborative approach to border security missions than we have \npreviously seen.\n  H.R. 3586 also authorizes two programs specifically intended to \nbolster the Department's ability to identify and prevent threats from \nentering the United States via commercial aircraft--the Air Cargo \nAdvance Screening pilot and the Immigration Advisory Program. Through \nthese two programs, DHS is able to thoroughly screen and vet cargo and \npassengers coming to the United States from abroad on commercial \nairplanes and share information with international partners prior to \ndeparture.\n  There is strong bipartisan support and interest in strengthening and \nimproving our border and maritime security efforts among my colleagues \non the Committee on Homeland Security. I urge my colleagues in the \nHouse to support H.R. 3586 as well.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), from the \n23rd Congressional District, who actually has 800 miles of the \nsouthwest border in his district.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as the representative of dozens of \nborder communities in Texas, I take the obligation to stand up for them \nseriously. Improvements to security are a key portion of this bill. \nHowever, I have long maintained that they are not enough and they are \nnot the only part of a successful border strategy.\n  Trade is the lifeblood of many of these communities. Yet, far too \noften they find themselves relying on ports of entry that are \nunderstaffed and out of date. This limits growth and strains the ties \nof the local communities. In many cases, they want to do more to expand \non the Federal resources that currently exist. Public-private \npartnerships are key to enabling this.\n  Let me be clear: port of entry infrastructure is a Federal \nresponsibility, but that doesn't mean that local communities and \nbusinesses shouldn't be able to pitch in.\n  Since January 2014, the Public-Private Partnership pilot program run \nthrough the Customs and Border Protection has made a difference. It has \nenhanced the ability of CBP to increase resources and decrease wait \ntimes at ports of entry. This program provides guidance for \nreimbursable services and allows CBP to tailor its services to the \nneeds of the stakeholders while meeting the demands associated with \ndecreasing budgets.\n  Both CBP and stakeholders have been exceedingly pleased with the \nresults of this pilot program. Unfortunately, it could come to an end.\n  In an effort to ensure the longevity of this program, language in the \nbill permanently authorizes portions of the Public-Private Partnership \nprogram for reimbursable services and donation authority and it \nestablishes a framework to guide its implementation in a responsible \nmanner.\n  Public-private partnership authority for CBP is a critical issue for \nborder communities like mine and has proven to be an essential tool to \nreduce wait times at the border and enhance the security of the \nhomeland. I believe that we can secure our border and facilitate the \nflow of goods and services at the same time. The public-private \npartnerships that would be codified by this law will ensure just that.\n  I would like to thank Representative Miller for her leadership on \nthis issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 3586 helps enhance the coordination and cooperation among DHS' \nborder security components, and it authorizes integral border security \nprograms that enhance homeland security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  When we think about some of the remunerative responsibilities that \nMembers of Congress have, certainly, securing our border is one of the \nmost important. As we can see by what is happening this year throughout \nthe country, there is an enormous amount of interest in making sure \nthat we do secure our border. I feel that this piece of legislation is \na critical component but that it is not nearly what we need to be doing \nto secure our border. We would like to see a border security bill come \nto the floor. At any rate, I think this is a very, very important piece \nof legislation.\n  Again, it is important to note that this has been a bipartisan effort \non this legislation, and I certainly appreciate the consideration and \nthe work that we have achieved together, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, as we have worked to secure our borders. I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 3586.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, and former ranking member of its Border and \nMaritime Security Subcommittee, I rise in support of H.R. 3586, the \n``Border and Maritime Coordination Improvement Act.''\n  Our Nation has thousands of miles of coastlines, lakes, and rivers \nand hundreds of ports\n\n[[Page H1663]]\n\nthat provide opportunities for legitimate travel, trade, and \nrecreation.\n  There are currently 328 ports of entry to the U.S., including 167 \nland ports of entry with Canada and Mexico, staffed by approximately \n21,000 CBP officers in the U.S. and abroad.\n  There are more people and goods coming through our ports of entry \nthan ever before.\n  Last fiscal year, CBP inspected more than 360 million travelers at \nour air, land, and sea ports of entry.\n  Since 2009, we have seen growth in both trade and travel.\n  In Fiscal Year 2013, total passenger volume was 6.4% higher and total \nimport value was nearly 40% higher than in Fiscal Year 2011.\n  Houston's George Bush International and the William P. Hobby Airports \nare vital hubs for domestic and international air travel:\n  1. Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through Bush International \nAirport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P. \nHobby (HOU);\n  2. More than 650 daily departures occur at IAH;\n  3. IAH is the 11th busiest airport in the U.S. for total passenger \ntraffic; and\n  4. IAH has 12 all-cargo airlines that handled more than 419,205 \nmetric tons of cargo in 2012.\n  It was reported in October 2015 that the William P. Hobby Airport has \nopened a new 280,000 ft complex that includes 5 gates for its \ninternational concourse in an effort to re-establish the airport's \ndaily international air service.\n  The addition is expected to support travel service for nearly 7,500 \ninternational passengers and 25 departing flights a day.\n  At the same time, these waterways offer opportunities for terrorists \nand their instruments, drug smugglers, and undocumented persons to \nenter our country.\n  Protecting the nation's border--land, air, and sea--from illegal \nentry of people, weapons, drugs, and contraband is vital to our \nhomeland security, as well as economic prosperity.\n  The Border and Maritime Coordination Improvement Act:\n  Creates an office of Biometric Identity Management;\n  Establishes the Border Security Joint Task Forces in the East, West \nand for investigations;\n  Updates the Maritime Operations Coordination Plan;\n  Establishes an Asset Development for the U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection Office of Air and Marine;\n  Secures the Transportation Worker Identification credential against \nuse by unauthorized aliens;\n  Creates a cost-benefit analysis of co-locating operational entities;\n  Evaluates the Coast Guard Deployable Specialized Forces;\n  Constructs an evaluation of Coast Guard Deployable Specialized \nForces; and\n  Establishes a Customs-Trade Partnership against Terrorism Improvement \namong other important changes.\n  I support this legislation because it will help protect the integrity \nof our borders and the security of our homeland.\n  H.R. 3586 provides specific responsibilities for the Undersecretary \nto establish and operate the newly implemented departmental Joint Task \nForces and appointing the directors to those joint task forces.\n  Under H.R. 3586, the Joint Task Force--East and Joint Task Force--\nWest is to execute a strategic plan to secure the land and maritime \nborders, which will coordinate criminal investigations supporting such \ntask forces.\n  The bill also directs the the DHS to establish additional Joint Task \nForces to:\n  1. coordinate operations along the northern border;\n  2. prevent and respond to homeland security crises;\n  3. establish other regionally based operations; and\n  4. combat cybersecurity.\n  The smuggling of illicit drugs, illegal immigrants, and contraband \nweapons over the Texas border is a major problem that needs to be \naddressed.\n  Approximately 1 million passengers and pedestrians cross the Texas \nborder on a daily basis; of these, on average 23 of these persons are \nwanted for arrest.\n  H.R. 3586 is a positive step in the right direction and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting its passage.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 3586, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1663-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1663-H1665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SOUTHWEST BORDER SECURITY THREAT ASSESSMENT ACT OF 2016\n\n  Ms. McSALLY.

Pursuant to \nthe rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Payne) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include any extraneous materials on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today, we are considering a critical piece of legislation that would \nrequire the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a full \nassessment of the threats that are coming across our southern border.\n  Evaluating our border threats regularly seems like common sense, \nespecially given the ever-evolving nature of cartel and smuggling \nactivity; yet DHS has not conducted a systematic threat assessment of \nour southern border in over 20 years. A lot has changed since then.\n  Southern Arizonans know well that our border is not secure. \nTransnational criminal organizations are trafficking drugs, money, \npeople, and weapons into and through our communities. This poses a \nsignificant public safety risk and national security threat. For my \nconstituents, this is not just an abstract issue but is something that \nis a part of their everyday lives.\n  The brave men and women of the Border Patrol do all they can with the \ntools they are provided, but they are restricted by outdated strategies \nand political leadership that does not have the resolve to let agents \ndo what they do best--secure the border. In addition, not only is our \nstrategy based off of outdated information, but the metrics used to \nmeasure that strategy are inconsistent and incomplete.\n  The last time DHS measured security along the border, which was in \n2010, a mere 44 percent of it was under operational control. Recently, \nDHS claimed they have been over 80 percent effective along the border; \nyet the best analytical research, using all available data, puts the \ntrue probability of apprehension much closer to 50 percent. Likewise, a \nmonth ago, in a hearing I led as the chairwoman of the Border and \nMaritime Security Subcommittee, the Border Patrol confirmed they have \nonly a little over 50 percent situational awareness of the border. That \nmeans, of illicit activity coming across our, roughly, 2,000-mile \nsouthern border, we only know of a little over half of it. We will \nnever secure the border unless we have a full awareness of where we are \ngetting beat by the cartels.\n  The first step to fixing something is actually understanding the \nproblem. My bill requires a full assessment of the threats along our \nsouthern border, including where we have vulnerabilities, where we can \nbetter leverage technology, and what percentage of situational \nawareness and operational control we have. Once we understand and \nidentify the gaps in our defenses, then we can develop a better plan to \naddress those shortfalls through a change of strategy that modifies how \nwe deploy agents, technology, and infrastructure. That is why my bill \nalso requires the U.S. Border Patrol to design a new strategic plan \nthat is based on a new threat analysis required by this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is always a lot of talk about securing the border \nhere in Washington, D.C. It is time to actually take some action. This \nbill is a critical first step in building trust in our system and in \nour ability to accurately measure illicit activity along the border and \nrespond to it. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4482, the Southwest Border Security Threat \nAssessment Act of 2016.\n  H.R. 4482 would help enhance the Department of Homeland Security's \nborder security efforts by enhancing DHS' understanding of the relevant \nvulnerabilities and capabilities and by requiring a strategic plan to \nensure border security personnel, technology, and infrastructure \nresources are being used to their fullest.\n  Specifically, the bill would require the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to assess vulnerabilities and capabilities on the southwest \nborder to help counter threats and illegal activities. The assessment \nis to include an analysis of the improvements needed at and between the \nports of entry; gaps in law and policy between State, local, and tribal \nlaw enforcement and international agreements that hinder border \nsecurity efforts; the flow of legitimate trade along the southwest \nborder; and the percentage of situational awareness and operational \ncontrol achieved by DHS in the region. The bill also requires the Chief \nof the Border Patrol to issue a Border Patrol Strategic Plan every 5 \nyears based on this assessment.\n  Last month, the bill was reported to the House by the Committee on \nHomeland Security after the inclusion of provisions that were offered \nby the ranking member, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), \nin order to strengthen an already good, commonsense bill.\n  H.R. 4482 would help the DHS and the Border Patrol, in particular, to \nunderstand and to mitigate border security threats, to improve \ncoordination and cooperation between DHS' border security components \nand partners, and to increase situational awareness along the border.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4482.\n\n[[Page H1665]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McSALLY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include any extraneous materials on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee \non Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise in \nsupport of H.R. 4509, the State and High-Risk Urban Area Working Group \nAct, which was introduced by the subcommittee's ranking member, \nCongressman Payne.\n  The Homeland Security Act requires States and urban areas that are \nreceiving State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Areas \nSecurity Initiative funds to have planning committees to determine how \nto efficiently and effectively expend these funds. H.R. 4509 expands \nthe stakeholders who are required to be involved in these committees to \ninclude representatives from public health, educational institutions, \nfusion centers, and interoperability coordinators, as appropriate.\n  In New York City, the New York City Police Department, the FDNY, \nemergency management, and public health, along with other partners, \nwork together to ensure that these grant funds provide the biggest \nreturn on investment for the city's security. Time and again, these \nofficials have told me how important these funds are to their ability \nto ensure the security of millions of residents, commuters, and \nvisitors in the city each day. They have used these funds to train \npersonnel, to conduct exercises, and to procure helicopters, fireboats, \ncameras, and radiation detection equipment.\n  This funding is vital now more than ever. Securing high-risk urban \nareas, like New York City, becomes more challenging every day \nconsidering the fact that we are at our highest threat level since the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks. That is why it is so outrageous that \nthe President's fiscal year 2017 budget proposes to cut more than $500 \nmillion from grants to support States, localities, ports, and transit \nsystems.\n  The Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and \nCommunications held a hearing last month on the proposed cuts. We heard \nfrom representatives of emergency management, law enforcement, the fire \nservice, and fusion centers. They all had the same message: these \ngrants have made a difference, and cutting them now would have \ndisastrous effects on their ability to prevent, to prepare for, and to \nrespond to terrorist attacks. Not only would they be unable to make new \nsecurity investments, but the investments they have made since 9/11 \nwould be eroded. In this threat environment, this is not the time to \nback away from our support of our Nation's first responders.\n  Mr. Speaker, the States and urban areas that are receiving Homeland \nSecurity grant funding take their responsibilities to secure their \nareas very seriously. They diligently work through the planning \ncommittees that are discussed in this bill in order to make sure they \nmake sound investments to secure their jurisdictions. The President \nmust take the security of these jurisdictions equally as seriously and \nfund these programs accordingly.\n  I support the passage of H.R. 4509.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4509, the State and High-Risk Urban Area \nWorking Group Act.\n  Before I begin my statement, I would like to support the comments \nmade by my chairman in his being very concerned about the cuts to the \ngrant that have been proposed.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I represent the 10th Congressional District of the State \nof New Jersey. Communities throughout my district from Newark to Jersey \nCity have built robust capabilities to prevent, protect against, and \nrespond to terrorist attacks and natural disasters with State Homeland \nSecurity grants and the Urban Areas Security Initiative funding.\n  I am proud of the progress New Jersey has made in preparing and \nprotecting against terrorist attacks with these important grant \ndollars. I cannot stress enough the critical role these funds play in \nmy district's ability to protect itself from terrorist attacks and \nnatural disasters.\n  Over the past 3\\1/2\\ years, I have served as the ranking member of \nthe Committee on Homeland Security's Emergency Preparedness \nSubcommittee. In this capacity, I have seen the benefits realized \nacross the Nation from DHS' Homeland Security Grant Program.\n  With this funding, State and local governments equip first responders \nwith the much-needed protective equipment and emergency communications \ntechnologies as well. These\n\n[[Page H1666]]\n\ngrants also help jurisdictions develop and exercise disaster response \nplans. These activities facilitate important relationships among the \nindividuals and entities that play critical roles in disaster \nprevention and response.\n  As successful as DHS' Homeland Security Grant Programs have been, \nhowever, more needs to be done to ensure those who are responsible for \nthe various aspects of the disaster response plan, train, and exercise \ntogether before a disaster strikes.\n  Indeed, Save the Children testified before my subcommittee about the \ndisconnect in some communities between emergency planners and school \ndistricts and childcare facilities.\n  A GAO report I requested with former subcommittee chair Susan Brooks \nreleased earlier this week revealed that about 68 percent of school \ndistricts surveyed incorporate the district emergency management plans \ninto the broader community's emergency management plan. That is good \nprogress, but we must do better.\n  The State and High-Risk Urban Area Working Group Act seeks to build \nupon the relationships that the State Homeland Security Grant Programs \nand the Urban Areas Security Initiative facilitate and to ensure \ndecisionmakers have a complete understanding of a community's \nvulnerabilities so that investments can be prioritized appropriately.\n  H.R. 4509 would facilitate the whole community approach to disaster \nplanning by identifying key players to be included in the State \nplanning committee's Urban Area Working Groups.\n  From firefighters and police to medical community and school \nofficials, H.R. 4509 would ensure that the right people are at the \ntable when decisions are made about how Federal Homeland Security Grant \nfunds are to be spent at the State and local levels.\n  H.R. 4509 was approved by the Committee on Homeland Security by voice \nvote, and similar language was approved in a larger package late last \nyear.\n  The legislation also has the support of the Security Industry \nAssociation, and I include in the Record a letter from the Association.\n\n                                Security Industry Association,\n\n                                                   March 22, 2016.\n     Hon. Donald Payne,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Payne: On behalf of the Security \n     Industry Association (SIA), and its more than 600 corporate \n     members, I would like to express our strong support for H.R. \n     4509, the State and High-Risk Urban Area Working Group Act, \n     which clarifies the roles and responsibilities of state \n     planning committees and urban area working groups under the \n     Homeland Security Grant Program.\n       H.R. 4509 amends Title 6 U.S.C. 611 to include additional \n     stakeholder representation in committees and working groups \n     that set local priorities for grants awarded through the \n     Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland \n     Security Grant Program (SHSGP). We believe this is critical \n     in light of recent attacks and broader terrorist threats \n     against vulnerable targets such as schools and workplaces, \n     and the desire of state and local governments to provide \n     additional protections and response capabilities.\n       SIA and its members believe that the inclusion of \n     educational facilities, emergency communications coordinators \n     and fusion centers will help improve state and local homeland \n     security grant planning processes as they are aligned with \n     evolving threats.\n       SIA members have assisted many homeland security grantees \n     with technology solutions essential to securing critical \n     infrastructure such as maritime ports and airports, schools, \n     power generation and transmission systems, hospitals, \n     factories, transit systems, and governmental buildings.\n       SIA urges swift consideration of H.R. 4509 by the House \n     Homeland Security Committee, and on the House floor. We stand \n     ready to provide any further information you may need. Thank \n     you for your time and attention to this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Don Erickson,\n                               CEO, Security Industry Association.\n\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4509, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. If the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey has no other speakers, I am prepared to close once the \ngentleman does.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4509. I thank \nthe gentleman from New Jersey for his astuteness, along with Mr. \nWalden, for a very important initiative.\n  Having been on the Homeland Security Committee since the tragic \nterrorist attack against the United States, I have watched the \nformation of this department and the issues that are important to \nsecure America.\n  I have lived through various processes and various disasters that are \nnot terrorist related to know how important these grants overall are.\n  The grants, in particular, that are dealing with this bill in \nplanning committee are extremely important to add to the planning \ncommittee those individuals who are beyond the very able work of our \nfirefighters and police officers. Those are first responders. But it is \nvery important to engage the community, such as schools, medical \nprofessions, and beyond.\n  I hope, as this legislation passes, we will also look to having on \nthe planning committee some of the leaders on Homeland Security issues \nthat are in our community.\n  For example, I have an individual by the name of Charles X. White who \nhas led issues on homeland security for a very long time. His activism \ncreated an opportunity for there to be a homeland security specialty \nand discipline at Texas Southern University because the community is \ninvolved, involved on issues of evacuation, involved on issues of \nrestoration, involved on issues of making sure funding gets to those \nnecessary entities that may not be known on a global sense and, when I \nsay that, in a countywide, city-wide, or statewide sense.\n  They provide the insight into neighborhoods. I think it is important \nthat, as this bill makes its way, its interpretation will be that we \nadd community leaders who are the kind of persons who are engaged with \nthe day-to-day goings-on of neighborhoods, knowing how important it is \nfor them to be heard during times of a terrorist act or any other \ndisaster to be restored.\n  Again, I am grateful for this legislation and the leadership of Mr. \nPayne and Mr. Walden. I ask my colleagues to enthusiastically support \nthis legislation.\n  To those who may be engaged all around America with preparedness, it \nis important, of course, to have every aspect of our community involved \nin these planning committees so that their voices can be heard on how \nbest to heal, to solve, and to restore after a tragedy has occurred in \nour local communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4482, a legislation that will \nrequire an analysis of the Southwest Border Threat from the Secretary \nof Homeland Security and a Border Patrol Strategic Plan from the Chief \nof the Border Patrol.\n  I support this legislation as a senior member of the House Committee \non Homeland Security and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations; \nI believe that Congress can and should do more to ensure the safety of \nour southern border from terrorism and criminal threats.\n  My service in the House of Representatives has focused on making sure \nthat our nation is secure and prosperous.\n  The U.S. has thousands of miles of coastlines, lakes, and rivers and \nhundreds of ports that provide opportunities for legitimate travel, \ntrade, and recreation.\n  Ports serve as America's gateway to the global economy since the \nnation's economic prosperity rests on the ability of containerized and \nbulk cargo arriving unimpeded at U.S. ports to support the rapid \ndelivery system that underpins the manufacturing and retail sectors.\n  A central component of national security is the ability of our \ninternational ports to move goods in and out of the country.\n  According to the Department of Commerce in 2012, Texas exports \ntotaled $265 billion.\n  In 2012, ship channel-related businesses contributed 1,026,820 jobs \nand generated more than $178.5 billion in statewide economic activity.\n  The Port of Houston is a 25-mile-long complex of diversified public \nand private facilities located just a few hours' sailing time from the \nGulf of Mexico.\n  In 2014, the Port of Houston was ranked among U.S. ports:\n  1st in foreign tonnage;\n  1st among Texas ports with 46% of market share by tonnage and 95% \nmarket share in containers by total TEUS in 2014;\n  1st among Gulf Coast container ports, handling 67% of U.S. Gulf Coast \ncontainer traffic in 2014; and\n  2nd in U.S. ports in terms of total foreign cargo value (based on \nU.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census).\n  The Government Accountability Office (GAO), reports that the Port of \nHouston and\n\n[[Page H1667]]\n\nits waterways and vessels, are part of an economic engine handling more \nthan $700 billion in cargo annually.\n  The Port of Houston houses approximately 100 steamship lines offering \nservices that link Houston with 1,053 ports in 203 countries.\n  The Port of Houston is home to a $15 billion petrochemical complex, \nthe largest in the nation and second largest in the world.\n  With the nation's largest petrochemical complex supplying over 40 \npercent of the nation's base petrochemical manufacturing capacity, what \nhappens at the Port of Houston affects the entire nation.\n  At the same time, these waterways offer opportunities for terrorists \nand their instruments, drug smugglers, and undocumented persons to \nenter our country.\n  U.S. seaports, like the Port of Houston, are vulnerable to terrorist \nattacks.\n  H.R. 4482 will require the Secretary of Homeland Security to analyze \nand assess the southwest border threat:\n  Terrorism and criminal threats seeking unlawful entrance to the U.S. \nthrough the southwest border or exploiting border vulnerabilities;\n  Improvements needed in border ports to prevent the entrance of \nterrorism into the U.S.;\n  Law, policy, cooperation between state, local or tribal law \nenforcement, international or tribal agreements that hinder effective \nand efficient border security, counterterrorism, anti-human smuggling \nand trafficking efforts and legitimate trade along the southwest \nborder;\n  Current percentage of situational awareness and operational control \nof U.S. borders achieved by DHS of international land and maritime \nborders of the U.S.\n  H.R. 4482 will require the Chief of the Border Patrol to issue by \nMarch 1, 2017, and every five years after, a Border Patrol Strategic \nPlan:\n  Evaluation of southwest border threat analysis;\n  Assessment of principal border security threats;\n  Efforts to focus intelligence collection to disrupt transnational \ncriminal organizations outside of U.S. borders;\n  Ensure new border security technology can be operationally integrated \nwith existing DHS technologies;\n  Technology required to maintain, support, and enhance security and \nfacilitate trade at ports of entry;\n  Cooperative agreements and information sharing with state, local, and \nfederal law enforcement agencies that have jurisdiction on the northern \nand southern borders;\n  Prioritized list of research and development objective to enhance the \nsecurity of borders;\n  Assessment of training programs for detecting fraudulent documents, \nunderstanding scope of enforcement authorities and the use of force \npolicies, and screening, identifying, and addressing vulnerable \npopulations;\n  Assessment of how border security operations affect crossing times.\n  Let me close by reminding my colleagues that earlier this year we \npassed the Northern Border Security Act, which secured our border with \nCanada.\n  Now it is time to protect our Southern Border, therefore I urge all \nMembers to join me in voting to pass H.R. 4482.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Time and time again, we have learned the true value of Homeland \nSecurity grant dollars comes from the relationships built through \nplanning, training, and exercises that are done in these communities.\n  H.R. 4509 would facilitate the whole community approach to disaster \nresponse and planning by adopting a more inclusive definition of \nemergency response.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity as well as the Security Industry Association for their \nsupport.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4509.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4509, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1667-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1667-H1670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TREATING SMALL AIRPORTS WITH FAIRNESS ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 4549) to require the Transportation Security \nAdministration to conduct security screening at certain airports, and \nfor other purposes, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4549\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Treating Small Airports with \n     Fairness Act of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONDUCT OF SECURITY SCREENING BY THE TRANSPORTATION \n                   SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AT CERTAIN AIRPORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Transportation \n     Security Administration shall provide for security screening \n     to be conducted by the Transportation Security Administration \n     at, and provide all necessary staff and equipment to, any \n     airport--\n       (1) that lost commercial air service on or after January 1, \n     2013; and\n       (2) the operator of which, following the loss described in \n     paragraph (1), submits to the Administrator--\n       (A) a request for security screening to be conducted at \n     such airport by the Transportation Security Administration; \n     and\n       (B) written confirmation of a commitment from a commercial \n     air carrier--\n       (i) that such air carrier intends to resume commercial air \n     service at such airport; and\n       (ii) to resume such service not later than the date that is \n     one year after the date of the submission of the request \n     under subparagraph (A).\n       (b) Deadline.--Subject to the one-year limitation described \n     in subsection (a)(2)(B)(ii), the Administrator of the \n     Transportation Security Administration shall ensure that the \n     process of implementing security screening by the \n     Transportation Security Administration at an airport \n     described in subsection (a) is complete not later than the \n     later of--\n       (1) the date that is 90 days after the date on which the \n     operator of such airport submits to the Administrator a \n     request for such screening under paragraph (2)(A) of such \n     subsection; or\n       (2) the date on which the commercial air carrier that is \n     the subject of such a request intends to resume commercial \n     air service at such airport.\n       (c) Effects on Other Airports.--The Administrator of the \n     Transportation Security Administration shall carry out this \n     section in a manner that does not negatively affect \n     operations at airports not described in this section that are \n     otherwise provided security screening conducted by the \n     Transportation Security Administration.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Walker). Pursuant to the rule, the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPayne) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As a Representative, I love fighting for the little guy, battling the \nbureaucracy on behalf of those who can't. Today I am fighting for the \nlittle airports.\n  I think that the people who are dependent on small airports in order \nto travel and conduct business deserve the same security that those at \nlarger airports get. And this isn't just about security. It is about \njobs and the economy.\n  In the past 3 years, nearly 30 airports across the country have lost \ncommercial service. This wreaks havoc on the local economy and, \nultimately, the community. In at least six of these cases, airlines \nhave reevaluated and sought to return at a later date.\n  Unfortunately, in many cases, even if it has only been several \nmonths, TSA has already removed their resources from the airports and \nhave refused to return. The irony is that many of these airports have \nsimultaneously been awarded funding by the U.S. Department of \nTransportation in order to regain and promote commercial air service.\n  While one Federal agency agrees to invest in getting the airport up \nand going, another Federal agency is refusing to provide security \nscreening. This makes no sense from a budgetary standpoint and is \nsimply unfair.\n\n[[Page H1668]]\n\n  These airports are located in important cities. For example, Del Rio \nis home to Laughlin Air Force Base, numerous DHS facilities, and a \ngrowing community that facilitates international trade between the U.S. \nand Mexico.\n  Given the national and homeland security-related institutions \nserviced directly by the Del Rio airport and the potential boost to the \neconomy, it only makes sense to provide basic screening.\n  Del Rio, Texas, is not alone. This is playing out across the country \nfrom New Jersey to California. By screening these passengers at the \npoint of origin, we are further decreasing wait times at our larger hub \nairports.\n  The bill is a bipartisan effort and has passed out of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee with unanimous support. Equally bipartisan companion \nlegislation with the exact same language has been included in the \nSenate's FAA reauthorization, which passed out of committee unanimously \nas well.\n  We are all in agreement that this is an important step towards \nachieving economic and national security. I want to thank my fellow \nMembers, Representatives Walden, DeFazio, Lummis, Kilmer, and Davis, \nwho cosponsored this piece of legislation.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAYNE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4549, the Treating Small \nAirports with Fairness Act of 2016.\n  Under this act, TSA would be required to provide staffing and \nscreening equipment to any airport that lost commercial air service on \nor after January 1, 2013, if the operator submits a request to TSA \ntogether with a written commitment from a commercial air carrier that \nsuch carrier intends to resume service at such airport not later than 1 \nyear after the date on which the request is submitted.\n  It is my understanding that, without this legislation or alternative \nmeasures, should commercial service return to the affected airports, \nthe passengers who depart the airport would fly unscreened to their \ndestination and be subject to security screening upon arrival if they \nhave to connect to another destination via commercial air flight.\n  The potential universe of airports that are believed to be implicated \nby this legislation is over 20, but there are at least 6 airports that \nare expected to pursue Federal screening operations.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  As a member of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, I believe \nthat it is important that passengers undergo a security screening \nbefore boarding commercial flights.\n  As we have heard from TSA and various media reports, this travel \nseason is expected to be the busiest in many years. One of the factors \ncontributing to the long wait times at airports across the Nation is \nthe lack of adequate staffing.\n  During consideration of this measure in committee, the committee \napproved an amendment offered by the ranking member, Mr. Thompson, to \nensure that when TSA acts to implement this law and provides screening \nservices to new airports, they do not do so at the expense of other \nairports in the system.\n  If TSA does this right and manages its staffing resources in a \nthoughtful and holistic manner, there is no reason for other airports \nto be negatively impacted.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume \nto the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the principal author of this \nlegislation, a gentleman who has been fighting for small communities \nand communities all over the country.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Hurd for his \nleadership on this issue. I want to thank as well the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Payne), the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), \nand the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) for helping us out on this, \nand certainly Chairman Michael McCaul.\n  This answer by the TSA makes no sense from a security standpoint and \nhurts our smaller communities that may go from time to time without air \nservice but clamor for air service. If you are a big airport and you \nlose a carrier, you probably have several others there serving the \npeople of that area.\n  If you are a small airport and you have one carrier, as is the case \nin Klamath Falls, Oregon, in June of 2014, when SkyWest pulled out, \nthey had no other carriers, so they immediately began to seek \nadditional air service. The city of Klamath Falls acted diligently. \nThey recruited a new partner, Peninsula Airways, in July of 2015, so \nlike a year later they had somebody in line and everything was working \nout.\n  They go to TSA, and TSA says: No, we are not coming back.\n  Their answer was to reverse screen.\n  I said: Well, what is that?\n  Well, that means you board the 28- or 30-passenger airplane with all \nyour luggage, everything else, and then you fly--in this case 236 miles \nnorth to Portland, Oregon, Oregon's largest city--then you deplane on \nthe tarmac, and you come back through like you had just driven up.\n  Well, that is an interesting way to provide security for the Nation's \ncommunities and airplanes because that means you have flown right up \nthe entire length of Oregon, from the California border down here in \nKlamath Falls all the way to Portland.\n  Now, let me put that in an East Coast perspective for you. That would \nbe like boarding a plane in Raleigh-Durham International Airport down \nin Raleigh, North Carolina, and then you would fly all the way up to \nReagan Washington National Airport, up to DCA here. Actually, we go 4 \nmiles farther in Oregon, but we will leave that aside for the moment, \n232 miles versus 236. Then you get off the airplane here at Reagan \nNational, and then we will screen you. We will find out what you are \ncarrying, what is in your bags, and then we will put you on a \nconnecting flight.\n  Does anybody think that is good security? Does anybody think that \npeople who want to do us harm aren't going to figure that gaping hole \nout?\n  Portland International Airport was willing to work with us, but it \nmade no sense. So we pleaded with TSA: Can't you come back? You were \nhere before. It won't take much.\n  And they basically said no. And that is what brings us here today. \nFor our Nation's security, for the economic security of our small \ncommunities, we need to pass this bipartisan legislation.\n  On a side note, the Nation's only F-15 training unit is in Klamath \nFalls at Kingsley Airfield. So our F-15 pilots have to come out now, \nand rather than fly into Klamath Falls, they have to fly into an \nairport that is at least, well, on a bad day probably 2 hours over the \nmountains, and then come over. So we are paying all that extra \ntransportation cost, we are paying hotels, everything else, delaying \ntheir access to training, and that doesn't make sense, either.\n  So let's be safe and secure. Let's be smart and prudent. Let's pass \nthis legislation and allow our communities to have the air service they \nneed and our country to have the security that we demand. This is \ncommonsense legislation that we need to pass. I thank both sides of the \naisle for their great work on this with us. Together, we are going to \ndo the right policy even when TSA wouldn't.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio).\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me the \ntime and for his support of the bill. I thank the majority side also.\n  I don't represent the area where this airport is located, but Greg \nWalden and I represent two of the largest districts, geographically \nspeaking, in Congress. The problems that are created by the lack of air \nservice to Klamath Falls, the gentleman has already well documented. It \nis about a 4-hour drive to Portland, which is the nearest place where \nyou can get a variety of hubbed destinations out of there. Flying a \nplane into the Portland metropolitan area, twin-engine, fairly heavy \nplane with no screening and no security, defies common sense.\n  Now, unfortunately, I was principal, after 9/11, with John Mica in \ncreating TSA, and there are days when we have concerns and regrets, and \nthis is certainly one of them. It was not our intent to create an \nagency that could dictate who could and couldn't have air service. That \nis not within TSA's scope\n\n[[Page H1669]]\n\nof jurisdiction. This is outrageous that they would try to deny this.\n  Remember, TSA, you can't lobby Congress. But I hear they have been \nlobbying in some phone calls, saying: this will cost $50 million; it \nwill take away service from your airport, which is why the committee \nsaid they can't take it away.\n  No, these are going to be part-time screeners. Klamath Falls has even \noffered to hire private screeners. TSA says no. TSA is giving away \nequipment, surplusing equipment that is still perfectly functional for \nan airport like Klamath Falls, so there is no cost involved there. At \nworst, they are going to have a few part-time screeners and they are \ngoing to have to move the surplus equipment there and plug it back in. \nThis isn't going to cost millions of dollars.\n  This is, plain and simple, a commonsense approach to how we will make \nour entire system safer and also provide what small cities need. \nAirports are a critical, critical factor in economic development and \nrecruitment for small cities across the western United States. When you \nhave a willing partner, a growing airline, PenAir, that has signed a \ncommitment to come back in and provide service, as they do for some \ncommunities in my district, then it is not the place of the TSA to say, \noh, no, hold it up, sorry, can't do that. PenAir probably wouldn't even \nbe willing to provide the service without screening because what would \ntheir liability be if they are flying unscreened passengers on a \ncommercial airline? I am not even sure what the FAA would have to say \nabout that.\n\n  This is absolutely outrageous, and it is just absurd that Congress \nhas to step in and act to rectify this misguided step by the TSA, but \nby passing this bill, we will. I recommend this bill to my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Huelskamp).\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues from Texas and \nacross the Nation who, as I have discovered with this bill, have \nsimilar problems. In my particular case, it is the city of Salina, \nKansas, which is located only 100 miles from the closest hub, and it \nhas long provided valuable air service either to Kansas City or a \nlittle bit farther to Denver. Due to circumstances beyond Salina's \ncontrol, just in January their air carrier stopped providing flights \nfrom Salina, and TSA obviously withdrew screening services.\n  However, just a few weeks later--just a few weeks later--the airport \nand Great Lakes Airlines reached an exciting agreement to restore air \nservice to and from Salina. As we have heard the same story, the \nairport sent a request to TSA asking them to reinstate screening \nservices--again, this is just a few weeks after they had ended the \nservices--to begin these much-needed flights.\n  Shortly thereafter, without adequate explanation, TSA, of course as \nwe have heard, denied the request. I soon learned from other airports, \nother communities across America that I wasn't alone. Other airports \nlocated predominantly in rural communities, in nearly identical \nsituations, were also being denied screening services.\n  Perhaps most troubling to me--and I heard a lot of troubling \ntestimony here--was that no credible reason was given for declining the \nscreening services, again, just a few weeks after they were still \nscreening flights in Salina, Kansas, saying we can't do it now.\n  I believe our rural communities in Kansas and others across the \nNation are tired of being left with the short end of the stick and \nWashington bureaucrats thinking they can get away with it.\n  In response to these lame excuses, I urge passage of our TSA Fairness \nAct today. This legislation will reverse the denial by TSA and ensure \nthey stop discriminating against rural communities like Salina, Kansas. \nThe service agreement they have reached with Great Lakes Airlines will \nsupport our region's continued economic growth. As the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access, I understand \nhow important reliable air service is for Salina, Kansas, and our \nregion. It is a simple fix with this bill.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Texas carrying this on the floor. It \nwill ensure TSA continues to fulfill its mission, which is to ensure \nfreedom of movement for people and commerce, and again for Salina and \nother rural communities across Kansas.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. \nI thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the sponsor of this \nbill, as well as the numbers of individuals who came to the floor.\n  I chaired the Subcommittee on Transportation Security of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security some years ago and happily remain on \nthat committee because I do think it has a crucial and important role. \nI do believe in your cause and in this legislation.\n  We like to think of rural America as being tranquil areas. But in \nlight of the recent incident in Brussels, many of us who are students \nof aviation security are well aware of a number of elements of \nweakness, period. Whether or not it is the perimeters of the airports \nor ingress and egress of airports, whether or not it is the access of \nemployees, of which we make no general indictment of the hardworking \nindividuals who work at airports, but we know that the ingress and \negress in many of our large airports still gives us pause, and now, \nobviously, the conspicuous utilization of the open space where the \nterrorists did their havoc in Brussels.\n  We would hope that would not be the case in America, and as well in \nrural airports. But certainly if a commercial airline comes back to a \nrural community, they need appropriate security. As we grow in \ndeveloping our security matrix, they may need security that expands \ninto the outer areas, depending upon risks. But the one thing we know \nis that they need to fall in the category of what we said after 9/11: a \nprofessional, well-trained security team, the Transportation Security \nAdministration and TSO.\n  I have a lot of confidence, as I have had in previous TSA \nAdministrators, in their understanding of the seriousness of their \nresponsibilities. I have the same kind of confidence in the admiral, \nalong with Secretary Johnson, that they understand that we are the \nfront line on securing this Nation. So the airports that have a \ncommercial airline signed, agreed, and sealed need that kind of \nsecurity. We must leave no stone unturned as it relates to airport \nsecurity.\n  Now, obviously, with no security mechanism, it makes it difficult to \nhave a commercial structure, but more importantly, it opens up the \nairport system to get into, if you will, the system of travel and, not \nknowing how terrorists think, to start at one point that is more \nvulnerable than others and wind up in the Nation's busiest airports.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  So I support this legislation. I look forward to determining and \nencouraging funding for this expansion. Obviously, that would be the \nconcern--certainly, in the appropriations process--and I can only \nimagine that there are those of us who are committed in a bipartisan \nway to making sure that every aspect of the Nation's travel system, \nwhether you are going from rail to bus to plane or in any other manner, \nis, of course, protected.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank Mr. \nPayne and Mr. Hurd for their leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee and a \nformer chair of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and \nInfrastructure Protection, I rise in support of H.R. 4549, ``Treating \nSmall Airports with Fairness Act of 2016'' which requires the \nTransportation Security Administration (TSA) to restore security and \nscreening services to any airport that lost air services after January \n1, 2013 but has a guarantee from a commercial airline to resume \nservice.\n  A number of airports in rural parts of the United States have lost \ncommercial air service in the past years.\n  Those living in rural areas without easy access by highway to other \nairports have lost a vital travel option.\n  Once an airport receives a commitment from an airline to begin or re-\nestablish service it at an airport, it also must get TSA to re-\nestablish passenger and baggage screening, but in some cases TSA denies \nthe airport's request to re-establish security screening.\n  For example, TSA at Crater Lake-Klamath Regional Airport in southern \nOregon denied\n\n[[Page H1670]]\n\nthe airport's request to restore security screening, citing the \nunpredictability of air service in the region and the inability to \nmaintain consistent passenger loads.\n  Without TSA security screenings, airports must make alternative \nsecurity arrangements, such as having security screening of passengers \nand baggage occur once the flight arrives at a large connection \nairport.\n  Under H.R. 4549, TSA must begin security screenings at an airport \neither 90 days after a request for screening is made by the airport or \nwhen commercial air service commences, whichever is later.\n  This requirement would apply only to airports where the airline has \nsaid it will resume services within a year of when the airport has \nrequested the restoration of TSA screening.\n  Small cities in 25 States have lost commercial air service and the \nlocal economy of the cities involved suffers.\n  The loss of airports in these small communities results in using \nsmall propeller-powered planes that charge fares much higher \nproportionately than those of conventional airlines.\n  Closing airports in these cities results in lost tourist dollars and \nairport revenue which benefits the community tremendously.\n  H.R. 4549 directs TSA to restore security and screening services to \nairports that lost air service and have a guarantee from a commercial \nairline to resume service.\n  H.R. 4549 requires restoration of TSA screening to a limited number \nof airports that have a guarantee from a commercial airline including: \nKlamath Falls, Oregon; Del Rio, Texas; Sheridan, Wyoming; and Salina, \nKansas.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 4549.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to note the bipartisan nature \nin which this measure comes to the floor today. I thank Members for \ntheir support of this measure, and I encourage support for this \nlegislation. Enactment will contribute to strengthening the aviation \nsecurity system by ensuring that passengers undergo screening before \nboarding commercial flights.\n  I had the pleasure of being in south Texas in the last week, and I \nflew out of McAllen, Texas. I see the nature and size of these \nairports; but, nevertheless, they should have the same support as the \nlarger airports.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today is a good day. Despite the circus atmosphere that \nwe often see in Washington, D.C., we are strengthening national \nsecurity and improving the communities across our Nation, and we are \ndoing this in a bipartisan effort.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and, \nagain, urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4549.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 4549, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1670-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1670-H1672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ENHANCING OVERSEAS TRAVELER VETTING ACT\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill \n(H.R. 4403) to authorize the development of open-source software based \non certain systems of the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of State to facilitate the vetting of travelers against \nterrorist watchlists and law enforcement databases, enhance border \nmanagement, and improve targeting and analysis, and for other purposes, \nas amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4403\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing Overseas Traveler \n     Vetting Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. OPEN-SOURCE SCREENING SOFTWARE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (c), the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State--\n       (1) are authorized to develop open-source software based on \n     U.S. Customs and Border Protection's global travel targeting \n     and analysis systems and the Department of State's \n     watchlisting, identification, and screening systems in order \n     to facilitate the vetting of travelers against terrorist \n     watchlists and law enforcement databases, enhance border \n     management, and improve targeting and analysis; and\n       (2) may make such software and any related technical \n     assistance or training available to foreign governments or \n     multilateral organizations for such purposes.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security and Secretary of State shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a plan to implement \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Provision of Software and Congressional Notification.--\n     Not later than 15 days before the open-source software \n     described in subsection (a) is made available to foreign \n     governments or multilateral organizations pursuant to such \n     subsection, the Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary \n     of State, with the concurrence of the Director of National \n     Intelligence, shall--\n       (1) certify to the appropriate congressional committees \n     that such availability is in the national security interests \n     of the United States; and\n       (2) provide to such committees information on how such \n     software or any related technical assistance or training will \n     be made available.\n       (d) Rule of Construction.--The authority provided under \n     this section shall be exercised in accordance with applicable \n     provisions of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et \n     seq.), the Export Administration Regulations, or any other \n     similar provision of law.\n       (e) Prohibition on Additional Funding.--No additional funds \n     are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section.\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) in the House of Representatives--\n       (i) the Committee on Homeland Security; and\n       (ii) the Committee on Foreign Affairs; and\n       (B) in the Senate--\n       (i) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs; and\n       (ii) the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n       (2) Export administration regulations.--The term ``Export \n     Administration Regulations'' means--\n       (A) the Export Administration Regulations as maintained and \n     amended under the authority of the International Emergency \n     Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and codified in \n     subchapter C of chapter VII of title 15, Code of Federal \n     Regulations; or\n       (B) any successor regulations.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous material on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to begin by thanking our colleague, Mr. Hurd from Texas, \nfor his work here on behalf of the safety and security of the American \npeople. He is a former CIA undercover officer. As a result of that, I \nthink he had some unique insights here in moving this legislation. The \nname of this bill is Enhancing Overseas Traveler Vetting Act.\n  I would also like to thank one other Member, and that is the Homeland \nSecurity chairman, Mr. McCaul. He is also on the committee that Mr. \nSherman and I serve on, but I thank him for his leadership on the \nbipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter \nTravel. That task force made recommendations, with the help of Mr. \nHurd, and it led to the introduction of this important piece of \nlegislation. It was passed out of the committee I chair, the Foreign \nAffairs Committee, back in February. I also want to recognize Mr. Eliot \nEngel and Mr. Sherman for their assistance and support on this as well.\n  I think the reason this has such resonance with the Members in the \nHouse is because the global threat of terrorism has never been as high \nas it is today. In just the last 12 months, we have seen terrorists \nstrike in my home State of California; we have seen it in France, \nBelgium, Turkey, India, Tunisia--where I just was a few days ago--the \nIvory Coast, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Iraq. We were up in Erbil and \nBaghdad.\n  And I have got to tell you, this is a situation that is compounding. \nNo\n\n[[Page H1671]]\n\ncountry is immune. This radical ideology that is now on the Internet--a \nvirtual caliphate on the Internet, we should call it--knows no \nboundaries. It is pulling individuals from all over the globe. It is \nradicalizing them and, increasingly, doing it without them even having \nto leave their neighborhood.\n  I just returned, as I mentioned, from Iraq, Tunisia, and Jordan, and \nI heard firsthand there about the foreign fighter threat. You have got \n35,000 foreigners right now, and 3,600 of them were from Europe. They \nare actually from a total of 120 countries. They have traveled to the \nMiddle East to join ISIS. Many of these fighters are now looking to \nreturn to their homes back in Brussels, back in Paris and the capitals \nof Europe--even here in the United States.\n  Bazi was the name of a young girl who testified before our committee. \nMr. Sherman and I remember some of the things she told us. She was \ntaken captive by an American who had been recruited over the Internet \nto join ISIS. She became his concubine, and he felt compelled to tell \nher this was part of his ideology. He had converted to this. As a \nresult of her being an apostate, she had to go through what other \nYazidis and Christians and other faiths had to go through, which was to \nsubmit to him and to the will of his particular code.\n  Eventually, she got loose. She got free of him and told us that tale \nof how, ultimately, she lost every male in the village--all her \nbrothers--and how her sisters are now concubines. Many of them were \nforeign fighters, and that is why information sharing between countries \nis more critical now than ever, because this thing is everywhere now.\n  The bipartisan task force's report highlighted the lack of any \ncomprehensive global database of foreign fighters and suspected \nterrorists. In its absence, the U.S. and other countries rely on a \npatchwork system for exchanging extremist identities, which is weak and \nincreases the odds that foreign fighters and suspected terrorists will \nbe able to cross borders undetected.\n  So this bill, thanks to Mr. Hurd's expertise, will authorize the \nSecretaries of the Department of State and Homeland Security to develop \nopen-source software platforms to vet travelers against terrorist watch \nlists and against law enforcement databases. It permits the open-source \nsoftware to be shared with foreign governments and multilateral \norganizations for police purposes, like INTERPOL.\n  This bill reflects the recommendations made by, as I said, our \ncolleagues on the task force, which we have worked together on. I thank \nMr. Hurd and Chairman McCaul for their leadership working to make our \nNation safer against terrorist threats.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 4403, the Enhancing Overseas Traveler \nVetting Act.\n  I want to associate myself with the comments of our committee chair, \nparticularly his praise for the hard work of Mr. Hurd and the \ninvolvement of Chairman McCaul of the Homeland Security Committee.\n  I am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I supported it in the House \nForeign Affairs Committee, which considered the bill on February 24, \nand voted it out by voice unanimously, with no opposition. It is also \nmy understanding that the bill also passed unanimously in the Committee \non Homeland Security.\n  As the chairman of our committee explained, this legislation \nauthorizes the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security \nto develop open-source versions of software that vets travelers against \nterrorist watch lists and law enforcement databases. Once the software \nis developed, we will be able to share it with our allies and \nmultilateral organizations involved in police work, such as INTERPOL. \nThat means that we will have better software in the hands of worldwide \nlaw enforcement sooner and it will be interoperable.\n  As things stand now, we do not have a comprehensive global database \nfor identifying and tracking terrorists. As the bipartisan Task Force \non Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, which was \nestablished by Chairman McCaul and the Committee on Homeland Security, \nhighlighted in its September 2015 report, ``countries, including the \nUnited States, rely on a patchwork system for swapping extremist \nidentities, increasing the odds foreign fighters will slip through the \ncracks.''\n  The Paris and Brussels terrorist attacks demonstrate the need for a \nglobal system. Since those tragedies, there has been finger pointing \nabout missed intelligence and criticism over the lack of information \nsharing across borders.\n  Just in February, Europol warned that more than 5,000 Europeans with \nEuropean passports had traveled to ISIS and Syria to become ISIS \nfighters. In late March, European security officials told the \nAssociated Press that the Islamic State group had trained at least 400 \nattackers and sent them to Europe to carry out specific attacks.\n  Of course, we have a visa waiver relationship with most of Europe, \nand that means these European passport holders will be able to visit \nthe United States without special vetting by our officials. There is an \nexception to that for those European passports that have been stamped \nindicating they visited Syria or Iraq.\n  This should not give us a whole lot of false security because, \ntypically, foreign fighters who want to join ISIS travel to Turkey, \nwhere their passport is stamped with a Turkish stamp and then they \nsneak into ISIS-controlled areas. ISIS does not stamp their passport \nentry into the Islamic State, so the passports of these Europeans that \nhave gone to fight for ISIS in Iraq and Syria do not bear a Syrian or \nIraqi stamp.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  In addition, if, for some reason, they did bear such a stamp, any \nEuropean can simply go and ask for a replacement passport and, in most \ncases, there will be no record available to the United States that this \nperson had ever visited Syria or Iraq.\n  So we need a system that gives us the best possible opportunity to \nidentify foreign fighters, but especially those who hold European \npassports.\n  If we are going to fight and prevent global terrorism in tandem with \nother countries, the United States and our allies must be on the same \npage when it comes to vetting travelers and tracking would-be \nterrorists. This legislation helps us do just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4403.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd), who is a member of the Committee on \nHomeland Security, and he is also the author of this bill.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Sherman for \nhis support of this bill; and I would like to thank Chairman Royce, not \nonly for his support of this bill, but for everything that he does on \nhis committee to make sure that our allies know that they can trust us \nand that our enemies know they should fear us.\n  Last month, terrorists struck again in the heart of Europe. Their \nattack in Brussels was part of a wider ISIS campaign to ramp up \nexternal operations. Already, the group has been tied to more than 80 \nterrorist plots or attacks against the West. This is an unprecedented \nfigure.\n  We have been sounding the alarm here in Congress about the rising \ntide of terror, as well as the global security gaps being exploited by \nextremists. My bill, H.R. 4403, would help close one of those major \nloopholes to make it harder for terrorists to cross borders.\n  This bill was a recommendation of the bipartisan Task Force on \nCombating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, on which I served.\n  In our final report in September, we found that ``gaping security \nweaknesses overseas--especially in Europe--are putting the U.S. \nhomeland in danger by making it easier for aspiring foreign fighters to \nmigrate to terrorist hotspots and for jihadists to return to the \nWest.''\n  I saw firsthand that our partners are in a pre-9/11 mindset, and that \nmany of them have failed to conduct adequate counterterrorism \nscreening. For instance, key operatives behind the Paris and Brussels \nattacks managed to travel back and forth to Syria and throughout \nEurope, undetected, even though some were on terrorist watch lists. \nThis should not just be a wake-up call, it should be a call to action.\n\n[[Page H1672]]\n\n  My bill would allow the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of State to develop specially tailored, open-source watch-\nlisting and screening systems to help our foreign partners disrupt \nterrorist travel. We have an interest in providing it to several \nforeign countries, and we should do that.\n  However, as a matter of overarching Federal policy, this bill does \nnot choose open-source over proprietary. Indeed, the Federal Government \nshould consider proprietary and open-source software and make an \neducated choice on which one fits the need the best. In this case, \nproviding our partners with software they trust simply makes sense.\n  Thousands of ISIS fighters have Western passports, and if our \noverseas partners don't stop them first, we might have to confront them \nhere at home. Yet many governments lack the capacity to properly vet \ntravelers and weed out known or suspected jihadists. That is why we \nmust act today on this legislation and send a clear signal to our \nallies that America is ready to lead this fight.\n  I want to thank my fellow members on the task force for their hard \nwork, and I want to particularly thank Mr. Vela and Mr. Keating, on the \nDemocratic side, for their leadership and support for this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, seeing as I have no additional speakers, I \nurge my colleagues to support H.R. 4403, the Enhancing Overseas \nTraveler Vetting Act.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just say this for the \nMembers. The 9/11 Commission Report was pretty prescient on this point. \nIt said: ``The U.S. Government cannot meet its own obligations to the \nAmerican people to prevent the entry of terrorists without a major \neffort to collaborate with other governments.''\n  The report said further: ``We should do more to exchange terrorist \ninformation with trusted allies and raise U.S. and global borders \nsecurity standards for travel and border crossing, over the medium and \nlong term, through extensive international cooperation.''\n  This is what the bill does. And, frankly, the Department of State \nhere and the Department of Homeland Security, giving them this \nauthorization to develop this open-source software, to vet those \ntravelers against terrorist watch lists and against those law \nenforcement databases, is absolutely vital.\n  I will just mention that the so-called Islamic State--we call it \nDaesh or ISIS--has already threatened to send hundreds of its European \nfighters back to the continent to carry out attacks like those attacks \nthat they have already carried out in Paris and Brussels and, frankly, \nattacks like the one they carried out in San Bernardino, California. So \nI think this measure really deserves our unanimous support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hurd of Texas). The question is on the \nmotion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the \nHouse suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4403, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1672-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1672-H1676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FUTURE FORUM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of \nthe Future Forum to provide an update on our past year's work and \nactivity and to discuss the work we must still do to move America's \nmillennials forward.\n  Yesterday, April 12, marked the 1-year anniversary of Future Forum, \nand what a year it has been. I encourage everyone at home to follow \nalong as we talk about these issues this afternoon at #futureforum on \nTwitter or Instagram and Facebook. Send us your questions. I will look \nat them live here on the floor and talk about them and continue the \ndialog beyond today's conversation.\n  Our membership has grown from 14 members a year ago when we started, \nto 18 of the House's youngest Members. We have traveled to 14 cities \nnow across this great Nation, from San Diego, California, to \nManchester, New Hampshire, and to, most recently, last week, hosted by \nRepresentatives DeGette, Polis, and Perlmutter, Denver. We were even \njoined there in Denver by our House Minority whip, Steny Hoyer.\n  On each visit we talk to young people at universities, community \ncolleges, coworking spaces, and startup companies, to learn about the \nissues most important to them, the issues that they are finding as \ntheir own personal barriers to success.\n  Overwhelmingly, we have heard millennials across the Nation share \nthat they are most concerned about issues relating to student loan \ndebt, college affordability, climate change, and campaign finance \nreform. I want to talk about a few of these issues, and I first start \nwith student loan debt.\n  At many of these sites with a polling app we ask people: What issue \nis most important to you? Across the country, the issue that we have \nseen most often, regardless of what part of the country we are in, what \ncrowd we are in front of, has been student loan debt.\n  Now, this is an issue that is very personal to me. I just brought my \nown student loan debt just under $100,000 within the last few months; \nand I have seen, in my own life, in my constituents' lives in \nCalifornia's East Bay and with the people we have talked to at these \nFuture Forum discussions, that student loan debt has put an entire \ngeneration into financial quicksand, and it affects almost every life \ndecision that young people are making.\n  The biggest decisions you will make in your life: the decision to \nstart a family, we are delaying that decision by about 5 years later \nthan the generation before us; the ability to buy a house, we are \nperhaps the least home-owning generation America has ever known; the \ndecision and the ability to go out on your own and start your own \nbusiness--well, actually, millennial entrepreneurship is on the \ndecline. From 2014 to 2015, 5 percent fewer millennials started a \nbusiness.\n  How is that?\n  You look at Silicon Valley, you look at Silicon Alley, you look at \nSilicon Beach, you look up in the Northwest at Silicon Forest, you see \nall of these startups across our country and you think, well, this is \nthe startup generation.\n  In fact, we are more risk averse than you would think. It is because \nof the student loan debt that we carry that makes it so hard to go out \non your own to find that capital you need to take that risk to start a \nbusiness to create jobs that will help grow our economy.\n  These are the four issues we are seeing that student loan debt is \naffecting: starting a family, buying a home, starting a business, and \nthen, finally, being able to save.\n  We are also the generation that has saved the least of any generation \nthat has ever come before us. And it makes sense, right?\n  Every month, you have approximately 40 million young people, with \n$1.3 trillion in student loan debt, hundreds of dollars each month \ngoing out the window, going to pay off this debt, making it very hard \nfor you to rent near where you work, let alone even realize that \nAmerican Dream of homeownership.\n  Now, while higher education also remains a worthwhile investment, we \nhave found on our tour that, by 2018, 63 percent of new jobs will \nrequire a college education. But here is the problem. The cost of \ncollege continues to go up.\n  One of our biggest challenges, perhaps, is making and having \ngenerations that have come before us understand that what they \nexperienced 30, 40 years ago, is just not what young people are going \nthrough today. It is apples and oranges in terms of experiences. In \nfact, the cost of college tuition has gone up higher and faster than \nany other good or service that Americans consume.\n  In California, for example, in the sixties and seventies, if you were \nqualified and you were able, you could go to a UC--University of \nCalifornia--school\n\n[[Page H1673]]\n\nand walk away with, essentially, a debt-free education.\n  The return on that investment, when Californians and the Federal \nGovernment valued public education as a public good, was a workforce \nthat built the greatest tech and biotech economy that the world has \never seen. The tech economy that drives northern California, the \nbiotech economy that is thriving down in San Diego, the minds that are \npowering the inventive forces in the entertainment industry down in Los \nAngeles, that is the return on investment that we received when we \ntreated education as a public good in California, and you could have an \nUC degree and walk away with a debt-free education.\n  Now, an issue that is also important to millennials and new to Future \nForum and affecting young Americans is the issue of diversity in the \ntech industry.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  We love the tech industry in California. It has created so many new \njobs and a lot of traffic to go with it, but people who are driving to \ngood-paying jobs.\n  Silicon Valley in the bay area is at the helm of America's burgeoning \ntech industry, which is constantly developing innovative ways to \ninteract within a global environment and compete in the 21st century. \nThese cutting-edge companies are creating new ways to communicate, \ntravel, buy, sell, and listen.\n  The tech industry is led by some of the best and the brightest our \nNation has to offer. But there are some statistics about the tech \nindustry I want to share with you that are quite disturbing. The tech \nindustry is not as diverse as California or our country is.\n  Millennials are at the center of this industry. They are the largest \ngeneration in the U.S. workforce. By 2020, millennials will make up 50 \npercent of the global workforce.\n  However, over the past 2 to 3 years, major concerns have been raised \nthat tech lacks one major component. We are the largest workforce \nAmerica has ever known, and we are the largest and most diverse \ngeneration America has ever known, but the tech industry is missing a \ndiverse workforce.\n  Despite making up significant portions of the U.S. population, women \nand minorities are drastically underrepresented in this industry. Let \nme give you an example.\n  In the United States, women compose 50.8 percent of our population. \nHowever, women only make up about one-third of the tech workforce.\n  Ethnic diversity in tech tells a similar story. Eight percent of the \ntech workforce is Hispanic, 7 percent is African American, 23 percent \nis Asian, and 60 percent is White.\n  How can we resolve this? Many tech firms have made great strides \ntoward improving workforce gender and ethnic diversity by releasing \nworkforce data and creating internal programs to address this \ndisparity.\n  However, action must continue to be taken every single day to address \nthe root of the problem, like improving access to STEM education. The \ntech industry also needs to seriously examine recruitment measures in \norder to encourage a more diverse workforce.\n  I recently introduced the STEM K to Career Act. This bill would \nprovide Federal loan forgiveness for STEM teachers in low-income \nschools, create a tax credit for paid STEM internships and \napprenticeships, and ensure that 7 percent of Federal Work Study funds \nare used for STEM jobs.\n  This would help make sure that every corner in America, every \nclassroom across our country, is treated equally and receives the same \namount of funding for STEM and make sure that every child has that \nfreedom to dream.\n  I am also a cosponsor of Representative Rick Larsen of Washington's \nYouth Access to American Jobs Act, which will connect students to \ntraining in STEM skill positions to prepare them for well-paying jobs. \nJust last month I signed a letter urging for an increase in Federal \nsupport of Hispanic-serving institutions.\n  Someone in the House who has worked on this issue who is my neighbor \nin the east bay and someone I have been proud to serve with is \nCongresswoman Barbara Lee. I would like to welcome my distinguished \ncolleague to add to this discussion.\n  I will start, Congresswoman, by asking: This is an industry that has \nexpanded beyond just San Francisco and Silicon Valley. We are seeing \nmajor investments put into Oakland and also out in the tri-valley.\n  What are you hearing back in the bay at home, outside of that \nWarriors fever--because tonight they are going to set the NBA's single-\nseason wins record--but outside of that fever, what are we hearing at \nhome about the tech industry and what we can do better?\n  Ms. LEE. First of all, I thank the gentleman so much for his \ntremendous leadership in Future Forum. I want to thank him also for \nreally stepping up since he has been here in Congress not only in \nshowing dedication and phenomenal representation for his constituents, \nbut, also, he has shown such a tremendous ability to organize his peers \nand to really focus on the issues that really give our young people, \nthe millennials, a hope that they can actually achieve the American \nDream. So I thank the gentleman very much.\n  I am really proud to share our region with Congressman Swalwell. I \nwant to first congratulate him also because I think today is the \nanniversary of Future Forum. One year?\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. That is right. One year.\n  Ms. LEE. The gentleman is doing such critical work to make college \naffordable and debt free and to really provide opportunities for our \nyoung people and our millennials. So I thank the gentleman.\n  We represent the east bay, as we have said. For years now, this is \nnothing new to us. I have my office full of cases that go back, \nactually, 10 years of qualified people of color who wanted to work in \nthe tech sector and never could get in the door.\n  Let me also say that 40, 50 percent of the jobs in the tech sector \nare non-tech-related. They are human resources attorneys, lawyers, jobs \nthat many people of color qualify for and still they have been shut out \nfrom these opportunities. So this is an important issue to talk about.\n  Tech is making a home for itself in my district and your district, \nand it is creating new jobs.\n  Unfortunately, too many of my African American and Latino \nconstituents have been locked out of these opportunities for years, \nwhich have been created by the region's booming sector.\n  Believe you me, it is not unique to your district or my district. It \nis a systemic problem that we need to address across the country.\n  When major tech firms have released workforce data--and, mind you, \nmany have not--we have seen that, at some firms, employees that are \nAfrican American can make up as much as 7 percent of the workforce. At \nother firms, this can be below zero percent.\n  I don't know how you get below zero percent, but some don't even \nthink about it, despite the fact that African Americans, for example, \nmake up 14 percent of the American population.\n  So that is why I am really honored to serve with our Congressional \nBlack Caucus chair, Chairman Butterfield, as his co-chair of the CBC \nDiversity Task Force.\n  In May of last year, our task force launched the TECH 2020 initiative \nto increase diversity and inclusion in the tech sector by 2020, \nspecifically as it relates to African American diversity.\n  Let me just take a moment to thank Reverend Jesse Jackson and Rainbow \nPUSH because they have been for several years now really making sure \nthese companies commit to releasing their data and coming up with a \nplan to address inclusion and diversity.\n  The core principles of TECH 2020 initiative let me lay out very \nquickly. T, transparency; education and training; corporate \nresponsibility and investment; hiring and retention.\n  Transparency means ensuring that companies set and achieve inclusion \ngoals, release their data annually, and put this information in a \ncentral location for the public to access.\n  Education and training, STEM education, commitment to long-term STEM \ninvestments, working with minority-serving institutions, Hispanic-\nserving institutions, HBCUs, and advancing public and private \ninvestment in education.\n  Corporate responsibility and investment means working to increase \nboard of director diversity. When you look at\n\n[[Page H1674]]\n\nthe boards, you don't see much inclusion at all in diversity.\n  We have to target philanthropic investments, expand venture capital \nto diverse ideas, to new, young ideas, seek out diversity in the \nsupplier area and helping young, millennial small businesses grow.\n  The last principle, hiring and retention, means encouraging companies \nto provide specific programs, goals, and timetables focused on \ninclusion and recruit from minority-serving institutions and invest in \nAfrican American and Latino employees.\n  The TECH 2020 initiative--we have taken these principles on the road \nto the boardrooms of some of the biggest names in the tech sector.\n  So I am pleased that we are continuing this conversation tonight with \nthe head of Future Forum because this really is about the future.\n  In our district, we have many, many young people, many young African \nAmerican young men and women, who are working on coding, \nBlackGirlsCode.\n  When you look at some of the investments that the Kapor Institute, \nMitch and Freada Kapor, have made in terms of investments in firms that \nrequire inclusion in STEM education, it is really phenomenal.\n  We have seen companies add highly qualified people of color, business \nleaders, to their board of directors, not enough, only a couple, but we \nare going to continue to work to develop and implement and, most \nimportantly, disclose their diversity and their inclusion plans.\n  We have also made progress in gaining commitments to investments in \nscience, technology, engineering, and math--of course, the STEM \npipeline--to help educate and create the next generation of coders, \ninnovators, and tech leaders.\n  Last year I was proud to lead a letter--and it was cosigned by 67 of \nour colleagues--to support the President's Computer Science for All \nInitiative, which will ensure that every student from preschool to \ngrade 12 will be able to learn how to code.\n  This initiative specifically focuses on girls and students of color \nand will help us close the achievement gap in STEM education.\n  These are all steps in the right direction, but we can and we must do \nmore. America has become more and more diverse. Increasing diversity \nand inclusion within the tech sector really is not only a moral \nimperative, it is an economic imperative.\n  As a former businessowner myself, I can tell you that diversity is \nreally good for business. It is good for the bottom line. When you have \na diverse and dynamic employee base, new doors of opportunity open.\n  So I am very pleased to be helping to lead this effort with our chair \nof the Black Caucus, Mr. Butterfield, and other colleagues and yourself \nto achieve parity in the tech sector.\n  I also look forward to working with Future Forum in addressing these \ncritical issues as we move forward with Future Forum in terms of the \nnext generation of leaders.\n  Young people are concerned about student loan debt, college \naffordability, and climate change, all the issues that really create a \nplanet worthy of the future of our young people.\n  As future members of the modern workforce, they are also concerned \nabout equity. So I have to commend the gentleman once again in Future \nForum for his vision and his efforts to engage and empower our future \nleaders.\n  I know that together we can and we will achieve a future where people \nof color, African Americans and Latinos, are fully represented within \nevery level of the tech sector, from entry-level coders and H.R. \nrepresentatives, legal professionals, C-suite officers, and corporate \ndirectors.\n  Finally, let me say that one effort that some of the companies are \nmounting, which I think you know about, which we need to talk a little \nbit more about in the future and Future Forum should look at, are the \nunconscious bias studies that these companies are undertaking.\n  Because oftentimes it is the culture of the organization and \nunconscious biases that translate into policies and programs that \ncreate a discriminatory effect which, in fact, need to be addressed and \ndealt with, and they are so unconscious that people don't even realize \nthat this is the ultimate outcome of those unconscious biases.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Do you think that shining a light on \nworkforce data is probably one of the best ways to kind of reverse an \nunconscious bias, that unless you are forced to look at the numbers and \nthe behaviors of your company, you are not going to make a change that \nresults in having a diverse workforce?\n  Ms. LEE. Yes. Absolutely. If you don't have the facts, if you don't \nhave the data, how do you know, first of all, that there is an issue \nand a problem of exclusion?\n  Secondly, oftentimes people hire people and work with people whom \nthey are familiar with. There are some systemic issues that, unless you \nhave the data, you don't know what these systemic issues are.\n  So that is absolutely essential. That is why we continue to ask tech \ncompanies to release their data and to really be transparent.\n  So you have to know what the issues are and what the problem is \nbefore you can look at how to rectify it and how to move forward.\n  So I think that many employees and many corporate officials want to \ndo the right thing. They just have not done the right thing, and they \nare trying to begin to understand what to do next.\n  So Future Forum, the Congressional Black Caucus, our Tri-Caucus, all \nof us here, our Dem Caucus, have really been working hard to try to get \nthis movement forward.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. In your district, you have one of the \nbest universities in the world, UC-Berkeley, and we have heard on our \nFuture Forum's tour from young students who are either right out of \ncollege or about to be out of college that the amount of debt they have \nis driving the decision about where to work, that a lot of times their \nchoices are limited to where their parents live because they know they \ncan't afford to live in the bay area. So they are going to have to \nboomerang back home with their parents who have just gotten used to \ntheir being out of the house.\n  So what have you heard from the students or the recent graduates in \nyour area about how student loan debt is affecting major life \ndecisions?\n  Ms. LEE. Student loan debt really is hampering our young people from \nmoving forward. They are concerned mainly about how to get a job that \nis going to pay enough money to pay down their debt when, really, they \nshould be looking at how to move forward and get the type of job they \nwant, buy a home if they want, have a family or do some of the things \nthat their dreams have been in their minds, in their vision, and in \ntheir heart for years. Now their dreams are deferred because they have \nto just hang on with their families and pay student loan debt.\n  Secondly, in our area, the cost of housing is outrageous. We met with \nthe Secretary of HUD last week to try to determine what the Federal \nGovernment could do to help with, first, displacement and, secondly, to \nhelp develop more affordable housing, which, of course, will help young \npeople because they can't afford to live now in the east bay or in the \nbay area, really.\n  Our region is just excessively expensive, and we have to figure out \nhow young people can stay where they want to stay and how they can have \nthe type of life they deserve.\n  They have gotten a degree. I went to UC-Berkeley. That is my alma \nmater--go Bears--and I know what a phenomenal education it is.\n  But I also know, when you get out, you think that that degree, that \npiece of paper, is a ticket to something better, and here you end up \nhaving to go back home, live with your parents, and pay down your \nstudent debt. That is outrageous. It doesn't make any sense. Our young \npeople deserve more.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. That is right. A lot of times I have told \nyoung people our generation is the least home-owning generation America \nhas ever known. In the bay area and the L.A. area, they say: Forget \nhome owning. We just want to be able to rent near where we live.\n  Right now, rents are so expensive. Oakland now ranks in the top five \nmost expensive rent cities.\n  Ms. LEE. I think it is the fourth in the country.\n  It is outrageous. Homeownership is not even a dream anymore that \nyoung people have.\n\n[[Page H1675]]\n\n  How do you acquire wealth in this country?\n  When you look at what happened to African Americans, for example, and \nLatinos during the subprime meltdown and crisis, our net worth is gone. \nMost of that was equity in our home.\n  Young people deserve to be able to buy a house so they can begin to \nacquire some wealth, so they can begin to do what they want to do with \ntheir lives. Until we get this housing piece right, we are not going to \nget anything else right in terms of inequality and equity for our young \npeople or for people of color.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. That is right. As we talk to young people \nand we listen to these stories across the country, it is heartening, \nthough, to offer solutions. I know you are a part of many of the \nsolutions that the Future Forum has been promoting.\n  One of them is the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing bill--\nit is Joe Courtney's bill, our colleague--which says that if the banks \ncan refinance at the lowest rate, if a homeowner can refinance at the \nlowest rate, and an auto loan can be refinanced at the lowest rate, why \ncan't our students refinance at the lowest rate? Why should they have \nto pay so much money in interest and not get more competitive rates?\n  Ms. LEE. There is no reason why. Here you have young people starting \nout making a life for themselves. They should be able to do the same \nthing. The banking institutions should allow young people the same \nopportunities as they do other people who own mortgages and who own \ncars. This, to me, is discriminatory.\n  I am really pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill. I hope we can pass \nthis on a bipartisan basis. I would give young people just a bit of \nhope that it can be done, that they can be made whole, and that their \ncollege education, the sacrifices that they made, was worth it because \nnow they are going to the next step.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. That is right. In the bay area, young \npeople are so collaborative and inventive that they have powered this \ninnovative innovation economy. Then they look at Washington and they \nwonder, why isn't the majority party in the House collaborating on \nthese student loan bills?\n  If you look at every student loan bill that is out there right now, I \nthink 9 out of 10 of them have been offered by our side. This is an \nissue that should not be owned by a political party. People are hurting \nout there.\n  Ms. LEE. Republican young people are hurting also. I would think that \nthe majority party would want to help their young people also find a \npath to the American Dream. Certainly refinancing student loan debt is \na major step. It should be bipartisan, it should be nonpartisan, and we \nshould be working together to get this passed.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I don't know if you have any constituents \nwho are in bankruptcy because of student loan debt, but we found that \nthree things in this country will follow you to your grave and have no \nstatute of limitations: murder, treason, and student loan debt.\n  We have constituents who have had their Social Security garnished \nbecause of outstanding student loan debt and people who cannot \ndischarge as they get that second chance in life, that jubilee that \nbankruptcy is, they can't discharge their student loan debt. It hangs \nover them until they go to the grave.\n  Ms. LEE. Many constituents are in very similar circumstances, \nCongressman Swalwell. On top of that, their credit score goes down, so \nthen they can't even buy a car, even if they wanted to. They are not \nable to do anything else because they are delayed on their payments. \nThey are behind because they can't afford it. They get dings on their \ncredit score, and then they can't buy anything else on credit. It is a \nvicious cycle. They end up in debt and out there not being able to \nparticipate in the mainstream economic fabric of our society because of \nthat.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. That is right. Another bill we have to \nsupport that is the Private Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act, \noffered by Congressman Cohen of Tennessee, who seeks to address this \nissue and relieve young people from having to have this follow them for \na lifetime.\n  Congresswoman, I am glad you came to join us to talk about diversity \nin tech and about larger Future Forum goals. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with you in the east bay and across our country to \ntake as many young people as we can out of financial quicksand.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Swalwell, and I thank him for his \nleadership. I am confident we can with his leadership and with all of \nus working together.\n  I know that both Democrats and Republicans want the same thing, I am \nconfident of that, but we are just not matching our rhetoric with \nreality. Hopefully they will begin to understand, the majority will, \nthat this is good for America, not just for Democrats and not just for \nour young people.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. That is right. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. \nLee.\n  I also see in the House with us this afternoon is another California \ncolleague, someone who I was hoping maybe could talk a little bit about \nwhat students in her part of California are going through, one of the \nyoungest Members of the House as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. \nTorres).\n  Congresswoman, we are just talking about student loan debt. In \nCalifornia, we have got the greatest education system in the world, but \nbecause of the amount of student loan debt young people are facing, it \nis just putting them, as I said, in financial quicksand. We have got a \nlot of solutions here in the House.\n  Is there anything you are hearing in your Congressional District from \nyoung people and what they want to see from their leaders?\n  Mrs. TORRES. Absolutely. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Swalwell for \nbringing this topic to the forefront.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. We are celebrating a year of the Future \nForum tonight.\n  Mrs. TORRES. One year. That is wonderful.\n  This issue is not limited to the students. At a Congress in Your \nCorner last November, I heard from parents of a constituent who were \nnearly in bankruptcy because the student loan from not one child, but \ntwo, was so much that it was actually more than their mortgage payment. \nSo here they are working in their late 60s to try to help make payments \nfor their students.\n  This is a critical issue. They are not able to purchase a vehicle and \nthey are not able to purchase a home. I bought my home in my early 20s. \nI know that 20-year-olds today, or 23-year-olds today, could not do \nthat because of the high student loan ratios that they have.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. That is right. I call it getting lapped, \nwhich is we are seeing parents today who are still paying off their \nstudent loans, then their kids are going off to college, and now they \nare doubling down. It has become a family matter.\n  We talked on a Future Forum tour to a mother who showed up to an \nevent that had 200 millennials in Boston. She kind of sheepishly raised \nher hand and said: I know I am not supposed to be here, but I am here \nbecause I am worried about my daughter. She was the first in our family \nto go to college. We were really excited. We sent her off and we missed \nher dearly for that first year she was gone. We got used to her being \ngone in years two, three, and four. We never expected that she would \nboomerang back home because she couldn't afford to live near where she \nworks.\n  This was at the same time that this mother's own mother was going \ninto a costly assisted living facility. It is a family matter. It is \nsqueezing baby boomers right now because their kids are incurring \nstudent loan debt and their parents are taking on costly assisted \nliving. So you are right.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Torres for sharing what is going on in her \narea.\n  Maybe my other colleague, another one of California's millennial-\nminded Members down in the L.A. area, Tony Cardenas, what is he hearing \nas we celebrate a year of being on the road with Future Forum and \ntalking to thousands of young people? What is he hearing about student \nloan debt or any issues that are important to millennials?\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas).\n  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Swalwell for bringing this \nissue to the floor. It is incredibly important not just for \nmillennials, but as\n\n[[Page H1676]]\n\nour colleague, Norma Torres, pointed out, for people who are at \nretirement age, people who want to retire but can't because they have \nthese generational issues that are costly and they can't move on and \nthen follow through with their version of the American Dream in \ndifferent phases of their life.\n  What I am hearing is that this is not just an issue of young people \nwho are in college. This is an issue of entire families wondering \nwhether or not their children can afford to do that and whether the \nfamily can come together for that bright individual who wants to \nsucceed and wants to get that education, and yet they are doubting \nthemselves as to whether or not that is the path for them.\n  That is unfortunate because the fact of the matter is that the United \nStates of America for many, many generations has been the place for \nhope and expectation of a brighter future for generations. Yet, at the \nsame time, because, in my opinion, Congress is not doing enough to make \nsure that we can right the situation, we can make sure that we can \nright size the environment of making sure that when a young bright \nperson in America wants to get an education, that there are ways in \nwhich they can afford to do that, regardless of where they come from, \nregardless of whether their parents are farm workers, like my parents, \nor whether their parents live on the other side of town where they can \nafford to do that.\n  Our environments and the universities shouldn't be left only to the \nindividuals who have the affluency to be able to be in that \nenvironment. One of the reasons why we have created these wonderful \nuniversities that have 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 people there \nis so that they can be an eclectic environment, so people can learn to \nbecome friends with people that otherwise they might not have rubbed \nelbows with.\n  What I am hearing is that people are afraid. Too many Americans are \nafraid. I am hearing that too many bright individuals are doubting \nwhether or not they can afford to get that degree, not that they can't \ndo it, not that they are not bright enough.\n  The problem that I am hearing from my constituents and people around \nAmerica is that it is tough to make that decision because too many \nyoung people now have examples that they are in debt $100,000, \n$200,000, $300,000. And then on top of that, they can't find a right \nsize job to fit their skill set. And then on top of that, they have got \nthis mounting debt. That is something that too many people are afraid \nto enter into. That is unfortunate. It shouldn't happen in our country.\n  I am glad that Mr. Swalwell is bringing this issue up. Let's continue \nto try to do many, many things about righting the ship that we have \nabout our young people being too afraid to incur the kind of debt that \nthey are forced to do in order to get an education.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Amen. Well said.\n  I think young Californians, in my experience, want us to be as \ncollaborative in solving this problem as they are in charting the \ninnovation economy. You are right. Out of those environments in our UC \nand Cal State systems and our community colleges, we are creating minds \nand experiences that are building this new economy. So they look to us \nand say: Why aren't Democrats and Republicans working together?\n  Right now, I see our caucus is the only one that is offering \nsolutions. I think we are putting our hands out there saying: Work with \nus, we are ready to talk about this, but you have got to come to the \ntable because Republican and Democratic kids across this country are in \nfinancial quicksand and are counting on us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cardenas and Mrs. Torres.\n  That will conclude our one-year celebration of Future Forum.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 3, 2013, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California \n(Mrs. Torres) for 30 minutes.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, California is a much warmer State and much \nmore beautiful, if I may add that.\n  I rise today to recognize National Public Safety Telecommunicators \nWeek.\n  After 17\\1/2\\ years as a 911 dispatcher, I know firsthand the \nchallenges our public safety dispatchers face, the stress they are put \nunder, and the critical importance of their work. That is why I am \nproud to introduce a resolution commemorating National Public Safety \nTelecommunicators Week.\n  I remember working the graveyard shift at the LAPD, sitting four \nfloors below ground, taking calls from people from all walks of life, \noften during their most vulnerable time in their lives.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  In fact, it was my work as a 911 dispatcher that got me involved in \npolitics.\n  When I was working for the LAPD, I took a call from a little girl who \nended up being murdered at the hands of her uncle. When I answered that \n911 call, all I could hear was thumping. Later, I learned that that \nthumping noise was her head being bashed against the wall. Soon after, \nfive shots were fired, and she was murdered--11 years old, murdered at \nthe hands of her uncle.\n  I yield to my colleague, the gentleman from the San Fernando Valley, \nCongressional District 29, Tony Cardenas, to share with us some \ninformation about how he supports 911 dispatchers in his district.\n  Mr. CARDENAS. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  To my colleague, Norma Torres, thank you for bringing up this very, \nvery important opportunity for awareness of this issue on the floor of \nthe House of Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, yes, it is National Public Safety Telecommunicators \nWeek, but it is really important for us to understand that, in America, \neverything starts with us--the individuals.\n  I will just add to this dialogue that it is up to all of us to keep \nour communities safe. If we do that well, maybe we won't need so many \n911 operators. We have heard so many times and too often of those \nfrantic calls when someone is calling 911 because the action has \nalready started, because the atrocity has already begun. As Americans, \nwe should be vigilant and understand that we all have a collective \nresponsibility to be the safe keepers of our communities so that we \nminimize the number of 911 calls any one individual in our \nneighborhoods or in our communities across America would ever have to \nmake.\n  I take this opportunity to mention someone, Krystal Blackburn, who is \nthe assistant supervisor at the Harrodsburg Police Department. She has \nbeen a 911 operator for some time now, and I quote one portion of what \nwas mentioned on the House floor this afternoon:\n\n       911 has changed my life. It has shaped me, and I have grown \n     into a role that I wasn't even sure I wanted in the \n     beginning. It has become a way of life that I wouldn't change \n     for any reason. I am 911.\n\n  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important for us to \ntake the opportunity to recognize and appreciate the eclectic \nresponsibilities that friends and neighbors have in every community \nacross America. In every situation, let people take on that \nprofessionalism so as to be the solution--to be the go-to person--when \nwe need them most. It is important for people to understand that our \ndispatchers at 911 and that our safety community around America deserve \nour support and deserve our recognition. Most importantly, they deserve \nour thanks.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for giving me the opportunity to express my \nthoughts on this very important issue.\n  Mrs. TORRES. I thank the gentleman.\n\n[[Page H1677]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, so few people know what it is like to be an emergency \ndispatcher and don't truly understand how crucial our role is. They \ndon't get that without us. They don't get that without you. First \nresponders wouldn't be able to do their jobs without someone's \nanswering that 911 call.\n  Back when I served in the California State Assembly, the State budget \ncrisis meant that 911 dispatchers were furloughed because they weren't \nexempt as public safety professionals. Hundreds of calls went \nunanswered. Who knows how many lives were put at risk? I spent months \nbadgering Governor Schwarzenegger until he realized the catastrophic \neffect the policy was having on our State. God forbid there had been an \nevent like San Bernardino during that time and calls couldn't get \nthrough or first responders didn't know where to go.\n  Sadly, too many people think of dispatchers as a little more than \nglorified receptionists. This means that they don't often get the \nresources, the training, and the support they need and deserve in order \nto do their jobs. Dispatchers are the first points of contact in the \nevent of an emergency, and they are the sole link between those in \ntrouble and the personnel who can help them. Better training and more \nsupport would go a long way toward improving service and increasing \nstaff retention.\n  During this year's State of the Union, I had the honor of inviting as \nmy guest the dispatch supervisor who directed radio and call traffic \nduring the San Bernardino attack. While the police, fire, and EMS \nresponders definitely deserve a lot of credit, there had been very \nlittle mention in the media about the key role the public safety \ntelecommunicators played.\n  Annemarie Teall and her team were the ones behind the scene, making \nsure the first responders were deployed efficiently and effectively. \nThey fielded calls from the community, from law enforcement agencies, \nand from callers from all over the country and the world. During a \nsituation that can quickly become pure chaos, they stayed calm, took \naction, and helped save lives.\n  When she was here, Annemarie discussed the training she had received \nin dealing with these types of situations and how grateful she was for \nthat training. Unfortunately, this kind of training isn't a regular \noccurrence.\n  Without public safety telecommunicators, our first responders can't \ndo their jobs. The response of police, firefighters, and paramedics is \ndependent upon the quality and accuracy of the information the \ndispatcher is able to provide. Public safety telecommunicators don't \njust take calls and relay information; they also play a key role in \ncoordinating multiple teams of first responders from multiple agencies \nduring times of crisis. They are a vital link for police, fire, and EMS \nas they monitor their activities by radio and provide them with \ninformation that can ensure their safety and an efficient, effective \nresponse.\n  911 dispatchers have also helped in the apprehension of criminals and \nhave helped bring them to justice because, in many cases, they are \nwitnesses to the crimes as they occur. In the case that I stated \nearlier, I was the only witness. It was that recorded call that brought \njustice to that little girl.\n  Public Safety Telecommunicators Week not only provides us with the \nopportunity to recognize the hard work of our dispatchers, but it is \nalso a reminder to our constituents of the importance of maintaining \nemergency lines free for just that--emergencies. There is no excuse for \n911 abuse. Some estimates indicate that 15 to 20 percent of incoming \ncalls are nonemergencies. These calls could prevent legitimate \nemergency calls from getting through and being answered. For example, \nas a 911 dispatcher, I remember receiving calls from those who were \nasking for directions to Disneyland, who were asking if an earthquake \nhad just occurred, or who were asking for the time of day. Those are \nnot emergencies. Dispatchers can't send for assistance if they never \nreceive the call.\n  911 is not an information line. Local governments have limited \nresources and few dispatchers. Many localities have info lines--for \nexample, 311 or 511. I encourage individuals to look up their local \npolice departments and have their nonemergency police numbers on hand. \nI also encourage them to add that information to their cell phones so \nthat the number is readily available when they have emergencies.\n\n  I can give you many examples of when people have dialed 911 from a \ncell phone and the dispatcher does not have the accurate location. \nImagine if you were in the middle of having a heart attack and if you \nwere not able to voice your location. Having that local telephone \nnumber is important because your call would be expedited to the local \nparamedic or to the local police department that has jurisdiction over \nwhere you may be.\n  It is never too early to teach kids about the proper uses of 911. You \nnever know when an emergency will happen, and your child may be the \nonly one who is able to get help. Teach children how to dial the number \nand stay on the line and when they should and shouldn't dial 911. One \nbad example is when my children were looking for me. They knew at the \ntime that I worked at the 911 center. They dialed 911 and asked for \ntheir mom. That is not a true, good 911 call. Discourage your children \nfrom making inquiries to that emergency line.\n  Every day, public safety dispatchers help save lives, provide comfort \nand reassurance, and are a critical part of our law enforcement teams, \nbut, too often, their work goes unrecognized. When you need a calming \nvoice to guide you through a crisis, when law enforcement, fire safety, \nand rescue personnel are in need of seamless coordination at a moment's \nnotice, when every second counts, they are on the other line. 911 \ndispatchers are the unsung heroes of the first responder community.\n  I want to share with you another story of a 911 dispatcher:\n\n       I had to make sacrifices as a soldier to serve my country, \n     and I have to make sacrifices as a dispatcher to serve my \n     community. I knew this when I chose this profession--we have \n     to be on call; we have to work overtime; we have to work \n     holidays; we have to work nights; we have to work weekends; \n     and we have to be reachable 24/7, and it is tough.\n       I spent most of my life in the service of others--22 years \n     in the military, 8 years with the Texas Youth Commission, \n     over 2 years in Iraq assisting military forces, and nearly 8 \n     years as a 911 dispatcher. I can't remember how many life \n     events I have not been a part of because I was working, \n     sacrificing, in order to help others. It is only tolerable \n     and manageable with the assistance of my fellow team and \n     family members helping me when I just couldn't get through it \n     without their help.\n       We have committed ourselves to this calling, and we are \n     very good at it. We have sacrificed ourselves in the service \n     of others because someone had to do it.\n\n  That came from Richard Dulin of the Coleman Police Department.\n\n       The first thing he said when I answered the phone was: ``I \n     just shot myself in the heart.'' Given that he was still \n     speaking, I figured he probably didn't hit his heart, but the \n     point was pretty clear. I established that he had, in fact, \n     shot himself in the chest about 30 minutes before he had \n     dialed 911. He waited to call because he was not sure if he \n     wanted to live.\n       Unfortunately, we don't tend to get a lot of closure, so I \n     have no idea if he lived or died.\n\n  Kyle from Kitsap County, Washington.\n  The stories go on and on, and I could go on and on for the rest of \nthe time and share with you about the wonderful work that these \ncommitted people do each and every single day for our communities.\n  I close, Mr. Speaker, by thanking the 911 dispatchers and recognizing \nthe hard work they do for our communities every single day.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/13/house-section/article/H1677-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The Speaker announced his signature to an enrolled bill of the Senate \nof the following title:\n\n       S. 192.
