John A. Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, to facilitate \n     application of sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional \n     Budget Act, I am transmitting an updated status report on the \n     current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal \n     years 2015, 2016, and for the 10-year period of fiscal years \n     2016 through 2025. This status report is current through May \n     15, 2015. The term ``current level'' refers to the amounts of \n     spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on \n     laws enacted or awaiting the President's signature.\n       Table 1 in the report compares the current levels of total \n     budget authority, outlays, and revenues to the overall \n     limits, as adjusted, that were filed in the Congressional \n     Record on April 29, 2014 for fiscal year 2015, and to those \n     limits contained in the conference report on S. Con. Res. 11, \n     as agreed to on May 5, 2015, for fiscal year 2016 and for the \n     10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025. This\n\n[[Page H3568]]\n\n     comparison is needed to implement section 311(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act, which creates a point of order \n     against measures that would breach the budget resolution's \n     aggregate levels. The table does not show budget authority \n     and outlays for years after fiscal year 2016 because \n     appropriations for those years have not yet been considered.\n       Table 2 compares the current levels of budget authority and \n     outlays for legislative action completed by each authorizing \n     committee with the ``section 302(a)'' allocations filed on \n     April 29, 2014 for fiscal year 2015, and to those limits \n     contained in the conference report on S. Con. Res. 11, as \n     agreed to on May 5, 2015, for fiscal year 2016 and for the \n     10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025. For fiscal \n     year 2015, ``legislative action'' refers to legislation \n     enacted after the adoption of the levels set forth in the \n     Congressional Record on April 29, 2014. For fiscal year 2016 \n     and the 10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025, \n     ``legislative action'' refers to legislation enacted after \n     the adoption of the levels set forth in the conference \n     agreement on S. Con. Res. 11. This comparison is needed to \n     enforce section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, which \n     creates a point of order against measures that would breach \n     the section 302(a) allocation of new budget authority for the \n     committee that reported the measure. It is also needed to \n     implement section 311(b), which exempts committees that \n     comply with their allocations from the point of order under \n     section 311(a).\n       Tables 3 and 4 compare the current status of discretionary \n     appropriations for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 with the \n     ``section 302(b)'' suballocations of discretionary budget \n     authority and outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The \n     comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act because the point of order under \n     that section equally applies to measures that would breach \n     the applicable section 302(b) suballocation The tables also \n     provide supplementary information on spending in excess of \n     the base discretionary spending caps allowed under section \n     251(b) of the Budget Control Act.\n       Table 5 compares the levels of changes to mandatory \n     programs (CHIMPs) contained in appropriations acts with the \n     permissible limits on CHIMPs as specified in sections 3103 \n     and 3104 of S. Con. Res. 11. The comparison is needed to \n     enforce a point of order established in S. Con. Res. 11 \n     against fiscal year 2016 appropriations measures containing \n     CHIMPs that would breach the permissible limits for fiscal \n     year 2016.\n       Tables 6 and 7 display the current level of advance \n     appropriations for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively, \n     of accounts identified for advance appropriations under \n     section 601 of H. Con. Res. 25 (113th Congress), in force and \n     effect pursuant to H. Res. 5 (114th Congress), and under \n     section 3304 of S. Con. Res. 11. These tables are needed to \n     enforce a point of order against appropriations bills \n     containing advance appropriations that are: (i) not \n     identified in the statement of managers or (ii) would cause \n     the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the \n     level specified in the budget resolution.\n       In addition, letters from the Congressional Budget Office \n     are attached that summarize and compare the budget impact of \n     enacted legislation that occurred after adoption of the \n     budget resolution against the budget resolution aggregates in \n     force.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Jim Herz or Jim \n     Bates at (202) 226-7270.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Tom Price, M.D.,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\nTABLE 1--REPORT TO THE SPEAKER FROM THE COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, STATUS OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2015, 2016, AND 2016-\n                    2025 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET, REFLECTING ACTION COMPLETED AS OF MAY 15, 2015\n                                   [On-budget amounts, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Fiscal Year  2015  Fiscal Year  2016  Fiscal Years 2016-\n                                                                \\1\\                \\2\\                2025\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAppropriate Level:\n    Budget Authority...................................          3,033,319          3,039,215               n.a.\n    Outlays............................................          3,027,686          3,091,442               n.a.\n    Revenues...........................................          2,535,978          2,676,733         32,237,371\nCurrent Level:\n    Budget Authority...................................          3,028,949          2,146,257               n.a.\n    Outlays............................................          3,038,932          2,564,163               n.a.\n    Revenues...........................................          2,454,602          2,676,733         32,237,371\nCurrent Level over (+) / under (-)\nAppropriate Level:\n    Budget Authority...................................             -4,370           -892,958               n.a.\n    Outlays............................................            +11,246           -527,279               n.a.\n    Revenues...........................................            -81,376                  0                 0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nn.a. = Not applicable because annual appropriations Acts for fiscal years 2016 through 2024 will not be\n  considered until future sessions of Congress.\n\\1\\ Section 115(b) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) required the Chairman of the Committee on the\n  Budget in the House of Representatives to file aggregate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2015 for purposes of\n  enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
