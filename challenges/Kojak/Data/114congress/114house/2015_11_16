Madam Speaker, Friday morning President Obama \nboastfully declared to the world that ISIS was contained.\n  Hours later, Paris was burning. ISIS fighters unleashed coordinated \nattacks all over the City of Lights, murdering 130 people and injuring \nhundreds of others. This, just weeks after ISIS blew up an airplane, \nkilling over 200 people.\n  The President is wrong. ISIS is not contained. ISIS' homicidal \naggression has spread from the Middle East to the sleeping West. This \nmorning, the radical killers released a video threatening an attack on \nWashington, D.C.\n  Shall we dither until this Capital is bombed? I think not. This is \nour fight, but it is not our fight alone.\n  We should immediately invoke article 5 of the NATO agreement. This \nsays an attack on one NATO nation--such as France is an attack on all \nNATO nations. This paves the way for a truly joint and international \nresponse to ISIS. The U.S. invoked this provision after the 9/11 \nattack.\n  All 28 NATO nations need to join the war against our common enemy \nbecause containment is not a strategy.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8157-7", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN FLINT, MICHIGAN\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, right now in my hometown of Flint, \nMichigan, there is a public health crisis. In the 21st century, in a \ncity of 100,000 people, they cannot deliver safe drinking water. They \ncan't guarantee safe drinking water because of high lead levels. As a \nresult of a decision by a State-appointed financial receiver, the city \nnow has water that is undrinkable.\n  I continue to pursue all avenues to provide relief to my hometown as \nthey struggle with this crisis, to provide relief to the victims and \nsupport to that community as it now has to rebuild its water \ninfrastructure.\n  The State of Michigan could act to forgive the city of its current \ndebt to the Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund, and it should do that \nimmediately. I am pushing for action to do that, and that requires not \nonly the support of the State government but the Federal Government as \nwell.\n  The State also must act to provide a health fund to provide \nmonitoring, education in the short term, and assistance in the long \nterm to individuals, especially children, who have been exposed to high \nlevels of lead.\n  What is happening in Flint is a failure of government. It cannot be \nallowed, and the State and Federal Government need to act to help this \npoor city.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8157-8", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8157-H8158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS\n\n  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1\n\n[[Page H8158]]\n\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, this morning my Governor, Governor Abbott \nof Texas, sent a letter to President Obama: ``I write to inform you \nthat the State of Texas will not accept any refugees from Syria in the \nwake of the deadly attacks in Paris.''\n  This tragedy on Friday follows quickly behind Secretary Kerry's \nannouncement that the United States will be taking in an unprecedented \nnumber of refugees.\n  Last month the Helsinki Commission, of which I am a member, held a \nhearing. Assistant Secretary of State Anne Richards said that refugees \nwere fleeing to Europe because they perceived those borders to be open.\n  Madam Speaker, there can be no perception that our borders are open. \nDuring my questioning last month, it became clear to me that we do not \nhave the procedures in place to perform adequate and thorough \nbackground checks on refugees.\n  President Obama is engaged in what may be best described as magical \nthinking. Certainly, it is a fragmented strategy to combat ISIS.\n  The world held a moment of silence this morning. We should not be \nsilent on this issue any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8158-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WE STAND WITH FRANCE\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, as we saw on Friday, as most Americans \nwere perhaps heading home for the weekend, at least 129 innocent \ncivilians were killed by terrorists in Paris.\n  One of the attacks took place at a Paris concert hall, where a band \nfrom Palm Desert, California, was scheduled to play.\n  Nohemi Gonzalez, an American and 23-year-old junior at California \nState University, Long Beach, was doing a semester abroad and was \nkilled while having dinner with her classmates.\n  Madam Speaker, our thoughts, our prayers, our hearts go out to the \nfamilies of the victims and the people of France. We stand with the \nFrench people, just as they stood with us after \n9/11 and so many other times in our past, going back to our founding as \na nation.\n  This attack was a deliberate attempt to use violence and the \ndestruction of innocent lives as a means of spreading a hateful \nideology against the world. ISIS must be defeated and destroyed, not \ncontained.\n  Madam Speaker, we hear rhetoric coming from this administration that \nglobal warming is the greatest threat. Indeed. Tell that to the \nfamilies, the victims of what happened in Paris.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8158-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CHAMPIONS OF FREEDOM WILL NOT BE STOPPED\n\n  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, November 13, the world was reminded \nonce again that freedom has its foes when Islamic State militants \nkilled 129 people and injured hundreds more in coordinated terrorist \nattacks in Paris.\n  As we mourn those whose lives were lost and pray for the people of \nFrance as they confront this terrible tragedy, we must let the \nadversaries of liberty know that champions of freedom will not be \nstopped. We will not waver, we will not cede strength, and we will \nstand firm.\n  Today a video released by an Islamic State subgroup appears to show \nmilitants praising the Paris attacks and warning that a similar attack \ncould take place in Washington.\n  Congress will continue to explore ways in which we can defeat Islamic \nState, but it is time for President Obama, who told ABC News on Friday \nthat we ``have contained'' Islamic State, to take seriously this threat \nto our Nation and all that we stand for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8158-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MELANEY SMITH AND BOOKS FOR KEEPS\n\n  (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a \nconstituent in my district who has made a difference in the lives of \nmany students.\n  In 2009, Melaney Smith met a little girl in Athens, Georgia, who \nloved to read but had no books at home to read over the summer \nvacation. After realizing this little girl was one of many children in \nthis situation, Melaney decided to start Books for Keeps, a nonprofit \ndedicated to keeping children engaged in reading by giving them books \nto take home over the summer. In the 6 years since its founding, Books \nfor Keeps has donated 185,000 books to children in 10 schools, and \nMelaney has plans to expand it to 15 more next year.\n  Many children in rural Georgia don't have regular access to \nlibraries, especially during the summer vacation. Location and access \nto transportation pose a difficulty for many, especially low-income \nstudents.\n  Being married to a schoolteacher, I am sure my wife can attest to the \nfrustration teachers feel when August rolls around and they have to \nspend precious class time reviewing and catching up before they can \nmove on.\n  Every year in May, Books for Keeps sends kids off to summer vacation \narmed with a variety of titles tailored to their interests to entertain \nand challenge them over the break. We have Melaney Smith from Athens, \nGeorgia, to thank for her initiative to encourage literacy and to \ninspire students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8158-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Woodall) laid before the House the \nfollowing communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and \npass the bill (H.R. 308) to prohibit gaming activities on certain \nIndian lands in Arizona until the expiration of certain gaming \ncompacts.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 308\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep the Promise Act of \n     2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) In 2002, the voters in the State of Arizona approved \n     Proposition 202, the Indian Gaming Preservation and Self-\n     Reliance Act.\n       (2) To obtain the support of Arizona voters to approve \n     Proposition 202, the Indian tribes within Arizona agreed to \n     limit the number of casinos within the State and in \n     particular within the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n       (3) This Act preserves the agreement made between the \n     tribes and the Arizona voters until the expiration of the \n     gaming compacts authorized by Proposition 202.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this Act--\n       (1) the terms ``Indian tribe'', ``class II gaming'', and \n     ``class III gaming'' have the meanings given those terms in \n     section 4 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. \n     2703); and\n       (2) the term ``Phoenix metropolitan area'' means land \n     within Maricopa County and Pinal County, Arizona, that is \n     north of latitude 33 degrees, 5 minutes, 13 seconds north, \n     east of longitude 113 degrees, 20 minutes, 0 seconds west, \n     and west of longitude 110 degrees, 50 minutes, 45 seconds \n     west, using the NED 1983 State Plane Arizona FOPS 0202 \n     coordinate system.\n\n     SEC. 4. GAMING CLARIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Class II gaming and class III gaming are \n     prohibited on land within the Phoenix metropolitan area \n     acquired by the Secretary of the Interior in trust for the \n     benefit of an Indian tribe after April 9, 2013.\n       (b) Expiration.--The prohibition in subsection (a) shall \n     expire on January 1, 2027.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nAlaska (Mr. Young) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alaska?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 308, the Keep the Promise Act, introduced by a \nbipartisan group of Members from the Arizona delegation, would preserve \nan Arizona voter-approved gaming compact by prohibiting any Indian \ncasino on land acquired in trust after April 9, 2013, in the Phoenix \nmetropolitan area. This prohibition would expire on January 1, 2027, \nwhen the current gaming compact negotiated with the Arizona Governor \nexpires.\n  This bill helps to resolve public promises that were supposedly made \nin good faith to the voters in Arizona. In 2002, the voters supported \nthe passage of Proposition 202, which limited the number of tribally \nowned casinos in the State, and it granted tribes exclusive rights to \noperate casinos in Arizona.\n  During the Proposition 202 campaign, a public promise was made by a \ncoalition of 17 Arizona tribes, including the Tohono O'odham Nation, to \nlimit casino gaming in the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n  Unfortunately, one tribe is on the verge of breaking that commitment \nand more than a majority of the tribes in the State are upset.\n  The immediate effect of the bill is to block the TO Nation from \nopening an off-operation casino in the Phoenix area. As I mentioned, \nthe bill has bipartisan support, including a majority\n\n[[Page H8160]]\n\nof the House delegation, the Governor of Arizona, and six of the tribes \nthat took part in the Proposition 202 agreement.\n  It is important to point out that it is not just Arizona tribes who \nsupport this bill. Tribes from other States are very concerned about \nwhat is happening in Arizona. They believe a dangerous precedent could \nbe set if this legislation is not signed into law, leading to the \nexpansion of off-reservation casinos.\n  Today's deliberations are not about stopping one casino or gaming as \na whole. The Keep the Promise Act is about protecting the integrity of \nthe State's gaming compact, the future of gaming in Arizona, and, \nultimately, the future of Indian gaming in this country.\n  I would like to thank the gentleman, the cosponsor of this \nlegislation, for his leadership on this bill and on this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today, as all of us extend our condolences of support to the people \nof France, to the loss of life, to the friends and loved ones and \nfamilies of those murdered by terrorism, we ask Congress that the \nadministration have the resolve to defeat and deal with the horror that \nthis terrorism has created not only in France, but in other parts of \nthe world, and our condolences and prayers in support of the victims.\n  Today is also a day on which we are debating a profit-driven \nmonopoly-seeking piece of legislation under suspension, H.R. 308, that \nseeks to make null and void established law, 18 court and \nadministrative decisions, and in a very real way expose the American \ntaxpayers to at least $1 billion in liability.\n  That CBO score has been again validated and affirmed in the same \nanalysis that was done for S. 152, the companion legislation in the \nSenate. This liability is for an economic taking of the Tohono O'odham \nNation.\n  Why is this special interest earmark that we are talking about today \nfor established human interest in the East Valley of Maricopa County in \nArizona with us today on suspension? Because it is simply a piece of \nlegislation to eliminate competition, to control the gaming market in \nthe metro Phoenix area. The adages about let the market decide and let \nthe consumers have choice does not apply to this piece of legislation.\n  Again, why is H.R. 308 under suspension when very dangerous \nprecedence can be set by H.R. 308 if it were to become law? It \neliminates existing law that was passed in 1986. It overturns 18 \njudicial State and Federal Court decisions and administrative \ndecisions.\n  It opens up a $1 billion taxpayer liability and creates a new \ncategory of selective sovereignty in terms of land taken into trust as \na result of 1986 legislation. It nullifies the tribe's ability to yield \nthe highest economic development from it.\n  It is essentially creating a Federal law that established a no-\ncompetition zone in that part of Maricopa County in the Phoenix metro \narea. So why not regular order, where amendments can be discussed and \nwe can have a full debate?\n  Today, Monday, under suspension leads one to the belief that there is \na deadline involved here, that Congress must pass H.R. 308, and the \nPresident must sign H.R. 308 by December 20, when the Tohono O'odham \nCasino in the West Valley is scheduled to open.\n  Hypothetically, it passes the House. Then it quickly passes the \nSenate. Then it goes to the President, is vetoed, as has been indicated \nby the administration. It comes back. The House overrides that veto, \nand the casino can't open.\n  This scenario places H.R. 308 in national significance, above things \nlike security and terrorism, tax extenders that need to come before \nthis Congress, transportation--do we extend for additional time until \nthe conference can come up with one package?--general government \nfunding and appropriations, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, and the TPP, the trade agreement.\n  If H.R. 308 is of this vital national importance that it overrides \nother issues, why suspension and why not have a real debate on the \nissue?\n  In terms of Indian Country priorities, where is the legislation of \nthe Carcieri fix? Where is the legislation and funding appropriate for \nthe Indian Health Service? Where are the tribal recognition reforms, as \nrecommended by the administration? Where is the funding for BIA \nschools? Where is legislation to protect sacred sites? Where is \ngovernment-to-government codification for consultation? Why not deal \nwith these issues? Perhaps the lobbying influence and resources are not \npresent to move these items so quickly to suspension.\n  But H.R. 308, a special interest piece of legislation to protect game \nand market share in Maricopa County, Arizona, has this Congress' total \nattention. It makes one wonder why, but I think we really know why.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Franks).\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Young and also \nthank Chairman Bishop and the leadership of this House for bringing \nthis bill to the floor today. I also want to thank the bipartisan group \nof cosponsors for their support. I especially want to thank the Members \nof the Arizona delegation who have been in support of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a budgetary impact by Michael \nSolon, the former senior adviser to the senior leadership; a report \nfrom the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste; and a letter \nfrom the mayors of Arizona regarding this legislation.\n\nFormer Senior Advisor to Senate Leadership Provides Budget Analysis of \n                                H.R. 308\n\n\n                      Says ``No Budgetary Impact''\n\n       The former budget advisor to Senator Mitch McConnell and \n     Trent Lott, Michael Solon of U.S. Policy Strategies, has \n     analyzed Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) most recent \n     score of H.R. 308, the Keep the Promise Act and its companion \n     bill in the Senate, S. 152.\n       In the analysis, Mr. Solon finds that the ``the facts \n     strongly support CBO's past repeated positions that the Keep \n     the Promise Act will have no budgetary impact, and will not \n     increase spending or the deficit.''\n       CBO recently expressed uncertainty on the budget score of \n     H.R. 308, stating that they had ``no basis for estimating'' \n     any potential cost from any future litigation. Yet, Mr. Solon \n     notes that previous CBO analyses of virtually identical \n     legislation found no significant impact on the federal \n     budget: ``As recently as September 2013, the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) found that the Keep the Promise Act \n     upholding the Arizona Tribal-State Gaming Compact `would have \n     no significant impact on the federal budget' and `would not \n     affect direct spending or revenues.'\n       That analysis mirrors the January, 2012 CBO report using \n     the identical term of ``no significant impact on the federal \n     budget'' in its assessment.''\n       Additionally, Mr. Solon indicates that the specific facts \n     of the case make a significant monetary judgment extremely \n     unlikely: ``A full analysis of the legal and factual \n     background strongly supports CBO's original conclusion of no \n     budget impact. Under current law, there are tremendous \n     hurdles that the tribe would have to overcome in order to \n     expand gambling operations beyond the limits jointly \n     established by the state government, all the Tribes, and \n     voters through compacts, state laws and referendum. Even if \n     one assumed they would be successful absent the Keep the \n     Promise Act, the chances of obtaining a significant monetary \n     judgment against the government is extremely low, in \n     particular because other economic uses of the property would \n     not be barred.''\n       Mr. Solon concludes: ``While CBO is right to inform \n     policymakers of information that introduces uncertainty in \n     its cost estimates, in this particular case the facts \n     strongly support the repeated previous positions of the CBO \n     that the Keep the Promise Act will have no budgetary impact, \n     and will not increase spending or the deficit.''\n       CBO's recent analysis of the Senate version of the Keep the \n     Promise Act adds that it ``would not increase direct spending \n     or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year \n     periods beginning in 2026.''\n       Michael Solon is a partner at U.S. policy strategies. He \n     spent two decades on Capitol Hill. In addition to Senators \n     McConnell and Lott, he also worked for Senator Phil Gramm, \n     and Congressman Dick Armey.\n       A copy of the report is available upon request.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Council For Citizens Against\n\n\n                                             Government Waste,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2015.\n     Hon. Thomas E. Price, M.D.,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, Today, the House of Representatives will \n     consider H.R. 308, the Keep the Promise Act of 2015, \n     introduced by Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) on January 13, \n     2015.\n\n[[Page H8161]]\n\n       The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) \n     is aware of the legislative history of this bill, to include \n     similar bills from previous Congresses: H.R. 2938, the Gila \n     Bend Indian Reservation Lands Replacement Clarification Act \n     (2011), and H.R. 1410, the Keep the Promise Act of 2013. For \n     each of the previous bills, which are virtually identical to \n     H.R. 308, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) determined \n     that those bills ``would have no significant impact on the \n     federal budget'' and that they ``would not affect direct \n     spending or revenues.''\n       However, CBO has failed to provide a definitive score for \n     H.R. 308, due to a virtually unprecedented factor: the risk \n     of potential litigation. Of particular concern, CCAGW \n     understands that CBO may have been pressured by opponents of \n     the legislation to inject uncertainty into the final score. \n     Regardless of the merits of the underlying legislation, CCAGW \n     finds these circumstances to be troublesome. Furthermore, \n     CCAGW understands that, when asked to use litigation risk as \n     a scoring factor for other legislation, CBO indicated that \n     such an approach was inconsistent with their established \n     procedures.\n       Therefore, without reference to the merits of the \n     underlying legislation, CCAGW believes that, in the absence \n     of a definitive score for this bill and given the precedent \n     of two previous estimates that indicated ``no significant \n     impact'' of virtually identical legislation, thus rendering \n     CBO's latest scoring statement an outlier, passage of H.R. \n     308 should not reasonably be considered to increase spending.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas Schatz.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 12, 2015.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Office of the Speaker of the House,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Office of the Democratic Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: As the elected leaders \n     of towns and cities in the State of Arizona, we are writing \n     to you to convey our support for H.R. 308, the Keep the \n     Promise Act of 2015, and urge you to pass this bill as soon \n     as possible.\n       In 2002, the people of Arizona voted to approve a tribal-\n     state compact, which, among other things, prohibited \n     additional casinos from being built in the Phoenix area \n     through 2027. In exchange for this prohibition, tribes were \n     granted the exclusive authority to conduct gaming within the \n     state. H.R. 308 simply preserves and codifies the will of the \n     Arizona people.\n       For us, this issue is about more than public policy. It is \n     about preserving the integrity of our communities by keeping \n     casinos from opening across the street from our schools, \n     churches, and homes. It's also about maintaining the trust \n     and integrity that was forged over a decade ago between \n     tribes and our governments.\n       In 2002, a representative for a coalition of 17 Arizona \n     tribes testified to the State Senate that the tribal-state \n     gaming compact would not permit the construction of \n     additional casinos in the Phoenix area beyond the number that \n     existed at the time.\n       This promise--that there would be ``no additional casinos \n     in the Phoenix metropolitan area''--had the full and complete \n     backing of the Tohono O'odham Nation and other tribes and was \n     widely publicized to Arizona voters who were asked to approve \n     the compact in a state-wide referendum. Now, the Tohono \n     O'odham Nation is building a new casino near Phoenix, in \n     direct opposition to the promises it made, and which voters \n     relied on when they went to the polls.\n       The Tohono O'odham Nation has purchased land across the \n     street from a high school and is building a Las Vegas style \n     casino 100 miles from its primary reservation. This is not \n     what the Arizona voters and other tribes intended when they \n     approved the State-tribal gaming compacts. And, more \n     importantly, it is contrary to the statements that Tohono \n     O'odham made to persuade the voters of Arizona to support \n     tribal exclusivity for gaming in Arizona.\n       That's why this legislation has the support of the \n     Governor, the State Legislature, numerous tribal governments, \n     and almost the entire Arizona congressional delegation. \n     Congress is the only entity that can address this issue. We \n     ask that you move quickly to enact this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Linda Kavanagh,\n       Mayor, Fountain Hills, Arizona.\n     John W. Lewis,\n       Mayor, Town of Gilbert.\n     Gail Barney,\n       Mayor, Town of Queen Creek.\n     John S. Insalaco,\n       Mayor, City of Apache Junction.\n     Tom Schoaf,\n       Mayor, City of Litchfield Park.\n     Mark W. Mitchell,\n       Mayor, City of Tempe.\n     John Giles,\n       Mayor, Town of Mesa.\n     W.J. ``Jim'' Lane,\n       Mayor, City of Scottsdale.\n     Jay Tibshraeny,\n       Mayor, City of Chandler.\n\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 308, the Keep the Promise \nAct, seeks to prevent Las Vegas-style gaming in the Phoenix \nmetropolitan area until the gaming compact, to which the Arizona tribes \nagreed and the Arizona voters approved, expires in 2027.\n  One Tucson area tribe is trying to build a major casino on lands that \nwere deceptively purchased in the Phoenix metropolitan area at the very \ntime that they were in negotiations with other tribes in the State to \ncraft this gaming compact duly passed by the voters.\n  These actions are contrary to the public commitments that this \nparticular tribe made between 2000 and 2002 to the other 16 Indian \ntribes in the State of Arizona and also to the State voters of Arizona.\n  This legislation was then publicly supported by the passage of \nProposition 202, this compact, a State referendum to limit casino \ngaming in the Phoenix metropolitan area. All parties knew what we were \nagreeing to, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan cosponsors of H.R. 308 are simply trying \nto hold all the parties to their publicly stated commitment to the \npeople of Arizona not to engage in gaming in the Phoenix metropolitan \narea.\n  Contrary to the opposition's position, Congress does have a role in \nsupervising tribal gaming. Congress has a long-established history of \nregulating, managing, and working with the tribes relative to tribal \ntrust land.\n  Most astonishing, Mr. Speaker, is the opposition's argument that the \ncourts have ``upheld'' the tribe's right to operate a casino on that \nparcel of land. Indeed, the court raised serious questions about the \ntribe's misconduct, but dismissed the litigation under the doctrine of \nsovereign immunity. This is not a ruling on the merits in favor or \nagainst any side, Mr. Speaker. It simply means the court could not or \nwould not issue a ruling.\n  This bill passed the House twice before and it had a zero CBO score. \nIn CBO's analysis of this exact bill last Congress, they acknowledged \nthe uncertainty of future legal challenges, but did not score those. \nThis is the standard practice. Today any ruling by them to the contrary \nis a precedent and sets the CBO up for being politically impacted in \nthe future, politically driven in the future.\n  Astonishingly, the CBO recently scored an addition to the exact same \nbill this Congress of zero dollars to $1 billion. Let me say that \nagain, Mr. Speaker. The CBO added a score now to this same bill from \nzero last time to now zero to $1 billion.\n  Now, of course, they were lobbied to do that in an unprecedented way \nwhile admitting it had no basis to issue any conjecture about a \npossible lawsuit resulting from the passage of this bill.\n  CBO admits it had no basis to score litigation. The CBO has never \nscored potential litigation on other bills. This score should be \nignored as useless and harmful if allowed as a precedent, Mr. Speaker.\n  This bill does not impact any tribe's ability to have any lands taken \ninto trust, nor does it impact any water or land claims. Consistent \nwith the intent of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and Proposition \n202, this bill merely restricts the ability of tribes to game on the \nvery lands on which they themselves agreed they would not game.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that my colleagues join \nwith me today and the Members of Arizona's delegation supporting this \nbill.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego).\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand with thousands of \ncommunity voices and jobs in opposition to H.R. 308.\n  This legislation not only shortchanges our commitments to our tribal \nbrothers and sisters, but it will do so at exorbitant costs to \ntaxpayers according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Construction of the West Valley project has been an immense and \nwelcome addition to communities across Phoenix and beyond. Once fully \ncompleted, the project will employ 3,000 people and support their \nfamilies, jobs we need in our community as we continue to reel as one \nof the hardest hit areas in the Nation from the Great Recession.\n  Millions of dollars have flowed into the region. More than 45 \ncompanies\n\n[[Page H8162]]\n\nhave been retained for the construction of this project both within \nArizona and nationally. 1,300 construction workers are currently under \ncontract, and those 1,300 jobs are just the beginning.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  If you want proof, look no further than the job fair the tribe \nrecently held on September 28. It drew over 3,000 applicants from the \ncommunity, 400 of whom were hired on the spot. That number will rise to \n500 employees when phase one of the project opens in December, and it \nwill eventually climb to 3,000 full-time employees when the project is \ncompleted and staffed. These are new, permanent, good-paying jobs that \nare badly needed in the West Valley. This bill will unnecessarily put \nthese hardworking men and women out of work while costing American \ntaxpayers as much as $1 billion.\n  Mr. Speaker, our community supports these jobs and this project. We \ncannot afford to play politics when it comes to the bottom lines of our \nfamilies and of our local economies.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for local jobs and join me in \nopposing this job-killing legislation.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar), one who has been involved in this issue for \nmany, many years.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, for several years, I have been actively involved in a \ntroubling, off-reservation gaming issue in my home State of Arizona \nregarding the Tohono O'odham Nation. TO has been attempting to open a \nLas Vegas-style casino--more than 60 miles from its ancestral lands and \nreservation in Tucson and in another tribe's former reservation in the \nPhoenix metropolitan area--for the sole purpose of gaming.\n  This comes after TO and 16 other Arizona tribes adopted a compact, \napproved by Arizona voters, which expressly promised there would be no \nadditional casinos or gaming in the Phoenix metropolitan area until \n2027. TO alone spent $1.8 million in urging Arizona voters to rely on \nthis limitation. In exchange for this promise, the voters granted the \ntribes a statewide monopoly on gaming, and other tribes gave up \nsignificant rights.\n  Shockingly, a few months after Arizona voters approved Proposition \n202, TO finalized a multiyear effort to violate this compact and used a \nshell organization to purchase land in Glendale for a casino. TO's \ndismissal of their promise to build no additional casinos in Phoenix is \nnot something that Congress can ignore when the result will be so \nharmful to what has been a national model.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to call attention to critical evidence \nobtained from the litigation discovery in the State of Arizona v. \nTohono O'odham Nation. Here are a few of the important quotations from \ntribal council meeting transcripts and minutes that were included in \nthe underlying discovery:\n  5-18-01: VDI, a TO chartered and owned corporation, included in their \nmeeting notes a description of a presentation delivered by Mark Curry, \nTO's lead negotiator in the gaming compact negotiations. The notes \nreflect ``107th Avenue-Stadium,'' ``gaming compact--unsure what will \nhappen,'' ``put in a shell company--need to keep it quiet, especially \nwhen negotiations of compact are at stake.''\n  6-26-01: VDI meeting with TO's San Lucy District Council. ``We are \nalso looking at another project . . . based on discussions we had and \ncontinue to have about a casino on the west end of Phoenix, and part of \nthat discussion that we've had was that--we didn't want to publicize \nthat because of the confidentiality in terms of that issue . . . and \nthat's how we're holding it--as confidential--because we don't want, \nyou know, people to know we are seriously considering this, because, if \nyou do, I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of resistance from, you \nknow, the general public.''\n  8-22-02: VDI meeting transcript discussing the West Phoenix casino \nproject and whether Governor Hull's successor would also oppose \nadditional Phoenix area casinos. The meeting transcript states:\n  ``Max: Because, if that's going to be the position of the State, that \nthey don't want any more casinos around the Phoenix area, then they're \ngoing to fight it, whoever the new Governor is, if he's going to go \nalong--he or she go along with Jane Hull regarding taking a position.\n  ``Jim: Which is why we really want to wait until the initiative \npasses before it gets out.''\n  2-23-03: VDI meeting transcript discussing potential political \nproblems with the proposal:\n  ``Male voice: I just hope that . . . in terms of the political--\nthat's going be to coming--that some of the metro tribes over there \ndon't come back and jump on us, too . . .\n  ``Male voice: Might Gila River and Salt River indicate that it's a \nviolation of Proposition 202--metropolitan area?\n  ``Male voice: Well, that's what I said in terms of political impact, \nis that even--even those metro tribes, particularly those three that \nare right there, might--might say something.''\n  Shamefully, TO has falsely been claiming a victory in court. Let's be \nclear. TO won nothing in court. In fact, the U.S. District Court stated \nthere was evidence that TO made false promises, but, unfortunately, \nTO's sovereign immunity barred the court from ruling on this case. In \nother words, the court ruled that the tribe cannot be sued in court \nbecause ``it can't be sued in court.'' Any ruling could not consider \nanything claimed under sovereignty by the tribe, i.e., the tribal \nminutes, notations in meetings.\n  That is the fundamental reason that H.R. 308, the Keep the Promise \nAct, is necessary. Only Congress has the authority to hold TO \naccountable for their shameful, deceitful, and criminal actions. This \nwas confirmed again by the Supreme Court in 2014 in the case of \nMichigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, when the Court stated that only \nCongress can act when a tribe raises sovereign immunity. TO acted \nimmorally and covertly against its fellow tribes, the State, and the \ngeneral public. We can't let TO get away with these horrific actions \nthat violate a voter-approved compact and that could upend tribal \ngaming compacts throughout the Nation.\n  Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 308.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  There have already been 18 court and Federal agency rulings favoring \nTohono O'odham Nation on this issue, and we can dismiss those court \ndecisions by Federal judges--the Ninth Circuit--State judges, \nadministrative hearings with the Interior. We can dismiss them as not \nmeaning anything. Obviously, the state of the law that was passed in \n1986 means nothing. Obviously, these court cases and judicial decisions \nmean nothing because this legislation, H.R. 308, seeks to usurp the law \nin 1986 and to overrule judicial decisions that have been made.\n  We keep hearing about the fact that there is no standing in those \ndecisions. The latest was a unanimous decision by the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals that confirmed, once again, the legality of the \ntribe's West Valley project.\n  We keep hearing the same myths about what the numerous legal outcomes \nactually mean for the nation. For instance, we heard just now that the \nnation won nothing on the merits and that all of the cases had merely \nbeen dismissed on the draconian doctrine of sovereign immunity.\n  It doesn't take a law degree to realize that, while the court \ndismissed some claims for this reason, the courts have, in fact, ruled \non the merits of several of the claims in favor of the nation. For \nexample, Judge David Campbell, a George W. Bush appointee, ruled:\n  ``The parties did not reach such an agreement, and the nation's \nconstruction of a casino on the Glendale area land will not violate the \ncompact.''\n  He ruled: ``No reasonable reading of the compact could lead a person \nto conclude that it has prohibited new casinos in the Phoenix area.''\n  He ruled: ``The Glendale area land acquired by the nation qualifies \nfor gaming under the Indian Game and Regulatory Act.''\n  Judge Campbell also ruled: ``No other agreements or promises are \nvalid or binding.''\n  The latest unanimous ruling from the Ninth Circuit found that Arizona \nState law, designed to block the Federal Government from taking land it \npurchased into trust on behalf of the nation, was unconstitutional and \nwould frustrate the purpose of the law Congress passed to secure \nreplacement lands for the nation.\n  The rulings further confirmed that, if H.R. 308 is enacted--the land \nthat is\n\n[[Page H8163]]\n\nnow in trust--the nation's contractual and statutory right to sue to \nuse its land would be violated, and the U.S. taxpayer would be on the \nhook to pay the nation up to $1 billion in compensation.\n  We can't dismiss those decisions because it serves the narrative of \nthose who want to keep a ``no competition'' zone in the Phoenix area.\n  With regard to the West Valley--and I represent a part of that area \nup in Maricopa--it is in deep need of stimulus and economic \ndevelopment. This would be a huge shot in the arm as evidenced by the \nsupport of the mayors and city councils of Peoria, Tolleson, and \nGlendale, which is where the casino would be located, representing \n670,000 people in that West Valley area. So I would say that there is \nsupport in the area, and one cannot merely dismiss it as if there is \nnot any.\n  I want to address the claim of reservation shopping head-on. The \nproponents of this bill love to throw around the term ``reservation \nshopping.'' They like to suggest the bad images associated with it. \nThey invoke the ``boogeyman of tribal megacasinos'' outside of major \ncities, but that cannot be further from the truth for the Tohono \nO'odham Nation. This has nothing to do with reservation shopping, and \nthe term is offensive at best. The Tohono O'odham Nation didn't ask for \ntheir land to be flooded and their economic resources to be destroyed. \nThey didn't ask for their agricultural way of life to be taken away. \nThey aren't looking to expand their land base. They are simply trying \nto replace the land that was destroyed by the Federal Government.\n\n  The Gila Bend Act, which authorized the land, is specific only to the \nTohono O'odham Nation. The replacement land can only be purchased in \none of three counties. In fact, the land in question is in the exact \nsame county, Maricopa, where the flooded land was located, and the \nreplacement land was to be specifically used--and I am quoting from the \noriginal Gila Bend Act here of which Senator McCain was a cosponsor--\n``. . . for sustained economic use which is not principally farming and \ndo not require Federal outlays for construction, and promote the \neconomic self-sufficiency or the self-sufficiency of the O'odham Indian \npeople.''\n  Nothing in this situation is off-reservation. This tribe simply has \nreservation lands in two places, thanks to being flooded by a Federal \nproject. So let's please stop talking about ``reservation shopping'' \nand ``Las Vegas-style casinos'' when the casinos in these valleys are \nnot Las Vegas-style casinos but something less than--maybe Reno-style \ncasinos, maybe Atlantic City-style casinos.\n  The fact remains that this act and the land that we are talking \nabout--for the O'odham and the Gila Bend Act--was a replacement to \ntheir losing 10,000 acres due to the Painted Hills Dam that was \nconstructed by the Federal Government. All of the rights have been \naffirmed by the courts, and the right for use has been affirmed by the \ncourt. We can't dismiss those judicial decisions as merely \ninconveniences to some. They are legal decisions; they are binding; the \nland is in trust. For all intents and purposes, the reservation land \nand the complication of passing this bill and the complication of \nfuture liability for the Federal Government is very much part of the \ndecision that is being made today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  Mr. GOSAR. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Arizona makes my exact point.\n  The discovery in the case of the State of Arizona v. TO prohibited \nthe discovery of those minutes and tribal minutes in meetings from \nbeing allowed in the court. That is why the court said they had to find \non behalf of TO, but they knew something was wrong.\n  As cited earlier in my testimony, the Supreme Court ruled once again \nthat Congress--and only Congress--has the jurisdiction over tribal \ntreaties and tribal entities when they claim sovereign immunity. Once \nagain, for 2014, the gentleman from Arizona mis-cites that.\n  Last but not least, jobs have been utilized here, but they should not \nbe utilized by criminal extortion and in violation of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act. This has consequences far beyond that, not just for \nArizona but across the country. When we passed the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act, we expected good faith and to follow the proceedings \nand to not enhance criminal activity. Obviously, just by my citations \nin the record, it shows that there was a conspired, extortive extent to \nwhich the TO conspired to violate the compact that the voters of \nArizona expected to be honored exactly.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am not going to get into the points that were made about extortion \nand immorality.\n  What is going on here is that this piece of legislation, H.R. 308, \nseeks to target just one tribe, the Tohono O'odham Nation, in order to \nretroactively prohibit a specific casino which is on their reservation \nland and which is almost completely constructed and will soon be \noperational. Other wealthy special interests don't want the \ncompetition. It is as simple as that.\n  We have talked about the court cases, the agency's ruling, and the \nland's being taken into trust. The tribe is right in that their West \nValley casino is well within the conditions of the Arizona Gaming \nCompact, and it has been upheld by the courts; but that hasn't stopped \nthe special interests and the wealthy lobbyists from pushing this \nreckless bill year after year.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  By supporting H.R. 308, I think the Members are setting a dangerous \nprecedent. You are saying that no matter what the obligations are to \nour Native Nations by a previous Congress, no matter what was promised \nto them and agreed in law, no matter what was decided and ruled upon by \na court, no matter the process undertaken by the administration--you \nare opening up a very, very dangerous area--that you can unilaterally \nundo, by the request of outside interests for one tribe, their ability \nto take full advantage of the law that was passed in 1986 and to make \nthem whole again economically.\n  You are opening up an era of selective sovereignty where Congress can \ndictate the terms for how and when a tribe can assert its own self-\ndetermination and self-governance. That is akin to Congress being the \nsole determiner of recognizing who is a Native tribe and who isn't.\n  I believe that this bill, H.R. 308, is going to have serious \nramifications for this Congress if it is passed and ever were to become \nlaw. The precedent set here is a dangerous precedent that extends \nbeyond the one tribe that is being targeted now. It's the O'odham \nNation being targeted now. What would prevent this same kind of \nsituation in a different light, under different circumstances on a \ndifferent issue from another tribe being targeted and limited as to the \nuse of their land and under law?\n  Mr. Speaker, let me close by saying that this controversial and \npotentially costly legislation really has no place on the suspension \ncalendar. At the very least, Members deserve the opportunity to fully \ndebate H.R. 308 and to offer amendments to address the serious concerns \nraised by the legislation.\n  For example, the bill should be amended to guarantee that any Federal \nliability resulting from litigation sparked by H.R. 308--liability that \nthe CBO estimates could be as high as $1 billion--shall not result in a \nreduction in funding for any Bureau of Indian Affairs programs. We \nshould not punish the rest of Indian country for the greed of a few.\n  Second, the legislation should be amended to clarify that this \nprohibition on gaming should not apply to land specifically authorized \nby Congress as compensation for trust lands destroyed by the Federal \nagency action. If the bill is designed to stop so-called off-\nreservation gaming and reservation shopping, it should clearly exempt \nreservation lands provided to a tribe to replace land that the Federal \nGovernment destroyed.\n  If the aim of H.R. 308 is to enforce Arizona's tribal-State gaming \ncompact, this legislation should be amended to be clear that gaming can \ntake place as\n\n[[Page H8164]]\n\nlong as it is conducted pursuant to the compact.\n  Bringing H.R. 308 to the floor under suspension is unfair, and it \nonly serves the interests of those who would rather not discuss the \nissues highlighted by these and other amendments.\n  Finally, let me reiterate that regardless of how you voted the last \ntime around, this is a completely different situation. As of July 2014, \nthe land is now in trust. It is now part of the Tohono O'odham \nReservation. This casino is set to open for business next month. If \nthis legislation was unfair before, it is now just shameful.\n  Mr. Speaker, there was only one promise that was made that needs to \nbe kept; the solemn promise this government made to the Tohono O'odham \nNation with the passage of the Gila Bend Act in 1986. H.R. 308 will \nbreak that promise. It will set a dangerous precedent for settled land \nclaims and will forever be a black mark on the dealings with Indian \nnations.\n  I urge Members to oppose H.R. 308. I remind my colleagues that this \npiece of legislation, while tempered and promoted for interests, \ncarries with it extensive liability, dangerous precedents, and deserves \na full, regular order debate, which we are not going to have today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Walker). The gentleman has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This has been a good debate. Of course, I brought this bill to the \nfloor on behalf of the mostly unanimous Arizona delegation. My role in \nthis is that I am, in fact, the prime author of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act itself.\n  I would suggest that what is being proposed here and the opposition \nto it, H.R. 308 does not affect land into trust and is a temporary \nhalt. All this bill does is stop the opening of this casino, which they \ndid, I believe, under the guise of dishonesty to the general public. \nPromises made, promises kept.\n  When the Governor and all the tribes, including the Tohono O'odham \nTribe, agreed and signed a compact not to expand gambling in the State \nof Arizona, as they were doing so, in signing the compact, they were in \npreparations to buy this land, not telling anybody, not acknowledging \nor thinking of another casino. At least they should have had the \ncourage and the guts not to sign the compact.\n  It went to the public. Promises made to the public. It would never \nhave passed. Gambling in Arizona would not be there if they did not \nhave this understanding there would be no expansion.\n  Now we have a group--and don't talk about greed, et cetera. There are \npeople in that group who are just as greedy, trying to take and \nestablish a gambling place where they said they wouldn't do it. That \nwas the compact. That was the understanding with the State. That was \nthe State legislative body.\n  Then we hear on the other side we can't vote for this because it is \ngoing to take jobs away. Away from whom? Other Natives. Other American \nIndians.\n  Remember, these casinos were built on a platform, a model of how many \npeople go in and how many people come out. That is how you make these \ncasinos pay, and that was the understanding and the plan that all the \ntribes agreed to. They all signed it, and we have documentation of \nthat.\n  It was voted on by the general public because the general public did \nnot want an expansion of gambling within the State of Arizona. It \npassed in good faith, but the faith was not that good. It was not the \nspirit and intent of the Indian Gaming Act at all. It broke the compact \nwith the State and the people of the State. That is what we have to \nthink about.\n  There is a factor here that was not exposed during the conference and \nin negotiating with the State and with the tribes. It was not exposed \nyet. It was taking place, not in sincerity but, in fact, in dishonesty.\n  I don't like to get involved in these tribal wars, but what is being \nencouraged here is wrong with that compact. The promise made by the \npeople for the people and with the people and with the tribes, and you \nare asking us not to stop that.\n  This is a good piece of legislation to make sure a dishonest act does \nnot take place. A breaking of a promise while you are holding your hand \nbehind your back with your fingers crossed when you have the other hand \nup swearing, that is what occurred.\n  So I am asking my colleagues to listen to the Arizona delegation and \nthe Governor. I am asking my colleagues to think about a promise made \nshould be kept and only the Congress will make sure it is kept.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 308, the Keep the Promise Act is a \nclose call on the merits. However, as I have stated in the \nCongressional Record before (for example on September 25, 2012), when a \nbill is controversial and a close call on the merits, we should not be \nconsidering it under suspension of the rules. Accordingly, I cannot \nvote to suspend the rules.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today the House is scheduled \nto consider H.R. 308, the ``Keep the Promise Act of 2015'' which would \nprohibit gaming on property near Glendale, Arizona that is owned by the \nTohono O'odham Nation and held in trust by the United States. The \nTohono O'odham Nation is currently constructing a resort and casino on \nthis property and expects to begin operations within a year.\n  The Congressional Budget Office expects that if this legislation were \nenacted, the tribe would pursue litigation against the federal \ngovernment to recover its financial losses from foregone gaming \nrevenue. For this reason, the Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat possible compensation payments from the government could range \nfrom nothing to more than $1 billion. However, the Congressional Budget \nOffice concludes that it has no basis for estimating the outcome of the \nfuture litigation.\n  Budget enforcement is among my top priorities for the 114th Congress. \nIt is my intention to ensure compliance with the Congressional Budget \nAct and House Rules as they apply to budget enforcement on the floor. \nHowever, given the considerable uncertainty of the budget impact of \nthis legislation as concluded by the Congressional Budget Office, it is \nmy position that a definitive score for this legislation cannot be \ndetermined.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 308.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8164-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8164-H8169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FAIRNESS TO VETERANS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 1694) to amend MAP-21 to improve contracting \nopportunities for veteran-owned small business concerns, and for other \npurposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1694\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and insert extraneous materials into the Record on H.R. \n1694.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by expressing my deepest condolences to the \nfamilies, friends, and loved ones of those killed in last Friday's \nterrorist attacks in Paris. My prayers go out to them, the French \npeople, and all those lovers of freedom and peace who have been shaken \nby this very savage attack.\n  As Americans, we are too familiar with the specter of terrorism. \nFourteen years ago, on September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked our \nhomeland. 9/11 was a call to action for tens of thousands of men and \nwomen who enlisted and served in our Nation's Armed Forces in defense \nof the American ideals that we all hold so dear.\n  Now, each year, more than 250,000 of these post-9/11 veterans are \nreturning home and transitioning into civilian life after service and \ncontinue to serve as leaders in our communities and in our economy. In \nfact, one quarter of these veterans say they are interested in starting \nor buying their own businesses. This is exactly, Mr. Speaker, the kind \nof entrepreneurial spirit that makes America work.\n  To support these heroic individuals and to put their unique skills \nand commitment to best use, the Federal Government has a role to play \nin empowering them to succeed in the private sector, especially in \nterms of Federal contracting. A number of agencies do.\n  For example, Mr. Speaker, the Veterans Administration has been a \nleader in engaging the veteran-owned small-business community within \ntheir agency, working on contracting and procurement and seeing the \nbenefits of increased veteran involvement. In fact, this week, in my \nown State of Pennsylvania, the VA, in collaboration with other Federal \nagencies and partners, will host its fifth national veterans small-\nbusiness engagement event. This event is expected to attract nearly \n3,000 veteran businessowners and focus on promoting and supporting \nveteran-owned small businesses' access to economic opportunities. VA \nSecretary Robert McDonald said the event highlights the agency's \n``commitment by offering veteran businessowners the tools they need to \nthrive in the Federal marketplace. We want to do all that we can to \nhelp our veterans be successful,'' he said.\n  However, while these veteran businessowners will be making valuable \ninroads into working within the Federal contracting and procurement \nprograms, they won't be talking about rebuilding our Nation's \ninfrastructure through competing for Federal contracts.\n  That is because even with the immense amount of work facing the \nDepartment of Transportation, its small-business contracting program \ndoesn't put veteran small businesses on a level playing field when \ncompeting for contracts. That is a real problem, not only for missed \nopportunities for veteran-owned businesses but missed opportunities to \nput veteran-owned firms on the front lines of our battle to rebuild our \ninfrastructure.\n  While I am a supporter of having a completely level playing field \nthroughout Federal contracting for every small business, the fact is \nthat today, some get a preference when doing business with the Federal \nGovernment where veterans do not. While 10 percent of federally funded \ninfrastructure projects are set aside for small businesses, our \nveterans are excluded from competing equally. That is not fair, and \nthat is why I rise today to offer bipartisan legislation to address it.\n  My bipartisan Fairness to Veterans for Infrastructure Investment Act \nis a simple, yet powerful update to current law. It would allow \nveteran-owned small businesses to compete in an existing infrastructure \nsmall-business program known as the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise \nProgram or DBE. This simple legislation is critical to both the shared \ngoal of creating and sustaining jobs for our veterans and rebuilding \nour Nation's infrastructure.\n  This bill is an idea that my constituents in Bucks County, \nPennsylvania, know as fairness to veterans and they support it.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  When I visit veteran-owned small businesses across my district which \nhave received their veteran-owned small-business certification, it is \neasy to see its impact on their outlook. Connecting veteran-owned \nbusinesses to the contracting power of the Federal Government opens the \ndoor for increased production, the hiring of additional staff--\noftentimes veterans themselves--and opens doors to national \nopportunities.\n  But it is not just Pennsylvania veterans who would benefit from this \nmeasure. Fairness to Veterans would level the playing field for more \nthan 380,000 veteran-owned construction firms across the Nation. And it \nis not just construction firms that will benefit. There are, in fact, a \nvariety of industries involved, such as personnel, administrative, \nengineering, landscaping, utilities, and information technology. So \nthis is an issue that affects all veteran-owned small businesses.\n  With this obviously positive impact, it is easy to see why the \nAmerican Legion--one of the foremost organizations advocating for \nveterans in the workforce--backs this bill. Its 2.3 million members \nsupport providing parity for veterans in all small-business government \ncontracting programs.\n  Here is what they just said in a message to all of our offices:\n  ``The Fairness to Veterans for Infrastructure Investment Act of 2015 \nis a bipartisan, commonsense, and `no cost to the taxpayer' update of \nexisting legislation that redresses the exclusion of veteran small \nbusinesses when the framework of the DBE program was originally \ndrafted.\n  ``Currently, only half of the States meet their DBE goals. Adding \nveteran small businesses to this program would increase the pool of \neligible firms at the States' disposal. For States that already meet \ntheir goals, this bill does not affect them or the small-business \ncontractors that they employ.\n  ``We cannot in good conscience stand idle while our veterans are \nprecluded from this Federal program.''\n  Members of this body from both sides of the aisle should see the \npositive impact that can be made by putting the most trained workforce \nin history on the job of rebuilding our Nation's roads and bridges. \nThat is what the Fairness to Veterans for Infrastructure Investment Act \nis all about.\n  As a member of the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus and an advocate \nfor tens of thousands of veterans in my district in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan \neffort.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, flags throughout the Nation are at half staff, and, \ncoincidentally, we have just celebrated our own Veterans Day. We \nparticularly feel that celebration here in the District of Columbia \nwhere we have served our country since it was created and still have no \nvote on this floor, even though the residents of the city I represent \npay the highest taxes per capita of any residents anywhere in the \nUnited States, including our veterans, who continue to go to war \nwithout a vote.\n  But this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, in the wake of Veterans Day, the \nHouse is considering several bills that will benefit the Nation's \nveterans. I strongly support much of this legislation. I believe that \nmany of these bills will pass the House without a single dissenting \nvote.\n  Regrettably, that is not the case, Mr. Speaker, for H.R. 1694, which \nI cannot support because, as currently drafted, it may cause \ndestructive harm to the Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged \nBusiness Enterprise, or DBE, program, which helps combat historic \ndiscrimination against women and minority-owned small businesses.\n  The DBE program helps level the playing field and provides an \nopportunity for these small businesses to\n\n[[Page H8166]]\n\nfairly compete for highway and transit construction contracts. \nRegrettably, this bill could destroy the entire program, taking \neverything down with it, including the veterans it purports to add.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has been very clear in determining that the \nDBE program must be subject to the highest standard of constitutional \nreview by the courts, known as the strict scrutiny test, to be \nconstitutional. Under the strict scrutiny test established by the U.S. \nSupreme Court, the DBE program must be narrowly tailored to serve a \ncompelling governmental interest.\n  To meet these objectives, State Departments of Transportation and \npublic transit agencies must certify individual DBE businesses and \nconduct extensive disparity studies to determine the appropriate goal \nfor awarding contracts to the small businesses owned by women and \nminorities in a particular community or State. That is a very rigorous \nstandard.\n  The bill before us today, however, adds all veteran-owned businesses \nwithout the constitutionally mandated study. I emphasize that service-\nconnected disabled veterans are and always have been included. They are \na narrowly tailored group of veterans. However, the change offered \ntoday threatens the constitutionality of the existing DBE program \nbecause it would no longer clearly meet one of the two essential \nelements of the Supreme Court test.\n  The most important is that the program be narrowly tailored to \naddress the continued effects of discrimination, which the disparity \nstudy must have already shown. Thus, although the bill has a worthy \nobjective, it has an unintended consequence of threatening the very \nprogram designed to help level the playing field for small businesses \nowned by women and minorities and, as would happen, veterans as well. \nIt just would blow up the whole program.\n  The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and I have met extensively \nwith the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) to outline these \nconcerns. Mr. Cummings and I, in response, developed an alternative \napproach to create a veteran-owned business enterprise program within \nthe Department of Transportation. Under that program, there would be a \nnational goal to ensure that veteran-owned small businesses receive \nhighway and transit construction contracts. Moreover, this program \nwould not undermine the constitutionality of the existing DBE program.\n  Mr. Cummings and I introduced that bill earlier today, and I had \nhoped, in the spirit of compromise that is necessary to save the \nprogram at this point, we could proceed with that compromise proposal \nthat would achieve all of our objectives: Mr. Fitzpatrick's objectives \nand the objectives that have been in the bill since the 1980s. \nRegrettably, we have not yet reached any such agreement on this \napproach with the gentleman from Pennsylvania prior to today's \nconsideration of H.R. 1694.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, only in the Nation's Capital, only in Washington, D.C., \nwould somebody ever make the argument that adding veterans to any \nFederal program would make it weaker, but that is the argument we just \nheard. The fact is, of the hundreds of thousands of veteran-owned small \nbusinesses in the United States of America, the owners of many of them \nare women veterans, the owners are minority veterans.\n  I just want to address some of the arguments that my colleague from \nthe District of Columbia has made, two in particular.\n  First, the Fairness to Veterans for Infrastructure Investment Act \ndoes not presume that veterans are socially and economically \ndisadvantaged for purposes of the DBE program. Instead, the veteran-\nowned small businesses are given the exact same definition that they \nhave in other contracting programs through the Small Business Act. The \nDBE program was set up to assist certain classes of small businesses, \nand this bill does not affect those businesses, number one.\n  Number two, the Fairness to Veterans for Infrastructure Investment \nAct uses existing Small Business Act definitions requiring that \nbusinesses be 51 percent owned or controlled by veterans. The \ncertification process and the screening was put in place by the \nDepartment of Transportation regulations, a similar process that would \napply to veteran-owned small businesses. Additionally, any business \nparticipating in the DBE program could also be publicly owned.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I do want to note that the gentleman is \ncorrect that women are covered. They are already covered. One-third of \nthose covered under the DBE category of minority and ethnic groups are \nminorities. So we do have large numbers of women and minorities \ncovered, and the disparity studies have been done as to them.\n  No disparity studies have been done as to veterans as a whole. If the \ngentleman wants to do such a study, we invite him to work with us in \ndoing a disparity study on veterans rather than blowing up the whole \nprogram.\n  I now yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), \na member of the committee and my good friend.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and \nI also thank her for her leadership as the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Highways and Transit of the Committee on Transportation \nand Infrastructure.\n  This past week, our Nation paused to honor the extraordinary service \nof our Nation's veterans. The foundation of America's military is not \nships or missiles, and it isn't tanks or jets. The foundation of our \nmilitary is the men and women who voluntarily serve, the ones who give \ntheir blood, sweat, and tears to make sure that we have the freedom \nthat we experience every day.\n  Too often those who have served our country, particularly after the \nterrible events of 9/11, have faced significant challenges finding \ncivilian employment. Earlier this year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nreleased a report on veterans' employment in 2014. According to the \nBLS, last year there were more than 21 million men and women who had \nserved in our Armed Forces, or approximately 9 percent of our civilian \npopulation.\n  The BLS found that in 2014 the jobless rate for all veterans was 5.3 \npercent, while the unemployment rate for veterans who had served since \n9/11 was 7.2 percent. The BLS also found that the unemployment rate for \nveterans in my home State of Maryland was 8.5 percent, the highest \namong all 50 States.\n  According to data drawn from the Census Bureau's Survey of Business \nOwners in 2007, there were nearly 2\\1/2\\ million businesses in the \nUnited States of which veterans comprised the majority ownership. \nTogether, these businesses had receipts of approximately $1.2 trillion. \nNearly half a million of these businesses were also employers, with a \ncombined annual payroll of approximately $210 billion.\n  Now, I agree with Representative Fitzpatrick that we must expand \nprograms that help veterans find employment after their service ends \nand that we should expand contracting opportunities in the highway and \ntransit programs for small businesses owned by veterans. I just don't \nthink adding veterans to the existing DBE program is the right way to \naccomplish these goals.\n  Adding veteran-owned small businesses to the DBE program would force \nthe veteran-owned businesses to compete with disadvantaged business \nenterprises already participating in the program for contracting \nopportunities. The best way to help veterans is to establish a Federal \nparticipation goal that is specifically for veteran-owned small \nbusinesses and business concerns separate and apart from the DBE \nprogram.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Today I and several of my colleagues introduced legislation to \naccomplish just that. Our bill, H.R. 3997, would amend the MAP-21 \nprogram to create a 10 percent aspirational goal for veteran-owned \nsmall-business concerns.\n  Setting a specific and separate goal for veteran-owned businesses \nwould be\n\n[[Page H8167]]\n\nconsistent with existing Federal contracting programs while ensuring \nthat veterans do not have to compete with any other business under the \naspirational goal.\n  Setting a separate goal would also ensure that we do not make changes \nto the DBE program that could open the program to new legal challenges \nthat could limit the program's ability to serve either DBEs or \nveterans.\n  I hope that my colleagues across the aisle agree to work with us to \ncreate a program that will provide the maximum benefit to veterans, \nwhich is a Veterans Business Enterprise program with its own \naspirational goals.\n  To that end, I join Ranking Member Norton in urging Members to oppose \nthe bill currently before us in favor of creating a program that will \nserve veterans and only veterans.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleagues. I would just \nindicate that this is not a bill that was just recently filed. This was \nfiled and has been pending in the House since 2012, when I first filed \nthe Fairness to Veterans Act, seeking to put our veterans to work as \nthey are coming off the battlefield and coming back into a difficult \neconomy, many of them starting businesses because they are \nentrepreneurial, because they are hard workers, and because they have \nthose skills that they achieved while defending our Nation with our \ntraining. They want to put it back in the economy and help get their \ncountry's economy moving again.\n  Many of them found that, as they were competing for contracts, they \nwere not on a level playing field. I indicated that for 5 years this \npolicy has been pending and there have been too few meetings to try to \nforward the idea of helping our Nation's veterans compete.\n  For 5 years our Federal Government has been measuring the DBE \nprogram. On the 10 percent contracting goal that is set forth in the \nDisadvantaged Business Enterprise program, for 5 years in a row, 25 of \nthe 50 States--half of the States--never met their 10 percent goal.\n  So when we hear that we don't want our Nation's veterans competing \nagainst others within the 10 percent set-aside, first of all, half the \n10 percent set-aside is not being met. Number two, I think we do want \ncompetition. I think we do want our Nation's veterans competing.\n  It will not only be good for our Nation's veterans, it will be good \nfor all enterprises, all businesses, in this country. Competition is \nwhat built this country. Competition will help put our Nation's \nveterans back to work and get our roads and bridges rebuilt, which is a \nbig and important job.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan). The gentleman from Pennsylvania \nhas 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, with respect to that big and important \njob that our Nation's veterans are prepared for, I would say that we \nknow that they are up to the challenge, and the statistics prove it.\n  There are 250,000 veterans transitioning each year from military to \ncivilian life, and they are looking for their next mission. A quarter \nof them say they want to start or buy their own business in the future. \nThat is something that we should celebrate, encourage, and support.\n  They join the nearly one in seven veterans who are self-employed or \nare small-business owners right now. The impact of veteran-owned \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs with a veteran background on our economy \nis impressive.\n  There are currently 3.7 million veteran-owned businesses in the \nUnited States, accounting for more than $1.6 trillion in receipts and \nemploying 8.2 million people. Of them, there are more than 380,000 \nveteran-owned construction firms, 414,519 veteran-owned firms in the \nprofessional, scientific, and technical services, and over 10 percent \nof all manufacturing firms are veteran owned. These are the people that \nwould stand to benefit from this commonsense bill.\n  Unfortunately, the numbers also show that 75 percent of current \nveteran business owners are over the age of 55. That means we need to \nsupport the next generation of veteran small-business owners. The \nFairness to Veterans for Infrastructure Act lays that groundwork.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The gentleman said there haven't been enough meetings. I met with the \ngentleman more than once and then wrote an extensive memo on the \nproblems with the bill.\n  You just can't divide veterans the day after Veterans Day. You can't \ndivide this House on the question of veterans, not when we have offered \nan entire program for veterans.\n  So I don't know what is so sacred about being in this particular \nprogram. In fact, the gentleman mentioned that minorities and women \nwere not, in fact, meeting all of their goals. Therefore, some of those \ngoals are left on the table.\n  That is a very important point. Because being a minority or a woman \nis not enough to qualify you for this--and I don't even want to call it \na set-aside for this goal is not a set-aside. So these minorities and \nwomen have to show equivalent skills with others who are competing. It \nis not an easy thing to do.\n  So it is not a question of whether there are some leftover points to \nbe picked up by veterans. The DBE program has 30 years of history in \nthe United States Supreme Court.\n  Mr. Speaker, even with that history, every time this bill is passed \nthe DBE program is challenged. Each time the Justice Department, under \nDemocratic and Republican Presidents, have defended it as a narrowly \ntailored program.\n  Recognizing that history and the strict, narrowly tailored standard, \nthe gentleman was offered a way for veterans to, in fact, be recognized \nin transportation and infrastructure programs.\n  He was offered a way that is probably even better than the program \nthat unites minorities, women, and, I might add, service-disabled \nveterans, who are a narrowly tailored group that is already included.\n  But instead of accepting this offer, he has decided he wants to blow \nup the entire DBE program for veterans and everyone else. We can't \nagree to such a destructive approach, particularly when we have offered \nthe gentleman a way for veterans to be recognized.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is disappointing to hear the motives behind my \ninterest in putting our Nation's veterans back to work being \nmischaracterized on the floor, the 5-year effort from 2011 to 2015 \nwhere I patiently worked on both sides of the aisle, where I patiently \nintroduced bills, where I patiently signed up sponsors and cosponsors \non both sides of the aisle.\n  Only in Washington, D.C., would you say that, after 5 years' worth of \nlegislative work on an issue to help our veterans, we are rushing \nsomething to the floor. That is what is being suggested here today.\n  In fact, this bill is the product of years of work, much of that work \nhand in hand with The American Legion. And, Mr. Speaker, this is what \nThe American Legion has to say: On behalf of the 2.3 million members of \nThe American Legion, I would like to express my support for H.R. 1694, \nthe Fairness to Veterans for Infrastructure Investment Act.\n  This bill passed as a resolution at the National Convention of The \nAmerican Legion. They supported the Fairness to Veterans for \nInfrastructure Investment Act. It was Resolution 339. It passed The \nAmerican Legion's 2014 national convention.\n  It states that The American Legion ``supports legislation to ensure \nequal parity for all veterans in all small-business government \ncontracting programs, thus ensuring no veteran procurement program is \nat a disadvantage in competing with any other government procurement \nprogram established by law.''\n  The American Legion supports the passage of this legislation. It also \ngoes on to applaud the leadership in addressing this critical issue \nfacing our Nation's servicemembers and veterans. Mr. Speaker, that is \nfrom Michael Helm, National Commander of The American Legion.\n\n[[Page H8168]]\n\n  Let me add that we are not just talking about construction firms, as \nI said earlier. We are talking about a wide swath of veteran businesses \nthat will be impacted.\n  This is what The American Legion pointed out at their national \nmeeting. They pointed out that: This bipartisan, commonsense, and no \ncost to taxpayer update of existing legislation redresses the exclusion \nof veteran-owned small businesses when the framework of the DBE program \nwas originally drafted, such as personnel, administrative, engineering, \nlandscaping, utilities and information technology. So, again, this is \nan issue that affects all veteran-owned small businesses.\n  That is from Joe Sharpe, Director of The American Legion's Veterans \nEmployment and Education Division.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The gentleman mentioned 5 years that he has put into his bill. His \nparty has been in power the past 5 years. As far as I know, he never \nasked for a hearing so that these issues could be clarified. I am sure \nthat, if he had, we might have been able to iron this out.\n  Even without a hearing, based on what the Supreme Court has said, we \nhave no choice but to oppose the bill as he has offered it, in not \ndifferentiating among the veterans he is speaking about, but putting in \na global group, which has never been done or approved.\n  We have barely been able to get the Supreme Court to agree to let \nsuch programs prevail, but we have always succeeded in getting the \nCourt to understand that past discrimination has been shown through \ndisparity studies. Without any disparity studies, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania means to march straight up to the Supreme Court and say: \nWe are veterans. Approve us anyway.\n  Nobody opposes veterans, particularly at this time, following what we \nhave seen in Paris. The way to make sure that veterans are not left out \nis to sit down with us and figure it out, not to barnstorm the floor in \nthe hope that, since you are in the majority, it will pass.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia indicated \nthat there has not been a hearing in the House of Representatives in \nthe relevant subcommittees or committees on the Fairness to Veterans \nfor Infrastructure Investment Act.\n  The fact is, for 5 years, this bill has been pending. Anybody on the \ncommittee, including Ms. Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, \ncould have asked for and had a hearing.\n  It is a shame that, after 5 years, there was no hearing. But we have \na hearing now on the floor here on this bill.\n  In addition to the Transportation Committee, the bill was also \nreferred to the Small Business Committee. The American Legion testified \non the bill within one of their subcommittees.\n  So there was a hearing. There was testimony. There was an opportunity \nfor all Members to question and to follow up on those questions and to \nsubmit material after the hearing was over.\n  So, after 5 years of debate, after 5 years of negotiation, after 5 \nyears of working with committees and subcommittees, this bill was \nprepared to be voted on here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter from The American \nLegion dated April 22, 2015, signed by National Commander Michael D. \nHelm, in support of the Fairness to Veterans for Infrastructure \nInvestment Act.\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2015.\n     Hon. Michael Fitzpatrick,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Fitzpatrick: On behalf of the 2.3 \n     million members of The American Legion I would like to \n     express support for H.R. 1694, the Fairness to Veterans for \n     Infrastructure Investment Act.\n       Resolution 339, passed at The American Legion's 2014 \n     National Convention states that The American Legion ``. . . \n     supports legislation to ensure equal parity for all veterans \n     in all small business government contracting programs, thus \n     ensuring no veteran procurement program is at a disadvantage \n     in competing with any other government procurement program \n     established by law.''\n       This bill would work to achieve this end, by making \n     veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs) eligible for \n     Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) programs of the \n     Department of Transportation (DoT). Veterans are not presumed \n     to be socially or economically disadvantaged for purposes of \n     DBE programs; instead the proposed legislation would make \n     VOSBs independently eligible by establishing VOSBs as a \n     separate entity who count for the purposes of the 10 percent \n     goal as set by DoT.\n       Again, The American Legion supports passage of this \n     legislation, and applauds your leadership in addressing this \n     critical issue facing our nation's service members and \n     veterans.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Michael D. Helm,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This is the first time I have ever heard a Member from the majority \nsay that a Member from the minority should have asked for a hearing on \nhis bill. If you are in the majority and you want a hearing on your \nbill, that is your obligation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown), my \ngood friend, for the purpose of a colloquy.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me just say that \nwe just finished celebrating Veterans Day, and as the ranking member, I \nsupport veterans 100 percent.\n  Also, as a minority, I have a question for the gentlewoman because we \njust celebrated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and, of course, minorities \nhave had a tough time participating in many programs.\n  Can you tell me, if this amendment passed, how will this affect the \nMBA, the minority business program in transportation?\n  We have both been on this committee. I have been on it for over 23 \nyears, and we know it has to be narrowly tailored, or else we will have \nno programs.\n  Ms. NORTON. I thank the gentlewoman for her question.\n  Unfortunately, there is some very rough history to prove what needs \nto be done. It is not as if we are speculating on what the \nconstitutional standard is. The constitutional standard has been \ndeveloped. The States have to do their disparity studies all over again \nto show that groups should still be included. Some groups may fall out.\n  This is delicate work, and in our constitutional government, we don't \nsay every worthy group should have a preference. We need to make a \nshowing, and if that showing isn't made, then the matter will not \nstand.\n  If you want to give a very, very painful example of that, let's take \nthe Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court of the United States \noverturned, about 5 years ago, the Voting Rights Act.\n  Guess why, Mr. Speaker? They said there had been some changes, and \nthat people of color could now vote, as they couldn't always vote when \nthe Voting Rights Act was passed. And so they threw it back to this \nCongress, and said: All right, you can have a Voting Rights Act but you \nmust update the Act to show that there is still a disparity in voting. \nThere are pending now three bills in order to do that.\n  But if the Supreme Court did that on the Voting Rights Act, where the \ndiscrimination was perhaps the most apparent, from poll taxes to \nlynching, you can imagine where we would be on DBE, and we have got 30 \nyears of court history to show it.\n  We all want to do the best that we possibly can for our veterans. The \nway to do that is to sit down and design a bill that would, in fact, \npass constitutional muster. We know how to do it.\n  This is not a matter of the ego of whoever introduces the bill. It is \na matter of how you make sure that veterans, in fact, are designated, \nin a constitutional way, for participation in the soon-to-be-signed-by-\nthe-President surface transportation bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from the District of \nColumbia has 45 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, we have done the best we could for our \nveterans in speaking for this bill today. We remain open to assuring \nthat the veterans participate in the funds that are\n\n[[Page H8169]]\n\nabout to come from the transportation and infrastructure bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, we know that we must rebuild our \ncrumbling infrastructure in this country. That is not a question.\n  In fact, in my home State of Pennsylvania, 15 percent of roads are in \npoor condition, and there are over 5,200 structurally deficient \nbridges.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill \n(H.R. 3114) to provide funds to the Army Corps of Engineers to hire \nveterans and members of the Armed Forces to assist the Corps with \ncuration and historic preservation activities, and for other purposes, \nas amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 3114\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Corps of Engineers and other Federal agencies are \n     required to preserve and catalogue artifacts and other items \n     of national historical significance that are uncovered during \n     the course of their work (notably under part 79 of title 36, \n     Code of Federal Regulations).\n       (2) Uncatalogued artifacts within the care of Federal \n     agencies are stored in hundreds of repositories and museums \n     across the Nation.\n       (3) In October 2009, the Corps of Engineers, Center of \n     Expertise for the Curation and Management of Archaeological \n     Collections, initiated the Veterans' Curation Program to \n     employ and train Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in \n     archaeological processing.\n       (4) The Veterans' Curation Program employs veterans and \n     members of the Armed Forces in the sorting, cleaning, and \n     cataloguing of artifacts managed by the Corps of Engineers.\n       (5) Employees of the Veterans' Curation Program gain \n     valuable work skills, including computer database management, \n     records management, photographic and scanning techniques, \n     computer software proficiency, vocabulary and writing skills, \n     and interpersonal communication skills, as well as knowledge \n     and training in archaeology and history.\n       (6) Since 2009, a total of 241 veterans have participated \n     in the Veterans' Curation Program, including the current \n     class of 38 participants. Of the 203 graduates of the \n     program, 87 percent have received permanent employment in a \n     field related to training received under the program or \n     chosen to continue their education.\n       (7) Experience in archaeological curation gained through \n     the Veterans' Curation Program is valuable training and \n     experience for the museum, forensics, administrative, records \n     management, and other fields.\n       (8) Veterans' Curation Program participants may assist the \n     Corps of Engineers in developing a more efficient and \n     comprehensive collections management program and also may \n     provide the workforce to meet the records management needs at \n     other agencies and departments, including the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT FOR VETERANS AND MEMBERS OF \n                   ARMED FORCES IN CURATION AND HISTORIC \n                   PRESERVATION.\n\n       Using available funds, the Secretary of the Army, acting \n     through the Chief of Engineers, shall carry out a Veterans' \n     Curation Program to hire veterans and members of the Armed \n     Forces to assist the Secretary in carrying out curation and \n     historic preservation activities.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Gibbs) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on H.R. 3114.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As our veterans return home, they deserve opportunities for \nemployment in addition to our thanks for their brave sacrifice and \nservice.\n  I believe one of the greatest responsibilities our government has is \nto ensure the members of our military, both Active and retired, and \ntheir families have opportunities upon returning home.\n  Our veterans gave a career of service to their country, risked their \nlives in combat, and experienced long periods of separation from their \nfamilies.\n  The Veterans Curation Program was created to give veterans the \nopportunity to adjust to a civilian work environment and learn \nimportant skills while processing at-risk archeological collections \nbelonging to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  By investing in servicemembers, the Veterans Curation Program is \nbuilding on the skills that veterans acquire during military service, \nincluding leadership, teamwork, and attention to detail.\n  Working under the direct supervision of professionals in the field of \narchaeology, the veterans receive competitive pay and technical \ntraining in a peer-to-peer veterans environment. I urge all Members to \nsupport the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of H.R. 3114, as stated by my \ncolleague, a bipartisan bill, introduced along with my colleague, \nCongressman Rodney Davis from Illinois, to permanently authorize \navailable funds from the Army Corps of Engineers to hire veterans for \ncuration and historic preservation of archaeological sites, items of \nhistorical value during their excavation and during other related \nactivities.\n  It is very notable that, on the legislative week immediately \nfollowing Veterans Day, the House is considering important legislation \nto provide job training assistance to hire and train our veterans.\n  As part of our government's effort to protect our Nation's \narchaeological heritage, Federal agencies are required to provide \ncuration and preservation services to professional museums and archival \npractices.\n  In 2009, the Army Corps of Engineers began training veterans in \narchaeological processing activities, using temporary funds provided by \nthe American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, otherwise known as ARRA.\n  For 6 years, veterans have enrolled in the program, and have been \nacquiring valuable job skills, including but not limited to computer \ndatabase management, records management, scanning, and photographing \nrecords and artifacts. These are skills further preparing our veterans \nfor today's competitive job market by giving them valuable, hands-on \nexperience.\n  As of earlier this year, 231 veterans have gone through the program, \nand currently they have 38 veterans in this current class.\n  As a direct result of the program, 139 veterans have obtained \npermanent employment; 39 have continued their education, either at \ncolleges, universities, or in certificated programs.\n  Not only does the Corps' Veterans Curation Program educate, train, \nand employ veterans, the program's jobs are tailored to fit the \ncapabilities of disabled veterans. The Corps undertakes these \nactivities in three facilities across our country, located in Georgia, \nVirginia, and Missouri.\n  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I are grateful for the chance to \nprovide our veterans an opportunity to continue\n\n[[Page H8170]]\n\nhealing by carrying out meaningful work and job training that is \nhelping them and their families reintegrate, become more productive, \nand that is so beneficial to our Nation.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support making this worthwhile program \npermanent and joining me in passing this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a program that is very worthwhile. It is one of \nthe agency's many efforts to continue helping our veterans be able to \nget job training, get job skills, and be able to sustain their families \nin a way that may make them feel whole again. I do ask all my \ncolleagues to support this.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3144, the \nPartners for Aviation Security Act of 2015.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this important bipartisan legislation ensures that the \ncritical decisions affecting the transportation security of the United \nStates are not made in a vacuum without the input and perspective of \nrelevant transportation stakeholders.\n  Unfortunately, the Transportation Security Administration has a \ntroublesome history when making sweeping policy changes at the expense \nof the traveling public and other affected parties, such as aviation \nworkers, airports, airlines, vendors, and law enforcement.\n  Specifically, H.R. 3144 requires the Administrator of TSA to consult, \nwhen possible, with the Aviation Security Advisory Committee before \ndetermining whether to modify the prohibited items lists for passenger \naircraft.\n  In the 113th Congress, the Subcommittee on Transportation Security \nconducted oversight of efforts to modify the prohibited items list \nafter TSA made a sweeping decision to do so without appropriate prior \nconsultation with stakeholders. By codifying the Aviation Security \nAdvisory Committee, or ASAC, the committee has a proven record of \nensuring that TSA consults with stakeholders on important matters of \ntransportation security when appropriate.\n  This commonsense legislation adds to this record. Another important \nprovision of this bill requires that the Secretary of Homeland Security \nsubmit a report to both Congress and the Transportation Security \nOversight Board, including important information on the Board's \ncomposition and activities. This report may include recommendations for \nCongress and the Department to improve the Board and ensure that it is \nmeeting the original intent of providing review to transportation \nsecurity-related regulations and making a meaningful contribution to \nthe security of our Nation's critical transportation systems.\n  Each and every day, Mr. Speaker, there are new and evolving threats \nto the security of America's traveling public, and it is the important \nwork of the Department of Homeland Security and TSA to ensure that \ntravelers are safe and to mitigate threats against transportation. In \nthis regard, it is of the highest importance that relevant partners in \ntransportation security are engaged and included in ongoing dialogue on \nimportant policy matters being considered.\n  I wish to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. McCaul, as \nwell as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, \nMr. Katko, for their work in bringing this bill to the floor today and \nconducting critical oversight efforts to secure America's \ntransportation systems. Additionally, I wish to thank the bill's \nauthor, Congressman Payne, for his hard work and dedication to this \nissue. Finally, I would like to thank the ranking member of the full \ncommittee, Mr. Thompson, for supporting this important legislation.\n  Collaboration is the key to effective security, and it is the \nprerogative of the Committee on Homeland Security to ensure that open \nlines of communication exist between stakeholders, TSA, and DHS.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3144, the Partners for \nAviation Security Act. I introduced H.R. 3144, the Partners for \nAviation Security Act, to ensure that the Transportation Security \nAdministration's key domestic partner for aviation security, the \nAviation Security Advisory Committee, is\n\n[[Page H8171]]\n\npositioned to contribute to aviation security policy.\n  Before beginning, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that our thoughts \nand prayers are with the families of those that were lost on the \nMetrojet flight originating from Egypt recently.\n  The safety and security of the traveling public is vital, and the \nwork of the Transportation Security Subcommittee, of which I am a \nmember, is extremely important, as we address issues and \nvulnerabilities that affect the Nation's aviation sector.\n  As many of you will recall, Mr. Speaker, in 2012, then-TSA \nAdministrator John Pistole unilaterally made changes to the prohibited \nitems list allowed onto passenger planes to include small knives and \nsporting goods equipment. Almost immediately, there was an outcry \nagainst this decision from a broad range of stakeholders. Our committee \nheard from flight attendants, pilots, passenger groups, and others \nabout the security and safety risks associated with this change.\n  Like many Americans, I was pleased that TSA ultimately decided to \nwithdraw its changes to the prohibited items list. However, I believe \nTSA should consult the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, or ASAC, \nbefore implementing new security protocols. Enactment of H.R. 3144 \nwould ensure that such consultation occurs.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3144 also includes language to ensure that there is \ncontinuity in the ASAC's operations even when there are changes to its \nmembership. In general terms, given that most of our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, it is \nimportant that DHS maintain close partnerships with the private sector \nto execute its missions and programs.\n  When it comes to aviation security, such partners are essential \ninsofar as TSA cannot effectively carry outs its mission at our \nNation's airports without buy-in from the air carriers, airport \noperators, labor unions, passenger groups, airport vendors, and \ntechnology companies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge that this bill was approved \nunanimously in committee and thank our cosponsors; the chairman of our \ncommittee's Subcommittee on Transportation Security, Mr. Katko; the \nchairman of the full committee, Mr. McCaul; and the ranking member of \nthe full committee, Mr. Thompson. I am pleased that the committee has \nworked in a bipartisan fashion to advance this timely piece of \nlegislation.\n  Together we send a strong message to TSA and the American flying \npublic about our commitment to ensuring that sensible and effective \nsecurity policies are in place at our Nation's airports. For these \nreasons, I urge Members to support H.R. 3144.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3144.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3144, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8171-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8171-H8174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1073, the Critical \nInfrastructure Protection Act of 2015.\n  The threats to the Nation's critical infrastructure continue to \nevolve. Threats today come in all forms: physical, cyber, and \nelectromagnetic pulse, or EMP, events.\n  H.R. 1073 is a commonsense piece of legislation because it would \nensure that DHS plans and addresses threats to critical infrastructure \nfrom EMP events. Specifically, this bill would require the Department \nof Homeland Security to include EMP events in national planning \nframeworks. It would also ensure DHS conducts outreach and educates \nowners and operators of critical infrastructure, emergency planners, \nand emergency responders about the threat of EMP events. Finally, this \nlegislation requires the Secretary to conduct research and development \nto mitigate the consequences of EMP events.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from Arizona (Mr. Franks) for \nauthoring this important legislation. I urge all Members to join me in \nsupporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1073, the Critical \nInfrastructure Protection Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1073 would require the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to undertake research, planning, and educational activities to \nmitigate the potential consequences of electromagnetic pulses and \ngeomagnetic disturbances on critical infrastructure such as public \nutilities and national security assets. As the Congressional Budget \nOffice noted in its analysis, the Department is currently carrying out \nprograms similar to those required by the bill.\n  Along those lines, I think it is important to identify the elements \nof EMP and GMD preparedness and response activities that are common to \nthe existing preparedness and response efforts as set forth in the \nnational planning frameworks. These national planning efforts identify \nroles and responsibilities for disaster prevention, protection, \nmitigation, response, and recovery activities, and this bill will \ninclude consideration of EMPs.\n  It is also important to distinguish between EMP, or electromagnetic \npulses, and GMD, or geomagnetic disturbances. There are significant \ndifferences in the nature of the threats, the science behind their \nimpacts, and the range of options for potential solutions.\n  EMP weapons are most generally recognized as thermonuclear weapons \nthat may be launched on missiles designed to explode in the upper \natmosphere and produce intense, short-duration, targeted energy that \ncan impact a wide range of technologies and industries. An EMP blast \ncould disrupt and potentially destroy electronic devices in the \naffected area with consequences extending to critical infrastructures \nthat rely on microprocessor-based electronic devices.\n  In contrast, geomagnetic fluctuations, or GMDs, result from solar \nweather activity. Severe GMD events may produce varying effects on the \npower system depending on orientation of the solar storm, latitude, \ntransmission line characteristics, the geology of an affected area, and \nthe design of the power system. The effects of GMD are believed to be \nprimarily limited to reliability of the bulk power system, while the \neffects of an EMP could cross multiple infrastructures and \ntechnologies.\n  Given that any EMP is likely to be the result of an international \nattack or warlike activity on the United States or its neighbors, DHS \nmay need to partner with the Department of Defense. Going forward, I \nurge Members to be mindful of the broad range of preparedness demands \non DHS.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks).\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am sincerely grateful to all of those who have \nsupported the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act. I am especially \ngrateful to Chairman Pete Sessions for his cosponsorship and his \ncommitted partnership on this bill, as well as, of course, to Chairman \nMcCaul and to the leadership team of this House for allowing this \nlegislation to come to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think it is an especially appropriate time for us to \npause and reflect on the tragedies that have occurred in France and to \nstand in solidarity with those people who are part of the free world \nand do the best they can to fight terrorism and to survive its effects. \nMy prayers are with them, and it is ironic that today we are here \ndealing with legislation to try to help mitigate our own \nvulnerabilities to potential attacks that could come in the future.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. Speaker, electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, can be catalyzed by \nnonnuclear intentional electromagnetic interference, a major solar \nstorm, or a high-altitude nuclear blast. EMP is an invisible force of \nionized particles with the potential to overwhelm and destroy our \npresent electrical power grids, which are a vital component of nearly \nevery other critical infrastructure we have.\n  Reducing America's vulnerability to naturally occurring or weaponized \nelectromagnetic pulse is a timely and critical matter of national \nsecurity. During the past several decades, America has spent billions \nof dollars hardening many of our critical defense assets, including our \nnuclear triad and our missile defense components, against natural or \nweaponized electromagnetic pulse.\n  However, the Department of Defense relies upon the largely \nunprotected civilian grid for 99 percent of its electricity needs in \nthe continental United States, without which it cannot affect its \nmission.\n  Twelve years ago, in August of 2003, an electromagnetic pulse knocked \nout a large portion of the electric grid across the eastern United \nStates. Fifty million people were affected after 21 power plants shut \ndown in just 3 minutes. Office workers streamed into parking lots and \nmany commuters were stranded inside their trains.\n  In a matter of moments, the things that make up our critical \ninfrastructure, from the electric grid to water pumps, to cell phone \nservice, to computer systems, were disrupted. Lives suddenly changed \nthat day in New York City, Cleveland, Detroit, and all the way into \nCanada. In New York City alone, this short blackout was estimated to \ncost more than a half billion dollars.\n  There are at least 11 major government reports now that have all come \nessentially to the same conclusion regarding our vulnerabilities to \nelectromagnetic pulse. Some of America's most enlightened national \nsecurity experts, as well as many of our enemies or potential enemies, \nconsider a well-executed weaponized electromagnetic pulse against \nAmerica to be a ``kill shot''--let me say that again--a ``kill shot'' \nto America.\n  However, our civilian grid remains fundamentally unprotected against \nsevere EMP, and for it to remain so is an open invitation to our \nenemies to exploit this dangerous vulnerability.\n  Indeed, the National Intelligence University recently translated an \nIranian military doctrine called ``Passive Defense.'' This doctrine \nstresses that electrical grids are vital to the national existence of \nmajor powers in the\n\n[[Page H8173]]\n\nworld like America. It includes a formula for calculating the value of \nelectrical power plants and for prioritizing the targeting of electric \ngrid components and other critical infrastructures. Mr. Speaker, this \nIranian military doctrine referenced the use of nuclear-generated \nelectromagnetic pulse as an effective weapon more than 20 times.\n  Now that the Islamic Republic of Iran begins to enjoy the bounty of \ntheir nuclear negotiations, it should be a wake-up call to all of us \nthat the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism is contemplating \nthe concept of nuclear-generated electromagnetic pulse as an asymmetric \nweapon against America.\n  Thankfully, Mr. Speaker, we are here this day to pass the Critical \nInfrastructure Protection Act, which, if signed into law, will \nrepresent the first time in history that Congress will be specifically \naddressing this dangerous threat of electromagnetic pulse.\n  This legislation will enhance the DHS threat assessments for EMP \nthrough research and reporting requirements. It will help the United \nStates prevent and prepare for such an event by including large-scale \nblackouts into our critical existing national planning scenarios, \nincluding educational awareness for first responders to protect \ncritical infrastructure. Most importantly, it requires a specific plan \nfor protecting and recovering the electrical grid and other critical \ninfrastructure from a dangerous electromagnetic pulse event.\n  Mr. Speaker, finally, there is a moment in the life of nearly every \nproblem when it is big enough to be seen by reasonable people and still \nsmall enough to be addressed. Those of us in this Chamber and across \nAmerica live in a time when there still may be opportunity for the free \nworld to address and mitigate the vulnerability that naturally \noccurring or weaponized EMP represents to the mechanisms of our \ncivilization. This is our moment.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the remarks by the \ngentleman from Arizona in reference to the solidarity in which we stand \nwith the French people. As it has been stated now and called, this \nterrorist attack is their 9/11. I just wanted to be on the Record to \nacknowledge the comments of the gentleman from Arizona. We stand with \nthe French people in solidarity.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my dear friend from \nGeorgia, for the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1073, the Critical \nInfrastructure Protection Act.\n  Over the past decade, our Nation has seen an unprecedented expansion \nin the use of electronics, Mr. Speaker. These electronics have \ntransformed our economy, our homes, our families, and, really, the way \nwe do business and have become an integral part of our daily lives.\n  Unfortunately, this technology is also susceptible to new types of \npotential threats, threats that have been talked about on this floor by \nnot only Mr. Franks, but also our friend, Mr. Carter, and others.\n  Today electromagnetic pulses, known as EMPs, could dramatically \ndisrupt electronic activity and severely damage our electrical grids \nand everything that stands under those grids. Examples of EMP threats \ninclude those generated from a geomagnetic solar flare, from a \nterrorist short-range missile, cybersecurity attacks, or from a \nphysical assault on a utility or a power plant.\n\n  The Critical Infrastructure Protection Act that we are talking about \ntoday and that we hope to pass is an important first step towards \nprotecting our Nation from potential catastrophic nationwide blackouts.\n  I would like to recognize Frank Gaffney, the president and founder of \nthe Center for Security Policy. Frank has provided the leadership not \nonly by meeting with me, but also working with Mr. Franks and hundreds \nof other Members to let us know not only about this important critical \ninfrastructure policy need, but also to make sure that we educate and \nspread awareness to not only our constituency, but other Members of \nCongress, regarding the new types of potential threats and occurrences, \nsuch as an electromagnetic pulse attack, that could dramatically alter \nour way of life.\n  I would also like to recognize, as I have previously done, our leader \nin Congress on this issue, my dear friend, Arizona Congressman Trent \nFranks. Mr. Franks and I have spoken about this issue for years. We \nhave worked hard with the chairman of Homeland Security, as well as \nleadership in this House, to make sure that we accomplish this \nlegislation now.\n  Ultimately, the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act is simply the \nfirst step towards getting the U.S. closer to protecting ourselves from \na potentially catastrophic nationwide blackout. It is simply the first \nstep, Mr. Speaker. I know this will begin a national dialogue, a \ndialogue that needs to take place and that has already been begun by \nsuch leaders as former Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Vice President \nDick Cheney.\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the House today for taking up this important \nlegislation, ask that my colleagues pay attention to understand this \nbill, and vote for it because support and passage of H.R. 1073, the \nCritical Infrastructure Protection Act, is important to the American \npeople and our way of life.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, I would like to note that H.R. 1073 puts focus on EMP and \nGMD preparedness response in a reasonable manner. It does so in a way \nthat does not come at the detriment of preparing for other more likely \nor more potentially lethal events.\n  I would also reiterate that there are activities already underway at \nDHS to improve preparedness activities for an EMP event. For example, \nit is my understanding that DHS is looking at including EMP as an annex \nto the Federal Interagency Operational Plans currently in development.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1073.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1073.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. \n1073, the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2015.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security as \nwell as the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Investigations, I am well aware of \nthe importance of our nation's critical infrastructure and for this \nreason I support H.R. 1073.\n  The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by adding the \ndefinition of ``EMP'' to mean: (1) an electromagnetic pulse caused by \nintentional means, including acts of terrorism; and (2) a geomagnetic \ndisturbance caused by solar storms or other naturally occurring \nphenomena.\n  Directs DHS to: (1) include in national planning frameworks the \nthreat of EMP events; and (2) conduct outreach to educate owners and \noperators of critical infrastructure, emergency planners, and emergency \nresponse providers of the threat of EMP events.\n  The bill also directs DHS to conduct research and development to \nmitigate the consequences of EMP events, including: an objective \nscientific analysis of the risks to critical infrastructures from a \nrange of EMP events; determination of the critical national security \nassets and vital civic utilities and infrastructures that are at risk \nfrom EMP events; an evaluation of emergency planning and response \ntechnologies that would address the findings and recommendations of \nexperts, including those of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the \nUnited States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack; an analysis of \navailable technology options to improve the resiliency of critical \ninfrastructure to EMP; and the restoration and recovery capabilities of \ncritical infrastructure under differing levels of damage and disruption \nfrom various EMP events.\n  DHS will make recommendations to Congress on a strategy to protect \nand prepare the critical infrastructure of the nation against EMP \nevents, and provide biennial updates on the status of developing a \ndefense against EMP strategy.\n  Electricity and the national electric grid are of vital importance to \nour national and domestic security interest.\n  There were 3 strategic imperatives that dives the Federal approach to \nstrengthen critical infrastructure security and resilience: refine and \nclarify functional relationships across\n\n[[Page H8174]]\n\nthe Federal Government to advance the national unity of effort to \nstrengthen critical infrastructure security and resilience; enable \neffective information exchange by identifying baseline data and systems \nrequirements for the Federal Government; and implement an integration \nand analysis function to inform planning and operations decisions \nregarding critical infrastructure.\n  Effective security for our nation's critical infrastructure requires \na national unity of effort based upon strategic guidance from the \nSecretary of Homeland Security.\n  I introduced H.R. 85, Terrorism Prevention and Critical \nInfrastructure Protection Act, which directs the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to work with critical infrastructure owners and operators and \nstate, local, and territorial to take proactive steps to address All \nHazards that would impact: national security; economic stability; \npublic health and safety; and or any combination of these.\n  The Jackson Lee bill, just as H.R. 1703 is intended to do, would \nreduce vulnerabilities associated with potential terrorist attacks that \ntarget critical infrastructure by supporting a coordinated partnership \namong federal agencies; critical infrastructure owners and operators \nand local, state, and tribal authorities.\n  Last, Friday's terrible attacks in Paris only illustrates the \ninhumanity of those who are America's enemies--the enemies of all of \nthose who cherish freedom.\n  I join my colleagues in the House in offering my deepest sympathies \nto the people of Paris especially to the families of those killed.\n  Our commitment to our national security should and must extend to the \nsecurity needs of our allies in the struggle against violence and \nterrorism--France.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1703.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1073, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8174-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8174-H8175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DIGNIFIED INTERMENT OF OUR VETERANS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks or to add any extraneous material they may have on H.R. 1338, \nas amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do urge all Members to support H.R. 1338, the \nDignified Interment of Our Veterans Act of 2015.\n  This very important bill, which was introduced by my good friend, Mr. \nShuster of Pennsylvania, would help ensure that deceased veterans are \ntreated with respect and with dignity.\n  H.R. 1338, as amended, would require that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs conduct a study on the serious problem of unclaimed remains of \ndeceased veterans. VA will provide a dignified burial in national \ncemeteries for those who die with no family to claim their remains or \nwho did not have enough money to cover burial expenses.\n  Unfortunately, the remains of deceased veterans may end up on the \nshelf at a funeral home or the shelf of a coroner's office, and VA may \nnot be aware that the veteran's remains were not interred.\n  In 2013, Congress passed legislation in an attempt to ensure that all \ndeceased veterans are treated with the honor that they had earned. The \nDignified Burial and Other Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2012 \ndirected VA to work with Veterans Service Organizations and assist \nStates, cities, and funeral directors to identify the unclaimed remains \nof veterans and to arrange for their burials in one of our national \ncemeteries.\n  Unfortunately, the law has not resolved this issue and too many \nveterans may not be receiving a dignified burial. That is \nunconscionable. The men and women who have served our Nation in uniform \nhave the right to expect that our Nation will make every effort to \ntreat them with honor and deference even after they pass away.\n  This study would determine the scope of the problem and identify any \nobstacles associated with claiming or interring veteran remains.\n  Additionally, VA would also be required to make recommendations on \nhow we can better ensure that our Nation's heroes are properly laid to \nrest.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of my friend Mr. Shuster's Dignified Interment of \nOur Veterans Act. This legislation will require the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to conduct a study on the unclaimed remains of \nveterans.\n  Our Nation continues to be challenged by local and privately owned \ncemeteries that fail to identify and provide the VA with uninterred \nveterans' remains. It is our intent that the VA look into this issue \nand come up with some solutions to assist privately and locally owned \ncemetery homes with the information and the support they need to \ntransfer those remains to the VA's National Cemetery Administration.\n  Our Nation's veterans have earned a proper and honorable burial for \ntheir\n\n[[Page H8175]]\n\nservice. This legislation will help the VA to help our veterans. I urge \nall of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Everett, Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the original \nsponsor of this particular piece of legislation.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. I thank the chairman for working with me on this piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on the issue plaguing our \nNation's veterans. Specifically, there are an estimated 47,000 cremated \nveterans' remains that are waiting to be interred because it was not \npossible to identify the next of kin.\n  Existing legislation directs the Veterans Health Administration, \nVeterans Service Organizations, and funeral directors to work together \nin the claiming and interring of deceased veterans. Unfortunately, \nnumerous barriers prevent the effective collaboration among these \nstakeholders. As it stands today, these barriers are not fully \nunderstood, which is preventing an effective solution to the problem \nfrom being found.\n  For instance, the Missing in America Project, a nonprofit service \norganization that was established to locate and bury unclaimed \nveterans' remains, identified 100 veterans who were awaiting burial \nwithin the State of Pennsylvania over the last couple of years. Some of \nthose veterans waited more than 20 years for a dignified, military \nburial. We can speculate regarding the reason for this disgrace, but we \ncannot know for sure without giving this issue the attention it \ndeserves.\n  That is why I have introduced H.R. 1338, the Dignified Interment of \nOur Veterans Act of 2015. My bill requires the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to conduct a study on matters relating to the claiming and \ninterring of unclaimed veterans' remains. The intent of the study is to \nconfirm the scope of this problem, to uncover any barriers associated \nwith claiming and interring veterans' remains, and to solicit \nrecommendations from the Department of Veterans Affairs on potential \nsolutions.\n  I would like to thank two of my constituents, Mr. Ron Metros and Mr. \nLanny Golden, for working with me on this legislation.\n  When asked why he is so passionate about this issue, Mr. Golden, a \nVietnam veteran, simply replied that his brothers in arms deserve to be \nburied alongside those who have walked the same path.\n  I fully agree with Mr. Golden, and I would like to say ``thank you'' \nto all of those who have served this great Nation.\n  I would also like to take this time to thank my colleagues Chairman \nMiller and Ranking Member Brown for working with me. Of course, I thank \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee and the 98 bipartisan cosponsors of the \nHouse for their support.\n  Also a special thanks to two people without whom I could not have \ndone this. They are my military fellows. One is U.S. Marine Corps \nSergeant Anna Lloyd. She helped start the process. We then finished up \nwith Air Force Major Cheri Guikema. Both of them provided an invaluable \nservice in putting this bill forward, and I can't thank them enough for \ntheir help and also for their continued service to the United States \nmilitary.\n  Now, more than ever, we need to stand together and show or veterans \nwe care. None of our heroes should be forgotten, and this is a step \nforward in reaching that important goal.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for \ntime. I urge my colleagues to support the passing of H.R. 1338, as \namended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the Chair will note that \nthe time previously controlled by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nMiller) will now be controlled by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nCostello).\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce).\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this \nlegislation, the Dignified Interment of Our Veterans Act of 2015.\n  In May of last year, reports emerged that the bodies of 52 veterans \nhad remained unburied for over a year at the Los Angeles County \nMortuary, located just outside of my district. Similar instances were \ndiscovered in 13 other States, demonstrating just how widespread this \nis. Stories of unburied veterans' bodies are deeply unsettling and the \nresult of gaps in burial procedure policies at the VA. It has to be \naddressed. Our service men and women have made immense personal \nsacrifices on behalf of our Nation, and it is unacceptable for their \nremains to be treated with such a blatant lack of respect and dignity.\n  Like the gentleman from Pennsylvania and many of my colleagues in the \nHouse and Senate, I introduced legislation in an effort to solve this \nissue. The Dignified Interment of Our Veterans Act directs the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to study the burial of veterans' \nunclaimed remains in national cemeteries and to report the findings of \nsuch studies to Congress. This legislation is an important step toward \nacknowledging and, ultimately, solving the problem.\n  Last week, the Senate passed by unanimous consent the 21st Century \nVeterans Benefits Delivery Act, which incorporated the House \nlegislation, and I am happy to see that the companion legislation is \nnow being voted on in the House of Representatives, bringing it one \nstep closer to the President's signature.\n  We made a commitment to take care of our veterans in both life and \ndeath, and it is crucial that we follow through on it. I encourage my \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives to vote in support of the \nDignified Interment of Our Veterans Act.\n  I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his work on this issue \nand the gentleman from Florida for his continued efforts as the House \nVeterans' Affairs Committee chairman.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to \nsupport H.R. 1338, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1338, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas \nand nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and to add extraneous material on H.R. 1384.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  I urge all Members to support H.R. 1384, the Honor America's Guard-\nReserve Retirees Act, which was introduced by the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Walz).\n  The National Guard and Reserve are vital to our Nation's defense. \nThese brave men and women enlist while knowing they can be deployed \nwith little notice, just like America's Active Duty servicemembers.\n  Despite the invaluable contributions of National Guard and Reserve \npersonnel to our national security, Members may be surprised to learn \nthat many of the men and women who served in the National Guard or \nReserve for 20 years may not legally be considered ``veterans'' if they \nwere never called up for Active Duty. This is not fair to these brave \nmen and women who have demonstrated their patriotism through their \nwillingness to wear the uniform and defend our Nation whenever and \nwherever they are needed.\n  H.R. 1384 would not provide any monetary benefit. It would simply \nhonor the service and sacrifice of retired National Guard and Reserve \npersonnel by giving them the prestigious title of ``veteran''--in my \nopinion, the most prestigious title that Congress can bestow.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I stand before this body to support legislation introduced by my \nfriend and colleague from Minnesota, Tim Walz. As a retired guardsman \nhimself and as the highest ranking enlisted soldier to serve in \nCongress, I know this bill is near and dear to his heart.\n  The Honor America's Guard-Reserve Retirees Act closes a long-existing \ngap. Federal law has neglected to acknowledge our guardsmen and -women \nand reservists who have served fewer than 180 days of Active Duty \nservice as ``veterans.'' This law would remedy this longstanding \noversight by legally recognizing Guard and Reserve retirees as American \nveterans.\n  Our military is more dependent on Reserve components than they have \nbeen since the dawn of modern warfare. These are men and women who have \nstood ready and trained to serve our Nation at war. They have served a \ndedicated 20 years of service. At the very least, we should acknowledge \nthe dedication of these servicemembers by legally recognizing them as \nAmerican veterans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz).\n  Mr. WALZ. I thank the subcommittee chairman and the ranking member \nfor the time. More importantly, I thank both of them and their \nrespective staffs for the bipartisan and continuously exceptional \neffort to serve our veterans. I thank them for the opportunity to move \nthis forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill has passed the House multiple times over the \nlast 8 years. It is very simple. It is less than 150 words, and it is \nvery rare in that it costs nothing, but I would argue that it is very \nimportant. The men and women of the Reserve component, as you so \neloquently heard by my colleagues who spoke prior, take the exact same \noath of office and are held to the exact same standards as the Active \ncomponent. They sacrifice their time and energy. They stand at the \nready if called upon, whether it is assisting flood victims in \nMinnesota, fighting wildfires across the Western United States, or \nfighting overseas in the protection of our freedoms.\n  For those who have completed 20 years or more in the Guard or Reserve \nbut who have not served a qualifying period of Title X Active Duty, we \nhonor their service with health care benefits and monetary benefits, \nwith one notable exception--they must call themselves ``military \nretirees'' and not ``veterans.'' As the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nnoted, I think most Americans, when I talk to them, are unaware of \nthis. Once they find out, they are appalled that we don't do it. This \nbill closes the loophole.\n  There are about 280,000 Americans who fall into this category. They \nhave devoted their lives to our Nation--they have served honorably for \n20 or 20-plus years--and this bill will recognize their service. It \nmight be as simple as buying a hat that reads ``Army veteran'' or \ngetting a license place for your car. It bestows no monetary benefits \nto these brave men and women, merely the title. Again, my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania, I think, said it right in that it is a pretty \nimportant title--a veteran of the United States military.\n  It also does something else very important. In doing so, we recognize \nthe integral role our National Guard and Reserve play in our Nation's \ndefense. There is nothing quite so unifying or quintessentially \nAmerican as the citizen soldier. Dating back to the founding of our \nNation or serving overseas at a time of fighting terrorism, it is the \nmother who leaves her family and her law firm to serve her Nation, and \nit is the father who leaves his teaching job and his family to serve \nhis Nation.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  It is about recognizing that our All Volunteer Force would be \nunsustainable if it were not for the men and women who dedicated 20 \nyears of their lives. And one of the most important things they did, \nmost of those are cold war warriors who were responsible for the \ntraining of the current force that protects us.\n  So I thank the gentleman and the ranking member again for their \ncommitment to our veterans.\n  I ask my colleagues--we are on the heels of Veterans Day here--to add \nthese 280,000. Let's do what is right. Let's call them veterans and \nhonor their service.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today extends and expands the \nMedicaid emergency psychiatric demonstration project.\n  A longstanding policy under Medicaid, called the institutions for \nmental diseases, IMD, exclusion, prohibits the Federal Government from \nproviding Federal Medicaid matching funds to States for services \nrendered to Medicaid-eligible individuals aged 21 to 64 who are \npatients in IMDs. IMDs are inpatient facilities with more than 16 beds \nthat primarily treat people with mental health and substance abuse \ndisorders. The original IMD exclusion is consistent with the goal of \ntreating severe mental illness in the least restrictive setting \nfeasible.\n  The IMD exclusion provided an incentive to shift the cost of care for \nmental illness to other care modalities and facilities where Medicaid \nmatching funds were available. However, since the IMD exclusion was \nincluded with the creation of the Medicaid program in 1965, our mental \nhealthcare system and overall healthcare system have evolved notably.\n  In recent years, we have seen a significant decrease in the number of \npublicly funded inpatient psychiatric beds available for emergency \nservices. This has contributed to patients in need of critical mental \nhealth services facing psychiatric boarding in general hospital \nemergency departments.\n  Psychiatric boarding occurs when an individual with a mental health \ncondition is kept in a hospital emergency department for several hours \nor admitted to medical wards or skilled nursing facilities without \npsychiatric expertise because appropriate mental health services were \nunavailable. This leads to potential serious consequences for \npsychiatric patients and unnecessary hospital costs.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act authorized a 3-year \ndemonstration program to study the effects of allowing Federal Medicaid \nmatching funds to pay for emergency psychiatric treatment for adults \nthat is otherwise prohibited by the Medicaid IMD exclusion. The \ndemonstration was funded with $75 million in FY 2011, and these funds \nwere available for obligation through December 31, 2015.\n  The HHS Secretary selected 11 States and the District of Columbia to \nparticipate in the demonstration program in March of 2012, and the \ndemonstration program began July 1, 2012. Due to significant State \ninterest, patient need, and other factors, the demonstration project \nexhausted its Federal funding in April and was forced to terminate \nearly.\n  S. 599 would temporarily extend the Medicaid emergency psychiatric \ndemonstration for States already participating in the demonstration \nthrough September 30, 2016, if the chief actuary of CMS certifies that \nthis extension would not increase net Medicaid spending.\n  The bill also requires that, not later than September 30, 2016, the \nHHS Secretary report to Congress on whether the demonstration should be \ncontinued after such date and whether the demonstration should be \nexpanded to additional States. If the chief actuary of CMS certifies \nthat this extension would not increase net Medicaid spending, then the \ndemonstration may continue not beyond 2019.\n  While I have strong concerns with the President's healthcare law, S. \n599 would let States and CMS continue to test the provision of critical \nmental health services for patients in a manner that is responsible for \nthe Federal budget.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense, \nbipartisan bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 599, the Improving Access to \nEmergency Psychiatric Care Act.\n  This legislation, sponsored by Senator Ben Cardin and championed in \nthe House by Representative John Sarbanes, will extend and expand the \nMedicaid emergency psychiatric demonstration protect. Since the \ncreation of Medicaid 50 years ago, the program has excluded payment for \ninstitutions for mental diseases, IMDs, a designation that includes \nmost residential treatment facilities for mental health and substance \nuse disorders with more than 16 beds.\n  The original IMD exclusion is consistent with the goal of treating \nsevere mental illness in the least restrictive setting possible. \nHowever, there have been some unintended consequences of this \nlongstanding policy. States have an incentive to shift the cost of \ntreating mental illness to other care settings where Medicaid matching \nfunds are available. This contributed to a decrease in the number of \npublicly funded beds available for inpatient psychiatric emergency \nservices. It also contributed to a rise in psychiatric boarding and \nrecidivism in hospital emergency departments.\n  To develop data on whether modifying an IMD exclusion can improve \nhealth care for mental illness, the Affordable Care Act authorized $75 \nmillion over 3 years for the Medicare emergency psychiatric \ndemonstration project. Administered by the CMS Innovation Center, the \ninitiative aims to test whether the Medicaid program could provide \nhigher quality care at a lower total cost by reimbursing private \npsychiatric hospitals for emergency care otherwise prohibited by the \nMedicaid IMD exclusion. The demonstration project is currently \noperating in 11 States and the District of Columbia.\n  This legislation extends the demonstration in a budget-neutral manner \nso that the Secretary of Health and Human Services can complete an \nevaluation and make an informed recommendation regarding its \ncontinuation and expansion.\n  Medicaid plays a central and critical role in covering treatment for \nindividuals with mental illness. S. 599 holds promise for improving \naccess to quality psychiatric care for this underserved and vulnerable \npopulation and the overall success of our mental healthcare system.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 599, and I thank the sponsors for \ntheir commitment to this important issue.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Brooks), a prime sponsor of the House companion bill and \na member of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support \nof S. 599, the Improving Access to Emergency Psychiatric Care Act. The \nbill is the companion to H.R. 3681, which I proudly introduced with my \ncolleague, Congressman Sarbanes from Maryland.\n  With the passage of this bill today, I am pleased that this \nmeaningful mental health reform will head to the President's desk. \nFortunately, this bipartisan, bicameral, and commonsense legislation is \na great step toward enacting meaningful reforms to an incredibly \nchallenging system.\n  Currently, CMS does not reimburse private psychiatric institutions or \ninstitutions for mental diseases for the services provided to Medicaid \nenrollees aged 21 to 64. Yet often serious mental illness manifests \nitself in those in their twenties, and they are not allowed to go with \na severe psychiatric break to a psychiatric hospital.\n  Instead, they go and present at our ERs; and our ERs are already \noverburdened. Many of them often lack the resources and sometimes the \nexpertise to deal with people who are suffering from a true mental \ncrisis. When they find themselves in the ERs, it is not uncommon for \nthem to have to sit for hours and for far too long while they are \nsuffering.\n  This commonsense legislation extends the existing demonstration grant \nthat lifts the IMD exclusion and will allow these important psychiatric \nclinics to receive Medicaid reimbursement\n\n[[Page H8179]]\n\nwhile giving people access to short-term direct care in psychiatric \nhospitals when they need it most.\n  I am proud to support the extension of this legislation that allows \npeople to get the treatment that they need. As a lawyer, I have dealt \nwith people who have been in a psychiatric crisis. Many of us have \nfamily members who have dealt with a psychiatric crisis. They need the \nhelp from the right experts at the right time.\n  I thank the gentleman for carrying this in the House, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes). He is also a \nmember of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a member of our Health \nSubcommittee. I personally appreciate his commitment to mental health.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for \nhis leadership on the Health Subcommittee and on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  I rise today in strong support of the Improving Access to Emergency \nPsychiatric Care Act. I thank Representative Brooks of Indiana for her \nsupport of this measure and certainly welcome the fact that this is a \nbipartisan piece of legislation.\n  What this bill would do is it would extend a demonstration project, \nas indicated, that ends the Federal prohibition on Medicaid matching \npayments to community psychiatric hospitals for emergency psychiatric \ncases. This demonstration project allows individuals with severe mental \nillness who are a threat to themselves or to others, including those \nwith substance abuse disorders who have experienced overdoses, to get \nemergency inpatient treatment.\n  The background of this is as follows:\n  There has been a longstanding Medicaid provision, dating back to \n1965, called the institutions for mental diseases, IMD, exclusion. \nUnder that, the Federal Government is prohibited from providing \nMedicaid matching funds and reimbursement for the care of eligible \nindividuals aged 21 to 64 if that care is provided in an inpatient \nfacility that primarily treats people with mental health and substance \nabuse disorders and if that facility has more than 16 beds.\n  As was indicated, the effect of this exclusion has been to decrease \nthe number of inpatient psychiatric beds that are available for \nemergency services. It has also been cited by the Government \nAccountability Office as a factor in emergency department overcrowding, \nwhich Congresswoman Brooks just indicated.\n  Community-based psychiatric hospitals could help relieve these \nbackups and provide much-needed emergency psychiatric care, but these \nhospitals cannot receive Federal matching payments for these services.\n  In 2010, Congress authorized a 3-year pilot called the Medicaid \nemergency psychiatric demonstration project, which expanded the number \nof emergency inpatient psychiatric beds available in communities by \nallowing Federal Medicaid matching payments to freestanding psychiatric \nhospitals for emergency psychiatric cases.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Eleven States, including my home State of Maryland, are participating \nin this demonstration, and the preliminary data is very promising. Of \nthe total number of Medicaid beneficiaries admitted to these community-\nbased psychiatric hospitals, fully 84 percent had just one admission \nduring the entire first year of the demonstration. The average length \nof stay was only 8.2 days, and in 88 percent of the admissions, the \nbeneficiaries were discharged to their homes or to self-care.\n  The demonstration project is set to end on December 31, 2015, but the \nfinal evaluation of the project is not expected to be completed until a \nyear later.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, this bill would build upon the success of \nthe current demonstration project, which is providing timely and cost-\neffective care. It would also extend the current demonstration project \nby 1 year.\n  It would ensure budget neutrality by certifying that the extension is \nnot projected to result in an increase in net Medicaid program \nspending, and it would allow the Secretary of HHS to extend the \ndemonstration project for an additional 3 years, provided that the \nrequirements regarding Medicaid spending are met.\n  The bill has already been passed in the Senate by unanimous consent. \nWhile I am a little bit disappointed that a very small change was made \nthat is going to require it to go back to the Senate for \nreconsideration, I am confident that it will be supported there again \nwith Senator Cardin's leadership.\n  I urge support of this bipartisan effort to extend a demonstration \nproject that allows individuals with severe mental illness and \nsubstance abuse disorders to get emergency inpatient treatment at \ncommunity psychiatric hospitals.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time \nto the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), who is also a member \nof the Committee on Energy and Commerce, a member of the Subcommittee \non Health, and, again, a champion of mental health.\n  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Improving \nAccess to Emergency Psychiatric Care Act.\n  As we work to reform our broken mental healthcare system, it is \ncritical that we build upon programs that provide resources to \nunderserved and vulnerable populations at all points along the spectrum \nof care.\n  Today, with the passage of this bill, we have the opportunity to \nextend the vital Medicaid emergency psychiatric demonstration project. \nThis demonstration project, which recently expired, ensures greater \naccess to essential emergency psychiatric care for Medicaid patients.\n  This bipartisan bill will ensure that hospitals across our Nation \nwill be able to provide community members in need with inpatient \npsychiatric beds.\n  In my home district in Sacramento County, this demonstration project \nhas provided great benefits to our system of care. Medi-Cal \nbeneficiaries have greater access to mental health services, and there \nhas been a reduction in readmission rates at local hospitals.\n  In fact, by the final year of the 3-year demonstration project, the \nnumber of individuals rehospitalized within 30 days of their initial \nstay decreased by 20 percent in Sacramento County.\n  The project has improved coordination of care for mental health \npatients by streamlining planning efforts between inpatient and \noutpatient providers. In addition, Sacramento County has been able to \nreinvest savings generated by the project into programs that build \ngreater community alternatives for patients identified as high \nutilizers of inpatient and emergency departments.\n  All of these improvements add up to a community mental health system \nin California that is better able to focus on the whole spectrum of \ncare for underserved patients, from prevention to treatment to the \ncrisis stage.\n  There is still much more work to do to improve the mental health \nsystem, but we must not reverse our significant progress by failing to \nrenew this demonstration project.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on S. 599, the Improving Access \nto Emergency Psychiatric Care Act.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this \ncommonsense, bipartisan bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of extending and \nexpanding the Improving Access to Emergency Psychiatric Care Act, which \nhas already passed the Senate and for which identical legislation, H.R. \n3681 has been introduced in the House with bipartisan support.\n  This legislation would extend, and expand if appropriate, the \nMedicaid Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration that was created by the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  While I will not oppose this legislation based on process, I must \nmention that I am not pleased that this legislation did not go through \nregular order here in the House as it should have, and as it did in the \nSenate. I also do not support a change made to require the $100,000 in \nadministrative costs in the bill to come out of unobligated funds at \nCMS. To delay this legislation, slow it down even further and force the \nSenate to reconsider the bill for a one word change and an amount of \nmoney\n\n[[Page H8180]]\n\nthat is less than the annual salary of any Member of Congress is a \nwaste of time. However, despite these reservations, I support this \nlegislation moving forward.\n  Since the enactment of Medicaid in 1965, so-called ``Institutions of \nMental Disease'', or IMDs, have been prohibited by statute from \nreceiving federal Medicaid matching funds for inpatient treatment \nprovided to adults ages 21 to 64. This prohibition was rooted in the \ndesirability of community-based care as an alternative to mass \ninstitutionalization of the mentally ill, often in horrific conditions.\n  However, as our healthcare system has grown and changed, there has \nbeen increasing concern about the perverse incentives created by the \nwholesale exclusion of IMDs from treatment for Medicaid beneficiaries; \nfor instance, frequent boarding of psychiatric patients in emergency \nrooms and non-psychiatric beds of general hospitals has been reported \nto occur when specialized inpatient psychiatric beds are not available.\n  The days of mass institutionalization are over and we can never go \nback to those days--at the same time, so-called ``boarding'' of the \nseriously mentally ill in general hospitals, because the beds simply \naren't available, is not an acceptable alternative.\n  Those Medicaid beneficiaries that are seriously mentally ill need the \nright treatment, at the right time. The demonstration project that we \nare extending here today allows states to test incorporation of IMD \nservices for Medicaid beneficiaries in a way that insures other \ncommunity-based services do not suffer. This legislation, which also \naligns with CMS's recent proposal to allow for short-term IMD stays in \nMedicaid managed care plans, is the appropriate way to responsibly \naddress the Medicaid IMD exclusion.\n  We've had immense success with this project thus far, and we can \nstill learn more from it, which is exactly why this demonstration \nproject must be extended and as appropriate, expanded. This legislation \nwill allow the Secretary to do just that, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its swift passage.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 599, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8180-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8180-H8182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PROTECTING OUR INFANTS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. PITTS.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today begins to combat the rise of \nprenatal opioid abuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n  Over the past several years, opioid addiction has risen dramatically \nin the United States, reaching epidemic proportions. The death rate for \nheroin overdose doubled in just 2 years from 2010 to 2012.\n\n[[Page H8181]]\n\n  One of the issues resulting from this epidemic is neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome, known as NAS. Babies born with NAS are infants that are \naddicted to opioids and that suffer medical issues associated with drug \nwithdrawal. Symptoms can last for weeks, keeping otherwise healthy \ninfants confined to the hospital at the start of their lives.\n  NAS can result from the use of prescription drugs or from the use of \nillegal opioids. Sadly, over the past 15 years, the incidence of NAS \nhas tripled in the United States. This is a rapidly growing problem \nthat needs to be addressed for the safety of our mothers and children.\n  S. 799, Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015, introduced in the Senate \nby Majority Leader McConnell and led in the House by my colleagues, Ms. \nClark of Massachusetts and Mr. Stivers, would address the increasing \nproblem of prenatal opioid abuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n  Preventing opioid abuse among pregnant women and women of \nchildbearing age is crucial in addressing NAS. The Government \nAccountability Office has identified that more research is needed in \nthis area to help treat babies born with NAS and mothers addicted to \nopioids.\n  This legislation would help fill this research gap by directing the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ, to conduct a study \nand develop recommendations for preventing and treating prenatal opioid \nabuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House companion to S. 799 was approved by a voice \nvote in the Subcommittee on Health and the full Committee on Energy and \nCommerce. Today we have a chance to approve this important bipartisan \nand bicameral legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 799, Protecting Our Infants Act \nof 2015. This legislation, sponsored by Senator Mitch McConnell and \nchampioned in the House by Representative Katherine Clark, would help \ncombat prenatal opioid abuse epidemic.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, has found drug \noverdose to be the leading cause of injury death in the United States \nand declared prescription drug abuse to be an epidemic.\n  Prescription opioid use in pregnancy is strongly associated with \nneonatal complications. According to a recent study in the New England \nJournal of Medicine, the incidence rate of neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome, NAS, quadrupled from 2004 to 2013, a fourfold increase in \nless than a decade.\n  NAS is a group of problems that occur in newborns who have been \nexposed to opioids while in the womb. The symptoms are often severe. \nNewborns with NAS require specialized care, typically in a neonatal \nintensive care unit.\n  In February 2015, the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, \nreleased a report entitled ``Prenatal Drug Use and Newborn Health: \nFederal Efforts Need Better Planning and Coordination.'' The report \nidentified a number of different research gaps in the treatment of \nopioid use during pregnancy and in the treatment of infants with NAS.\n  S. 799 will help combat prenatal opioid abuse and neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome. Addressing these issues is a critical part of our effort to \nfight the ongoing prescription drug abuse epidemic.\n  The legislation will facilitate the development and recommendations \nfor the treatment of prenatal opioid abuse and NAS and coordinate a \nnational strategy to close research program gaps. It will also require \nCDC to help States improve data collection and surveillance activities \nrelated to prenatal opioid abuse and NAS.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 799, the Protecting Our Infants \nAct, and I thank the sponsors for their commitment to this important \nissue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins), a leader on this issue.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, every day in hospitals \nacross my district and the country, tragically, babies begin their \nlives suffering through drug withdrawal because they were exposed \nduring pregnancy.\n  Sadly, the rates of babies with NAS have skyrocketed. NAS is a \nnationwide crisis. The Protecting Our Infants Act addresses the many \ngaps in the care and treatment of NAS babies.\n  How do I know there are gaps? Today, in a facility in my hometown \nthat I helped start, Lily's Place is caring for 10--10--babies \nsuffering the ravages of withdrawal.\n  It took years of working through the regulatory burdens and \ncertification limitations just to do what is right for our most \ninnocent. The gaps in care are real and so are the obstacles treating \nNAS babies.\n  This legislation will pave the way to consider new models of care, \nlike Lily's Place, for our NAS babies.\n  I commend my colleagues, Leader Mitch McConnell and Representatives \nKatherine Clark and Steve Stivers, for helping to give every child a \nchance at a healthy start in life.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the House Democratic \nsponsor.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, today 58 babies, 1 baby \nevery 25 minutes, will be born suffering from the same pain adults \ndescribe as the worst pain of their lives, the pain of drug withdrawal.\n  Over the last decade, the number of infants born experiencing \nwithdrawal from powerful drugs has grown nearly fivefold. It is a \ncondition called neonatal abstinence syndrome. It results from prenatal \nexposure to opioids like heroin and prescription painkillers. In States \nlike Massachusetts, we are seeing this happen at a rate three times the \nnational average.\n  In addition to the human suffering, the costs associated with NAS \nbirths are staggering. They are five times more expensive than healthy \nbirths, totaling $1.5 billion for hospitals in 2012, with 80 percent \nbeing paid by Medicaid.\n  But despite the best efforts of doctors, nurses, and others, there is \nno coordinated response to this crisis. There are no clear best \npractices for treating these infants, and more research is needed to \nhelp understand the problem. That is why I have worked with my \ncolleagues, researchers, doctors, and advocates to introduce the \nProtecting Our Infants Act, the first Federal bill to take proactive \nsteps in addressing the rise of NAS births.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  We were able to pass this bill in the House in September, thanks to \nthe help of my partner on this bill, Representative Steve Stivers. A \nslightly modified version was passed a few weeks ago, due to the hard \nwork of our Senate sponsors, Majority Leader McConnell and Senator \nCasey. With broad support in both Chambers, this is an opportunity for \nCongress to make a difference for moms and babies suffering because of \nthe opioid epidemic.\n  The Protecting Our Infants Act will require the Department of Health \nand Human Services to develop recommendations to prevent and treat \nprenatal opioid abuse and NAS, and to develop a strategy in the \nDepartment to coordinate programs and research. This will help ease the \nsuffering of the smallest victims of the opioid crisis. It will help \nhospitals and Medicaid save money, and ease the burden on doctors and \nnurses that are overwhelmed by this problem.\n  This is not controversial, partisan, or political. It is just good \npolicy. I thank my Republican partner in the House, Steve Stivers, for \nhis leadership in getting this bill to where it is today.\n  I ask the House to come together and help the thousands of babies and \nmothers who are fighting this epidemic, and I urge my colleagues to \npass the bipartisan Protecting Our Infants Act and send this \nlegislation to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important \nbipartisan, bicameral legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 799--the Protecting \nOur Infants Act of 2015. This legislation addresses a sad reality of \nour country's opioid epidemic: prenatal\n\n[[Page H8182]]\n\nopioid abuse and the steep increase in the incidence of neonatal \nabstinence syndrome or NAS.\n  NAS occurs in newborns who were exposed to opiates while in their \nmother's womb and is associated with negative health outcomes such as \npreterm births, low birthweight, and respiratory distress. A recent \nstudy found the incidence of NAS quadrupled between 2004 and 2013. This \nlegislation would respond to that dramatic increase by requiring HHS to \ncreate a comprehensive national strategy to address prenatal opioid \nabuse and NAS. That strategy would include a coordinated research and \nprogramming strategy to address the public health challenge of NAS and \nprenatal opioid abuse as well as develop a comprehensive set of \nrecommendations for preventing and treating prenatal opioid use \ndisorders and NAS.\n  I want to thank Rep. Katherine Clark for her leadership on this \ncritical and timely issue. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 799.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8182-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8182-H8185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION PROCESS REFORM ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. WALDEN.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today marks the third time in 4 years that a variation of the FCC \nProcess Reform Act has come to the floor for a vote. This is a sign of \nhow seriously in need of reform the FCC's procedures are and how \nseriously I, and the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, \ntake the responsibility of helping put these reforms in place.\n  This bill is the product of a multiyear, bipartisan legislative \nprocess, bringing us to a place where we can at least begin to create a \nframework for more transparent and predictable rulemakings at the \nFederal Communications Commission.\n  There are few other industries that have shown such high levels of \ninnovation and investment as the communications and technology sector. \nThink of the developments in smartphones alone over the past few years, \nMr. Speaker. The only way to guarantee that this continues is to make \nsure that the agency that regulates the industry is accountable and \ntransparent so that the regulatory tangles do not impede the steady \nmarch of new and exciting innovations and offerings.\n  The Subcommittee on Communications and Technology has spent a great \ndeal of time on agency reform. In fact, tomorrow we will have the \nentire FCC before our committee once again. We have come to a consensus \non how we can best improve the processes at the Federal Communications \nCommission without tying the agency's hands unnecessarily. It has been \na focus of our work.\n  Our bipartisan compromise requires that the FCC undertake a \nrulemaking to adopt minimum time periods for comments and to adopt \nrules that prevent the introduction of large amounts of data--we call \nthose data dumps, where enormous amounts of information come in at the \nlast minute and nobody has a chance to understand what is in it or \ncomment effectively on it, sometimes even catching commissioners by \nsurprise--at the very end of a comment period.\n  The new Commission rules must put into place specific deadlines and \ntimeframes for agency decisions or action on different types of filings \nbefore the agency. I know all too well what those deadlines and delays \ncan be. My wife and I were broadcasters for more than two decades. We \nactually had applications sit at the FCC for nearly 10 years without \nany action. Finally, they were acted upon, and we were given 30 days to \nimplement them. This isn't acceptable. There must be predictability and \ncertainty for those who rely on the FCC to make decisions central to \ntheir businesses.\n  In addition to the rulemaking, the FCC must also conduct an inquiry \ninto more complex issues, giving them flexibility in deciding whether \nand how to implement the reforms. We aren't looking to, again, \nhamstring this agency. We simply are providing them with goals and \nallowing them to determine the best way to achieve them. That is our \njob as the oversight committee over an agency.\n  Process reform is not about the actions of one party and it is not \nabout the actions of one chairman. This is about putting rules into \nplace that will carry over from one administration to the next, one \nparty to the next, one chairman to the next, creating consistency and \ncertainty for the many that are subject to the Commission's rules. I \nbelieve there must be some kind of accountability for our independent \nagencies and the decisions that they make. After all, it is the \npublic's business that they are conducting.\n  While there is still much work needed to be done on reforming the \nprocedures at this sometimes broken agency, this bill represents a \nvital first step in that process. The communications industry and, more \nimportantly, the American people, deserve a transparent and accountable \nFederal agency, no matter who is in charge.\n  For the second consecutive Congress, I am proud to bring this \nbipartisan work to the House floor. I thank my Democratic colleague, \nRanking Member Pallone, who I know will speak on this bill; Ranking \nMember Eshoo, who has been a terrific partner as we have worked on \nthis; Representatives Matsui, Clarke, and Loebsack for their \ncontributions to this bill; and staff on both sides of the aisle, David \nRedl, Grace Koh, Kelsey Guyselman, Gene Fullano, David Goldman, Lori \nMaarbjerg, and David Grossman, for their hard work. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2583, the Federal \nCommunications Commission Process Reform Act of 2015.\n  The FCC has a role in regulating industries that make up one-sixth of \nour economy and whose services have been essential to consumers, and it \nis important that the FCC functions in a fast, efficient, and \ntransparent way.\n  The FCC Chairman has made process reform a priority of his tenure, \nand he has made great strides in improving how the FCC functions. But \nit is the role of Congress to make adjustments like we are doing today. \nI believe that the final text of the bill we are considering today will \nachieve that goal, and I urge all Members to support it.\n  Not all of the issues in the FCC Process Reform Act are new. In fact, \nthe base of the bill being considered here today is very similar to the \nbill that passed the House under suspension by voice vote last \nCongress. It requires the FCC to adopt procedural rule changes to \nmaximize public participation and to look into other potential process \nchanges, including whether to establish deadlines for application \nprocessing. It also includes the provisions of the FCC Collaboration \nAct, an issue championed by Representative Eshoo, which will allow \ncommissioners to freely discuss FCC issues with sufficient safeguards \nto protect against abuse.\n\n[[Page H8185]]\n\n  Democrats offered additional suggestions earlier this year when the \nSubcommittee on Communications and Technology considered this and other \nbills aimed at FCC process reform. The ideas of subcommittee members \nClarke, Loebsack, and Matsui furthered our goal to help make the FCC \nfast, efficient, and transparent.\n  The simple suggestions were to, one, require the FCC to provide \nquarterly reports on pending items with the agency to ensure \naccountability and timely responses; two, require, the FCC to \ncoordinate with the Small Business Administration to improve small-\nbusiness participation in FCC proceedings; and, third, require the FCC \nChairman to publicly post the agency's internal policies and procedures \nfor greater transparency.\n  Although we could not agree on the policies offered by the \nRepublicans and dissented from the version of the bill that was \nfavorably reported from the Energy and Commerce Committee in June, we \nworked in a bipartisan manner to craft the language that we take up \ntoday. This version of the bill takes the bipartisan language from last \nCongress and includes most of the Democratic suggestions that improve \nthe bill.\n  I appreciate Chairman Upton and Chairman Walden's willingness to \nlisten to our concerns and work with us to achieve a bipartisan result. \nIt is a stronger bill because of it.\n  I also want to thank Communications and Technology Subcommittee \nRanking Member Anna Eshoo for her leadership on these issues, as well \nas Representatives Clarke, Loebsack, and Matsui, for their thoughtful \nconsiderations. I look forward to continuing to work with our \nRepublican and Democratic colleagues in the Senate to help this bill \nbecome law. Again, I urge its passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to thank my colleague from New Jersey and his staff for the \ngreat work on this legislation. I also meant to thank Mr. Kinzinger \nfrom Illinois as well, who has been very active on our subcommittee. He \nhas done great work on this measure and some of its very important \nprovisions. I left him out earlier today. I want to thank him as well. \nI also thank the staff and my colleagues. I urge passage in the House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I think this is a fine piece of work. I think it \nwill result in the Federal Communications Commission being even better \nand more transparent as it conducts the public's business. I look \nforward to this bill moving on across the Chamber and to the Senate \nwhere, hopefully, this year they will take it up. So I ask for its \napproval.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2583, the \nFederal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2015, a \nbipartisan bill aimed at giving the FCC flexibility while promoting \nopenness, transparency and accountability.\n  In the 113th Congress, the House of Representatives considered and \npassed similar legislation by voice vote. The bill before us adds to \nthe previously included reforms by including three legislative \nproposals offered during the Energy & Commerce Committee's debate.\n  First, a proposal offered by Rep. Clarke would require the FCC to \nreport quarterly to Congress and to post, on its website, data on the \ntotal number of decisions pending, categorized by bureau, the type of \nrequest, the length of time pending, as well as a list of pending \nCongressional investigations and their costs to the agency.\n  Second, a proposal by Rep. Loebsack would require the Chairman to \npost the Commission's internal procedures on the FCC website and update \nthe website when the Chairman makes any changes.\n  Third, the underlying bill includes a proposal offered by Rep. Matsui \nwhich would require the FCC to coordinate with the Small Business \nAdministration and issue recommendations to improve small business \nparticipation in FCC proceedings.\n  Collectively the proposals by Reps. Clarke, Loebsack and Matsui would \nmodernize and enhance transparency at the FCC without jeopardizing \nregulatory certainty or opening the Commission to legal challenges on \nevery agency action.\n  I'm also pleased that the bill incorporates the FCC Collaboration Act \nof 2015, a bipartisan bill I introduced earlier this year with Reps. \nShimkus and Doyle. For years, current and former FCC Commissioners have \ncalled on Congress to pass `sunshine reform,' so that three or more \nCommissioners can hold non-public collaborative discussions, as long as \nno agency action is taken. While I remain disappointed that this \nprovision will not take effect immediately upon enactment, I've \nconcluded that any further delay in implementation is the unnecessary \ndelay of a much needed reform.\n  I thank Chairman Walden for working with me and my staff to put \nforward a bipartisan bill and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. \n2583.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2583, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8185-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8185-H8196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSPURRING PRIVATE AEROSPACE COMPETITIVENESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT OF \n                                  2015\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

DISCLAIMER OF EXTRATERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that by the enactment of this \n     Act, the United States does not thereby assert sovereignty or \n     sovereign or exclusive rights or jurisdiction over, or the \n     ownership of, any celestial body.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McCarthy) and the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. \nEdwards) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  America is a Nation uniquely called to explore the final frontier. We \nare born adventurers with a spirit of freedom and curiosity unmatched \nin human history. And that spirit is aided by the wealth of \nintelligence so deep that we continue to lead the world in advancement \nof technology and science.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  When the Wright brothers flew over the beaches of Kitty Hawk and \nChuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, they were supported by the spirit \nof freedom and a structure of laws that urged them to realize their \ndreams and change the world at the same time.\n  But the work of realizing our full potential is only just beginning. \nWe are still paying Russia $70 million every time we send one of our \nastronauts to the Space Station. Our commercial pioneers can and want \nto fulfill this role, but they need our help.\n  The SPACE Act will help. This bill will unite law with innovation, \nallowing the next generation of pioneers to experiment, learn, and \nsucceed without being constrained by premature regulatory action. It \nensures that anyone or anything impacted by flight or flight \nexperiments are protected, and it keeps us competitive by providing \nmuch needed flexibility in permitting and licensing, facilitating an \nenvironment that allows for swift and effective improvements in safety \nand reliability.\n  With this law, I have great hope for the future of space exploration. \nWhenever I visit the Mojave Air and Space Port, where so many of our \nadvancements are happening, I am overwhelmed by the feeling that the \nfuture is now.\n  Upon the firm foundation of the SPACE Act, I know they and others \nwill lead us far and that our limits are only bounded by what we can \nimagine as we continue our journey to the stars.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support the growing commercial space transportation \nindustry, and I support the stated goal of the SPACE Act, to \n``encourage private sector investment and create more stable and \npredictable regulatory conditions.''\n  The commercial space industry is emerging, it is growing, it is \npreparing for the 21st century and research and technology and \nentrepreneurship and exploration. It employs thousands of workers.\n  The bill does some useful things. It extends the life of the \nInternational Space Station at least through 2024, giving us a \nspringboard for a pathway to Mars.\n  It provides for a clear definition of government astronauts as \nseparate from crew and other spaceflight participants, recognizing the \nhistoric and unique and necessary place in the spectrum for government \nastronauts.\n  But I must also point out my concerns that we support policies that \nconsider the safety of those who will use the commercial services we \nare seeking to encourage, especially commercial human spaceflight \nservices.\n  I am concerned that the length of the moratorium, 8 years, on FAA's \nability to even start proposing regulations for human occupants on \ncommercial human spaceflight systems, the so-called learning period, is \nlonger than it needs to be for an industry that, as has been described, \nis moving at quite a rapid pace.\n  I am concerned that this bill requires spaceflight participants, \nthose who will buy tickets to fly on commercial and human spaceflight \nsystems, to waive their rights to sue the launch provider and related \nparties for claims.\n  It is unclear, for example, what the parameters are for instances of \nnegligence and gross negligence or malfeasance, and we needed the bill \nto clarify these issues.\n  I am concerned that we are rushing to establish policy on space \nresource mining and utilization without having vetted the range of \nissues associated with it and without having carried out the necessary \ndue diligence to inform legislation that relates to our international \ntreaty obligations with our international partners.\n  Mr. Speaker, I supported the original Senate-passed bill, S. 1297, \nwhich includes a 5-year learning period and 4-year extension of \ncommercial launch indemnification. A formal conference would have, of \ncourse, allowed Members the opportunity to fully explore and discuss \nthe issues that I have described and resolve most, if not all, of our \ndifferences. Unfortunately, such a\n\n[[Page H8191]]\n\nprocess was not followed in this case, and so we are left with a bill \nthat I believe exceeds its risks.\n  That said, I believe that we should continue to support the emerging \ncommercial space industry, though we must do so with an eye toward \nprotecting all those who use it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Smith), the esteemed chairman of the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for \nyielding me time. And I also want to thank the majority leader, Kevin \nMcCarthy, an honorary member of the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee, for sponsoring this important legislation.\n  This bill encourages the private sector to launch rockets, take \nrisks, and shoot for the stars. H.R. 2262, the SPACE Act, facilitates a \npro-growth environment for the developing commercial space sector.\n  It creates more stable regulatory conditions and improves safety, \nwhich, in turn, attracts private investment.\n  This bill secures American leadership in space and fosters the \ndevelopment of advanced space technologies.\n  It preserves the Federal Aviation Administration's ability to \nregulate commercial human spaceflight in order to protect national \nsecurity, public health, and safety. It also preserves the FAA's \nability to regulate spaceflight participants and crew safety in the \nevent of an accident.\n  The SPACE Act allows the commercial space industry to develop \nstandards and coordinate with the FAA so the industry can grow in a \nstable regulatory environment without the threat of arbitrary \nregulations that would adversely impact their ability to innovate.\n  International law places liability for damages that result from space \naccidents on the launching country. All spacefaring nations require \nsome form of third-party liability insurance for launching entities.\n\n  The current U.S. risk-sharing structure expires in 2016. This act \nextends indemnification to 2025, and this provision prevents U.S. space \ncompanies from going overseas where other nations have much more \nfavorable liability protection.\n  The SPACE Act also closes a statutory loophole that negates an \nexperimental permit once a launch license is issued for the same \nvehicle design. This fosters greater innovation and allows an \nexperimental permit holder to continue its tests while a license holder \nconducts operations.\n  Current law only allows for two categories of individuals carried on \na spacecraft: crew and spaceflight participants. Now that NASA allows \nother astronauts to travel to the International Space Station, a new \ncategory is necessary to outline the roles, responsibilities, and \nprotections for astronauts on a commercial human spaceflight launch.\n  This bill closes a loophole that carved out an exception for \nspaceflight participants from indemnification coverage. By including \nthese individuals in the indemnification provision, spaceflight \nparticipants who participate in a launch as a result of a contest or \nfor other reasons are not exposed to liability more than anyone else \ninvolved in the launch.\n  Current law requires that all parties involved in a launch waive \nclaims against each other. This bill adds spaceflight participants to \nthe cross-waiver requirement to ensure consistency and reinforce the \ninformed consent requirements.\n  Many bipartisan provisions recently considered by the Science, Space, \nand Technology Committee are included in this legislation. These \nprovisions establish in United States domestic law that U.S. citizens \nare entitled to explore, use, and take possession of space resources. \nThey also streamline the regulatory process for commercial remote \nsensing and update the Office of Space Commerce.\n  Numerous space companies have expressed support for this bill. They \ninclude SpaceX; Virgin Galactic; Blue Origin; World View Enterprises; \nXCOR Aerospace; Mojave Air and Space Port; Planetary Resources; Moon \nExpress; Spaceport America; Spaceport Camden, Georgia; Midland \nDevelopment Corporation; Masten Space Systems; the Satellite Industry \nAssociation; and the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, which \nrepresents more than 50 commercial space companies across the United \nStates.\n  This bill is the product of over 3 years of work, 14 committee \nhearings, multiple markups, a rule on the House floor that allowed \namendments, and input from industry, education groups, and grassroots \ncitizen advocacy groups. Virtually every space stakeholder group \nsupports this bill. And, in fact, it passed the Senate unanimously last \nweek.\n  H.R. 2262 keeps America at the forefront of the aerospace technology, \npromotes American jobs, reduces red tape, promotes safety, and inspires \nthe next generation of explorers. It provides the boost America's \nprivate space partners need as they lead the world into the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have reached this point because of the persistence, \nover many weeks, of very able staff members. I especially thank the \nSpace Subcommittee Staff Director, Tom Hammond; Science Committee \nSenior Adviser and Legislative Director, Chris Wydler; and Chief of \nStaff Jennifer Brown for their work on this legislation.\n  I also want to thank Majority Leader McCarthy again, for his \ninitiative on this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), the ranking member \nof the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, nothing excites me \nmore than to discuss and to have witnessed much of the space \nexploration research.\n  The bill we are considering today is a missed opportunity to enact \nsensible policies. It is a bill that, if enacted, will do harm to \nAmerican taxpayers, to the long-term interests of the commercial space \nindustry itself.\n  It is a bill that displays the inconsistent and contradictory \napproach that this Congress has taken toward this industry. On the one \nhand, Congress and the industry has been saying that the commercial \nlaunch industry is so mature that we are ready to send our NASA \nastronauts on the International Space Station as passengers on \ncommercial spacecraft.\n  On the other hand, the bill before us today says that the industry is \nstill so immature that the FAA shouldn't be allowed to impose any \nsafety regulations to protect passengers who fly on any of the \ncommercial spacecraft until well into the next decade; this, despite \nthe fact that our country has more than a half century of experience in \nhuman spaceflight, and we understand very well what is needed to \nmaintain passenger safety.\n\n  This contradictory posture makes no sense to me. NASA will insist on \nthe insight and oversight necessary to be convinced that the vehicles \nits astronauts fly on will be as safe as they can be. However, with \nthis bill, ordinary citizens who fly on commercial spacecraft won't \nhave any similar protections.\n  I must point out that I am not talking in the abstraction. In just \nthis past 13 months, we have witnessed three different commercial \nlaunch providers experience catastrophic failures. One of those \nfailures resulted in the death of a test pilot. Another caused millions \nof dollars of damage to the launch facility.\n  With these major accidents as a backdrop, I think it is \nunconscionable that we are here today moving this bill in its current \nform.\n  The bill before us also goes against the interests of the American \ntaxpayer. By extending the current licensing and indemnification regime \nwithout any updating of its provisions, it shifts more and more of the \nthird-party liability financial risk in the event of an accident, and \nwe know there will be accidents, from the companies to the taxpayers.\n  Each year that the current, outdated indemnification regime is \nextended, the financial exposure of the taxpayer grows, and that of the \ncompanies are reduced. I can think of no other industry where we are \nwilling to have the government--and ultimately the American taxpayer--\nassume an increasing share of the financial risk of an industry as it \nmatures.\n\n[[Page H8192]]\n\n  Of course, some of my majority colleagues will argue that we have to \nprovide that preferential treatment to our domestic commercial space \ntransportation industry because foreign governments are providing it to \ntheirs. Yet I would note that many of those same Members rejected that \nsame argument when it was applied to the renewal of the Ex-Im Bank. I \nguess consistency is not always seen as a virtue in this party.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will not belabor the point. I opposed this bill when \nan earlier version passed the House. Unfortunately, negotiations with \nthe Senate did not result in any significant improvements.\n  That is not to say there are no good provisions in the bill. There \nare.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  But they are outweighed by the provisions that in one way or another \nsay that we as a Congress are concerned with protecting the interests \nof the commercial space transportation industry but not the safety of \nthe Americans who will fly on their commercial spacecraft.\n  Mr. Speaker, when the inevitable accident with significant loss of \nlife occurs, whether it is 1 year from now or 5 years from now, the \nAmerican public will look back at what we are doing today and ask how \nwe could be so shortsighted. I would urge my colleagues to take a step \nback from this path that we are on so that we can take the time to \ncraft legislation that will help this industry grow in a responsible \nmanner while still protecting our citizens.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Babin), the chairman of the Space Subcommittee.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the amendment in \nthe nature of a substitute to H.R. 2262. This bill is the result of \nbipartisan negotiations with our Senate colleagues over the last \nseveral months. Just last week, the Senate passed this bill \nunanimously.\n  Over the last 3 years, the House Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee has held 14 hearings on issues related to commercial space, \nwith dozens of witnesses from government, industry, academia, and \ngrassroots organizations. We have met with countless stakeholders and \nconsidered this bill in committee with markups, on the House floor \nunder a rule that allowed for amendments, and successfully negotiated a \nbipartisan, bicameral bill with the Senate. By all measures, this is \nhow the legislative process should work. I commend my colleagues both \nin this House and in the Senate on a job well done.\n  That isn't to say that this is a perfect bill, but in some instances \nI don't think the bill goes quite far enough. But that is the nature of \nour legislative process, and the bill before us moves the ball down the \nfield in the right direction, enabling a strong American commercial \nspace industry to flourish. This bill reflects the most significant \npiece of legislation relating to commercial space since 1988.\n  I am also very proud that our final product looks remarkably similar \nto the bill we approved in the House, with strong bipartisan support, \nearlier. We were able to convince our Senate colleagues of the \nimportance of extending the regulatory learning period beyond 5 years \nto 8 years; we were able to extend indemnification to 10 years as \nopposed to 5 years as called for in the Senate bill; and we were able \nto include many additional launch provisions from the original House \nbill. These are important provisions that will build a strong American \nspace industry.\n  I am also very pleased that the Senate agreed to include three other \ncritical titles in this bill that were introduced and advanced by \nmembers of the committee. These include the Commercial Remote Sensing \nAct, sponsored by Representative Bridenstine; the Office of Space \nCommerce Act, sponsored by Representative Rohrabacher; and the Space \nResource Exploration and Utilization Act, sponsored by Representative \nPosey. Their tireless advocacy ensured these provisions stayed in the \nbill. These provisions will pave the way for new industries to blossom \nin the United States, allowing our Nation to remain the world leader in \nspace. We want the United States to be the place where the world comes \nfor space.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan, bicameral agreement facilitates a \nprogrowth environment for the developing commercial space sector and \ncreates more stable regulatory conditions.\n  None of this could have been possible without the tireless leadership \nof Majority Leader McCarthy  and Chairman Lamar Smith, who sponsored \nthe bill. Throughout the process, they helped navigate and chart a \ncourse for our private sector space community. I thank them for their \nleadership and recommend a yes vote on this important legislation.\n\n                                          Planetary Resources,\n\n                                   Richmond,VA, November 15, 2015.\n     Hon.

Planetary \n     Resources strongly supports H.R. 2262, as amended, and \n     commends you for your leadership in passing this vital \n     legislation.\n       The bill provides a critically important element of legal \n     certainty regarding property rights in asteroid resources. \n     This will help companies like ours continue to unlock private \n     support for resource exploration in space.\n       Thank you for your foresight and perseverance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Chris Lewicki,\n     CEO, Planetary Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n         Midland Development Corporation,\n                                   Midland, TX, November 13, 2015.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to express our support \n     for the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act. We \n     appreciate your leadership in developing this important \n     legislation.\n       The Midland International Air and Space Port (MAF) received \n     its FAA license last year to operate as a commercial space \n     launch site, also known as a spaceport. Although there are \n     other spaceports in the United States, MAF is the only \n     commercial service airport to have this designation. The \n     Midland Development Corporation has been active in working \n     closely with the City of Midland in making the spaceport \n     successful.\n       Our initial plans are going well and our long-term vision \n     is to have Midland serve as an important center for the \n     world's growing commercial space industry. Since we are still \n     in the early stages of commercial human spaceflight, the \n     CSLCA is needed to assist the industry in continuing to \n     develop and move forward and we are grateful for your efforts \n     to have this legislation enacted.\n       We in Midland will continue to do all that we can to ensure \n     that Texas and the United States are at the leading edge of \n     commercial space developments. We look forward to working \n     with you to achieve this goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Pamela Welch,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Moon Express,\n\n                            Cape Canaveral, FL, November 16, 2015.\n     Chairman Lamar Smith,\n     House Science Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson,\n     House Science Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: Moon \n     Express applauds the House and Senate negotiators for the \n     tremendous work and effort put into crafting the bipartisan, \n     bicameral ``U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness \n     Act'' (CSLCA, or H.R. 2262 as amended). This new legislation \n     sets the stage for the continued growth and expansion of the \n     commercial space industry, and incentivizes further \n     investments in innovation and the development of spaceflight \n     capabilities that will benefit all Americans.\n       Moon Express wishes to focus particular praise on the House \n     and Senate negotiators for Title IV of CSLCA, the ``Space \n     Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015'', that \n     provides the first ever codification of rights under United \n     States law for the private sector extraction and utilization \n     of space resources obtained from a celestial body. This \n     landmark legislation provides a unified vision for the growth \n     of the private sector space resources industry and will help \n     spur new investments into this bold new field that's vital to \n     America's future competitiveness, prosperity and security.\n       Moon Express, Bigelow Aerospace, and many other companies \n     are applauding the Senate for supporting the creation of a \n     stable and predictable environment for private sector \n     development while encouraging investments into the bold new \n     field of outer space resource exploration and utilization. \n     This legislation protects and supports U.S. interests as \n     private sector companies expand the economic sphere of Earth \n     to the Moon and beyond.\n       The opportunities for the private sector to explore and \n     utilize space resources are substantial, and Moon Express \n     welcomes the\n\n[[Page H8193]]\n\n     CSLCA and particularly the landmark legislation of its Title \n     IV ``Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015'' \n     that recognizes and promotes the rights of United States \n     companies to engage in the exploration and extraction of \n     space resources from the Moon and other celestial bodies.\n       For these reasons, and many more, Moon Express calls on \n     Congress to quickly pass H.R. 2262 as amended, the bipartisan \n     bill that will ensure that America remains the leader in \n     space.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Robert (Bob) Richards,\n     Founder and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       Masten,\n\n                                    Mojave, CA, November 16, 2015.\n       Honorable Members of the United States House of \n     Representatives: On behalf of Masten Space Systems Inc., an \n     American rocket technology company, we would like to express \n     our sincerest thanks for your continued support in America's \n     continued leadership in space exploration through the \n     development and passing of the CSLCA bill.\n       Your leadership, unwavering commitment, and forward leaning \n     legislation allows companies like ours to continue safely \n     pursuing the reaches of space while we grow an American space \n     company.

Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McCarthy and Chairman Smith: Blue \n     Origin strongly supports the Commercial Space Launch \n     Competitiveness Act (H.R. 2262 as amended) and thanks you \n     both for your steadfast support and efforts leading to the \n     passage of this bill through the House of Representatives. \n     Since its original enactment in 1984 this legislation has \n     shaped the commercial space transportation industry, and this \n     reauthorization paves the way for continued growth and \n     advancement by companies like Blue Origin. This bipartisan \n     bill enables companies like ours to increase the safety of \n     spaceflight while opening the horizons of space to everyone. \n     The expanded protections for spaceflight participants and \n     opportunities for expansion in new commercial space \n     applications guarantees a promising future for this industry. \n     We also applaud the leadership and support of Chairman Brian \n     Babin, and Representatives Steven Palazzo, Jim Bridenstine, \n     Randy Hultgren, Steve Knight, Frank Lucas, Michael McCaul, \n     John Moolenaar, Bill Posey, Dana Rohrabacher and Randy Weber, \n     for their co-sponsorship of this important legislation.\n                                                  Robert Meyerson,\n     President, Blue Origin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Spaceport Camden,\n\n                                  Woodbine, GA, November 14, 2015.\n     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,\n     Majority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Chairman Lamar Smith,\n     House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McCarthy and Chairman Smith: Spaceport \n     Camden County, a proposed spaceport along the south Georgia \n     Coast, is fully supportive of the passage by the House of \n     Representatives of the Commercial Space Launch Act, as \n     recently amended by House and Senate actions.\n       We note that the CSLA was last updated in 2004, and that \n     initial action created a regulatory framework for commercial \n     human spaceflight that resulted in a wave of investment, \n     innovation, jobs and economic growth for the U.S. Since 2004, \n     there has been numerous successful companies formed (or \n     expanded), citizens employed, revenues generated and \n     significant private risk capital committed and spent to \n     develop new approaches to space technology, utilization, \n     services, and economic development. These developments have \n     also captured the country's attention and spurred a renewed \n     emphasis on the pursuit of science, technology, engineering \n     and mathematics (STEM) studies by students from 5-85 years \n     young.\n       The new legislation under consideration by the House sets \n     the stage for the continued growth and expansion of the space \n     transportation industry, while enabling rapid advances in \n     safety for spaceflight participants. It also promotes \n     investments in new commercial space applications, promising \n     future spaceflight capabilities that will benefit all \n     Americans. The bill facilitates a pro-growth environment for \n     the developing commercial space industry by encouraging \n     continued and\n\n[[Page H8194]]\n\n     enhanced private sector investment, creating more stable and \n     predictable regulatory conditions, and improving safety.\n       We encourage the full House to vote in the affirmative for \n     the new legislation!\n           Sincerely,\n     Steve L. Howard, ICMA-CM, CPM, CPPO,\n       County Administrator.\n\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine).\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Speaker, I am fully convinced of the potential \neconomic growth and innovation the commercial space industry \nrepresents. We already rely on commercial space for so much, and in the \ncoming years, we will see this industry continuing to expand worldwide \nInternet coverage, advanced communication architectures, remote sensing \nand weather architectures, affordable access to space for science and \ncommerce, permanent habitats in space, utilization of space resources, \nand the list goes on.\n  We must make sure that we as members of Congress do not do anything \nthat could stifle this world-changing industry. That is why the U.S. \nCommercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act is crucial. The most \nimportant aspect of this legislation is the extension of the so-called \nlearning period or moratorium on regulations for commercial human \nspaceflight. We need a learning period so we can eventually create a \nregulatory environment based on real data, not just speculation.\n  The bill also extends launch indemnification to keep American space \ncompanies competitive against international companies, clarifies that a \nlaunch license and experimental permit can be issued for the same \ndesign, and enables private companies to explore and mine celestial \nresources by incorporating the Space Resource Exploration and \nUtilization Act of 2015 introduced by my friends Bill Posey and Derek \nKilmer here in this body. These provisions will go a long way toward \nencouraging a continued growth of the commercial space industry.\n  I would also like to address a few provisions of this bill that I \nworked to include myself, and I am pleased that we were able to keep \nthem as the Senate worked to keep them in the final bill.\n  Section 116 of the bill will require a GAO report to capture the role \nof space support vehicles in the commercial space industry, regulatory \nand statutory barriers to the services these vehicles offer, and \nrecommendations for updates that will address these barriers. People \nwill need to be trained to fly, and vehicle designs will not remain \nstatic, which is why this provision is so important. This section will \nhelp us address situations that will become more prevalent as the \ncommercial space industry continues to expand and diversify.\n  Additionally, title II of this bill incorporates H.R. 2261, the \nCommercial Remote Sensing Act, bipartisan legislation I introduced with \nmy friend from Colorado, Ed Perlmutter. This title sets metrics to give \nCongress a full picture of the workload facing the Department of \nCommerce when licensing remote-sensing activities and what issues are \npreventing them from meeting statutory deadlines. Title II also \nrecognizes the importance of seeking input from the Advisory Committee \nfor Commercial Remote Sensing, which is largely made up of industry \nrepresentatives. This legislation will be crucial as industry expands \nbeyond traditional remote-sensing satellites and activities and as \nCongress looks to update the statutes governing these activities for \nthe first time since the 1990s.\n  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I would like to thank the majority \nleader, Mr. McCarthy, the sponsor of this legislation, and the Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee chairman, Mr. Smith, for their \ncontinued leadership on commercial space issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2262 is critically important to the future of \nAmerican leadership, and I urge my colleagues to pass the bill.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Posey).\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the historic U.S. Commercial \nSpace Launch Competitiveness Act. This legislation continues to lay the \ngroundwork for a vibrant commercial space industry in the United States \nof America.\n  I would like to thank the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and \nChairman Lamar Smith for all their work on the legislation.\n  I include in the Record several items.\n\n                                            Spaceport America,\n\n                                Las Cruces, NM, November 16, 2015.\n     Hon.

The CSLA was last updated in 2004, \n     creating a regulatory framework for commercial human \n     spaceffight that resulted in a wave of investment, \n     innovation, jobs and economic growth for the U.S. This new \n     legislation sets the stage for the continued growth and \n     expansion of the space transportation industry, while \n     enabling rapid advances in safety for spaceflight \n     participants. It also promotes investments in new commercial \n     space applications, promising future spaceflight capabilities \n     that will benefit all Americans.\n       This bill is a fair and equitable compromise that resulted \n     from months of hard work and negotiations among Republicans \n     and Democrats in the House and Senate to harmonize language \n     from the House-passed SPACE Act of 2015 with provisions from \n     S. 1297, the Senate's commercial space legislation. It \n     reflects your shared vision for commercial spaceflight, while \n     addressing issues raised by Democratic leaders during \n     deliberations on the bill.\n       Last week the Senate passed this compromise bill without a \n     single objection, indicating broad support for this \n     legislation across the political spectrum. In May, your \n     original SPACE Act passed the House 284-133--a 68 percent \n     margin that included 236 Republicans and 48 Democrats.

The \n     indemnification provision was included as a part of the \n     Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and \n     Entrepreneurship (SPACE) Act of 2015. The Senate has already \n     passed identical legislation, so the measure will now be sent \n     to the White House for signature or veto.\n       ``Extending the launch indemnification regime for a further \n     10 years ensures the continuation of a long-standing \n     provision needed for the global competitiveness of U.S. \n     launch services companies,'' said Tom Stroup, President of \n     SIA. ``SIA applauds this action by Congress. It is an \n     important step to maintaining U.S. innovation and leadership \n     in satellite launch while aiding the broader domestic and \n     global satellite industry.''\n       SIA has long supported extending commercial space launch \n     indemnification regime, which offers government \n     indemnification for any such damages in excess of the \n     required private launch insurance limits. The regime has \n     never been drawn upon, but allows U.S. commercial launch \n     service providers to compete on a level playing field with \n     foreign providers, all of which enjoy similar indemnification \n     from 3rd party liability damage related to launch failures.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   World View,\n\n                                                November 16, 2015.\n     Hon.

Participants will gaze upon \n     the spectacular, even life-changing vistas of the Earth in \n     the vast blackness of space, as they sail along the frontiers \n     of space.\n       This important policy framework, will help pave the way for \n     American leadership in space exploration, create new \n     opportunities for American businesses, and will help harness \n     the tremendous potential of our space exploration industry. \n     We anticipate significant job growth and the advent of a \n     whole new support industry in the months and years ahead.\n       Thank you in advance for your support and ongoing \n     leadership to bring this bill to fruition, and for your \n     continued service to our nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jane Poynter,\n     CEO, World View Enterprises.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Moon Express,\n\n                          Cape Canaveral, FL, November 16th, 2015.\n     Chairman Lamar Smith,\n     House Science Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson,\n     House Science Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: Moon \n     Express applauds the House and Senate negotiators for the \n     tremendous work and effort put into crafting the bipartisan, \n     bicameral ``U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness \n     Act'' (CSLCA, or H.R. 2262 as amended). This new legislation \n     sets the stage for the continued growth and expansion of the \n     commercial space industry, and incentivizes further \n     investments in innovation and the development of spaceflight \n     capabilities that will benefit all Americans.\n       Moon Express wishes to focus particular praise on the House \n     and Senate negotiators for Title IV of CSLCA, the ``Space \n     Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015'', that \n     provides the first ever codification of rights under United \n     States law for the private sector extraction and utilization \n     of space resources obtained from a celestial body. This \n     landmark legislation provides a unified vision for the growth \n     of the private sector space resources industry and will help \n     spur new investments into this bold new field that's vital to \n     America's future competitiveness, prosperity and security.\n       Moon Express, Bigelow Aerospace, and many other companies \n     are applauding the Senate for supporting the creation of a \n     stable and predictable environment for private sector \n     development while encouraging investments into the bold new \n     field of outer space resource exploration and utilization. \n     This legislation protects and supports U.S. interests as \n     private sector companies expand the economic sphere of Earth \n     to the Moon and beyond.\n       The opportunities for the private sector to explore and \n     utilize space resources are substantial, and Moon Express \n     welcomes the CSLCA and particularly the landmark legislation \n     of its Title IV ``Space Resource Exploration and Utilization \n     Act of 2015'' that recognizes and promotes the rights of \n     United States companies to engage in the exploration and \n     extraction of space resources from the Moon and other \n     celestial bodies.\n       For these reasons, and many more, Moon Express calls on \n     Congress to quickly pass H.R. 2262 as amended, the bipartisan \n     bill that will ensure that America remains the leader in \n     space.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Robert (Bob) Richards,\n     Founder and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Planetary Resources Applauds U.S. Congress in Recognizing Asteroid \n                        Resource Property Rights\n\n       Redmond, Wash.--November 10, 2015--Planetary Resources, \n     Inc., the asteroid mining company, praises the members of \n     Congress who promoted historic legislation (H.R. 2262) that \n     recognizes the right of U.S. citizens to own asteroid \n     resources they obtain as property and encourages the \n     commercial exploration and recovery of resources from \n     asteroids, free from harmful interference.\n       This legislation creates a pro-growth environment for the \n     development of the commercial space industry by encouraging \n     private sector investment and ensuring a more stable and \n     predictable regulatory regime. This law is important for the \n     industry and is integral to protecting and supporting U.S. \n     interests as the commercial space sector continues to expand.\n       ``We are proud to have the support of Congress.

Mr. Speaker, title IV of this bill includes language from \nH.R. 1508, the Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act. I \nintroduced this bipartisan, bicameral bill with my colleague from the \nState of Washington, Derek Kilmer, and with support from many members \nof the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. I appreciate the work \nand the research of Senators Patty Murray and Marco Rubio to introduce \nidentical legislation in the U.S. Senate.\n  H.R. 1508 provides legal clarity that if a company mines resources \nfrom an asteroid in outer space, it has the right of ownership to those \nresources. It does so consistent with U.S. international obligations.\n  The right to explore and use outer space is found in article I of the \nOuter Space Treaty. Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty explicitly \nrecognizes that nongovernmental entities, such as private corporations, \nmay explore and use outer space, including the right to remove, take \npossession, and use in situ natural resources from celestial bodies.\n  In drafting and negotiating title IV, there was a challenge in \ndetermining the best language to use to recognize this right. The term \n``obtain'' was ultimately chosen because it was technically and \npolitically neutral. It is our intention that only through actually \nphysically recovering a resource does a company have the right of \nownership of those resources.\n  In short, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitive \nAct is a critical piece of legislation to the future of our commercial \nspace industry and space exploration efforts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues again for their work on this bill, \nand I urge passage of this important legislation.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind our colleagues because this is \nreally important legislation moving forward, and I think that as the \nranking member, Ms. Johnson, has indicated and as I have, that it is \nnot for lack of concern and support of the commercial space industry \nand sector that we raise concerns. This is an industry that is growing \nby leaps and bounds, that employs thousands of workers all across this \ncountry, and that is at the hub of entrepreneurship, research, and \nexploration.\n  It really is the 21st century future. It is really a question of what \nthe rules of the game are going to be going forward, how to best \nprotect the interests of taxpayers, how to protect the interests of the \nindustry, and to see it grow in a healthy way. So I would hope that the \nmajority would take into consideration some of the concerns that have \nbeen expressed and let's use an opportunity over these next several \nmonths and years to make sure that we get it right for the industry \nthat is a part of our future.\n  I would note that, even with the reservations that have been \nexpressed, we pointed out a number of areas where there is strength in \nthis legislation, but we haven't gotten it all right. I would also \nremind the majority that, with respect to mining of asteroids, we are \nnot doing that tomorrow, so all the more reason we should pay attention \nto the international treaties of which we are a part and to the needs \nand concerns of our international partners as we move forward; that is, \nwe don't have to rush to judgment where it concerns mining asteroids, \nas we are not doing that tomorrow.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I would close by just saying that I believe that \nthere is a great future in this industry, and I am excited about it. \nBut I also know that we have to balance a lot of our interests to make \nsure that we pay attention, again, to safety and that we do it in the \nright kind of way.\n  As I began, I applaud the gentlewoman from Texas for making sure that \nthe points of concern are on the record. I do not intend to oppose the \nbill, and I hope that we can move forward in the future to make sure \nthat we really can provide for the kind of strength that the industry \nneeds.\n  I want to take an opportunity to thank the staff: Pam Whitney of our \nSpace Subcommittee, who has put in tireless work on this bill; Allen \nLi; Russell Norman and John Piazza, our counsel. Dick Obermann, our \nchief of staff on the committee, has put in tireless hours to try to \nget it right. I think for all of those who are part of the commercial \nspace industry, we want you to go forward, we want you to succeed, and \nwe want to make sure that the American public, that the American \ntaxpayer, gets the benefit of the bargain.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, today America stands at the beginning of a \nnew era of innovation and adventure. Scientists, engineers, astronauts, \nand entrepreneurs are working in the deserts of California to embark on \nthe next phase of our journey into space, and today we have the \nopportunity to aid them in that journey. Completing consideration of \nthe SPACE Act in this Chamber today will help ensure America remains \nthe leader in space exploration and innovation in the 21st century.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here today thanks to the hard work of Chairman \nSmith, his committee and their staff, especially Chris Wydler and Tom \nHammond. I want to especially thank George Caram from my staff for his \nwork as well. Because of their commitment after months of negotiations \nfollowing the House passage of the original bill earlier this year, the \nSPACE Act passed out of the Senate unanimously. I look forward to the \npassage of this bill on the House floor today with similarly strong \nbipartisan support, and I urge my colleagues to vote with me to move \nAmerica into the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy) that the House suspend the \nrules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2262.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8196-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8196-H8209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE TO MAKE A TECHNICAL CORRECTION IN \n                       THE ENROLLMENT OF S. 1356\n\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.

Pursuant to the rule, the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy) and the gentlewoman from the District \nof Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on H.R. 3996.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Nevada?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3996, which extends the \nFederal surface transportation programs to December 4, 2015.\n  On November 5, the House overwhelmingly passed a multiyear surface \ntransportation bill, with more than 360 Members voting in support. \nSince then, the House and Senate have made good progress in resolving \nthe differences between our two proposals. The conference committee \nstill needs time to publicly meet, which we will do on Wednesday, \ncomplete our negotiations, and produce a final measure that helps \nimprove America's infrastructure. Today's extension provides a time for \nthat process to occur, while avoiding a shutdown of transportation \nprograms.\n  The bill allows the States to continue to fund transportation \nprojects and prevents 4,100 U.S. Department of Transportation employees \nfrom being furloughed.\n  H.R. 3996 funds these programs at the authorized levels for fiscal \nyear 2014. No offsets or transfers of funding to the highway trust fund \nare necessary for the extension since the trust fund will remain \nsolvent during the period.\n  I urge support of H.R. 3996.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today the House must consider yet another short-term \nextension to keep highway transit safety and HAZMAT investments limping \nalong, this time for only 2 weeks. We must pass this bill today, \nhowever, to avert a shutdown of Federal transportation programs, which \nexpire in just 4 days.\n  This stopgap measure is a means to a much-needed end, which the House \nand the Senate are working diligently to accomplish a long-term surface \ntransportation bill to provide certainty to States and to address our \nNation's crumbling roads, bridges, and transit systems.\n  Every State department of transportation, every county, every city, \nevery contractor, every construction worker, every commuter stuck in \ntraffic, every business that uses our roads and bridges to move goods \nwants Congress to break through its own gridlock and wants us to come \nup with a long-term bill.\n  I would very much like to thank Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member \nDeFazio, Subcommittee Chair Graves, and all the members who have worked \ntogether in the most bipartisan manner--it is bipartisanship that I \nbelieve is a model for how this House should operate--in order to craft \na surface transportation authorization bill that passed by voice vote \nout of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and that \nreceived robust support when considered by the House after many \namendments were also considered.\n  The conference committee is now diligently doing its work, and I look \nforward to continuing our talks with the Senate to produce a \ncomprehensive bill for the President to sign. Until such time as the \nconference committee can complete its work, we must keep programs up \nand running, Mr. Speaker. This extension does just that.\n  This extension is a necessary step to avert a shutdown, and I will, \ntherefore, support it. It is my sincere hope that this is the last \nextension, and I earnestly believe it will be because of the \nbipartisanship this bill has enjoyed, the very last extension we will \nneed because it is beyond time to get serious about how we are going to \nfund our transportation future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I thank the gentleman for coming forward this evening. I have no \nfurther speakers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, the House must consider yet another \nshort-term extension to keep highway, transit, highway safety, and \nhazmat investments limping along, this time for two weeks.\n  We must pass this bill today to avert a shutdown of Federal \ntransportation programs, which expire in just four short days.\n  This stopgap measure is a means to a much-needed end toward which the \nHouse and Senate are working diligently: a long-term surface \ntransportation bill to provide certainty to States and to address our \nnations' crumbling roads, bridges, and transit systems.\n  Every State Department of Transportation, every county, every city, \nevery contractor, every construction worker, every commuter stuck in \ntraffic, every business that uses our roads and bridges to move goods \nwants Congress to break through its own gridlock and come up with a \nlong-term bill.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, \nSubcommittee Chairman Graves, and all of the members who have worked \ntogether in a bipartisan manner to craft a surface transportation \nauthorization bill that passed by voice vote out of the Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee and that received robust support when \nconsidered by the House.\n  The Conference Committee is now diligently doing its work, and I look \nforward to continue our talks with the Senate to produce a \ncomprehensive bill for the President to sign. Until such time as the \nConference Committee can complete its work, we must keep programs up \nand running. This extension does just that.\n  This extension is a necessary step to avert a shutdown, and I will \ntherefore support it. It is my sincere hope that this is the last \nextension we will need, because it is beyond time to get serious about \nhow we are going to fund our transportation future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity, I rise to speak on H.R. 3996, Surface Transportation \nExtension Act II of 2015,'' which reauthorizes federal-aid highway and \ntransit programs for two weeks through December 4, 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, instead of this 14-day temporary extension, I would have \nstrongly preferred that we were debating a final Conference Report on \nH.R. 22, the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act of \n2015, which provides for what used to be the customary six-year \nreauthorization of surface transportation programs to provide certainty \nand stability to the needed effort to repair, rebuild, and revitalize \nthe nation's crumbling infrastructure.\n  The Senate Amendment to the Conference Report on H.R. 22, the Surface \nTransportation Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2015, passed by a vote \nof 65-34, nearly a two-thirds majority, while the version of the bill \npassed by the House version of the bill, which included two Jackson Lee \namendments, passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 363-64.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly support this emergency but temporary \nmeasure because as the Department of Transportation has reported, if we \ndo not act now highway trust fund balances will reach dangerously low \nlevels by November 20 and result in a reduction of payments to states \nby an average of 28 percent.\n  Many states have already canceled or delayed planned construction \nprojects, threatening 700,000 thousands of jobs, including 106,100 jobs \nin my home state of Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Highway Trust Fund was created in 1956 during the \nEisenhower Administration to help finance construction of the \nInterstate Highway System, which modernized the nation's transportation \ninfrastructure and was instrumental in making the United States the \nworld's dominant economic power for two generations.\n  Our national leaders then understood that investing in our roads and \nbridges strengthened our economy, created millions of good-\n\n[[Page H8217]]\n\npaying jobs, and improved the quality of life for all Americans.\n  It is currently composed of two accounts that fund federal-aid \nhighway and transit projects built by states.\n  Federal funding from the trust fund accounts for a major portion of \nstate transportation spending.\n  The Highway Trust Fund is financed by gasoline and diesel taxes, \nwhich until the last decade produced a steady increase in revenues \nsufficient to accommodate increased levels of spending on highway and \ntransit projects.\n  However, those tax rates--18.4 cents/gallon federal tax on gasoline \nand a 24.4 cents/gallon tax on diesel fuel--have remained unchanged \nsince 1993 and were not indexed to inflation so the value of those \nrevenues has eroded over the years, and, combined with the fact that \nvehicles have been getting increasingly better mileage, the revenues \ndeposited into the Highway Trust Fund beginning last decade have not \nkept pace with highway and transit spending from the trust fund.\n  Consequently, since 2008, Congress has periodically had to transfer \nat the 11th hour general Treasury revenues into the trust fund to pay \nfor authorized highway and transit spending levels and avoid a funding \nshortfall.\n  The total amount to date is more than $74 billion.\n  Obviously, this practice is economically inefficient and injects \nuncertainty in the highway construction plans, projects, and schedules \nof state and local transportation agencies, not to mention the anxiety \nit causes to workers and businesses who economic livelihood is \ndependent on those projects.\n  Mr. Speaker, the last transportation authorized by Congress for 4 \nyears or more, SAFETEA-LU, expired on September 30, 2009, at the end of \nFY 2009.\n  Because Congress and the Administration could not agree to a new \nreauthorization, it was necessary to resort to stop-gap temporary \nextensions on no less than eight occasions spanning a period of 910 \ndays before Congress finally enacted the Moving Ahead for Progress in \nthe 21st Century Act'' (MAP-21 Act) on July 6, 2012, which reauthorized \nhighway and transportation programs through Fiscal Year 2014, a little \nmore than two years, or until September 30, 2014.\n  MAP-21 was intended as a short-term measure to give Congress and the \nAdministration breathing room to reach agreement on a long-term \nreauthorization bill.\n  Yet, as Mr. Levin, the Ranking Member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, has often pointed out, since gaining the majority in 2010, \nour Republican colleagues have failed to take any action to sustain the \nHighway Trust Fund over the long-term and shore up vital infrastructure \nprojects and has not held even a single hearing on financing options \nfor the Highway Trust Fund.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for this Congress, and especially \nthe House majority, to focus on the real problems and challenges facing \nthe American people.\n  And one of the biggest of those challenges is ensuring that America \nhas a transportation policy and the infrastructure needed to compete \nand win in the global economy of the 21st Century.\n  To do that we have to extend the reauthorization of current \ntransportation programs and to authorize the transfer of the funds to \nthe Highway Trust Fund needed to fund authorized construction projects \nand keep 700,000 workers, including 106,100 in Texas on the job.\n  But that is only a start and just a part of our job.\n  The real work that needs to be done in the remaining days of this \nCongress is to reach an agreement on H.R. 22 that the President can \nsign that is fair, equitable, fiscally responsible, creates jobs and \nleads to sustained economic growth.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3996.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8217-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8217-H8219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1930\n                  POLICYHOLDER PROTECTION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. POSEY.

ENSURING THE PROTECTION OF INSURANCE POLICYHOLDERS.\n\n       (a) Source of Strength.--Section 38A of the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o-1) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (c), (d), and (e) as \n     subsections (d), (e), and (f), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n       ``(c) Authority of State Insurance Regulator.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The provisions of section 5(g) of the \n     Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1844(g)) shall \n     apply to a savings and loan holding company that is an \n     insurance company, an affiliate of an insured depository \n     institution that is an insurance company, and to any other \n     company that is an insurance company and that directly or \n     indirectly controls an insured depository institution, to the \n     same extent as the provisions of that section apply to a bank \n     holding company that is an insurance company.\n       ``(2) Rule of construction.--Requiring a bank holding \n     company that is an insurance company, a savings and loan \n     holding company that is an insurance company, an affiliate of \n     an insured depository institution that is an insurance \n     company, or any other company that is an insurance company \n     and that directly or indirectly controls an insured \n     depository institution to serve as a source of financial \n     strength under this section shall be deemed an action of the \n     Board that requires a bank holding company to provide funds \n     or other assets to a subsidiary depository institution for \n     purposes of section 5(g) of the Bank Holding Company Act of \n     1956 (12 U.S.C. 1844(g)).''.\n       (b) Liquidation Authority.--The Dodd-Frank Wall Street \n     Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in section 203(e)(3) (12 U.S.C. 5383(e)(3)), by \n     inserting ``or rehabilitation'' after ``orderly liquidation'' \n     each place that term appears; and\n       (2) in section 204(d)(4) (12 U.S.C. 5384(d)(4)), by \n     inserting before the semicolon at the end the following: ``, \n     except that, if the covered financial company or covered \n     subsidiary is an insurance company or a subsidiary of an \n     insurance company, the Corporation--\n       ``(A) shall promptly notify the State insurance authority \n     for the insurance company of the intention to take such lien; \n     and\n       ``(B) may only take such lien--\n       ``(i) to secure repayment of funds made available to such \n     covered financial company or covered subsidiary; and\n       ``(ii) if the Corporation determines, after consultation \n     with the State insurance authority, that such lien will not \n     unduly impede or delay the liquidation or rehabilitation of \n     the insurance company, or the recovery by its \n     policyholders''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Posey) and the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague on the Financial Services \nCommittee, Mr. Sherman, for all of his help and support on the \nPolicyholder Protection Act as well as the chairman and ranking member \nof the committee for their support.\n  I have devoted a great deal of time to insurance issues both as a \nState legislator in Florida and as a Member of Congress. For over 3 \nyears, I have been pushing legislation to address problems that Dodd-\nFrank created for insurance companies and, more importantly, their \npolicyholders.\n  I credit former Congresswoman Judy Biggert for bringing these issues \nto light and for offering a positive solution focused on protecting \nconsumers.\n  After a lot of hard work, multiple hearings, drafts, redrafts, and so \nforth, we now have before us this bipartisan, commonsense legislation \nthat will ensure that State regulators continue to have the tools they \nneed to protect policyholders back home.\n  Mr. Speaker, insurance policyholders shouldn't be on the hook for an \naffiliated company's failure or financial distress. But, unfortunately, \nthat is an all-too-real scenario under the current law.\n\n[[Page H8218]]\n\n  Today, in certain circumstances, insurance assets--those set aside to \npay out policyholders' claims--could be used as a source of strength to \noffset risky bets of an organization affiliated with the insurance \ncompany.\n  This practice could threaten the solvency of an insurer and undermine \nits ability to keep promises it makes to its customers, customers who \nrely on their policies to protect their families' homes, their \nlivelihoods, and their retirement.\n  It is simply wrong to force middle class families to put their \nhomeowner's or life insurance policies at risk because of bad bets that \nsomeone might have made on Wall Street. Therefore, our bill clarifies \nthat State regulators can wall off these assets from contagion, \nregardless of how an insurance company is structured.\n  The bottom line here is that insurance policies shouldn't be raided, \nperiod, and certainly not to bail out a financial institution that made \npoor decisions. Consumers deserve certainty that they will be \nprotected, which is why our bill will also require the FDIC to notify \nState regulators and consult with them before taking a lien on \ninsurance company assets. In the rare event that this action is being \nconsidered, this legislation requires that the FDIC first consider the \nimpact that taking such a lien could have on policyholders.\n  Taken together, these measures safeguard insurance assets and make \ncertain that they continue to be used for their primary purpose, which \nis to pay out the claims of policyholders.\n  The Policyholder Protection Act enjoys broad support from insurance \nregulators, State regulators, guaranty funds, consumers \nrepresentatives, and the industry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of our work on this commonsense consumer \nprotection bill. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1478, the Policy \nProtection Act. I applaud my colleagues, Mr. Posey of Florida and Mr. \nSherman of California, on their diligent work that they have put into \ncrafting this legislation in the Financial Services Committee. I \nsupported this legislation in committee.\n  The bill, in a nutshell, ensures that insurance company assets are, \nfirst and foremost, used to protect and pay policyholders' claims.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Sherman) to further discuss this bill.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure to work with the gentleman from \nFlorida on this bill. I was pleased to join him in introducing this \nlegislation.\n  This is a commonsense bill. It has, I believe, total support. We \nvoted on it in committee. It was supported unanimously. It has no \nobjection from any of the regulators, such as the FDIC, or others.\n  It is supported by most insurance commissioners all over the country, \nincluding Dave Jones, Insurance Commissioner in California. It is \nsupported by the American Council of Life Insurers, Property Casualty \nInsurers, and the Big I. So this bill has industry and the regulators \nbehind it, Democrats and Republicans. It is unanimous.\n  What does the bill do? It deals with the circumstance where you have \nan insurance company that is a subsidiary of a financial services \nholding company, and it basically lays out the principle that the \nassets of the insurance company are there to pay insurance claims.\n  The State regulator of the insurance company regulates that insurance \nsubsidiary and makes sure that the assets are there to provide \ninsurance reserves and to pay insurance claims. Those assets cannot be \ninvaded to pay for bad bets made by affiliated companies.\n  So, first, the bill says that State-regulated insurance company \nresources cannot be used as a source of strength for an affiliated \nfinancial firm that is being liquidated under title II of Dodd-Frank.\n  Second, the financial regulator may not place a lien on the assets of \nthe State-regulated insurance company under title II unless the State \ninsurance commissioner consents. It is the State insurance \ncommissioner's fundamental duty to protect the policyholders.\n\n  Finally, the State insurance commissioner has the primary authority \nto determine whether to liquidate or rehabilitate insurance companies.\n  The insurance commissioners did an excellent job during the meltdown \nof 2008 to make sure that policyholders were paid. This bill reaffirms \nthat the State regulators have the ability to wall off insurance \ncompany assets to protect policyholders. The bill will make sure that \nthose assets are not jeopardized by complex bets, risk-taking, or poor \nmanagement of affiliated companies.\n  In a nutshell, we want to make sure that those who have insurance \nfeel secure. This bill will do that.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for \nyielding.\n  A majority of the Financial Services Committee and, in fact, the \nmajority of Congress recognizes the need to preserve the current State-\nbased model of insurance regulation. It is an important conversation \nbecause our model, different from others around the world, centers on \nthe protection of policyholders before anything else.\n  H.R. 1478, the Policyholder Protection Act, introduced by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey) and the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Sherman) works to guarantee the policyholder protections that have \nserved the U.S. insurance system and consumers so well.\n  The bill guarantees the authorities of State regulators to protect an \ninsurance company from contagion, ensuring that policyholders can be \npaid for claims regardless of how that insurer is organized.\n  It also codifies the existing role of the FDIC to consult with State \nregulators and requires full consideration of all implications a \nresolution could have on policyholders. The legislation also ensures \nthat the States maintain authority over an insurer's resolution \nprocess.\n  Insurers typically hold large amounts of capital. They do so because \nthe primary function of an insurer is to pay claims. Mr. Posey's bill \nmakes sure those assets which go towards payment of claims aren't used \nto offset other activities of affiliated businesses.\n  There is a genuine concern that other affiliates could raid an \ninsurance affiliate's assets to prop up another entity within its \ncompany's holdings. This should never be allowed. This bill prevents \nthat from happening. In other words, it says ``hands off'' to other \nassets of the insurance company.\n  The Policyholder Protection Act enjoys broad bipartisan support. It \nwas passed unanimously by the Financial Services Committee because it \ncodifies protections for insurance policyholders.\n  I congratulate the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from \nCalifornia on their bill and thank them for their work on behalf of the \nconsumers. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This bill, which Mr. Sherman and Mr. Posey have worked so diligently \non, brings parity among State law, Federal bank holding company laws, \nand now the savings and loan holding companies.\n  It clarifies that the FDIC's backup receivership authority is not \ntriggered if a State insurance regulator decides to rehabilitate rather \nthan to liquidate a troubled insurance company.\n  I certainly commend this bill to my colleagues. The Financial \nServices Committee has looked it over carefully. I urge support of this \nbalanced proposal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1478, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n\n[[Page H8219]]\n\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8219-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REPORTING MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3032, the Securities and \nExchange Commission Reporting Modernization Act.\n  I want to thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) and the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Hurt), for their very diligent and \nbipartisan work that resulted in the Financial Services Committee \nfavorably reporting H.R. 3032 on a unanimous vote.\n  I would also like to thank SEC Chair Mary Jo White and her fellow \nCommissioners for providing their unanimous recommendation to eliminate \nthis reporting requirement, which the Congress previously repealed for \nall other regulatory agencies.\n  No matter how modest the legislation may be, legislative efforts to \neliminate unnecessary and otherwise extraneous reporting requirements \nare exactly the type of proactive suggestions our regulators should \nprovide to the committee for consideration.\n  Despite the Senate's unwillingness to pass equally bipartisan bills \nto spur growth, promote capital formation, and create jobs, I hope our \ncolleagues in the Senate can agree that this exceedingly minor change \nis worthy of swift enactment.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) and \nthe gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Hurt) for their bipartisan work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am so happy to join the chairman of the Financial Services \nCommittee and Ms. Sinema in overwhelmingly supporting H.R. 3032.\n  This bill, of course, will relieve the SEC from unnecessary \nadministrative burdens and enable the already overwhelmed agency to \nfocus resources to other, more mission-critical tasks, examinations, \nand enforcement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman \nfrom Arizona (Ms. Sinema) to talk about her great legislation.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Moore and Chairman \nHensarling for their bipartisan support of this bill. I also thank \nCongressman Robert Hurt for being the lead Republican sponsor of this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our bill, H.R. 3032, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission Reporting Modernization Act.\n  Our regulatory system is inefficient, complicated and confusing, \nwhich is why it is so important that outdated regulations are reviewed \nwith the goal of modifying them or repealing them to reduce waste and \nto make them work for everyday Americans.\n  That is why I have introduced this bipartisan legislation with \nCongressman Hurt, to repeal an unnecessary and outdated reporting \nrequirement in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Since 1995, the SEC has been the only Federal agency required to \ncompile this obscure annual report. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars, \nand it is a paperwork burden that diverts time and resources from \nprotecting investors.\n  Modernizing the SEC's reporting requirements will allow the \nCommission to better focus on its mission of protecting investors; \nmaintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating \ncapital formation.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure that our financial markets work for everyone, and I \nhope that Members will join me in support of this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, so I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1317. I would like to thank \nthe gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore) and the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Stivers), both very good members of the Financial Services \nCommittee, as well as Ms. Fudge and Mr. Gibson from the Agriculture \nCommittee, for their bipartisan work over, frankly, several years to \nclarify an important provision of title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  H.R. 1317 is necessary to, once and for all, provide true relief for \nbusinesses that neither caused nor contributed to the financial crisis. \nThe scope of Dodd-Frank's title VII, which governs the derivatives \nmarkets, captured thousands upon thousands of unsuspecting businesses \nwho merely want to provide stable prices to their customers and ensure \nthat there are predictable costs to produce those products.\n  While we were able to address one of those negative impacts that \nDodd-Frank was having on end users earlier this year as part of the \nTRIA Reauthorization, nonfinancial end users, regrettably, are still \nsubject to the onerous and costly requirements of title VII.\n  As long as a nonfinancial company uses a central treasury unit to \nconsolidate their derivatives positions, H.R. 1317 will exempt the \ncompany's affiliates and subsidiaries from having to comply with title \nVII's many requirements.\n  As many know, the House of Representatives last December unanimously \npassed a substantially similar bill to provide this desperately needed \nrelief. Unfortunately, that bill met with the same fate so many other \nbipartisan bills that have been produced by the Financial Services \nCommittee and the House: they passed on a good-faith, bipartisan basis \nbut, unfortunately, have been disregarded by the Senate.\n  Despite the significant differences between internal businesses or \ninter-affiliate derivatives trade and derivatives between unrelated \ncounterparties, the Dodd-Frank Act treats all trades the same, which \nneedlessly increase the cost of hedging risk for end users such as \nmanufacturers, chemical companies, and utility companies, who, in turn, \nwould do what, Mr. Speaker?\n  Regrettably, pass those increased costs and market fluctuations on to \ntheir customers.\n  In fact, Tom Quaadman, of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for \nCapital Markets Competitiveness, noted during the legislative hearing \non H.R. 1317 that ``without this critical bipartisan language, end \nusers and consumers would face increased costs, and companies may be \nforced to abandon proven and efficient methods for managing their \nrisk.''\n  H.R. 1317 is not for Wall Street; it is clearly for Main Street, and \nI hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this commonsense, \nbipartisan legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H8221]]\n\n  I do want to thank the chairman for his patience in getting this over \nthe line. Hopefully, the Senate will see it our way this time.\n  I also want to thank the ranking member, Ms. Waters, for her \ndiligence in working to get this legislation to the floor and, of \ncourse, my friend from Ohio (Mr. Stivers), for working with me on this \nbill. All of them have been tremendous partners.\n  A long, long, long, long time ago, Mr. Stivers shook my hand and said \nthat he would continue to work with me until we got this legislation \nright, and he made good on his word.\n  I also want to thank my friends on the Agriculture Committee, the \ngentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Fudge) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nGibson). I credit all of these colleagues with helping this bill pass \nthe Financial Services Committee 57-0, and the Agriculture Committee by \nvoice vote.\n  We have a bill that sort of works for everyone: business, consumer \ngroups, and regulators.\n  These central treasury units, Mr. Speaker, are financial affiliates \nof commercial companies. They are, indeed, the corporate best practices \nbecause they permit efficient aggregation of the risk of a corporate \nentity and provide for a single point of contact between the company \nand financial counterparties.\n  This legislation appropriately treats central treasury units like \nother inter-affiliate transactions in the aggregation and monitoring of \nrisk in businesses, which is exactly what the end user exemption in \nDodd-Frank always intended.\n  For example, if you are a company, you have many inputs and outputs \nthat require you to hedge, like wheat in beer-making or aluminum cans \nin beer-making, and you need to make sure that you hedge and lock in \nthe price before production.\n  This bill permits the CTU to transact hedging transactions under the \nDodd-Frank end user exemption as principal and as an agent, which is \nthe logic that the CFTC agrees with. The legislation enshrines that \nlogic into statute with appropriate flexibility for the regulator and \ncompanies.\n  So I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1317. We need to get this \nlegislation across the finish line to the President's desk because our \nend users need this in order to conduct business.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume \nto the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), an outstanding member \nof the Agriculture committee.\n\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 1317. This bill makes targeted reforms that narrowly expand end \nuser clearing relief to preserve the ability of end users to utilize \nnecessary risk management tools in line with congressional intent.\n  This House most recently passed similar language as part of the \nAgriculture Committee's comprehensive reauthorization of the CFTC. \nToday's suspension is another step forward in a bipartisan effort to \nprotect end users from the unintended regulatory consequences that have \nbegun to occur.\n  The derivatives market provides an efficient place for commercial end \nusers to manage and hedge the diverse risks associated with the day-to-\nday operations of the businesses in this country. These essential risk-\nmanagement practices allow businesses like our agricultural producers \nor utility companies to protect themselves against unfavorable market \nfluctuations and to invest their resources to grow and create jobs.\n  As someone who has a degree in risk management, I can't stress enough \nthat effective policy in the derivative space must take into account \nthese efficient and proven business strategies. That is why Congress \nclearly sought to exempt the end users from the law's costly and \nburdensome clearing requirements in the drafting of the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation.\n  Unfortunately, despite these efforts, current law does not adequately \ntake into account the common risk-management practices of many \ncompanies who utilize separate legal entities known as centralized \ntreasury units, or CTUs, to hedge the risk of their end user \naffiliates.\n  CTUs are used by a variety of businesses to centralize the hedging \nactivities of multiple affiliates into a single market-facing entity. \nWhile a CTU is appropriately classified as a ``financial entity,'' the \ntransaction it enters into to hedge the commercial market risk of the \nend user affiliates should also be exempted from the clearing \nrequirement as if the end user affiliate had hedged those risks itself.\n  This allows firms to use CTUs to consolidate and reduce \nenterprisewide risk, as well as to centralize hedging expertise. While \ncurrent law provides clearing exemptions for CTUs that act as an \n``agent'' for affiliates, the exemption does not currently extend to \nCTUs that practice as a ``principal'' to the trades which manage the \nend user risks of commercial affiliates.\n  As most CTUS act as principals to the transactions hedging the risks \nof end user affiliates, this glitch in the law effectively prohibits \ncommercial end users who utilize CTUs from accessing the end user \nclearing exception.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  H.R. 1317 makes targeted but important statutory changes to clarify \nthat the law's essential end user clearing exception remains available \nfor all end users, regardless of their corporate structure.\n  As policymakers, it is our responsibility to ensure that regulation \ndoes not pose an unnecessary detriment to legitimate business \npractices. H.R. 1317 is an opportunity for us to resolve one of those \nissues today. This bill provides needed reforms to ensure our \nregulatory framework protects the integrity of our markets while \nallowing end user access to the tools needed to conduct their \nbusinesses.\n  A large bipartisan group of Members from all points of the \nideological spectrum have worked diligently to produce this legislation \nwhich passed unanimously out of both the House Financial Services and \nthe Agriculture Committees.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by thanking each of them, and \nspecifically Representatives Moore, Stivers, Fudge, and Gibson, for \ntheir hard work. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. \n1317.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, but I just \nwish to urge all of my colleagues to support, again, a very bipartisan \nand very commonsense bill. This relief is needed for end users for \nproper risk management. It will indeed help these companies with \neconomic growth.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1317, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8221-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8221-H8223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EQUITY IN GOVERNMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2036, the Equity in Government \nCompensation Act. I would like to thank the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Royce) for his diligent work to craft the language which is the \nbasis for this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, S. 2036 will simply reinstate the limits on the salaries \nof the CEOs at the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac that were eliminated earlier this year.\n  Since entering a Federal conservatorship in September of 2008, Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac have received nearly $187.5 billion in taxpayer \nmoney making the GSE conservatorship by far the costliest of all \ntaxpayer bailouts due to the financial crisis.\n  This is not the first time there has been public outcry over the \ncompensation of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's CEOs during their \nconservatorship. Following several years of substantial salaries and \nbonuses, congressional and public concern caused then-FHFA Director Ed \nDeMarco to cap the compensation for the GSE's chief executives at \n$600,000. Earlier this year, now-FHFA Director Mel Watt repealed those \nsalary caps allowing the GSEs to raise their CEO pay to as much as the \n25th percentile of comparable companies. This ultimately allowed both \nGSEs to increase their CEO pay from the previous cap of $600,000 to $4 \nmillion annually, all at the expense of the American taxpayer who is \nstill backing these institutions.\n  Director Watt's decision to eliminate the salary caps has provoked \ndisapproval not only from Members of Congress but the administration as \nwell. Notably, both the Treasury Department and the White House opposed \nFHFA's decision to raise the GSE's CEO pay. Treasury recommended that \n``existing limits on compensation continue given the taxpayers' ongoing \nbackstop of both enterprises.''\n  Additionally, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest expressed the \nWhite House's opposition, adding that ``the reason that these entities \nare different than some of the financial entities that you see in the \nprivate sector is they benefit significantly from a backstop that is \nprovided by the taxpayers. And because of that taxpayer assistance, I \nthink it is entirely legitimate for the executives of those \ninstitutions to be subject to compensation limits.''\n  While some claim that the GSEs should be able to pay salaries \ncommensurate with the private sector, these arguments failed to \nconsider that the GSEs have yet to repay their debt to the U.S. \ntaxpayers for their unprecedented bailouts. The 2015 New York Federal \nReserve Bank Staff Report stated that taxpayers are entitled to ``a \nsubstantial risk premium,'' and the government has never collected the \ncommitment fee taxpayers are owed.\n  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew concurred in his June 17, 2015, testimony \nbefore the Financial Services Committee, which I chair, that ``the risk \nis being borne by taxpayers on an ongoing basis, and the \nconservatorship is not over.''\n  Mr. Speaker, while Congress continues to debate the best framework \nfor comprehensive housing finance reform, enactment of S. 2036 is a \npositive step forward based on a simple principle: What people do with \ntheir money is their business; what they do with taxpayer money is our \nbusiness.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting S. 2036.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         Congress of the United States, Committee on Oversight and \n           Government Reform,\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 2243, the Equity \n     in Government Compensation Act of 2015. As you know, the \n     Committee on Financial Services received an original referral \n     and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform a \n     secondary referral when the bill was introduced on May 8, \n     2015. I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this \n     legislation before the House of Representatives in an \n     expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on \n     Oversight and Government Reform will forego action on the \n     bill.\n       The Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 2243 at \n     this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject \n     matter contained in this or similar legislation. Further, I \n     request your support for the appointment of conferees from \n     the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during any \n     House-Senate conference convened on this or related \n     legislation.\n       As you know, I introduced H.R. 1577, the Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2015, which makes those \n     entities subject to the Freedom of Information Act when in \n     conservatorship or receivership. The bill shares the same \n     goal as H.R. 2243 in that it aims to ensure accountability, \n     transparency and fairness within our Government-sponsored \n     enterprises. The Committee appreciates your willingness to \n     examine my bill and work towards its consideration by the \n     full House.\n       I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on H.R. \n     2243 be included in the bill report filed by the Committee on \n     Financial Services, as well as in the Congressional Record \n     during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    U.S. House of Representatives,\n\n\n                              Committee on Financial Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2015.\n     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chair, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n       Dear Chairman Chaffetz: Thank you for your November 16th \n     letter regarding H.R. 2243, the ``Equity in Government \n     Compensation Act of 2015.''\n       I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on \n     H.R. 2243 so that it may move expeditiously to the House \n     floor. I acknowledge that although you are waiving action on \n     the bill, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is \n     in no way waiving its jurisdictional interest in this or \n     similar legislation. In addition, if a conference is \n     necessary on this legislation, I will support any request \n     that your committee be represented therein.\n       Finally, I shall be pleased to review H.R. 1577, the \n     ``Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Transparency Act of 2015,'' for \n     potential action by the Financial Services Committee. I will \n     also include your letter and this letter in the Committee's \n     report on H.R. 2243 and in the Congressional Record during \n     floor consideration of the same.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jeb Hensarling,\n                           Chair, Committee on Financial Services.\n\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, we understand that FHFA Director Watt is \ndoing everything in his power to conserve the assets of the GSEs. \nHowever, I agree with the chairman, Mr. Hensarling, that we disagree \nthat the CEOs of these two companies in conservatorship, whose \noperations are controlled by their regulator, should be paid \nmultimillion-dollar compensation packages.\n  The Treasury, which is the GSE's largest shareholder, opposes these \nproposed pay packages for the GSE CEOs, and so do we. So, Mr. Speaker, \nI therefore support S. 2036 and would urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.\n\n[[Page H8223]]\n\nHill), a very hardworking member of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. HILL. I thank the chairman and appreciate his work on bringing \nthis important bill to the floor, and I thank my friend, Chairman \nRoyce, from California, for sponsoring the House version of this \nmeasure, H.R. 2243, and I stand in full support with the Senate version \ntonight, S. 2036.\n  Mr. Speaker, since being placed in voluntary conservatorship, the \nFederal Housing Finance Agency, in my judgment, has really abdicated \ntheir responsibility with the Treasury in acting truly as a \nconservator. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have received almost $200 \nbillion in government assistance, by far our costliest taxpayer bailout \nresulting from the financial crisis.\n  This is also not the first time that the GSEs, the government-\nsponsored enterprises, were placed in conservatorship and that the FHFA \nhas been scrutinized for awarding increased pay to the CEOs. That has \nbeen previously discussed in detail here. And largely in response to \nthat criticism of FHFA's failure to properly administer these entities \nin conservatorship, the GSE's CEO compensation was capped in 2012 at \n$600,000. Now, miraculously, they are being approved for millions in \npay increases despite the fact that these entities are still, Mr. \nSpeaker, in conservatorship.\n  It is for that reason, Mr. Speaker, on July 30 that I wrote Mel Watt, \nthe Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and awarded him my \nmonthly Golden Fleece Award for poor stewardship of taxpayer resources. \nI include my letter to Mr. Watt in the Record.\n\n                                                    July 30, 2015.\n     Hon. Mel Watt,\n     Director, Federal Housing Finance Agency,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Watt: I write today to inform you of my \n     recent Golden Fleece Award to the Federal Housing Finance \n     Agency (FHFA) for its approval of approximately $4 million in \n     raises for each of the CEOs of the government-sponsored \n     enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n       Since being placed in voluntary conservatorship by FHFA in \n     2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have received almost $200 \n     billion in government assistance, by far the costliest \n     taxpayer bailout resulting from the financial crisis. This is \n     also not the first time since the GSEs were placed in \n     conservatorship that FHFA has been scrutinized for awarding \n     increased pay to their CEOs. In 2009, FHFA approved $42 \n     million in pay packages to the GSEs' top 12 executives. In \n     2011, FHFA approved $12.79 million in bonus pay for some of \n     the top executives at Fannie and Freddie. Largely in response \n     to this criticism, the GSEs' CEO compensation was capped in \n     2012 at $600,000.\n       Both the U.S. Treasury Department and the White House have \n     also opposed FHFA's decision to raise Fannie and Freddie \n     CEOs' salaries. Specifically, Treasury recommended that \n     ``existing limits on compensation continue given the \n     taxpayers' ongoing backstop of both enterprises,'' while \n     White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that ``the \n     reason that these entities are different than some of the \n     financial entities that you see in the private sector is they \n     benefit significantly from a backstop that's provided by that \n     taxpayers. And because of that taxpayer assistance, I think \n     it is entirely legitimate for the executives of those \n     institutions to be subject to compensation limits.'' \n     Additionally, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew stated in his June \n     17, 2015 testimony before the House Financial Services \n     Committee that ``the risk is being borne by taxpayers on an \n     ongoing basis and the conservatorship is not over.'' Despite \n     this opposition, FHFA has once again raised these salaries to \n     $4 million.\n       While the recovery of the housing market has helped Fannie \n     and Freddie repay the federal government, and I fully support \n     the private sector compensating its executives as it sees \n     fit, Fannie and Freddie still have taxpayer backing, are not \n     private companies, and should not be compensated as such.\n       While Congress still must work to enact necessary reforms \n     to our GSEs, FHFA must be accountable and responsible for \n     ensuring the protection of our hardworking taxpayers' \n     dollars. I am committed to eradicating this type of \n     inefficient and ineffective policy and regulation by our \n     federal agencies, and today's Golden Fleece highlights the \n     clear lack of judgement by FHFA in approving these raises. I \n     invite your immediate attention to this issue, and please \n     keep me apprised of your efforts at improvement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      French Hill,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n  Mr. HILL. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has given his opposition, the \nWhite House has provided a statement of opposition, and yet Mel Watt \ncontinues. It is for these reasons that I fully support the effort of \nMr. Royce and Mr. Vitter in capping the compensation until these \nentities are returned to financial health.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the day where we can work to have a \nsustainable housing finance system in America, one that is sustainable \nfor homeowners so they are not put into homes they cannot afford to \nkeep; one that is sustainable for our economy, so that we promote \neconomic growth and reduce our tendency to have these recessions; and \ncertainly one sustainable for the taxpayers, because the taxpayers \nshould never ever again be called upon to bail out government-sponsored \nenterprises to the tune of almost $200 billion.\n  Regardless of how effective the current CEOs are of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, $4 million compensation packages are not part of a \nsustainable housing finance system. Again, they are under government \nconservatorship. The taxpayer is still at risk. This does not pass the \nsmell test, it doesn't pass the laugh test, and it certainly doesn't \npass the taxpayer protection test.\n  So I am very happy with the work by the gentleman of California (Mr. \nRoyce) that provided the House language that was underpinning the \nSenate language that we are debating tonight. I am glad that this is \nbipartisan. I don't often find myself in agreement with the \nadministration, but I am prepared to take ``yes'' for an answer, and I \nurge all of my colleagues to adopt this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2036.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8223-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8223-H8227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SUPERSTORM SANDY RELIEF AND DISASTER LOAN PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                  2015\n\n  Mr. CHABOT.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, on July 13, this Chamber overwhelmingly passed H.R. 208, \nwhich was a corrective measure for those who suffered twice: first, by \na disaster and, second, by the SBA's inability to provide disaster \nassistance. Since that time, we have experienced more natural \ndisasters, with the President issuing major disaster declarations for \nthe wildfires in California and across the country in South Carolina \nfor the severe storms and flooding that recently occurred.\n  As we know too well, a major natural disaster can happen anywhere, at \nany time, and to anyone in this great Nation. A natural disaster \nexposes us to the worst nature has to offer, yet it oftentimes brings \nout the best in people. Communities band together, neighbors help \nneighbors, and volunteers donate their time and energy, all in an \neffort to rebuild.\n  Over the last decade, America has faced some of its worst natural \ndisasters, with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and, more recently, Hurricane \nSandy in 2012.\n  In the aftermath of any disaster, it is imperative that Federal \nGovernment programs operate efficiently and effectively so victims are \nable to rebuild and return their lives to normal as soon as possible.\n  Following both Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy, there have been \nstartling reports regarding the Small Business Administration's \ninability to properly administer the disaster loan program. The bill \nbefore us today, as amended by the Senate, has the great fortune of \nbeing authored by two individuals who have seen firsthand how \nchallenging the SBA disaster loan process is in the aftermath of these \ncatastrophic storms.\n  The amendment we seek to concur in today comes from Senator Vitter, \nthe chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, who, as we all know, represents the great State of \nLouisiana, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Senator Vitter's \namendment strengthens the already strong underlying bill, which was \nauthored by our committee's ranking member, Ms. Velazquez, whose \ndistrict in New York City was ravaged by Superstorm Sandy.\n  I would like to thank them both for their leadership and hard work on \nthese issues and for working together to craft legislation which takes \ninto account the needs of disaster victims and taxpayers.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  This amendment further ensures that the SBA will be able to respond \nquickly to the needs of disaster victims. It makes commonsense \nimprovements to the program, such as allowing SBA's resource partners \nwho already have a presence in the disaster area to engage with small \nbusinesses as soon as the area is declared a disaster, meaning small \nbusinesses can resume operating faster and getting people back to work.\n  It also recognizes that sometimes those resource partners will have \nbeen affected by the disaster and allows small-business development \ncenters, SBDCs, from other States to go into affected areas temporarily \nand to aid victims. I know in my home district, Ohio's First District, \nhaving Kentucky so close, this would be essential if either State's \nSBDC suffered due to a natural disaster.\n  Further, the amendment builds on the underlying bill's concerns \nregarding the SBA's struggle with electronic disaster loan applications \nfollowing Superstorm Sandy. This amendment ensures that Congress will \nbe informed of the status of the electronic application web portal so \nthat we can provide oversight and prevent failures that happened in \nprevious disasters from recurring. These changes, among others, will \nensure that the SBA is fully capable of responding to the next \ndisaster.\n  Again, I want to offer a special thanks to our committee's ranking \nmember, Ms. Velazquez, for her insight and leadership on this issue and \nfor working in a bipartisan, bicameral manner, as she does.\n  I have seen that as chair of the Small Business Committee that I \nchair now, but I have also been the ranking member under her when she \nwas chair, and it was always bipartisan. We have worked together in a \nvery collegial manner, and I thank her for that.\n  I want to thank her for this bill and developing it. It will help to \nensure those affected by disasters can rebuild quickly and that the \ninterests of the taxpayers are protected. This legislation, as amended \nand passed by the Senate, has broad bipartisan support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and concur on H.R. 208, as amended by \nthe Senate.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, when Hurricane Sandy made landfall in 2012, New York \nCity was one of the hardest hit areas. Thousands of homes suffered \ndamage, infrastructure was disrupted, and our city's small businesses \nwere impacted physically and economically.\n  After a disaster like this, it is not uncommon for as many as 40 \npercent of impacted small businesses to fail, depressing commerce and \nslowing the community's recovery.\n  The Small Business Administration's disaster lending functions are \nmeant to provide quick credit to small businesses and homeowners that \nhave been impacted by catastrophes.\n  With entrepreneurs' and homeowners' livelihoods at stake, it is vital \nthat the SBA's disaster programs operate effectively. That is why in \n2008, after Katrina, Congress passed reforms meant to improve SBA's \ndisaster response.\n  It became evident following Hurricane Sandy that there is still much \nwork to be done. The Government Accountability Office, the inspector \ngeneral, and Small Business Committee\n\n[[Page H8227]]\n\nDemocrats have all documented shortcomings in SBA's administration of \nthe disaster loan program.\n  Our committee found, for instance, that small businesses waited 46 \ndays to get their application processed by SBA, a threefold increase \nover previous Atlantic storms. The IG found the agency lacked clear \nguidance which resulted in confusion for borrowers, inconsistent \napplication of underwriting criteria, and loans going to ineligible \nentities.\n  H.R. 208 addresses these shortcomings and ensures those affected by \nHurricane Sandy are treated fairly. To begin, the bill would allow \nbusinesses to apply again for loans. As SBA was so unprepared for a \ndisaster of this scale, it is important that those impacted have \nanother chance at securing assistance.\n  This bill would also correct many of the problems identified by the \nIG. SBA will be required to provide up-front notification to borrowers \non necessary documentation as well as establish clear written policies \nfor loan officers. By clearing up confusion for both borrowers and SBA \nstaff, H.R. 208 will ensure funds flow more swiftly to businesses after \nfuture catastrophes.\n  Lastly, the measure incorporates a number of bipartisan reforms from \nour Senate colleagues. Under these provisions, for instance, businesses \nwould no longer be prohibited from posting their assets as collateral. \nThis is important as, previously, many entrepreneurs have had to use \npersonal assets for loan collateral.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a truly bipartisan, bicameral effort that \nfocuses on better assisting small businesses impacted by natural \ndisasters.\n  I want to thank Chairman Chabot for his leadership and support on \nthis legislation. I also wanted to thank Chairman Vitter, Ranking \nMember Shaheen, and Senators Menendez and Booker for their hard work in \ncrafting this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  When disasters strike, getting small businesses back on their feet \nquickly can help local economies recover. For that to happen, the SBA's \ndisaster lending initiatives must work as intended, providing emergency \ncapital to firms that have suffered physical and economical damage.\n  H.R. 208 would allow businesses that encounter delays to reapply for \nassistance and be made whole. It also improves how the agency functions \ngoing forward, speeding help to small businesses and homeowners when \nthey are most in need. This is a bipartisan bill, and it will do much \ngood for entrepreneurs impacted by Sandy and for businesses impacted by \nfuture disasters.\n\n  I want to thank Chairman Vitter, Ranking Member Shaheen, Senators \nMenendez and Booker, and especially Chairman Chabot for working in a \nbipartisan manner to get this bill to the President.\n  I also would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff for the \nSenate Small Business Committee and our staff for the House Small \nBusiness Committee: Adam Minehardt, Justin Pelletier, Emily Murphy, \nBarry Pinelas, and Corey Cooke.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, we never know when or where the next \ndisaster will strike. But, unfortunately, we do know that there will be \nanother disaster. In fact, there will be more disasters. Given this, we \nmust ensure that the SBA is truly prepared to help victims in the \naftermath of those disasters.\n  H.R. 208 rights the wrongs imposed by the SBA on those who suffered \nfrom the effects of Sandy. But H.R. 208 does more than just correct \npast mistakes. It imposes obligations on the SBA to ensure the agency \nlearns from history and does not repeat those mistakes.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to concur on the Senate amendment H.R. \n208.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and \nconcur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 208.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the Senate amendments were concurred in.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8227-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  (Mr. HONDA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, this week is American Education Week.\n  Today I rise to choose my bill, the Equity and Excellence in American \nEducation Act, which will move us towards a more equitable education \nfunding system. We can wait no longer to act, knowing we are not \nproviding each and every child with a quality education.\n  My legislation is a starting point to establish equity as a \nfoundational principle of our education system, especially in funding. \nEach and every child deserves to have an enriched education based on \nequity. Equity acknowledges all children are different with different \nneeds.

Mr. Speaker, back in my home State of New Jersey, we had \nthe honor of having a going-home celebration for a remarkable \nindividual from my community. He was known as Reverend Ron. His name \nwas Ronald B. Christian.\n  Reverend Ron's ministry was unique because Reverend Ron looked at the \nleast of us and took them in without judgment to help them with their \nills, whether they have drug issues or issues with the criminal justice \nsystem.\n  He never, never judged because he had seen the worst that life could \nshow you because he had gone through some of it himself. And one day \nGod stood him up and said: Now serve my people.\n  This great man passed away several weeks ago, but I wanted to honor \nhim on the floor of the United States Congress.

Mr. Speaker, Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District, which I am proud to represent, includes the \nAllegheny National Forest. The forest covers more than 500,000 acres, \nand the use of its hardwoods has supported the communities of the Elk, \nForest, McKean, and Warren Counties for generations.\n  Mr. Speaker, since these small towns depend on the harvesting of \ntrees from the Allegheny National Forest, I am deeply concerned by the \nnews that, while the amount of timber cut in the forest has increased \nin recent years, the number sold has sharply declined.\n  In fact, timber sales have gone down 19 percent in the past 5 years. \nFurthermore, a majority of the timber harvested is being sold as pulp \nand not as the high-value hardwood which is used to create furniture, \nflooring, and as veneers.\n  This is one of the reasons I cosponsored the Resilient Federal \nForests Act, which passed the House earlier this year, as it would \nenhance the management efforts in our national forests to make sure our \nquality hardwoods are being used in the right ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8228-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8228-H8232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS: RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to \nlead tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. For 60 \nminutes, we have the opportunity to speak directly to the American \npeople.\n  Before we get to business, I do want to take a moment to express my \ncondolences and the prayers of the Congressional Black Caucus and this \nCongress to our allies in France after Friday night's attacks in Paris.\n  Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. No act of terror \ncan shake the resolve of the French people to live free, and nothing \nwill impede France's ability to live prosperously. I want the people of \nFrance to know that the American people and this Congress stand in \nsolidarity with the people of France tonight. I say this with full \nfaith and confidence that no act of terror will deter France or the \nUnited States from embracing the principles of liberty, equality, and \nbrotherhood.\n  Our hearts also go out to those who recently lost loved ones and \nfriends in Beirut and Nigeria.\n  Mr. Speaker, in this hour, the Congressional Black Caucus will have a \nconversation with America about the issue of race relations in this \ncountry. This isn't a new topic of discussion. To be honest, I really \nwish there were no need and no appetite remaining in America so as to \nhave to address this topic.\n  It is amazing that the same nation that saw pilgrims journey to our \nshores on the Mayflower and that the same nation that saw Founding \nFather Ben Franklin make groundbreaking discoveries in electric science \nis the same nation that was able to land a man on the Moon and harness \nthe electromagnetic spectrum for our mobile devices. We still wrestle \nwith the same problem that confronted Ben Franklin and the Founding \nFathers so long ago: the issue of race relations in America.\n  As President Obama so eloquently remarked, the answer to the slavery \nquestion was already embedded within our Constitution--a Constitution \nthat had at its very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law, \na Constitution that promised its people liberty and justice and a union \nthat could be and should be perfected over time.\n  Yet these words were not enough to deliver slaves from bondage or to \nprovide men and women of every color and creed with their full rights \nand obligations as citizens of the United States.\n  It is this inherited sin that has guided a national history of \nchallenging race relations in America, from slavery to the Three-Fifths \nCompromise, to a nation divided and broken over the issue of slavery, \nto poll taxes and literacy tests, to separate but equal, to Japanese \ninternment, to anti-Semitism, to the Tuskegee experiment, to Brown v. \nThe Board of Education, to the loving Confederate flags at State \nhouses, to the Confederate statues in this Capitol, and to parishioners \nexecuted during a Charleston Bible study, executed in the hopes that it \nwould spark a race war. It is the sad truth that, while race relations \ndo not define us as a nation, ignoring and perverting these relations \nhas left a painful blemish on our national record.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, many times this year the Congressional Black Caucus has \ncome before you in this hour to discuss the issue of Black voter \nsuppression in America, the mass incarceration of African American \nmales in America, the issue of Black Lives Matter, community fears over \nunfair and unequal treatment at the hands of bad apple law enforcement \nofficers, and the economic concerns of communities of color.\n  These concerns aren't made up. The impact and evidence of these \nconcerns can be found everywhere for proof. Look at Amendments 13 \nthrough 15. Look at the issue of African Americans having higher rates \nof mortality than any other racial ethnic group for 8 of the top 10 \ncauses of death. Look at the Black Lives Matter protests that we have \nhad across the country. These concerns are our reality, and we must \nknow these things to be true. We know more must be done to strengthen \nour national record on race.\n  Tonight I want to use my time to discuss race relations in America, \nbut I want to do so in a way that looks forward and not behind. I want \nto have a conversation about strengthening our national foundation and \nabout healing the racial wounds of our past. In this conversation about \nrace relations in America, I will highlight areas of need and \nopportunity that should be examined. Tonight's conversation should be a \nstrong step toward progress.\n  It is my true honor and pleasure to coanchor this hour with my \ndistinguished colleague from New Jersey, a man who has committed his \ntime in Congress to strengthening communities and bridging cultures.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey, the Honorable Donald Payne, \nJr., my colleague.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois. It has \nbeen as a labor of love that we have represented the Congressional \nBlack Caucus in these Special Order hours this year.\n  Our year is coming to a close. As we look back at the issues that we \nhave discussed over the course of this year, it has been an honor and a \nprivilege to work alongside my colleague, R. Kelly.\n  As for tonight's issue, we have seen in recent weeks a number of \nracially charged incidents that have set off protests on college \ncampuses across the country. From the University of Missouri to Yale, \nstudents have protested the inadequate responses of their school \nadministrations to racism and harassment against minority students. We \nhave seen the failure of many college administrations to properly \naddress overt racism against minority students on campus.\n  Adding to the anxiety felt by these students have been threats of \nviolence against African American students and faculty. In many \ninstances, there is a disconnect between students of color and the \nuniversity leaders.\n  In many of these instances, administrators have openly acknowledged \nthat their responses to minority students have come too late and that \ntheir behavior has failed to take into consideration the concerns of \nstudents and the injustices against those students.\n  This is an extension of the debate over interactions--often deadly--\nbetween law enforcement and African\n\n[[Page H8229]]\n\nAmericans. Many African Americans feel marginalized and unsafe in going \nabout their normal day.\n  This year an overarching theme of our Special Order hours has been \nequality and justice. We have discussed how, despite the strides our \nNation has made on the journey to a more just society, minorities are \nstill the subject of racism and racial discrimination and face \npersistent inequities across the board, from health to income, to \ncriminal justice.\n  Through our conversations and through the ongoing national debate \nabout racial equality, we are highlighting how occurrences like those \nat the University of Missouri are not isolated incidents of racism; \nthey are part of a larger system of discrimination.\n  There is a history of racial discrimination, inequality, and bias \nthat still affects African American communities across this Nation. We \nneed to recognize this.\n  There also needs to be a recognition of the pain and anxiety and \nfears that it creates in some of these young Americans. As we are \nseeing right now, many minority students feel that they do not have a \nhome on campus. Many minority students are concerned about their safety \nat school.\n  Following reports of threats on social media, students at the \nUniversity of Missouri were afraid to attend classes. All students \ndeserve a safe environment in which to live and learn. We can't \ndiscount the fears of these students; yet, that is exactly what we see \nhappening. It is why so many students across the country are coalescing \nin support of racial justice.\n  How can we move forward from here?\n  Our national conversation about racial justice needs to remain \nongoing. As a Nation, we must continue to confront incidents of racism \nand harassment and bring light to the complacency that too often \nenables these occurrences in the first place. It has to be more than \njust a conversation. We have to use the voices of our students and of \nour communities to drive concrete action on their behalf.\n  Schools need to ensure the diversity not only of their student \nbodies, but also of their faculties and staffs to increase racial \nunderstanding and bring a broader perspective to their institutions.\n  Schools also need to make sure that marginalized students have access \nto services that enable them to share their experiences and to seek \nassistance to meet their needs. School administrators need to be held \naccountable for their failure to make their campuses inclusive and safe \nfor all students.\n  There needs to be an urgency of their handling of racial incidents, \nand any hate crimes or civil rights violations need to be investigated \ninternally and by law enforcement, as appropriate.\n  We must never waver in our efforts to address racial disparities and \nto eliminate racism in our country. The Congressional Black Caucus is \ncommitted to addressing racial disparities by developing initiatives \nand by working with grassroots and national organizations, such as \nBlack Lives Matter, the NAACP, and the Urban League, to ensure that \nthey know that they have someone in their corner and that there is an \neffort to work together.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  The Congressional Black Caucus is also holding a number of forums to \nbring African American community resources into the areas of business \ndevelopment, small-business assistance, financial empowerment, \ninequality, and education.\n  As a caucus, we will continue to lend our support to those fighting \nfor justice, equality, and opportunity for all.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back to my colleague, Robin Kelly.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank Representative Payne for those words.\n  One thing that you talked about with the University of Missouri, I \nthought it was great that when they did protests and sit-ins, that \nthere were White students, football players, and coaches that also sat \nwith them and gave them support. They were one. So even though bad \nthings had happened, it was good to see that there were all kinds of \nstudents and their coaches empathetic with what was going on.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Absolutely. To that point, this is the United States of \nAmerica, and we have to come together as a Nation to eradicate this ill \nthat has plagued this Nation since its inception. So we need people \nthat understand and like-minded people to also join in. This is not a \none-sided discussion. This is a discussion that we need to be having \nthat encapsulates the entire Nation.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. In my diversity training that I have done for \nmany years now, we have always talked about groups need allies. Allies \ngive you support and encouragement and the strength to go on.\n  At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Barbara \nLee).\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman \nPayne for organizing this Special Order and for your continued \nleadership on so many vital issues and for staying the course and \nholding down the fort for the Congressional Black Caucus. It is so \nimportant that our message of unity and our message--which really \ndescribes what many of the issues are that all of our communities are \nfaced with--that that message goes out. Both of you have really been \ntremendous in this effort.\n  So I rise this evening to join this critical conversation on race \nrelations in America and to challenge our colleagues to work with the \nCongressional Black Caucus to realize progress for racial justice and \nequality.\n  I join Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne in sending my \ncondolences to the families and the victims of the horrific terrorist \nattacks in Paris, Lebanon, Nigeria, and also in Egypt. Know that we \njoin in this quest for global peace and security throughout the world.\n  Now, tonight's Special Order is an important part of our work to \naddress the discrimination and racism that still plagues our Nation, \nspecifically as it relates to African Americans, but we know that it \nimpacts all communities of color. It is manifested in many ways, and it \naffects our entire country. As Congressman Payne said so eloquently, we \nare the United States. So when one is affected, all are affected.\n  All across the country at universities like Mizzou and Yale; in \nplaces like Baltimore and Ferguson; and in high schools like Spring \nValley High in Columbia, South Carolina, we are witnessing the painful \nimpact of institutional racism in our communities.\n  Very recently, we saw this in my home district at Berkley High \nSchool. In one of the most progressive and enlightened cities in the \ncountry, Black students were subjected to threatening messages on \ncampus. But I am so proud of the students at Berkley. They walked off--\nit was not only Black students; it was all students--and marched out \npeacefully through the city to protest these terrible, despicable \nmessages.\n  This is unacceptable. All students have a right to learn free from \nviolence and from threats. As long as Black students and any student of \ncolor feels unsafe in their classrooms, our work for justice remains \nincomplete.\n  This crisis isn't limited to our schools. Tragically, people of color \nface institutional racism from the moment they are born. According to a \nreport released earlier this year by the Joint Economic Committee and \nthe Congressional Black Caucus, more than one in three Black children \nare born into poverty.\n  This cycle of poverty and inequality continues in our school system \nwhere Black students account for 42 percent of preschool student \nexpulsions. Mind you, now, that is preschool. That is students from \nabout 2 years old to 4 years old. Black students account for 42 percent \nof preschool student expulsions, despite accounting for only 18 percent \nof enrollment. I can't figure out how any student aged 2 to 4 is \nexpelled from school. That is outrageous. Yet 42 percent of preschool \nstudent expulsions are African American babies. These kids don't even \nget a start, let alone a head start.\n  Outside of the classroom, African Americans are overpoliced, \novercriminalized, and underemployed. A report published by the New York \nTimes in April found that there are an estimated 1.5 million Black men \nbetween the ages of 24 to 54 who are missing from civic life, just \nmissing it. These missing men, who account for\n\n[[Page H8230]]\n\none in every six Black men, have been victims of mass incarceration or \npremature death. And this crisis of inequality extends to the \nstructures of the community and have persisted from generations.\n  Over the past four decades, the average unemployment rate for Blacks \nhas been double the rate for White Americans. For many Black families, \nit feels like this is a permanent recession.\n  Mr. Speaker, this must be our call to action. That is why I am so \nproud of our young people throughout the country and students who are \nstanding up to racism and injustice in their communities. It is time \nfor Congress to listen to the young people, saying that Black Lives \nMatter and Black students matter.\n  Earlier this month, I held a forum on racial justice in my district \nto address these issues. More than 300 East Bay residents from all \nbackgrounds attended and raised their voices for justice. This was the \nsecond forum that I have held throughout the last 3 months. Now, I have \nbeen able to reach over 1,000 East Bay residents.\n\n  So, tonight, in this dialogue, which Congressman Payne and \nCongresswoman Kelly have talked about, this dialogue leads to action. \nHopefully, our colleagues would think about hosting these types of \nforums and listen to what people are saying, listen to what the impact \nof some of our policies are on their daily lives. We must be part of \nthe conversation and the solution, but we must listen. We must hear the \npain and the suffering that people are experiencing as a result of \ndiscrimination and racial injustice.\n  Now, the Congress must act to start addressing the systemic racism \nthat degrades our institutions and threatens our communities. It is \npast time for us to get serious about us addressing the lack of \nopportunity for Black and minority families in this country. Right now, \ntoday, in this Chamber, there is legislation that can start moving the \nneedle forward.\n  We need to empower our communities to build greater trust between law \nenforcement and communities of color, and we need to address chronic \nrecidivism, which would be a huge step toward returning some of our \nmissing men to their families and communities. To do this, Congress \nshould pass the Safe Justice Act, sponsored by Congressman \nSensenbrenner and Congressman Scott. Congress should also pass the Stop \nMilitarizing Law Enforcement Act, H.R. 1232, to stop the militarization \nof our Nation's police forces. We also should pass the Police \nAccountability Act, H.R. 1102, and the Grand Jury Reform Act, H.R. 429, \nso we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and that \nthere is more accountability for police officers.\n  As we reform our broken criminal justice system and work to help \nrepair those families hurt by mass incarceration, we will be \nstrengthening America. We will have people who really can make a \ncontribution, not only to their families and their communities, but to \nthe entire country.\n  The Federal Government shouldn't continue to put up barriers to work \nfor those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and \nshould ban the box totally by Federal contractors and by Federal \nagencies. We also need to repeal the lifetime ban on Pell grants for \nthose formerly incarcerated as it relates to drug felonies, the \nineligibility for public assistance and food stamps.\n  We need to remove these barriers so that people of color, primarily \nAfrican American men and Latino men, can get back into society, get a \njob, and take care of their families. Once again, this is an example of \npublic policy that racism wreaks its ugly head in our own institutions \nand policies.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, we must address the poverty that plagues \ncommunities of color all across the country. We have the Whip's Task \nForce on Poverty, Income Inequality, and Opportunity, which I am proud \nto chair with our whip, Mr. Hoyer. We are working with more than 100 of \nour colleagues now to advance policies that give all families, \nincluding African American families living below the poverty line both \nin urban communities and in rural communities, a fair shot.\n  This effort includes our Half in Ten Act, H.R. 258, which calls for a \nnational strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade. That is \nmore than 22 million Americans lifted out of poverty into the middle \nclass in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our \nexisting programs.\n  Our Pathway Out of Poverty Act, H.R. 2721, would create good-paying \njobs. It would lift families out of poverty into the middle class while \nstrengthening our safety net for those who are still struggling. \nUltimately, the only way to end institutional racism is to give African \nAmericans and people of color a seat at the table, and we need to pass \nlegislation and policies that begin to remove these barriers.\n  My mentor, the Honorable Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, used to say: \n``If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring in a folding \nchair.'' That is what our young people are doing around the country.\n  So I want to thank all of the people across our country who are \nbringing in folding chairs and ensuring that these important \nconversations happen. We hear you. We support you, and we will keep \nfighting for you for ensuring liberty and justice for all, which means \njust that. It means for all. In doing so, we will make the United \nStates a stronger country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne for \norganizing this very important Special Order. I know that out of this \ndiscussion, we are laying out what can be done, and it doesn't take \nanother generation to end racial injustice in our country.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Representative Lee, I like your analogy about \n``if you are not at the table, bring your folding chair.'' I would like \nto say: ``If you are not at the table, your issues would be on the \nmenu.'' But I like the folding chair analogy also.\n  I think a good point that you bring up that people don't realize, \nwhen we talk about African American men in jail, incarcerated, people \nmight think, well, if they are doing something wrong, they should be in \njail.\n  To use Ferguson as an example, while comprising two-thirds of \nFerguson's population, African Americans represent 85 percent of \nvehicles stopped, 90 percent of citations, and 93 percent of arrests \nmade by the Ferguson Police Department. But while African American \ndrivers are twice as likely as White drivers to be searched on a \nvehicle stop, contraband was found on Black drivers 26 percent less \nfrequently than White drivers.\n  So these discrepancies, coupled with incidents of overly aggressive \npolice tactics and a police force that is racially and ethnically \nunderrepresented of the large Ferguson community, instill the culture \nof distrust and anonymity. So you can see why these things happen.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kelly for raising that \nissue because I think this is a clear example of what we talk about \nwhen we talk about racial injustice. It is very clear that many of our \npolicies--Federal, local, and State policies--the impact and the result \nend up being a result that has racial components, and that is what our \nyoung people are talking about when they are talking about systemic and \ninstitutional racism.\n\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California as \nwell for always making very clear and thoughtful comments and for being \na leader in this House for many years and taking bold steps in your \nbeliefs and your principles. Sometimes when it looked grim, that you \nmight be stepping out, history has been kind to you and shown that you \nwere right. So I appreciate your leadership in this United States House \nof Representatives.\n  One of the issues that we also find around racism is mass \nincarceration, which is a topic that has come to the forefront. The \nPresident is taking bold steps in that direction to try to have a \ndiscussion and correct those issues. There is no reason why the United \nStates of America, which comprises 5 percent of the world's population, \nhas 25 percent of the incarcerated population in the world. That number \nis mind-boggling.\n  We are talking about these schools that are having racial issues and \nthey are not being addressed.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  There is no mistake that when you look at the issue even around \ncocaine\n\n[[Page H8231]]\n\nand the disparity in the length of time that you receive for having \ncrack cocaine, which has predominantly been in African American \ncommunities, as opposed to powdered cocaine, which has predominantly \nbeen in the major population's community, but the sentences for crack \ncocaine are so much stiffer and longer that you can see a racial \ncomponent in even those sentences given out by the justice system.\n  We are dealing with a systemic institutional issue, and sometimes I \neven think that it has been so ingrained and embedded in the larger \npopulation that it is not even realized that there are issues. This is \nthe way of life. This is the way things are. This is how it has been. \nWe have to break that cycle. It is just unconscionable that these young \npeople who have done what we have asked them to do--do well in school, \nmove on to college, and get an education so you can be a productive \ncitizen in this country--have to worry about these types of issues as \nthey are trying to get their education.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank the gentleman for his kind \nremarks, but also for really digging deeper into this subject and \nreally raising, in many ways, the unconscious biases that are reflected \noftentimes in the policies and in the laws of the land.\n  One example that Chairman Butterfield and myself, co-chair for the \nCongressional Black Caucus, and Reverend Jackson have really been true \nleaders in, and that is the effort with the tech industry in terms of \nthe diversity of the tech industry.\n  We have learned and the data shows that many companies next door to \nme in the Silicon Valley, 2 to 5 percent may be African Americans and \nLatinos--maybe. To their credit, they are trying to figure out how to \naddress this; but one of the areas that some of the companies are \nexploring now is looking at unconscious bias and how that is reflected \nin the hiring policies of their managers as it relates to the \ndiscrimination actually that takes place against people of color, \nespecially African Americans.\n  It is embedded in this whole system here in our country, both in the \nprivate and in the public sector, and we have to really begin to talk \nabout it to raise the level of awareness so people understand we are \nnot talking about individuals and we are not going after people. We are \ntalking about biases that are embedded in our programs and policies and \nin the law of the land.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Absolutely.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I also think something that contributes to \nthat, your ZIP Code shouldn't dictate the quality of your education, \nlike it shouldn't dictate the quality of your health care. In too many \nplaces in this country, your ZIP Code does dictate the quality of your \neducation and the schools that have every sport, every technology, and \nthose kinds of things, and schools that barely have books.\n  They are not going to be at the same level when they graduate from \nhigh school, if they even make it through high school; and that is part \nof it, too, just the STEM, as we talk about, or STEAM, just the type of \neducation that students are getting because of the way in some cases \nthe schools are funded or the concentration of poverty in the school \nsystem, in some school systems.\n  Mr. PAYNE. We are talking about the school systems. We are talking \nabout Silicon Valley. I am doing a lot of work now with the insurance \ncompanies and finding out that based on your economic background and \nwhere you live and what your ZIP Code is will constitute what your \nrates on car insurance are. There is a built-in formula to that as \nwell. It is just amazing how systemic and institutionalized these \nissues are.\n  Even a young man like me, who was raised by my father not to get in \ntrouble and do the right thing, I was still a young man, and sometimes \nI didn't do the right things. One time I was in downtown Newark, New \nJersey, and I made a U-turn on one of the major thoroughfares in the \ncity. A policeman pulls up on his motorcycle.\n  Just my luck, I would make the U-turn and there would be a policeman \ncoming, but that is the story of my life.\n  This police officer approached me, very angry, very mean, yelling at \nme. It was my cousin's car, so I wasn't exactly sure where the \ncredentials were in the car. I was about 20 years old at the time. The \npolice officer finally says to me: Boy, if you don't find those \ndocuments--and he didn't use ``boy.'' He used a word that we can't use \non the floor of this House of Representatives. But he said: If you \ndon't find those documents, I will throw you so far under the jail that \nthey will never find you.\n  That was very frightening because he looked like he meant it.\n  I was able to produce my license, and at the time my father was a \ncouncilman in the city of Newark. It was amazing the change in his \nattitude. He became very concerned about my welfare and my well-being \nall of a sudden. He says: Well, don't you know that that is dangerous, \nand you shouldn't do that? You know, you could hurt yourself or hurt \nsomeone else. All of a sudden, I became someone because of what my last \nname is.\n  I am concerned about all the young men that can't produce something \nlike that at that point in time. There are more of those stories, of \nthe ones unable to produce than the ones that can produce. What does \nthat say for young men in this country? There are many stories like \nthat coming up that I could stand here and tell for several hours of \nexperiences that I have had with the institutional racism in this \ncountry.\n  Ms. LEE. Congressman Payne, you are talking about racial profiling \nand driving while Black, which so many of us experience throughout the \ncountry. I am glad we are having this discussion and you raised it \nbecause you come from a middle class family. You come from a great \nfamily.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Thank you.\n  Ms. LEE. Your father was a giant and raised you and your family to be \nlaw-abiding citizens, and still this happened to you.\n  Also, with regard to redlining, this is another level that we have to \nlook at as it relates to racism. When you look at how financial \ninstitutions targeted African American and minority communities with \nsubprime loans, our communities lost all of our wealth as a result of \nthat, and now have to start all over in terms of wealth accumulation. \nSo you just go one aspect after another of what America has done in \nterms of the past that has not been corrected yet, and we have to \nreally do that.\n  Congresswoman Kelly, I just want to mention the phenomenal job you \nare doing as the chair of our Health Braintrust. We had a meeting this \nweekend in South Carolina with our great leader, Mr. Clyburn. We talked \nabout health disparities in communities of color. You are talking about \nZIP Codes. I know in my district--I mentioned this at the forum--there \nis a gap. Depending on where you live, depending on the ZIP Code, life \nexpectancy where Black people live can be 10 to 15 years shorter.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Right. In the leading causes of death, African \nAmericans are number one in eight of them.\n  Ms. LEE. The mortality rate, that is right.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. We don't want to be number one in 8 out of 10.\n  Ms. LEE. That is right. That is right. The importance of the work you \nare doing in closing healthcare disparities, which sometimes people \ndon't understand, there are racial and ethnic disparities that, again, \nare reflected in our historical policies that have really severely \nimpacted communities of color and African Americans.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Representatives, we have about 5 more minutes. \nI don't know if you have anything to add.\n  Mr. PAYNE. I just want to thank you for working with us through this \nyear in bringing these topics to the floor. We want the viewing public \nto understand that we have raised these issues because they are issues \nthat plague our country. We are looking for African Americans and \nLatinos to have the same opportunities as everyone else. It is not \nabout special treatment or anything. It is about equal treatment. \nEveryone should rise based on their ability. Just having an equal \nopportunity is key.\n  Ms. LEE. I will just close by saying, we pledge allegiance to the \nflag, and we say, ``and liberty and justice for all,'' and that is what \nwe mean.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Representative Lee and \nRepresentative Payne.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we reflect on this evening's topic, the issue of race \nrelations in America, we want to talk\n\n[[Page H8232]]\n\nabout, just in closing, what can we do. We must do more, we must care \nmore, and we must understand more about the diverse cultures that make \nup this Nation.\n  A long time ago, as director of community affairs for the Village of \nMatteson, it has been 19 years now I have worked with a team hosting \ndiversity dinners in our area to grow friendships and nurture relations \namong residents of the south suburbs of Chicago.\n  Tonight as we discuss race relations in America, I want to reflect on \nwhat I see as the way to bridge the differences we experience in \nunderstanding in different communities.\n  Earlier this year, I along with colleagues, Democrat and Republican, \nhosted the Second Annual Congressional Diversity Dinner. Forty Members \nof Congress--Black, White, Asian, and Hispanic from both parties, \nincluding both Republican and Democratic leadership--showed up and \nenjoyed a meal with their colleagues. During the dinner, we weren't \nDemocrats or Republicans. We were colleagues with some great stories to \nshare.\n  At this year's dinner, I saw a microcosm of our Nation, a crowd made \nup of Members from coast to coast with truly diverse backgrounds coming \ntogether to enjoy each other's company. If we can put aside our racial \nand partisan blinders to break bread together, I am confident we can \nfind ways to work together. That is what America wants and needs, and \nthat type of leadership is the kind of leadership we deserve.\n  Today we have the opportunity to celebrate diversity and show that \nAmerica is only strengthened when we embrace the fact that we are a \nbeautiful, I will say, pot of stew. There is much that communities can \ndo to stanch out the rhetoric that divides us and find creative ways to \nbring people together. It was a small action, but that was what the \ndiversity dinner sought to do.\n  Now it is time for us to come together to address the reforms needed \nto rebuild trust between communities. Let's show the American people \nthat we are a diverse people, we are proud of it, and we celebrate it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this has been a \nchallenging year for race relations in the United States. Between the \nrecent events at college campuses across the country and several \nincidents involving law enforcement, it is clear that strong racial \ntensions still exist within our communities.\n  Renewed efforts to disenfranchise select groups of voters by gutting \nthe Voting Rights Act or segregating neighborhoods in violation of the \nFair Housing Act have contributed to the divisive elements of our \nsociety. These efforts run counter to everything that we as a nation \nhave tried to eliminate in bringing diverse individuals together under \ncommon values--and there is still much work to be done.\n  The fight for racial equality and inclusion has been a constant \nstruggle for individuals of color throughout our long history. Despite \nimportant victories during the Civil Rights era, a new struggle has \nemerged in our time to tackle more subtle and implicit racial biases \nthat exist within our society.\n  Recognizing these challenges and maintaining open and civil dialogue \nis the only way that we can seek to end these senseless divisions once \nand for all. While it is also important to learn from the lessons of \nour past, how we decide to move forward will truly come to define the \nfuture of our nation.\n  As we look to overcome our differences, we must reflect on our values \nand determine what kind of future we would like to see for our \nchildren. Do we want to leave behind a divided nation where individuals \nquarrel over race or socioeconomic status? Or do we want to live in a \nnation united under equal opportunity and justice for each and every \nAmerican? I, for one, choose to support an equal and just America.\n  Mr. Speaker, there will continue to be challenges ahead. However, the \nlessons that we carry with us into the future will help guide our \ndecisions to build for a stronger and more prosperous America. I urge \nmy colleagues to speak out against this blatant discrimination so that \nwe can heal our country and move forward as a nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8232-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8232-H8235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FIGHTING TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rouzer). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nCostello) is recognized until 10 p.m. as the designee of the majority \nleader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the \nopportunity to host this Special Order tonight.\n  Less than 100 hours ago, we were provided another tragic reminder of \nthe world that we live in, a world where radical terrorists are engaged \nin a violent war against the U.S. and our allies. Our thoughts, \nprayers, and condolences go to our ally, France, here this evening.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  Prior to Friday night's events in Paris, tonight's Special Order was \ngoing to focus on recent incidents of terrorist-led violence across \nIsrael. Yet Friday night's events are not dissimilar from the \nescalation of violence we have seen across Israel in recent months and \nin other places of the world.\n  The attacks have been indiscriminate in their targets. The attacks \nhave been intended to instill fear. And the attacks are a direct \naffront to the daily lives and the way of life of innocent, peaceful \ncivilians.\n  I want to share with you the words of Prime Minister Netanyahu this \nweekend:\n  ``In Israel, as in France, terrorism is terrorism, and standing \nbehind it is radical Islam and its desire to destroy its victims. The \ntime has come for the world to wake up and unite in order to defeat \nterrorism. The time has come for countries to condemn terrorism against \nus to the same degree that they condemn terrorism everywhere else in \nthe world.\n  ``We should remember--we are not to blame for the terrorism directed \nagainst us, just as the French are not to blame for the terrorism \ndirected against them. The terrorists who attack us have the same \nmurderous intent as those in Paris.''\n  Mr. Speaker, we know that ISIS has claimed responsibility for the \nParis attacks, but while we can condemn those attacks here this \nevening, it seems very evident to me, and I think Americans all across \nthis country, as we ask, I think, the same question: Are we safe, and \nare the policies of this administration and its foreign policy and the \nrefugee admissions policy making us safer, or are they cause for \nconcern and require more discernment and a more scrutinizing eye by \nthis Congress and the American people?\n  This year alone, there have been at least 49 alleged supporters of \nISIS in America charged with related crimes, and it is reported that \nthere is an estimated 20,000 foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria likely \nholding Western passports.\n  In May, FBI Director James Comey said:\n\n       Thousands in the U.S. may be consuming ISIS propaganda on \n     the Internet.\n\n  Tonight, in light of the horrific terrorist attack in Paris and the \nescalating violence in Israel, as we stand to express our solidarity \nwith our friends and allies affected by violent and extreme acts of \nterror, we must also be thinking about what we as Americans can do to \ndefeat--not contain--but eliminate radical jihadists and terrorists who \nare hell-bent on undermining the U.S., our allies, and our way of life.\n  A little bit later I will speak more on my views on our present \nforeign policy and the refugee admissions policy, but we have over the \ncourse of the next hour many Members from across the United States of \nAmerica condemning indiscriminate terrorist attacks, radical Islamic \njihad, and violence across the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to our first speaker this evening, the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers).\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I want to thank the gentleman from \nPennsylvania for his leadership on this issue and for holding this very \nimportant leadership hour talking about the issues that obviously \naffect our allies in the world but also the safety of the American \npeople.\n\n[[Page H8233]]\n\n  As we are discussing these issues and the views that are taking place \nand the discussion and the debate that is going to be had on this \nissue, I think it is important, again, that we remember this is an \nAmerican national security issue, and we in the House have to be as \nvigilant and as strong as we can be on the issue.\n  The attacks carried out on Friday by radical Islamic extremists can \nonly be described as barbaric, and we are responding with force. Yet, \nthis morning, the President announced at a G-20 summit in Turkey that \nthere ``wouldn't be any major changes to the approach taken against \nISIS.''\n  The President's passive approach has proven to be no deterrent to \nthese Islamic extremists, and it is time that he implement a clear and \ncomprehensive strategy to completely destroy ISIS abroad, on their \nsoil, so that we are not fighting them on ours.\n  This is an issue of American national security. Additionally, this is \nwhy again and again I have repeatedly called on the need to secure our \nborder and repair our broken immigration system to keep these threats \nout.\n  It has never been a matter of if, but a matter of when, we might face \nthis type of attack here at home. Time has shown that it is up to us in \nthe House to be the voice of strength for the American people.\n  As we work together to determine a stronger path forward, we will \nproudly stand with our allies--as they did with us--against these \nextreme forces of evil.\n  We will continue to hold the people of France in our prayers.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. I would like to thank the gentlewoman \nfrom North Carolina for her participation.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly.)\n  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Costello) for leading this important Special Order today.\n  We stand with our allies across the world who have repeatedly and \nrecently experienced violent acts of terrorism, specifically in Israel \nand France. We pray for the victims and their families, and we stand \nunited in our efforts to bring these attackers, these terrorists, to \njustice.\n  It is clear that we are at war with radical Islam. How do you expect \nto destroy your enemy if you can't even identify them or call them by \nname? They know who we are. They call us the infidels. And they will \nquit at no cost to destroy us all. We must identify and attack our \nenemy.\n  The world is safer when America chooses to lead. We must put forward \na coordinated and comprehensive strategy to eliminate ISIS, not a \npolicy of containment. We can no longer underestimate the desire and \nability for them to attack us in our homes. Our men and women in \nuniform will destroy the enemy, wherever they are, if we give them \nclear guidance and a strategy which they can enforce.\n\n  These acts of terrorism seek to make us less free. They are carried \nout on the mission of instilling fear, uncertainty, and hate. But the \nterrorists do not get to win. Americans and those other countries that \npromote freedom and democracy will continue to live our lives, go to \nwork, provide for our families, and advocate for those same freedoms \naround the world.\n  Now is the time to have faith in God, hug your loved ones a little \ntighter, and continue our commitment to eliminate the threat of ISIS, \nradical Islam, and other terrorist organizations around the world.\n  God bless our servicemembers, and God bless America.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. I want to thank the gentleman from \nMississippi for his participation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy).\n  Mr. HARDY. I would like to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for \nhis efforts to host us here this evening and for the opportunity to \nspeak.\n  As the events of Paris unfolded over the weekend, I watched in horror \nwith the rest of the world as violent terror once again touched the \nsoil of America's oldest allies. I echo the cares and concerns of the \nworld that terror is growing. And we must stand united against it. \nTerror does not respect borders or nationalities. Its effects are felt \nin the smallest village and in the world's most recognizable cities.\n  Nearly 500 innocent people were killed or injured in Paris this \nweekend, only 10 months after the extremists attacked the Charlie Hebdo \noffices, murdering 17. Last week, 43 people were killed and 239 were \ninjured by a suicide bomber in Beirut. Mounting evidence shows that \nterrorists were likely involved in the deaths of 224 people aboard a \nRussian jet that went down in Egypt last month. In Israel, our friends \nhave been battling this increased violence for weeks, with no \npredictable end in sight.\n  Each of these events happened in the last 2 months, and there are \ncountless other victims of hate around the world whose loss too often \ngoes unnoticed. Those losses have continuously happened over the past 6 \nto 7 years, and some of them seem to fall on deaf ears and unseeing \neyes.\n  No matter the location, the fact is that too many parents in these \nnations worry if their children will come home safe at night. It is \ntimes like these that defenders of freedom need to remember the common \nthreads that bind us together against the power of evil. France was not \nthe beginning, nor will it be the end.\n  On the heels of this tragedy, ISIS has taken credit and released a \nvideo promising that something ``worse is coming.'' Something worse is \ncoming. We should not neglect that threat.\n  Our own CIA Director said earlier today that he ``anticipates this is \nnot the only operation that ISIL has in the pipeline. The Paris attack \nis not something that was planned in a matter of days.''\n  The President has stated a shared goal that we want to ``degrade and \ndestroy'' ISIS. While that is the goal of all, in the meantime, we are \nobligated to the American people to contain and control these crazed \nattackers.\n  ISIS has expanded to Egypt, Yemen, Afghanistan, and to Pakistan. \nTeenagers from England and Europe have attempted to, or successfully \nsupported, ISIS on the ground. As sickening as these actions are, it is \nmore terrifying to think that those recruits might bring their new \ntraining back home. How long until we see terrorism touching our U.S. \nsoil again?\n  This is not just a threat to the eastern hemisphere. This is a global \nthreat that requires a global response. The U.S. cannot be the only one \ninvolved, but we also cannot fail to act. When America fails to lead, \nthere is too often a vacuum that we have seen filled with the \nnightmares of hateful leaders who disregard innocent lives in their \nquest for power and control.\n  We must be vigilant for the sake of life in America and across the \nworld. We must continue to fight these extremists and stand as a united \nfront against the rising tide of evil.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman from Nevada for \nparticipating in tonight's Special Order.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Young).\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. I want to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor his hard work and leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight, this Hoosier rises in solidarity with our \nFrench brethren.\n  Fourteen years ago, on September 11, when radical terrorists struck \nat the heart of the United States, France stood by us. In one of \nAmerica's darkest hours, when no words seemed to adequately express the \nshock and sadness we felt, it was our French allies who famously evoked \nthe phrase: ``We are all Americans.''\n  Sadly, last Friday evening, on November 13, 2015, France was \nsimilarly subjected to multiple acts of terror in Paris. Now, it is our \nturn to offer our support to the fallen, to their families, and to all \nof France. Today, Mr. Speaker, we Americans stand with the people of \nFrance.\n  Our ties with France date back hundreds of years, to the days of the \nAmerican Revolutionary War. Our shared values, our respect for liberty, \nequality, and democracy, have bound our two great nations through \ncenturies of conflict and peace.\n  So, tonight, on behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I send my sincere \nthoughts and prayers to the Parisians so devastated by this atrocity. \nTogether, we will restore France. Together, we will defend civilization \nagainst barbarianism, and together we can endeavor to eliminate ISIS.\n\n[[Page H8234]]\n\n  In the wake of this sorrow, we must reflect on what led to this \nattack on innocent civilians. And then we must, as we say in the \nMarines, ``adapt, improvise, and overcome.''\n  We must find ways to prevent future attacks from occurring on our \nsoil and the soil of our allies across the Atlantic. This won't be \nwithout risk. Leadership never is. At this critical juncture, I hope \nCongress stands ready to support the administration, to encourage its \ndevelopment of a winning strategy that doesn't purport to merely \ncontain ISIS but instead turns the tide of radicalism in the region and \neradicates this radical brand of terror.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  This is no time for half measures, Mr. Speaker. It will be imperative \nfor the United States to coordinate with France and our other NATO \nallies on a joint strategy to defeat ISIS, to eliminate this evil.\n  This is, of course, no time for political posturing, empty rhetoric \nor gamesmanship. It is a time for unity. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues and working with our Commander in Chief on a war strategy \nthat will annihilate the radical Islamic state, keep the American \npeople safe, and return Syria to its people.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, tonight we stand with our brothers and \nsisters in Israel and France to express our support and our commitment \nto these, our allies overseas.\n  We have witnessed the violence in Israel in recent weeks whipped up \nby the leadership of the Palestinian Authority, knowing now that \nradical Islamic militants are determined to continue their assault on \nthe democracies of the world and western civilization.\n  On Friday, the 13th, the world witnessed an unspeakable tragedy \nbrought about by ISIS. This is a terrorist organization that has \nrepeatedly plagued the Middle East with gruesome beheadings, violent \nkillings, the rape of women, and the enslavement of children.\n  Now they have unleashed a terror rampage on our ally, France, and \nthey promise to bring it to America as well.\n  Our President has called this slaughter ``a setback.'' So now \nCongress must recognize both the gravity and the tragedy of what has \nrecently occurred and respond accordingly.\n  What will it take, I ask, for this administration to admit that we \nare in a life-and-death struggle with radical Islam?\n  Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu once gave this admonition: Know thy \nenemy. The enemy must be identified in order to defeat him.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the recent terrorist \nattacks, and I hope that the United States will stand by them and the \npeople of Israel as well as France during these times.\n  To the people of France: I am very sorry--Je suis vraiment desole.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from New York (Mr. Zeldin).\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise in solidarity with the people \nof France in the aftermath of last Friday's horrific terror attacks in \nParis.\n  I also commend the French for their swift leadership in decisively \nand powerfully taking immediate action. They are delivering justice to \nthose responsible for the cowardly attack on their innocent people.\n  This latest attack wasn't just on France. No. This was an attack on \nall free nations targeted and threatened by the brutal and savage \ntactics of Islamic terrorists who oppose the basic freedoms and \nliberties of the free world.\n  This is not an isolated incident or a final stand. Far from it. It \ncould be France today and the United States tomorrow.\n  I should point out that there is but one mandatory function \nconstitutionally of the Federal Government. That is to provide for our \nnational defense. This is a constitutional duty and a moral imperative \nthat trumps any day of the week the charity of opening our doors to a \nSyrian who will blow himself or herself up on our streets in the name \nof Allah.\n  I say, if an ISIS member wants to meet Allah, that we give them every \nopportunity to do so with a bomb from the air or a round of ammo from \nthe end of a Navy SEAL rifle that you would never want to be on the \nwrong end of if you are the bad guy.\n  The good news is this: It doesn't require an occupation or an \nenduring ground operation. I don't want that. No one wants that. But it \ndoes mean that our entire strategy must evolve quickly and effectively.\n  We may have help from very motivated and a diverse capability of \nFrench, British, German, and now even Russians. We must understand that \nlosing is not an option.\n  What we can't do is put 50 Special Operations Forces on the ground in \nSyria, in the middle of a war zone, and then tell them they are not \nthere on a combat operation. You can't tell that to them, their family, \nthe entire free world. It is just divorced from the reality of what \nthey will face every day on the ground.\n  If you aren't going to send our servicemembers to win, do not send \nthem at all.\n  I would be happy to support a strategy to win if I actually believed \nthe President had one.\n  First and foremost, ID the threat. You cannot defeat a threat that \nyou cannot or will not identify.\n  Next, execute a strategy to win, not just tread water. It is not \nabout getting them jobs. It is about wiping them off the face of the \nEarth. You annihilate the enemy. You don't contain it, especially not \nthis enemy.\n  You eliminate the threat. You don't literally, as a matter of policy, \nescort that threat across our borders.\n  Here at home we must not move forward with the President's plan to \nbring in several tens of thousands of refugees, especially and so \nimportantly, because we cannot identify who the bad ones are.\n  Not one Syrian refugee should be brought into America without knowing \nwith confidence that they do not pose a threat. We must not bury our \nheads in the sand or try to click our heels together to an alternate \nreality.\n  Last week was Veterans Day. We were again reminded of the sacrifices \nthat have been made through generations to protect our way of life. \nLet's honor their memory, treasure American greatness, stand up for \nfreedom, and make sure what happened in Paris on Friday does not happen \non our own home turf tomorrow.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. That was excellent. Thank you, Mr. \nZeldin.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to offer my deepest sympathies and \ncondolences from the citizens of Ohio's Ninth Congressional District to \nthe people of France, our longstanding brothers and sisters in liberty. \nTo all whose loved ones were killed or hurt in the barbaric attacks in \nParis last weekend, we offer our prayers of comfort and consolation.\n  Our sincerest thanks are extended to the law enforcement officials \nwho bravely brought order, the health officials who ministered to those \nwho tragically lost their lives, and to the hundreds suffering injury.\n  Around the world, freedom-loving people are repeating the words of La \nMarseillaise, the national anthem of France. This powerful song of \nliberty against tyranny roused that nation when it was written at the \nstart of the French Revolution, just a few years after America's own \nfight for liberty.\n  One verse seems especially appropriate to recite tonight. Translated \ninto English, it says: Sacred love of the Fatherland: Liberty, \ncherished liberty, fight with thy defenders. Fight with thy defenders.\n  This is a message for the world today. America is fighting alongside \nthose who defend liberty. Surely, France.\n  We stand with those who fight for liberty--Combats avec tes \ndefenseurs.\n  The American people have long cherished and defended the spirit of \nliberty alongside the people of France, and there is no greater symbol \nof that in our harbor, New York Harbor, than the Statue of Liberty, \nwhich reminds us always of the triumph of freedom over subjugated \npeople.\n  In modern times, France has been a founding member of NATO and a \npermanent member of the United Nations\n\n[[Page H8235]]\n\nSecurity Council, and we will work together to defeat this enemy as we \nhave together defeated Nazism, communism, and now, as well, this new \nthreat.\n  We will have the finest intelligence assets that our nations have \nplaced on the ground in countries around the world.\n  We have used our intelligence assets here at home to keep out and \nprevent those who would harm our people from coming inside our borders. \nWe always worry. We keep trying to make the security even better. But \nwe have come a long way since 9/11.\n  Each American can play an important role by reporting suspect \nbehavior they observe, and you can help our law enforcement officials \nferret out dangerous elements that could prey upon our own people.\n  On the home front, every citizen can help by paying attention to what \nyou see and, if suspicious, report it to your local law enforcement \nofficials and, in an emergency, to 911.\n  Also important is strengthening the bonds of community, at home, at \nwork, at school. Build bridges in your own community, including \nreligious confessions. Let's build bridges across religious confessions \nin this country. Let no denomination feel isolated or abandoned at this \ntense time.\n  We stand with the people of France. We feel their loss. We stand with \nyou as partners in liberty and forever keep in our hearts the enduring \ncall: Liberty, equality, and fraternity--liberte, egalite, fraternite.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New York mentioned a minute ago about \nour constitutional obligation and the moral imperatives that we have to \ndefend our homeland and our national defense, and I couldn't agree with \nhim more.\n  In that spirit, I want to start to conclude my comments by saying \nsomething I think most agree with, and that is we need to enhance our \nintelligence and our vetting process of those who come to our country, \nincluding potential Syrian refugees, to reflect the seriousness of \nthreats posed by ISIS.\n  I want to go into a little bit of information that is easy to come by \nif you have paid attention to this issue, as I have, and the reality of \nthe situation on the ground in Syria.\n  As a result of over 4 years of Syrian civil war, we are seeing the \nworst humanitarian crisis since World War II, and we can and we will, \nas America, continue to be a leader in the provision of aid and relief. \nBut we can't afford to put the cart before the horse when it comes to \nadmission policies here.\n  This year alone over half a million Syrian people are seeking refuge \nin Europe, and our European allies are looking to us for assistance. \nHowever, it is gravely concerning, I think, when your FBI Director, in \nthis case, James Comey, said earlier this year that our government is \nunable to conduct thorough background checks on the 10,000 Syrian \nrefugees that the administration will allow in the United States. His \nquote: We have no record of them, and you can only query what you have \ncollected.\n  Mr. Speaker, the concerns and objections that I am raising aren't \njust mine. They are the multitude of phone calls and e-mails that my \noffice has received today and I suspect all Members have received \ntoday.\n  It is not isolationist. It is not anti-humanitarian. It is common \nsense, and it is in the name of making sure that we are protecting our \npeople and securing our homeland from threats.\n  It is not unreasonable to conduct due diligence on who is coming into \nour country, and we can't move forward with a policy of admit first and \nask later. We have to close the gaps in our screening process of \nrefugees entering into our country.\n  The Homeland Security Committee chairman, Mr. McCaul, recently \nintroduced legislation H.R. 3573, the Refugee Resettlement Oversight \nand Security Act. It would make substantial improvements to our refugee \nprogram and enhance congressional oversight of the administration's \nrefugee proposals.\n  Many don't know that Congress right now does not have much, if any, \nsay over our refugee admission policy. This bill is intended to change \nthat. It would require, amongst other things, GAO to review the \nsecurity gaps in the current screening process.\n  The President, as I mentioned, has proposed resettling at least \n10,000 Syrian refugees currently residing outside the Syria conflict \nzone in refugee camps to the U.S. this fiscal year.\n  I quote from correspondence I had the opportunity to review today \nthat Chairman McCaul wrote to the President: ``We remain concerned that \nthese resettlements are taking place without appropriate regard for the \nsafety of the American people.''\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  Nothing is more fundamental. Nothing gets at the core of what our \nConstitution is intended to protect as that statement.\n  In his correspondence, Mr. Speaker, he cites to a couple pieces of \ntestimony that he received this past summer from various officials. \nLeaders from the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security have all said to our Homeland Security \nCommittee that they lack the on-the-ground intelligence necessary to \nthoroughly vet Syrian refugees who seek to resettle here.\n  National Counterterrorism Center Director Nicholas Rasmussen \ntestified on October 21 that you have to rely on a vet. When you are \nvetting an applicant's information, his opinion is this: ``It isn't \nwhat we'd like it to be.''\n  FBI Director Comey explained during that same hearing: ``If someone \nhas not made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get \ntheir identity or their interests reflected in our database, we can \nquery our database until the cows come home, but nothing will show up \nbecause we have no record of that person. You can only query what you \nhave collected.''\n  I mentioned a piece of that statement a little earlier. That is the \nfull statement. And it gets to the point that, as we are concerned \nabout our security and we are trusting the administration to properly \nvet those who seek to come here, we have to rely on intelligence, and \nour intelligence leaders are offering something less than full \nconfidence that their intelligence on those Syrian refugees is \nsomething that we need to look a lot further at. That is what I think \nwe need to do.\n  Finally, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Johnson said: ``It \nis true that we are not going to know a whole lot about the Syrians \nthat come forth in this process.''\n  Now, I know tomorrow at 5:30, I believe, we will have a confidential \nbriefing from the FBI Director and our Director on Homeland Security.\n  Mr. Speaker, my point here this evening was just to raise some issues \nthat, frankly, were on the front of my mind and many others in my \ndistrict and many other Members of Congress even before the tragedy \nthat happened in Paris on Friday. What happened on Friday only \nreinforces in me and many others that ISIS isn't contained, and, in \nfact, a strategy of containment is actually a dangerous one; and \nfurther, as we are looking at the Syrian readmission policy, it cannot \nbe allowed to remain as it presently is. Be it through legislation or \nbe it through this administration's providing us more detail and \nallowing Congress and the American people to get a better understanding \nof what is and isn't happening I think would go a long way towards \nmaking us feel a lot safer. In fact, if reforms need to be made, if the \nprogram needs to be halted at the present time, then that is what \nshould be done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for participating in the \nSpecial Order this evening.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8235-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. DeFazio (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today through November \n19 on account of medical leave, recovering from eye surgery.\n  Mrs. Lawrence (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nofficial business in district.\n  Mr. Ruppersberger (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today through \nNovember 19 on account of medical reason.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/16/house-section/article/H8235-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8235-H8236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE BILLS REFERRED\n\n  Bills of the Senate of the following titles were taken from the \nSpeaker's\n\n[[Page H8236]]\n\ntable and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 1004.
