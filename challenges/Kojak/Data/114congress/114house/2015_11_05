Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndeclaring the Christians and Yazidis of Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, Iran, \nEgypt, and Libya as targets of genocide. This bill will make them \neligible for expedited refugee and visa processing for entry into the \nUnited States and give them priority over other applicants.\n  The Save the Christians from Genocide Act is imperative at this time. \nThe alarm bell is ringing. Ancient longstanding communities of \nChristians in the Middle East are being murdered individually and en \nmasse, targeted for extinction. Under President Obama's leadership, our \ngovernment has stood by impotently and watched this crime against \nhumanity.\n  I call on my colleagues and Members of this House to join me in \ncosponsoring this bill to save the Christians from genocide. Hundreds \nof thousands of Muslims are finding safety and economic handouts in \nEurope, but what about the true targets of genocide? Where is their \nsafe haven?\n  I ask my colleagues to join me to support the Save the Christians \nfrom Genocide Act to prioritize our immigration and refugee policy to \nsave these Christians from facing brutal extinction.\n  I rise now and will ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nbill. I, at this moment, will submit it to Congress for consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H7745-7", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7745-H7746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ROYALS 2015 WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  (Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be here this morning.\n  On Sunday, November 1, the Kansas City Royals took game five of the \nWorld Series from a very good New York Mets team. They beat them in the \n12th inning, and they bring the Commissioner's Trophy back to Kansas \nCity for the first time in 30 years.\n  The Royals' championship season had the best record in the American \nLeague: 95 wins, defeated the Astros in five games, defeated the Blue \nJays in six, and defeated the Mets in the World Series in five games. \nThese unheralded comeback kids scored 51 runs in the seventh inning or \nafter in the postseason, shattering the previous record by 15 runs.\n  It was made clear on Tuesday that this championship was not only \nabout the Royals, but about their loyal fan\n\n[[Page H7746]]\n\nbase. Mr. Speaker, 800,000 people turned out for the celebration. Every \nschool within 100 miles was closed.\n  The 2015 Royals team epitomizes what it means to play like a team. \nOur players never gave up. They have respect for themselves and the \ngame, and they treat each other like family.\n  I want to congratulate my team, the Kansas City Royals, and express \nsympathy for the losers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H7746-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SALVAGE TIMBER BURN\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, California and the West continue to be \nravaged by wildfires each summer and fall, which is especially \ndevastating to our forests in a time of record drought. Much is done on \nsuppressing fires as they happen, to the tune of hundreds of millions \nof dollars of sometimes unplanned emergency funds, as well as hundreds \nof millions in loss of the people's assets: the forestland and trees \nare in that inventory and, with it, the habitat, all of value not \nfrequently accounted for on public lands.\n  What I am immediately frustrated by is the lack of mobilization after \na fire for the important salvage work needed on public land and how \nimportant it is that it be timely. Large trees after a fire, many of \nthem can be salvaged within a year, and their value, sold to help \nrecover costs for needed reforestation.\n  This is important for many reasons, such as: habitat; the renewal of \nthe forest; and the critical prevention of massive erosion into our \nstreams, rivers, lakes, and other waterways after a fire, which \nreplantings help mitigate. Indeed, with the EPA's waters of the United \nStates emphasis, they should be looking at their own timely treatment \nof their own jurisdictional public lands first.\n  We need timely issuance now of the permitting that the Forest Service \nand the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are holding in their hands for \neven modest work still pending on 2014 fires. I urge these permitting \nentities to expedite the paperwork now to salvage what we can of 2014 \ntimber burn that has little time left to salvage at a value that will \nhelp taxpayers, instead of cost them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H7746-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT MERCED\n\n  (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart to convey my \nthoughts, prayers, and support for the students, the faculty, and the \nstaff of the University of California at Merced in my district, one of \nthe rising stars and the newest university in the University of \nCalifornia system. It is 11 years old, with 6,700 students.\n  Yesterday was a very sad and unfortunate day. An incident occurred \nwhere four individuals were stabbed by a student on campus. The good \nnews is that I am told that they will all recover, but it was a tragic \nact of violence. The campus was shut down.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and all \nthose who are part of the University of California campus at Merced, a \nwonderful community that I am honored to represent.\n  I am touched, but not surprised, by the courage and the bravery that \nthe students have shown during this difficult time. I am also not \nsurprised by the amount of community support that has come together \nover the last 24 hours.\n  The university community that Chancellor Dorothy Leland and the \nfaculty have built is a tremendous support within the Merced campus. It \nis very special, and I know everybody is reaching out to support \neveryone at this difficult time.\n  Again, my prayers and thoughts are with the victims and their \nfamilies, the faculty, the students, and the administration. We, today, \nare all University of California Merced Bobcats.\n  Stay strong and courageous. We are all with you.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Staff \nSergeant Ryan Hammond of Moundsville, West Virginia. Staff Sergeant \nHammond was one of six airmen killed last month when their C-130 \ncrashed at Jalalabad.\n  A native of Moundsville, Staff Sergeant Hammond joined the Air Force \nafter graduating from John Marshall High School in Glen Dale.\n  On Tuesday, I joined with Ryan's family and friends to honor his \nlife, service, and sacrifice at Arlington National Cemetery. The burial \nservice was a reminder that the expense of individual freedom is steep, \nrow after row of white headstones with names of Americans who gave \ntheir ultimate sacrifice.\n  Dozens of his fellow squadron members paid tribute to Staff Sergeant \nHammond during the ceremony. As they filed past, they laid their wings \nupon his coffin, a final salute to a young airman who followed his \ndream of flying. There was not a dry eye at the grave site.\n  Thomas Paine said, 200 years ago:\n\n       Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom, must \n     undergo the fatigue of supporting it.\n\n  I offer my condolences to Staff Sergeant Hammond's family; his wife, \nHolly; his parents, David and Cathy; and his friends.\n  Staff Sergeant Hammond will be missed, but his sacrifices will never \nbe forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H7746-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REVIVE THE SALTON SEA\n\n  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, today we are leading the way at the Red Hill \nBay to revive the Salton Sea. The Salton Sea is the largest body of \nwater in and poses the largest public health and economic threat to \nCalifornia.\n  As the sea recedes, windblown dust containing arsenic and pesticides \ncan cause respiratory distress in kids and seniors in the surrounding \ncommunities. The noxious odors may reduce home values and harm our \ntourism industry, costing billions of dollars. For too long, there has \nbeen study after study but no concrete action.\n  Today, at the Salton Sea's Red Hill Bay, we break ground on the first \nlarge-scale project to help prevent dust exposure and promote renewable \nenergy development.\n  Imagine a Salton Sea that hosts the largest renewable energy \nindustrial park in the Nation, creating jobs in southern California, \nwhile preserving wildlife habitat and preventing the noxious dust our \nchildren may breathe. Imagine a Salton Sea that, once again, attracts \ntourists from throughout the globe.\n  This is my vision for the Salton Sea, and today we took the first \nstep to making this vision a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H7746-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7746-H7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GOFFSTOWN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute the Goffstown Grizzlies \nfootball team, a high school with just 1,000 students who have an \namazing story of perseverance and achievement.\n  Thanks to great coaching and hard work, the team qualified for a \ndivision 3 championship a few years ago and has since advanced to \ndivision 1, the toughest in the Granite State. Even their fans thought \ncompeting at this level would be a tall order.\n  The Grizzlies are undefeated this season. They entered Saturday's \nplayoff game ranked number one; and they got there with exciting \ndefense and special teams blocking punts and returning kickoffs for \ntouchdowns.\n  The Grizzlies have the Granite State's fiercest linebacking crew and \na sack leader. Their kicker boots 45-yard field goals, helping his team \nto average more than 42 points a game. The running back rushed for over \n1,000 yards this season and scored over 20 touchdowns. They have New \nHampshire's most potent passing attack and incredible local support.\n  Their spirited fans make it easy to like the Grizzlies, who take on \nthe Second District's North Nashua Titans this weekend.\n\n[[Page H7747]]\n\n  I wish both teams well but the Grizzlies just a little bit better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H7747-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRUMP'S SNL APPEARANCE\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nencourage Saturday Night Live to disinvite Donald Trump from hosting \ntheir show this weekend.\n  Many may believe that Mr. Trump is just causing controversy so that \nhe can get media attention, but his divisive and racist rhetoric has \nvery troubling and real-world consequences.\n  Many businesses and individuals have severed ties with Mr. Trump. \nEven SNL's owner, NBC Universal, stated that, ``At NBC, respect and \ndignity for all people are cornerstones of our values,'' and they ended \ntheir relationship with Mr. Trump.\n  Perhaps this blunder happened because currently there is no Latino \ncast member on SNL, and there have only been two in the entire history \nof SNL.\n  I hope Saturday Night Live's producers, writers, and cast members \nwill consider how Donald Trump hosting SNL will compromise the \nintegrity of their show. Having Mr. Trump degrades the quality of SNL's \nhumor because racism isn't funny. It is lazy, and it is cheap.\n  Comedy has the power to highlight hypocrisy in society and reveal \nimportant social truths and political commentary. SNL has achieved that \nin the past, and I hope it returns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H7747-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0915\n                     HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY TO TSCPA\n\n  (Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Texas \nSociety of CPAs on their 100th birthday. As a lifetime member of the \nTSCPA and a past chairman of the Texas State Board of Public \nAccountancy, the TSCPA holds a special place in my heart.\n  While not in plain view and often not recognized, CPAs are a special \npart of our communities. They do important oversight and regulation \nwork that is integral to the functioning of our society. Bottom line, \nCPAs are essential for facilitating a thriving commercial system.\n  Some important TSCPA initiatives include financial literacy education \nand financial preparation in the event of a disaster. Both of these \noutreach programs are designed to help the general public improve their \nlives. Simply put, TSCPA is teaching people how to fish. In a complex \nworld, these financial skills will benefit them and their children for \nthe rest of their lives.\n  For 100 years, the TSCPA has been growing the profession, maintaining \nthe profession's integrity, molding leaders, and helping others. Its \ngrowth is in the evidence of its success. Since its founding in 1915, \nthe TSCPA has grown to 20 chapters and a membership of nearly 28,000 \nCPAs.\n  I am a proud member of the profession. I am proud to be a CPA, I am \nproud of my fellow CPAs, and I am proud of the TSCPA. I wish them happy \nbirthday on their 100th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H7747-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOVEMBER IS MEN'S HEALTH MONTH\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in our national conversation on \nhealth and health disparities, we often forget that men face some \nunique health and health access challenges. So I rise today on behalf \nof men around the world to recognize November as Men's Health Month and \nto raise awareness for men's health issues.\n  Today American men face a mortality rate 41 percent higher than \nwomen. Life expectancy for men is 76 years compared to 81 for women. \nAmerican men face a higher mortality rate than women for 8 of the 10 \nleading causes of death, including cancer, liver disease, and heart \ndisease. Additionally, men are at increased risk of mental health \nproblems and 4.1 times more likely to commit suicide than women.\n  These are serious issues facing men around the world. Every November \nmen around the world grow out their mustaches to raise awareness for \nthese and other issues facing men. While I won't be able to join my \ncolleagues in growing facial hair to raise awareness, I will be working \nbehind the scenes to spread the word. In the meantime, I urge my \ncolleagues to become educated about men's health and to stay healthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H7747-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren).

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNITED STATES MARINE \n                   CORPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As senior United States statesman Dr. Henry Kissinger \n     wrote in testimony submitted to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate on January 29, 2015, ``The United \n     States has not faced a more diverse and complex array of \n     crises since the end of the Second World War.''.\n       (2) The rise of non-state forces and near peer competitors \n     has introduced destabilizing pressures around the globe.\n       (3) Advances in information and weapons technology have \n     reduced the time available for the United States to prepare \n     for and respond to crises against both known and unknown \n     threats.\n       (4) The importance of the maritime domain cannot be \n     overstated. As acknowledged in the March 2015 Navy, Marine \n     Corps, and Coast Guard maritime strategy, ``A Cooperative \n     Strategy for 21st Century Seapower: Forward, Engaged, \n     Ready'': ``Oceans are the lifeblood of the interconnected \n     global community. . . 90 percent of trade by volume travels \n     across the oceans. Approximately 70 percent of the world's \n     population lives within 100 miles of the coastline.''.\n       (5) The United States must be prepared to rapidly respond \n     to crises around the world regardless of the nation's fiscal \n     health.\n       (6) In this global security environment, it is critical \n     that the nation possess a maritime force whose mission and \n     ethos is readiness--a fight tonight force, forward deployed, \n     that can respond immediately to emergent crises across the \n     full range of military operations around the globe either \n     from the sea or home station.\n       (7) The need for such a force was recognized by the 82nd \n     Congress during the Korean War, when it mandated a core \n     mission for the nation's leanest force--the Marine Corps--to \n     be most ready when the nation is least ready.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Marine Corps, within the Department of the Navy, \n     remain the Nation's expeditionary, crisis response force;\n       (2) the need for such a force with such a capability has \n     never been greater; and\n       (3) accordingly, in recognition of this need and the wisdom \n     of the 82nd Congress, the 114th Congress reaffirms section \n     5063 of title 10, United States Code, which states that the \n     Marine Corps--\n       (A) shall--\n       (i) be organized to include not less than three combat \n     divisions and three air wings, and such other land combat, \n     aviation, and other services as may be organic therein;\n\n[[Page H7817]]\n\n       (ii) be organized, trained, and equipped to provide fleet \n     marine forces of combined arms, together with supporting air \n     components, for service with the fleet in the seizure or \n     defense of advanced naval bases and for the conduct of such \n     land operations as may be essential to the prosecution of a \n     naval campaign; and\n       (iii) provide detachments and organizations for service on \n     armed vessels of the Navy, provide security detachments for \n     the protection of naval property at naval stations and bases, \n     and perform such other duties as the President may direct;\n     but these additional duties may not detract from nor \n     interfere with the operations for which the Marine Corps is \n     primarily organized;\n       (B) shall develop, in coordination with the Army and the \n     Air Force, those phases of amphibious operations that pertain \n     to the tactics, techniques, and equipment used by landing \n     forces; and\n       (C) is responsible, in accordance with the integrated joint \n     mobilization plans, for the expansion of peacetime components \n     of the Marine Corps to meet the needs of war.\n\n                      TITLE X--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                     Subtitle A--Financial Matters\n\nSec. 1001.

Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Huffman moves that the managers on the part of the \n     House at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two \n     Houses on the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the \n     bill H.R. 22 be instructed to--\n       (1) agree to the provisions of the Senate amendment that \n     establish the total amount of funding to be provided for each \n     of fiscal years 2016 through 2021 out of the Highway Trust \n     Fund for surface transportation programs; and\n       (2) insist on section 1414(b) of the House amendment \n     (relating to adjustments to contract authority).\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XXII, the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Huffman) and the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Shuster) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Since 2009, this Congress has failed to make some hard choices. As a \nresult, highway, transit, and safety programs have limped along with \nflat funding. States and transit authorities have been unable to plan \nmajor, long-term projects as they watch this Congress extend these \nprograms for a few months at a time, often waiting until midnight of \nthe next government shutdown, and then extend them again with short-\nterm patches.\n  The Federal gas tax, which pays for these highway and public transit \ninvestments, has not been raised in 22 years. Its purchasing power has \nfallen 40 percent.\n  And for all the progress we made last week under Speaker Ryan in \nterms of allowing policy amendments to be offered to the bill, let us \nall recognize that the Republican leadership blocked every single \nproposed amendment regarding the funding inadequacies in this bill.\n  Democrats and Republicans offered a wealth of options to fund the \nprogram: increasing the gas tax; using repatriated revenue to increase \ninvestment in the United States; creating a bipartisan, bicameral task \nforce to address the shortfall in the highway trust fund; and simply \nindexing the gas tax to account for the cost of inflation.\n  Regrettably, the Republican leadership, despite all the pledges of \nopenness, would not let this House debate even a single proposal to \naddress the shortfall in the highway trust fund.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can do better.\n  Today, I offer a motion to instruct conferees that recognizes that we \nare woefully underinvesting in our Nation's infrastructure. This motion \ninstructs conferees to adopt the higher funding levels for highway, \ntransit and highway safety programs that are contained in the \nbipartisan Senate DRIVE Act. The DRIVE Act provides $342 billion over 6 \nyears. That is $17 billion more than the House bill.\n  The DRIVE Act provides $12 billion more than the House bill over 6 \nyears to reconstruct our highways and rebuild our crumbling bridges. \nThis small increase only begins to deal with the 147,000 structurally \ndeficient or functionally obsolete bridges in our country. That is, by \nthe way, one out of every four bridges.\n  This funding will only begin to address the two-thirds of the \nNation's roads that are in less than good condition.\n  The DRIVE Act provides $4.4 billion over 6 years for local transit \nagencies to help more people move safely to their jobs. This small \nincrease will only begin to address the $86 billion state of good \nrepair backlog that exists nationwide for our local transit agencies.\n  In 2013, Americans took 10.7 billion public transit trips. Mr. \nSpeaker, many of these were on systems that were built a century ago.\n  Congestion is a ballooning problem around our country. It affects 42 \npercent of America's major roads and costs our economy $121 billion a \nyear. The status quo funding in the House bill will only worsen the \ncongestion in our cities and suburbs.\n  This motion also instructs conferees to include section 1414(b) of \nthe House bill in a final conference report. This section provides a \nmechanism to automatically adjust investment levels, should additional \nmoney come into the trust fund during the 6-year term of this bill.\n  Additional receipts could come into the trust fund from a number of \nplaces. There could be higher-than-anticipated vehicle miles traveled. \nThere could be a bigger infusion into the trust fund from a subsequent \nact of Congress.\n  If actual receipts do come into the trust fund exceeding the \nestimated receipts for the most recently completed year, program levels \nwould automatically be adjusted by the additional amount at the \nbeginning of the next fiscal year. This ensures that any additional \nfunds that Congress makes available can quickly flow to States to \ninvest in badly needed infrastructure projects.\n  The Secretary would distribute this additional funding \nproportionately to each of the highway transit and safety programs \nfunded in the highway trust fund authorized in the final conference \nreport.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to instruct. The STRR \nAct act is a bipartisan bill that reflects the input of Members from \nboth sides of the aisle. It has been a carefully crafted compromise. \nThis motion would threaten that compromise and dismantle the bipartisan \nHouse position as we head into negotiations with the Senate.\n  The STRR Act is a multiyear bill that provides needed certainty for \nStates and local governments. It helps improve our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure and maintains a strong commitment to \nsafety, but it also provides important reforms that help us continue to \ndo the job more effectively.\n  Key provisions in this bill will refocus our transportation programs \non national priorities, promote innovation to make our surface \ntransportation system programs work better, provide greater flexibility \nfor State and local governments to address their needs, streamline the \nFederal bureaucracy, accelerate the project approval process, and \nfacilitate the flow of freight and commerce.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  The STRR Act continues the Federal role in providing a strong \nnational transportation system, which enables our country to remain \neconomically competitive and helps ensure our quality of life.\n  This bill has widespread support. We have received nearly 300 letters \nof support from throughout the stakeholder community, so I would urge \nall Members to oppose the gentleman's motion.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nthe District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), who is our ranking member on the \nSubcommittee for Highways and Transit.\n  Ms. NORTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  We will, of course, continue to press for the DRIVE Act funding, the \nsmall amount of increased funding in conference. But I do want to thank \nChairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, Subcommittee Chair Graves, \nand all of the Members and staff who contributed to the Surface \nTransportation Reauthorization and Reform Act that has brought us to \nthis point.\n  Of course, many of us wanted to invest even more in desperately \nneeded transportation and infrastructure projects. However, we simply \ncan't wait any longer to address the crumbling roads, bridges, and \ntransit systems that Americans depend on every day.\n  While we will continue to press Congress to make more funding \navailable in future years, I support moving this bill to conference as \na means of providing necessary funding and certainty to our States and \nlocal partners for the next 6 years.\n  While this is not a perfect bill--it is a most imperfect bill--it is \nencouraging that we were able to get together\n\n[[Page H8135]]\n\non both sides of the aisle to come together as a model for how we \nshould proceed in the future.\n  Passage is necessary to shore up the highway trust fund and allow \ncritical projects to move forward around the country. Now, as we move \nto conference, I will continue to work with Ranking Member DeFazio and \nour Republican counterparts to see this bill across the finish line.\n  Our work to ensure robust funding for our roads, bridges, and transit \nsystems is just beginning. This bill is a good bridge to the future, \nbut we must work diligently to identify and secure additional sources \nof revenue in coming years.\n  This motion is a first step on the path to higher investment levels. \nI look forward to working with the Senate to produce a comprehensive \nbill for the President to sign.\n  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, I want to thank all the Members that have worked on this bill. \nI know that the two Members on the floor here are valued members of the \ncommittee.\n  Again, I oppose the instruction because I believe it really--we have \ngot a delicate balance here; and a strong position moving into the \nSenate to get this over the goal line and get ourselves a long-term, \nmultiyear highway transportation bill is just something that I think we \nall want. It is all good for the country.\n  The gentleman brings up some good points on the funding of it. As \nsoon as we get this bill passed, on the President's desk and signed, we \nhave really got to sit down with the stakeholder community and Members \non both sides of the aisle, both sides of the Capitol, people around \nthe States, and figure out a way to move forward in the future to have \na fully funded, robust transportation highway trust fund.\n  So again, I appreciate what the gentleman is saying, but, again, at \nthis point, I urge opposition to this motion to instruct.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to instruct.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my friend William C. \nWaggoner, a legendary union leader and a tireless advocate for the \nhardworking men and women who have built this country.\n  Mr. Waggoner first joined the Operating Engineers in 1951, and he \nrose through the ranks to occupy the highest office in the local union, \nbusiness manager, which is the position he held for 40 years. While \nthere, he established the cutting-edge Crane Operators Training \nprogram, which became the model nationwide.\n  Mr. Waggoner is known as a fighter for workers and their families. He \nbelieves in fairness above all and has consistently pushed for safety \nin the workplace, for fair wages and benefits, and for the right to \ncollectively bargain.\n  Away from the union hall, he remains devoted to his wife, Patty, and \nhis family, and he is committed to his community of Long Beach, \nCalifornia. Many Little League Baseball players and children with \nspecial needs have greatly benefited from his generosity.\n  I humbly thank him for his tireless service, congratulate him on a \ncareer well spent, and wish him the best in retirement.\n  Now, don't be a stranger, Wag. You are welcome anytime in Las Vegas--\na proud union town.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for one \nminute, and to revise and extend my remarks.\n  I rise to honor my friend, William C. Waggoner, a legendary union \nleader and tireless advocate for the hard working men and women who \nbuilt this country.\n  Bill first joined the International Union of Operating Engineers in \n1951 and immediately rose through the ranks, starting as a bulldozer \noperator before becoming a Foreman, Steward, Advisory Board Member, \nBusiness Representative, and District Representative for Southern \nNevada and Orange County. In 1970 he was elected as President of IUOE \nLocal 12, and in 1976 he was named to the highest office in the local \nunion, Business Manager, a position he held for 40 years.\n  As Business Manager, Mr. Waggoner served as Trustee for Local 12's \nPension, Health & Welfare, Vacation-Holiday, and Apprenticeship Trusts, \nand established state-of-the-art training centers, including the \ncutting-edge Crane Operators Training Program, which has become the \nmodel for all crane training in the nation.\n  In addition to his work with IUOP Local 12, Bill served as a Vice \nPresident of the California Federation of Labor, General Vice President \nof the International Operating Engineers, and President of the Western \nConference of Operating Engineers.\n  Bill is known far and wide as a fighter for workers and their \nfamilies. He believes in fairness above all. As his adversaries will \ntell you, he is an outstanding negotiator, always keeping the concerns \nand rights of his members at the forefront. He has consistently pushed \nfor safety in the workplace, fair wages and benefits, and the right to \ncollectively bargain.\n  Away from the union hall, Bill remains devoted to his wife Patty and \nhis family and committed to his local community of Long Beach, \nCalifornia. Many Little League Baseball players and children with \nspecial needs have greatly benefited from his generosity. His awards \nare too numerous to mention but I know he is especially proud of being \nnamed ``Man of the Year'' by the Kern-Inyo Mono Counties Building \nTrades Council.\n  Jack Henning, retired Secretary Treasurer of the California Labor \nFederation, said Bill ``represents the finest traditions of the \nAmerican Labor Movement.'' I could not agree more. He has been there \nfor me throughout my political career and for the working families I \nproudly represent.\n  I humbly thank him for his tireless service; congratulate him on a \ncareer well spent; and wish him the best in his retirement. Don't be a \nstranger, Wag. You're always welcome in Las Vegas, a strong union town.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8137-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE VA\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, on November 11, Veterans Day, we will honor \nand remember the efforts of those who serve our country. We owe it to \nour veterans to keep the promises made to them when they first joined \nthe military.\n  Despite bipartisan action in Congress to increase efficiency and care \nat the VA, we are still suffering from a lack of transparency that \nmakes it very difficult to determine what actions still need to be \ntaken to ensure quality, timely care for our veterans. Now we have \nlearned that there are over 140 investigations by the inspector general \nthat were hidden. These investigations were shelved; they were not made \navailable to the public or to Congress.\n  That is why I am supporting bipartisan legislation, the Veterans Care \nand Reporting Enforcement Act, which will require reports from the \ninvestigations by the inspector general to be made public, to be made \navailable to Congress.\n  I want to thank my Minnesota colleagues, Congressmen Tom Emmer and \nTim Walz, for bringing this legislation forward. It will go a long way \ntoward making the VA more accountable so that our veterans get the care \nthat they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8137-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8137-H8138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FAIR RATES ACT\n\n  (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, last year, when an energy capacity auction \nincreased certain rates in my region from $1 billion to $3 billion, I \nasked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a close look at \nthose prices and determine whether they were set fairly for consumers.\n  During the review, FERC had only four sitting Commissioners and \ndeadlocked at 2-2. That meant that rates went into effect ``by \noperation of law,'' and consumers were left with no avenue to appeal.\n  To me, that is unacceptable; so I introduced the Fair RATES Act to \nensure that ratepayers are guaranteed an opportunity to have their \nvoices heard.\n  Unfortunately, last week, Commissioner Philip Moeller stepped down--\nagain, leaving FERC with just four Commissioners. Without a \nconfirmation or even a nomination for a fifth Commissioner in sight, we \nfind ourselves in the same situation. FERC is, once again, reviewing \nrising rates in my region and, once again, is at risk of a deadlock \nthat would leave consumers holding the bag.\n  That is why we must pass Fair RATES today. Since last year's auction, \nour rates have jumped another billion dollars, and $3 billion is too \nsteep an increase for my constituents to pay just because Congress will \nnot act.\n\n[[Page H8138]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8138-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n             PASSING THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to commend my \ncolleagues in the House for passing a second National Defense \nAuthorization Act, or the NDAA.\n  The President's decision to veto Congress' first NDAA was nothing \nmore than a cheap, political ploy, and it marked the first time a \nPresident vetoed the NDAA for nonpolicy reasons.\n  Today's NDAA authorizes funding to expand Fort Gordon to accommodate \nfuture growth, and it authorizes defense projects at the Savannah River \nSite, including the MOX program.\n  Cybersecurity is critical to the future of international warfare, and \nits future home in the Army is in Augusta, Georgia, at Fort Gordon. \nThis legislation responsibly prepares Fort Gordon to house the Army \nCyber Command and to protect our Nation from cyber threats in the \ncoming years. I was happy to work with many members of the Armed \nServices Committee to maintain the authorization for these important \nprograms.\n  Despite the President's unwarranted veto, we again fulfilled our duty \nto support our troops and their families, who sacrifice so much to \nprotect our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8138-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRESS MUST ACT TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. DEUTCH.

Not only can't we have the debate, but, since \n1996, there has been a prohibition on even having a study about the \neffects of gun violence in our communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to stop putting our heads in the sand. \nCongress must act.

Mr. Speaker, next Wednesday, we will \nobserve Veterans Day, which is dedicated to the brave men and women who \nhave served in our Armed Forces.\n  I believe one of the most important things we can do is to instill \nrespect and honor among our Nation's young people for our servicemen \nand -women. As a part of the Veterans Day activities, the elementary \nschool students in my hometown of Howard will learn about the \ncontributions made by our veterans both in harm's way and here at home.\n  While educating our young people is important, it is also essential \nto make sure our veterans have the services and the support that they \nneed. This weekend, I will be speaking with a group that is actively \ninvolved in caring for our wounded vets: the Disabled American Veterans \nchapter, or DAV, in Warren, Pennsylvania. The DAV provides a wide range \nof services, from transporting the veterans to doctors' appointments to \nemphasizing the need for better care, both medically and for behavior \nhealth services.\n  November 11 is Veterans Day, but we need to strive to make sure we \nremember the contributions that these men and women make every day of \nthe year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8138-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VETERANS RECORD RECONSTRUCTION ACT\n\n  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an issue that \ntouches veterans in hundreds of congressional districts across this \nNation.\n  In 1973, a fire at a U.S. Government archives facility destroyed as \nmany as 18 million official military records. This loss has made it \nincredibly difficult for many veterans to prove the details of their \nservice, and it has even prevented some from getting the benefits that \nthey deserve. In the year since the fire, some affected files have been \npainstakingly reconstructed by using unofficial pieces of information, \nincluding postmarked letters and photographs, but this process can be \nconfusing, time consuming, and costly to the veteran.\n  Somehow, in 42 years, no system has been established to assist these \nveterans--whose files were lost by no fault of their own--in \nreassembling their records. We simply must do better. That is why I \nhave introduced the Veterans Record Reconstruction Act: to establish a \nclear set of guidelines for reconstructing a veteran's service record \nwhen it has been damaged or destroyed.\n  As we commemorate Veterans Day this next week, I urge my colleagues \nto support this commonsense, straightforward bill so that every veteran \nhas the opportunity to receive the benefits he or she has earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8138-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      WHITE HOUSE INITIATIVE ON EDUCATION EXCELLENCE FOR HISPANICS\n\n  (Mr. CURBELO of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 25th \nanniversary of the White House Initiative on Education Excellence for \nHispanics and to recognize the bright spots that have been identified \nin Florida's 26th Congressional District.\n  The initiative was established in 1990 to address educational \ndisparities faced by Hispanic students. As part of the 25th anniversary \ncelebration, the initiative released the Bright Spots in Hispanic \nEducation catalog to highlight the ongoing efforts in promoting \neducational achievement. Recognizing these bright spots will encourage \ncollaboration between stakeholders to promote best practices and to \ndevelop effective partnerships.\n  I am proud to recognize two bright spots in the district I represent. \nCongratulations to Florida International University's Mastery Math Lab \nand the STEM Transformation Institute.\n  The Mastery Math Lab is a high-tech, individualized approach to \nimproving student performance in mathematics. The STEM Transformation \nInstitute is a multidisciplinary collaboration to research and develops \neffective approaches to STEM education. Both of these programs have \nmade a substantial impact to the Hispanic community in south Florida.\n  I am also very happy to announce other programs in the 26th District \nthat have made commitments as part of the initiative to support \neducational outcomes for Latinos.

Mr. Speaker, thank you to President Obama for \nworking with us to get a real defense authorization bill and for us to \nbe able to fix the broken defense bill that was passed previously in \nthis House. I was prepared to sustain the veto, but through a very \ninstructive and positive budget resolution that we passed just last \nweek, we have been able to plus up the defense, and we have been able \nto plus up nondiscretionary defense spending.\n\n[[Page H8139]]\n\n  Today, I voted for the defense authorization. Included were \namendments that I offered that were sustained in the conference report \nwhich require the Department of Defense to conduct outreach programs to \nassist the concerns of small businesses that are owned and controlled \nby women, veterans, and socioeconomically disadvantaged minorities.\n  In addition, my amendment, which provides guidance to the Secretary \nof Defense in identifying HBCUs and minority-serving institutions and \nto assist them in developing and enhancing science, technology, \nengineering, and math, was also kept in the bill.\n  Finally, my amendment, which requires the Department of Defense to \nevaluate commercial, off-the-shelf business systems for security, \nresilience, reliability, interoperability, and integration with \nexisting interrelated systems, was also incorporated.\n  So, in protecting the security of the defense mechanisms, in \nproviding opportunities for small businesses, and in working with \nHistorically Black Colleges and minority-serving colleges, this bill is \na good bill.\n  I, again, support the fact that we are moving the defense bill \nforward and that we are protecting not only our veterans, but we are \nprotecting the men and women who serve us in the United States \nmilitary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8139-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ACTION FOR DENTAL HEALTH: DENTISTS MAKING A DIFFERENCE\n\n  (Mr. SIMPSON asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of creating access \nto oral health care and to raise awareness for initiatives that deliver \nimportant dental services to underserved communities.\n  This year, more than 75 million Americans won't visit a dentist, even \nthough nearly half of the people over 30 suffer from some form of gum \ndisease and an estimated 25 percent of children under the age of 5 \nalready have cavities.\n  It is time to take action.\n  That is why the American Dental Association launched Action for \nDental Health: Dentists Making a Difference. This initiative is a \nnationwide, community-based movement that is focused on delivering care \nto people who are already suffering from dental disease, and on \nbringing dental health education and disease prevention into \nunderserved communities.\n  This Sunday, the American Dental Association will transform the \nWalter E. Washington Convention Center into a Mission of Mercy--a 100-\nchair dental clinic--in order to treat 1,000 adults and children who \ndon't receive regular dental care.\n  We can grow support for initiatives like these through H.R. 539, the \nAction for Dental Health Act, which will help dentists and others \nimprove the health of Americans who need it most but without requiring \nany additional tax dollars. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 539.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8139-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1230\n                            TRI-VALLEY YMCA\n\n  (Mr. SWALWELL of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California.

Across the United States, \nhundreds of thousands of apprenticeship programs are helping to prepare \nworkers for today's high-skilled, in-demand jobs.\n  For far too long, there has been a discrepancy in what students are \nlearning in the classroom and what employers say they need in the \nworkplace.\n  Apprenticeships are key to narrowing that skills gap because they \noffer students a low-cost and, in many cases, a no-cost education that \narms them with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in today's \nglobal economy. Apprentices often earn an average starting salary of \n$50,000 and go on to make $300,000 more than their nonapprenticeship \npeers over the course of their career.\n  Employers who invest in these work-based learning programs are \nattracting and retaining highly qualified employees. They are also \nseeing results in the form of increased productivity and greater \ninnovation.\n  Apprenticeships can change lives, and I look forward to seeing how \nthese valuable programs continue to strengthen America's workforce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8139-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             2015 WORLD SERIES CHAMPION, KANSAS CITY ROYALS\n\n  (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YODER.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, ensuring Americans are capable of filling the \nskills gap and finding quality jobs through stakeholder-led and \naccountable workforce development programs has been one of my highest \npriorities in Washington.\n  That is why I was so proud last Congress to see legislation I \nsponsored, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, or WIOA, \nenacted into law. WIOA was the first major workforce development \nlegislation to be enacted in more than 15 years and included many vital \nprovisions to modernize, streamline, and localize our workforce \ndevelopment system.\n  The highway bill that passed the House earlier today included a \nfrontline workforce development program intended to address human \nresources needs in public transportation that was not subject to the \nreforms contained within WIOA.\n  In order to ensure that program is assessed consistently with other \nFederal workforce development programs and targeted to areas that have \nidentified needs in public transportation as part of their broader \nworkforce development programs, I introduced a bipartisan amendment to \nthe highway bill with my colleague from Washington (Ms. DelBene) that \napplied WIOA's performance measures and coordination reforms to the \nprogram.\n  All of our Federal workforce development programs should be assessed \nin a consistent manner and be considered as part of an overall package \ntailored to State and local needs that provide stakeholders on the \nground greater input and control. That is why I am also pleased the \nHouse adopted our bipartisan amendment as part of the broader \ntransportation package and strengthened the frontline workforce \ndevelopment program in order to better serve the workers who learn \nskills through the program and those policymakers who evaluate the \nprograms to improve its future outcomes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8140-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8140-H8145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORKING TOGETHER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) is recognized \nfor the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, everyone has gone back to their offices but \nyou and me, and I appreciate you sticking around to get this hour in. \nIt is not going to be an exciting hour. Ordinarily, I bring down charts \nand graphs and try to share something in a visual way that folks might \nnot have seen before. Today, it is just words, because words matter.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have just finished in this Chamber this fantastic--\nyou have heard me say it--it was a festival of democracy. Every Member \nwho had an amendment, they brought them to the Rules Committee. We made \nover a hundred of them in order. It has been 3 days, Mr. Speaker, and \nwe passed in a very bipartisan way Federal transportation policy for \nthe first time in more than a decade. Democrats had failed to get it \ndone. Republicans had failed to get it done.\n  We, as 435 individual Members representing diverse constituencies \nacross the Nation, came together today and we got it done. They said it \nwouldn't be done. Chairman Bill Shuster said it could be done. Ranking \nMember Pete DeFazio of Oregon said it could be done, and we did it.\n  Something has happened, Mr. Speaker, in this town that has people \nidentifying as Democrats or Republicans first and as Members of this \nbody, of the Article I legislature, second. It is bad. It is bad for \nthe country, and it is bad for the people we represent. It is a bad \nprocess.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is what I want to talk about today. You can't see \nthe chart that I have here, but it is a quote from President Obama--you \nwill remember it--back in August of 2013.\n  You will remember we worked together with the President. Nine \ndifferent times, we repealed portions of the President's healthcare \nbill. We repealed them. They were unworkable. He knew it. We knew it. \nWe came together nine times. He signed legislation into law that \nrepealed parts of the President's healthcare bill.\n  It was the summer of 2013 and we were talking about how to come \ntogether on some of the bigger problems in the President's healthcare \nbill. You remember the mandates were getting ready to go into effect--\nthe business mandates, the individual mandates--and the country wasn't \nready. The country was not ready. We all knew it. Every Member, from \nleft to right, Mr. Speaker, knew it.\n  The President held a press conference and he said this:\n\n       In a normal, political environment, it would have been \n     easier for me to simply call up the Speaker and say: You know \n     what? This is a tweak that doesn't go to the essence of the \n     law. It has to do with, for example, are we able to simplify \n     the attestation of employers to whether they are already \n     providing health insurance or not. It looks like there may be \n     some better ways to do this. Let's make a technical change to \n     the law.\n\n  The President goes on to say, Mr. Speaker:\n\n       That would have been the normal thing that I would prefer \n     to do, but we are not in a normal atmosphere around here when \n     it comes to ObamaCare.\n\n  The President says:\n\n       We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did \n     so.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this was from that very contentious time trying to solve \nproblems for the American people, again, problems the White House knew \nexisted and problems the Congress knew existed.\n  The President says:\n\n       You know what? If it was ordinary times like any time in \n     the past 225 years, I would have called the United States \n     Congress and I would have said: ``Listen, the Constitution \n     gives you Article I powers to legislate, and I need a \n     legislative change made because the law is not working.''\n\n  He didn't, and he said he didn't, and he said he wasn't going to. He \nsaid he was going to go it alone. The disappointment in that decision, \nin this body, was very partisan, Mr. Speaker. It was very partisan.\n  I don't know how we get past the allegiance to the President because \nhe is from our party. Republicans did this when George Bush was in \noffice. Democrats are doing this when President Obama is in office. It \nis not about who the President is. It is about what the President does.\n  What the President does is implement the laws that we pass. He \ndoesn't change the laws. And every time we fail on behalf of our \nconstituents to stand together as 435 Representatives of the people and \ninstead become Representatives of the Republican Party or the \nDemocratic Party, we fail America.\n  Mr. Speaker, what I have here is the chart of the Supreme Court \ndecision in\n\n[[Page H8141]]\n\nthe NLRB v. Noel Canning case. You may remember that one. I had just \ngotten to Congress, Mr. Speaker. I had just gotten to Congress.\n  The President was talking about making appointments. As you know, the \nAdvice and Consent Clause of the Constitution says the President can \nmake appointments, but he needs to get the consent of the Senate to do \nso. Well, the Senate wouldn't give him consent.\n  So while the Senate was away for a day, the President went into the \nRecess Appointments Clause of the Constitution. In fact, we got a big \nletter from the legal department there at the White House that said he \nhad the powers to pretend that the Senate had adjourned for the session \nand to go ahead and make appointments anyway.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  The protest, Mr. Speaker, of the President usurping congressional \nauthority was partisan. Republicans said no. Democrats said: Ah, he \nprobably has the right to do it anyway.\n  We didn't stand up for the people we represent. We didn't stand up \nfor the Constitution we swore to uphold, Mr. Speaker. We divided \nourselves by party instead of uniting ourselves on principle.\n  We had to go to the Supreme Court, Mr. Speaker. The Supreme Court \ncan't decide on anything unanimously, Mr. Speaker. If the question is: \nWhat time are we going to meet today to talk about cases?, it is a 5-4 \ndecision. You know this to be true.\n  But the Supreme Court came together in Noel Canning and said: That's \ncrazy. That's crazy. The President of the United States can't just \npretend he is king. He is not the king.\n  I am paraphrasing when I say that, Mr. Speaker, but to quote the \nSupreme Court decision, they said this:\n  Regardless, the recess appointments clause is not designed to \novercome serious institutional friction. It provides a subsidiary \nmethod for appointing officials when the Senate is away during a \nrecess. Here, as in other contexts, friction between the branches is an \ninevitable consequence of our constitutional structure.\n  Friction between the branches, Mr. Speaker, is an inevitable \nconsequence of our constitutional structure. That makes me feel good. \nIt makes me feel good because, Mr. Speaker, I go back home all the time \nand constituents say: Rob, why can't you get more done? Why can't you \nget more done?\n  Well, it turns out it is because of this. It is because of this \nConstitution that says, listen, if Congress is at work, your liberties \nand your freedoms may be under attack. Right?\n  What we do here isn't generally to give freedoms back to people. \nGenerally what we do is to restrict freedoms a little bit here. We want \nit to be slow. Here in the House, we are a little faster. There in the \nSenate, they are supposed to be a little slower, Mr. Speaker. But it is \nsupposed to be hard. It is supposed to be the inevitable consequence of \nour constitutional structure.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, this body--not Republicans in this body, not \nDemocrats in this body--collectively was silent as power flowed down \nPennsylvania Avenue, away from the Article I legislature down to the \nArticle II executive. It took the Article III courts, Mr. Speaker, to \nright our constitutional framework. Shame on us. Shame on us, \ncollectively, for not standing up.\n  Mr. Speaker, my constituents are frustrated by the pace of progress \nin this town. They are frustrated by what looks like the politics that \nare being played here, Mr. Speaker, when policy should be our focus.\n  I think it is up to us to educate folks, to proudly say it is the \ninevitable consequence of our constitutional structure, but when we \nstand together--as we have this week on this transportation bill--there \nis still more that unites us as a country than that divides us.\n  Environmental leadership, Mr. Speaker, is one of those areas of \noverreach that this particular White House is aggressively engaged in. \nAgain, the pushback has been partisan pushback. It has not been Article \nI legislative pushback, as it should.\n  I want to go back to some prior Presidents, Mr. Speaker. I will look \nat Republican Presidents. I am a Republican. I will look at what it \nlooked like when Republicans were running the show in the White House.\n  The EPA was signed into law by Richard Nixon, Mr. Speaker. On the \ncreation of the EPA, President Nixon said this:\n\n       The reorganizations which I am here proposing afford both \n     the Congress and the executive branch an opportunity to \n     reevaluate the adequacy of the existing program authorities \n     involved in these consolidations. I look forward to working \n     with the Congress in this task. The Congress, the \n     administration, and the public all share a profound \n     commitment to the rescue of our natural environment.\n\n  Richard Nixon had a calling when it comes to the environment, Mr. \nSpeaker. He had a calling. He didn't say:\n\n       I am the President of the United States. I am just going to \n     rewrite the entire environmental code and dictate that it is \n     the law of the land.\n\n  He came to Congress and said:\n\n       Protecting our natural resources is a shared American \n     value. It is a shared American value. I am going to go to \n     Congress. I am going to win the votes. We are going to change \n     the law, and we are going to make it so.\n\n  The Clean Air Act, Mr. Speaker, was signed into law in 1990 by \nPresident George H.W. Bush. He said this:\n\n       Today I am signing S. 1630, a bill to amend the Clean Air \n     Act. I take great pleasure in signing it as a demonstration \n     to the American people of my determination that each and \n     every American shall breathe clean air. Passage of this bill \n     is an indication that the Congress shares my commitment to a \n     strong Clean Air Act.\n\n  How do you know, Mr. Speaker, if Congress shares your commitment if \nyou don't bring the language to Congress to have Congress ratify it? \nThe President can propose all the legislation he wants to. We still \nhave to pass it. If our frustration about results allows us to let \nfolks shortcut the constitutional process, we will all--330 million of \nus--suffer.\n  I remember when President Reagan was trying to raise the gas tax, Mr. \nSpeaker. I talk about that because we were talking about the \ntransportation bill this week and transportation funding this week. He \nstood on the lawn, Mr. Speaker, there beside the Rose Garden, and he \nsays:\n\n       We deserve a world class infrastructure in America, and I \n     propose that we double the gas tax.\n\n  Yes, this is conservative Ronald Reagan talking about doubling taxes \nin order to build America. America didn't agree with him; yet, he went \nout there and sold it.\n  How did we get fundamental tax reform in this country, Mr. Speaker, \nin 1986? The country wasn't ready for fundamental tax reform. The \nCongress couldn't agree on fundamental tax reform. Ronald Reagan took \nit out there and sold it every single day until he got it done. That is \nwhat is supposed to happen. We work together to accomplish these \npriorities. Past Presidents have done exactly that.\n  Mr. Speaker, it hasn't been 2 weeks ago we were in here talking about \nthe President's overreach on the Department of Labor fiduciary rule. \nYou remember that bill. We had it here on the floor of the House, Mr. \nSpeaker, where the President just decided, through the Department of \nLabor, that longstanding investment law, as determined by the SEC, was \nno longer going to be the law of the land, that the Department of Labor \nwas going to take on some new rulemaking authorities in this area.\n  The President wanted to make some changes. Congress didn't want to \nmake changes. The President said this:\n\n       What I won't accept is the notion that there is nothing we \n     can do. So we are going to keep pushing for this rule.\n\n  Keep pushing, Mr. Speaker, didn't mean come to Congress to sell you \nand to sell me. Pushing didn't mean go to the United States Senate to \nbuild a coalition. Pushing meant ignoring the Congress and going \nstraightaway.\n\n  Now, I point this out as a success, Mr. Speaker. I point this out as \na success because our opposition to this wasn't partisan. Our \nopposition to this, Mr. Speaker, was bipartisan.\n  I have here a letter from September, Mr. Speaker, signed by 90 \nDemocrats that said:\n\n       Mr. President, don't do this. Don't do this. This is not \n     the proper path forward.\n\n  The plurality of the Democratic Caucus here said:\n\n       Mr. President, don't go forward. The President drove \n     forward anyway.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the times that I have seen the President change his mind \nin\n\n[[Page H8142]]\n\nmy 4\\1/2\\ years in Congress have not been because of my persuasive \noratory or even by the strength of this institution. It has been \nbecause the American people have spoken.\n  When the American people speak, the President is a good listener. \nWhat the President is hearing today is the ends justify the means. I \nneed results. And so however you get those results, Mr. President, I \nwill be behind you.\n  We are starting to turn that corner, Mr. Speaker, because I promise \nyou, whatever is good for Democrats today is going to be bad for \nDemocrats tomorrow. Whatever is bad for Republicans today is going to \nbe good for Republicans tomorrow.\n  The parties will change. The political environment will change. But \nwhen you short-circuit the process, the short-circuiting lasts forever. \nWe change expectations of the American people. We change expectations \nof what the Constitution means, Mr. Speaker. I applaud 90 of my \nDemocratic colleagues standing with this Congress saying:\n\n       Mr. President, don't go it alone.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this isn't something that I am just coming up with out \nof thin air. When the President wasn't President Obama, when he was \nSenator Obama, he had these same concerns.\n  He spoke out time and time again about overreaches of President \nGeorge Bush. Oftentimes he spoke out alone. Republicans weren't \nstanding with him to speak out because it was a Republican President.\n  Republicans said:\n\n       You know what. I want to support my President. So even if \n     he is coloring outside the lines a little bit, it is probably \n     important to the country that he do so. That is a failure. \n     That is a failure because our primary job here is not to be \n     Republicans and Democrats. Our primary job here is to be \n     Article I Representatives of the American people.\n\n  The President said this on immigration. He's talking at a Univision \ntownhall meeting in 2011, Mr. Speaker. He said:\n\n       This does not mean, though, we can't make decisions, for \n     example, to emphasize enforcement on those who have engaged \n     in criminal activity.\n\n  This was the beginning of his program.\n  But he goes on to say:\n\n       It also doesn't mean that we can't strongly advocate and \n     propose legislation that would change the law.\n\n  Time and time again, folks would ask him to do what he could as the \nexecutive to change immigration law, and he would say:\n\n       Listen, I'm not the king. I am the President. The Congress \n     has to change the laws. I can only enforce the laws.\n\n  He was right. He was right each and every time that he said that. The \nadministration can propose, but we have to implement.\n  Fast-forward to about this time last year, Mr. Speaker, and the \nPresident says this:\n\n       And to those Members of Congress who question my authority \n     to make our immigration system work better or question the \n     wisdom of my acting where Congress has failed, I have but one \n     answer: Pass a bill.\n\n  Pass a bill, he says.\n\n       In the meantime, I am just going to do things the way I \n     want to do things.\n\n  That is the opposite of the ``I am just a bill sitting here on \nCapitol Hill'' song that we all learned as children, Mr. Speaker. The \nbill comes first. The law change comes last. After the President signs \nthe bill, it becomes the law. We have to propose it first.\n  How many meetings have you had with the President, Mr. Speaker, where \nhe is pushing his immigration agenda, trying to get you to buy in to \nhis bill? The answer is zero because he doesn't have a bill and he \nhasn't been knocking on any of our doors. And my Democratic friends \nwould say the same.\n  How many meetings with the President have you had, Mr. Speaker, where \nthe President is trying to persuade you about his fiduciary rule and \nwhy that change is important for America and why we should move that \nbill forward? The answer is zero because he has never come to Capitol \nHill to make that pitch. He is not making it to Democrats, and he is \nnot making it to Republicans. He is going it alone.\n  How many times has the President come and knocked on your door, Mr. \nSpeaker, to try to sell you on his ozone regulations or his clean \nenergy plan and on and on and on? And the answer is he hasn't. And we \nhave been complicit in allowing that unilateral action. It is bad for \nAmerica. It is not the process that our Framers envisioned.\n  This is what the President said on immigration. It is that same \nUnivision townhall meeting. The question was:\n\n       Mr. President, my question will be as follows. With an \n     executive order, could you be able to stop deportations of \n     students?\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I am not down here talking about immigration policy \ntoday. I am not. Our immigration system is broken. I represent \nconstituents, Mr. Speaker, who have had family members on the list not \nfor 5 years, not for 10 years, not for 15 years, but for 20 years, and \nmore are standing in line waiting for their chance to come to America. \nOur system is broken.\n  I have employers who want to build in our district. They can't get \nthe people they need from their home countries to come and manage those \noperations. Our system is broken. We all know it. We have a chance to \nfix it.\n  But when the President goes around the Congress, he doesn't fix it. \nHe breaks it further. He says this:\n\n       With respect to the notion that I can just suspend \n     deportations through executive order, that is just not the \n     case because there are laws on the books that Congress has \n     passed. And I know that everybody here at Bell is studying \n     hard. So you know that we have got three branches of \n     government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch's \n     job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the \n     judiciary has to interpret the laws.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  The President says:\n\n       There are enough laws on the books by Congress, the \n     President says, ``that are very clear in terms of how we have \n     to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply \n     through executive order ignore those congressional mandates \n     would not conform with my appropriate role as President.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the words of President Obama:\n\n       There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are \n     very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration \n     system that for me to simply through executive order ignore \n     those constitutional mandates would not conform with my \n     appropriate role as President.\n\n  That was March 2011. You wouldn't know that is what he believed in \nNovember of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, what happened in those 4 years? I will tell you. What \nhas happened is we have been silent as a body. We have been vocal as \nRepublicans, we have been vocal as Democrats, but we have been silent \nas a representative body.\n  Article I of the Constitution says it is our job to legislate and it \nis our job to rein in those Presidents who would legislate on our \nbehalf.\n  What our Framers feared, Mr. Speaker, was an all-powerful executive. \nThat is what they had come from. That is what we should fear today, not \na Republican President, not a Democratic President, but an all-powerful \nPresident. Congress passes the law. The President enforces them.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you want to know the outcome of that overreach, if \nyou want to know where Congress is, again, the President is not on \nCapitol Hill selling those priorities. He is simply down in the \nexecutive branch with a phone and a pen implementing those priorities. \nBut if you want to know what the other two branches of government \nthink, the judiciary said no and the Congress said no.\n  There is no confusion about where the different branches of \ngovernment are. We have one branch that is saying yes. That is the \nexecutive, who has no lawmaking authority whatsoever. We have two \nbranches saying no, the branch that makes the law, which is the \nlegislative branch, and the branch that interprets the law, which is \nthe judiciary branch.\n  We are united in the noes, but what we are not united on is the \nyeses.\n  We talk about bipartisan in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker. It is always \nstriking to me that what is bipartisan is the opposition to the \nPresidential overreach. That is what is bipartisan.\n  Sometimes the support for it is partisan, with a minority of folks \nsupporting the President on that. It is bipartisan in its--disdain is \ntoo strong of a word, Mr. Speaker, but in some ways, it is not strong \nenough. It is that we owe our constituents better. It is that we owe \nthem better.\n  My voting card has my name on it, Mr. Speaker, but it is not mine. It \nis borrowed from the Seventh District of Georgia. It doesn't belong to \nme. It belongs to 700,000 folks back home who\n\n[[Page H8143]]\n\ndidn't send me here to satisfy my priorities. They sent me here to \nsatisfy their priorities.\n  I don't believe that, as a Nation, Mr. Speaker, we believe the ends \njustify the means. I hope that we don't. I hope that we have not fallen \nso far, Mr. Speaker, that we now believe the Constitution, the rule \nbook for America, is less important than what the results are.\n  Anybody involved in manufacturing, Mr. Speaker, knows that, if you \nhave a flawed process, you are going to produce a flawed product. Only \nwith a good process can you produce a good product. The Constitution \ngives us a good process. When we ignore it, we have a flawed process \nand a flawed product.\n  I will go to the President's environmental policies, Mr. Speaker.\n  I want to make it clear: I represent a district that plays outside, I \nwould argue, more than any other district in the country. If you want \nfolks that love clean air and clean water, come down to my part of the \nworld. If you want folks who are stewards of Mother Earth, come down to \nmy part of the world. If want folks who love green space, who love \nparks, national trailways and bikeways, come down to my part of the \nworld. We love being outside. We will ride a bike. We will push a \nstroller. We don't care. We just want to be outside.\n  And so, if the President came to me and said: ``Rob, Mother Earth is \nin peril. I need you to work with me to solve that problem,'' I would \nbe the best listener you could imagine. But that is not the way the \nprocess is working in the 4\\1/2\\ years I have been in Congress, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  The President's Clean Power Plan is shutting down power plants in the \ngreat State of Georgia, Mr. Speaker. It is the position of the \nadministration to protect Mother Earth. We are going to close down the \npower plants that we have just spent billions of dollars improving to \nmeet the last round of environmental regulation. And then, with those \npower plants closed down, we are now going to spend billions more to \nbuild brand-new facilities to generate electricity.\n  I promise you that is not going to result in fewer emissions in the \natmosphere than if we let these plants run out their useful life with \nall of the improvements that have gone upon them. But we didn't get to \nvote on that, Mr. Speaker. We didn't get to vote on that. That was an \nexecutive decree.\n  We have the Waters of the U.S., Mr. Speaker. Well, when it was a \nbill, we rejected it. It is the initiative from the White House that \nsaid the framework we have had in this country for 100 years of the \nFederal Government controlling navigable waterways and the State \ngovernments controlling the other waterways is gone.\n  If a drop of water falls, it is now the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to regulate. Why? Because, apparently, we can't be \ntrusted back in Georgia to take good care of our natural resources. \nNonsense.\n  Mr. Speaker, my district sits on a continental divide. We have built \na billion-dollar water treatment plant where we are putting the water \nback into our local lake cleaner than we took it out. While half the \ndistrict's on the other side of the continental divide, we know that \nthe Chattahoochee River Basin is in a water deficit. So we spend \nbeaucoup money pumping the water back up from one side of the \ncontinental divide so that we can let it go in the basin that needs the \nwater so badly.\n  We are stewards, Mr. Speaker. We are not stewards with your money. We \nare not spending somebody else's money on these projects. We are \nspending our money on these projects because we believe in taking care \nof America's natural resources.\n  The President, not through selling it to Congress, not through \nselling it to the American people, but with a pen and the phone \nfederalized water across the board. Where was the bipartisan outcry? It \nwas lacking.\n  And, finally, the revised Ozone Air Quality Standards, Mr. Speaker. \nIf you are confused, it is that we never got the last round of ozone \nstandards implemented. Those still haven't gone into effect yet. The \nPresident has dropped a new round of ozone standards on America not \nbecause Congress worked on it--we didn't--not because Congress passed \nsomething--we didn't--but because the President thought it was \nimportant and he wrote the law for himself.\n\n  How does Congress feel about this? Well, it turns out Members of this \nbody said:\n\n       If this is the direction the President wants it to go, let \n     me make this pitch to Congress and see if the Congress agrees \n     with the President.\n\n  Carbon emissions, cap-and-trade, Clean Power Plan: Rejected. Waters \nof the U.S.: Rejected. Ozone standards: Rejected.\n  It is not that Congress hasn't spoken on these issues. We have, Mr. \nSpeaker. We have. It is not that the President doesn't know what the \nArticle I Congress wants. He does.\n  He just doesn't like what the Article I Congress decided. And so he \nhas decided to do it himself. And we have been complicit in allowing \nthat to happen. It is not even we, the 435 of us, Mr. Speaker. It is \nwe, the 320 million of us. And there is going to be a price to pay for \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress is active on these issues. It is not as if \nfolks in this body don't care. They care deeply.\n  We passed the REINS Act, Mr. Speaker, to say:\n\n       Listen, if the President is going to start doing some rules \n     on his own, we need to come back and review those after the \n     fact in Congress.\n\n  It passed 243-165.\n  We had the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act for those \njurisdictions like mine where the local governments are taking such \ngood care of our natural resources, trying to protect their right to \ncontinue to protect our local natural resources. It passed 261-155.\n  The Ratepayer Protection Act said:\n\n       For Pete's sake, it hasn't been 5 years since you told us \n     to spend billions to make these power plants workable for the \n     next generation. Now you are telling us we have to close \n     these power plants.\n\n  That can't possibly be the right way for America to get clean energy. \nIt can't possibly be the right way to be stewards of taxpayer dollars. \nWe passed that bill 247-180.\n  The EPA Science Advisory Board Act said:\n\n       We have got to get together on the science. If we can't \n     figure out what the facts are, we are never going to agree on \n     what the solution is. So let's have a standard for what good \n     science looks like that we can all rally together around.\n\n  It passed here in the House.\n  Mr. Speaker, folks aren't confused about where the Congress is on \nthis issue. The President is not confused about where the Congress is \non this issue. The President believes the ends justify the means.\n  Article I: Congress passes the law. Article II: The White House \nenforces the law. Article II: The judiciary interprets the law.\n  Well, the judiciary had a chance to do a little interpreting. It had \na chance to look at the Waters of the U.S. and the clean water issue, \nand the court said this. This is the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals:\n\n       What is of greater concern to us in balancing the harms is \n     the burden potentially visited nationwide on governmental \n     bodies, State and Federal, as well as on private parties, and \n     the impact on the public in general implicated by the rule's \n     redrawing of jurisdictional lines over certain of the \n     Nation's waters.\n\n  The court says:\n\n       Wait a minute. We are worried about the impact on America.\n\n  I don't want the court to be worried about the impact on America. I \nwant the court to be worried about what the law of the land is. I want \nthe Congress to be worried about the impact on America. I want the \nPresident to be listening to Congress and enforcing the laws that \nCongress passed.\n  It has taken the courts to say:\n\n       Mr. President, you have gone a bit to too far.\n\n  The court goes on and says:\n\n       The sheer breadth of the ripple effect caused by this \n     rule's definitional changes counsel strongly in favor of \n     maintaining the status quo for the time being.\n\n  It is still being litigated. The court says the detrimental impact of \nthis new rule that Congress has never seen, except in the form that we \nrejected it, the damage to America is so severe, we are going to issue \nan injunction to prevent the President from going forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, it gives me no pride to have nine Justices in robes \nrunning the United States of America. Americans\n\n[[Page H8144]]\n\nelected a President to implement the law and they elected a Congress to \nwrite the law. We should be doing that together. We found ourselves \npowerless in doing that, asking the courts to solve that issue instead.\n  The courts go on:\n\n       But neither is there any indication that the integrity of \n     the Nation's waters will suffer imminent injury if a new \n     scheme is not immediately implemented.\n\n  They said:\n\n       I don't know what it is the President is trying to solve \n     here, but there is no harm coming. There is time to sort this \n     out.\n\n  Now, they mean time to sort it out in the courts. What about time to \nsort it out in the Congress, Mr. Speaker?\n  Who is it who loves the Waters of the U.S. bill? If they do, they \nshould come and make their pitch. The President should come and make \nhis pitch. When was the last time you saw him on the TV selling the \nWaters of the U.S. bill, Mr. Speaker? The answer is that you haven't \nseen him on TV selling it. He is not selling it. He is just doing it.\n  When have you seen him selling the ozone standards? The answer is \nthat he is not selling it. He is just doing it. And the list goes on.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have to ask him to get out there and sell it. Your \njob as President isn't just to do it. Your job as President is to get \nthe Congress to allow you to do it, to sell the American people, who \nwill sell the Congress, who will change the law of the land.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't know if you know Laurence Tribe. He is a Harvard \nlaw professor. In fact, he was President Obama's constitutional law \nprofessor. I would not call him a conservative by any stretch of the \nword, at least not in political terms, but perhaps constitutionally.\n  Laurence Tribe says this about the President's Clean Power Plan. He \nsays:\n\n       To justify the Clean Power Plan, the EPA has brazenly \n     rewritten the history of an obscure section of the 1970 Clean \n     Air Act. Frustration with congressional inaction cannot \n     justify throwing the Constitution overboard to rescue this \n     lawless EPA proposal.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I want you to follow that rationale. This isn't \nsomething that has snuck up on us here in the past few weeks, here in \nthe past few months, here in the past few years.\n  The President dug deep into a 45-year-old law and said:\n\n       It appears to me we have misunderstood this law for the \n     past 45 years.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  We have misunderstood it. And apparently, 45 years ago, we absolutely \nmade an effort, through Congress and the White House, to give the \nPresident the authority, in fact, the obligation, to rewrite America's \nenergy laws in this fashion.\n  Nonsense. Nonsense. The President is a constitutional law professor. \nFrustration with congressional inaction cannot justify throwing the \nConstitution overboard to rescue this lawless EPA proposal.\n  I get the frustration with congressional inaction. Mr. Speaker, I get \nit. If we had frustration meters around here, mine would be ticking up \nnear the top. But my experience is, the way to address that frustration \nisn't to take my toys and go home. The way to address that frustration \nis to find somebody on the other side of the aisle who I think I can \ntrust, who I think I can talk to, who I think I can listen to, and to \nwork together to find an answer, to work together to find a solution.\n  What is absent in all of these proposals that I have listed, Mr. \nSpeaker, is anyone working together to make this proposal the law of \nthe land. The only working together that is happening, Mr. Speaker, are \nfolks working together to prevent these proposals from being the law of \nthe land.\n  Process matters. Process matters.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to finish close to where I began. I was a new \nCongressman, had just been elected, 700,000 people in the great State \nof Georgia counting on me to be their voice, counting on me to succeed \non their priorities.\n  Right out of the gate, the President says:\n\n       You know what? I have been trying to get the people I want \n     appointed to a board, and the Senate won't do what I want \n     them to do; and because the Senate won't do what I want them \n     to do, I am going to do it by myself.\n\n  When did that become okay, Mr. Speaker?\n  We suffer from a little of that here. The House won't do what I want \nit to do, so I am going to take my toys and go home. The House won't do \nwhat I want it to do, so I am going to gum up the works and shut down \nthe process. The House won't do what I want it to.\n  Well, guess what? In a representative democracy, nobody does what you \nwant him to do, Mr. Speaker. You have got to go out and find 51 percent \nof America to agree with you, and that is when you get things done.\n  I do not fault the President for his policies, though I disagree with \nhim on them. I fault him for implementing those policies unilaterally, \nunconstitutionally, instead of going out and selling America on them.\n  That is what is so great about this institution, Mr. Speaker. If you \nhave the votes, you don't have to fuss about it.\n  Folks come down to the House floor, gnashing of teeth, tearing of \nclothes, self-flagellation going on here on the floor on a regular \nbasis. If you have the votes, you don't have to make a scene. You have \njust got to go out and win the votes. You just have to go out and win \nthe argument. If you win the argument, the law will change.\n  Mr. Speaker, America works. America works. The Constitution works. \nYou just have to follow it. You just have to believe in it. You have to \nbelieve in the Constitution. You have to believe in the American people \nthat it governs.\n  So, 9-0, the Supreme Court told the White House and its entire legal \nteam that crafted a too-cute-by-half explanation of why this was all \ngoing to be okay and roses and sunshine, hunky-dory, 9-0 the Court said \nno. No, that is not what the President does. That is not what the White \nHouse does. That is not what you are allowed to do in America. \nRegardless, the Supreme Court says the Recess Appointments Clause is \nnot designed to overcome serious institutional friction.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have serious institutional friction. I don't bemoan \nthis. I celebrate it. I think friction was part of the process. It \nturns out the Court agrees with me.\n  They go on to say it simply provides a subsidiary method for \nappointing officials when the Senate is away during a recess; hence, \nthe term ``Recess Appointments Clause.''\n  Here, as in other contexts--in other contexts, Mr. Speaker--are all \nof these other issues the Court now has on their plate from executive \noverreach. Here, as in another contexts, friction between the branches \nis an inevitable consequence of our constitutional structure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am just one vote in a 435-Member institution, but my \nconstituents would place that one vote on the side of being the Article \nI legislature rather than on the side of being the best Republican \nAmerica has ever seen. My constituents would ask me to place that vote \non the side of being the legislative branch, that institution from \nwhich the ideas percolate, that part of the U.S. House that is closest \nto the American people. They would ask me to pledge to be a part of \nthis institution, not the Republican National Committee, not the \nNational Republican Congressional Committee, not the Democratic \nCongressional Campaign Committee, not the Democratic National \nCommittee.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have an amazing opportunity and a solemn obligation \nin this institution. My commitment is to be a good listener to all the \npolicy concerns my colleagues have on the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will be a good listener. I may not agree with you, but \nI will give you a chance to sell me.\n  But we have to be united on behalf of all of our constituents back \nhome in saying that the Constitution gives only one branch the ability \nto write the law, and that is the Article I legislature.\n  When we ignore the President, Mr. Speaker, we do so at our own peril, \nat our institutional peril. When the President ignores the Congress, he \ndoes so at his own peril, at executive branch institutional peril.\n  I was on the elevator with one of the great leaders of this \ninstitution, Mr. Speaker, Mr. John Dingell out of Michigan, and he was \non the elevator. A young Democrat climbed on the elevator with him. The \nyoung Democrat was complaining that he didn't have a personal \nrelationship with the President. He said: I don't get to see enough of \nthe President. The President is not on Capitol Hill enough.\n\n[[Page H8145]]\n\n  Mr. Dingell said: Well, son, be careful what you wish for. Remember \nLBJ. We had LBJ over at the Library of Congress, a book study just this \nweek.\n  Different Presidents handle their relationship with Congress in \ndifferent ways. Some are involved too much, some are involved not \nenough, but everyone is involved.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is supposed to be a battle of ideas, not a battle \nof ideologies. This is supposed to be a battle of policy, not a battle \nof partisans.\n  This is supposed to be an opportunity to succeed on behalf of folks \nback home; and I will tell you, it is an opportunity that we are losing \nwhen we unite ourselves based on red and blue as opposed to uniting \nourselves based on Article I and Article II.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8145-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE RETURN TO PRUDENT BANKING ACT\n\n  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to encourage you to join with me and \n69 of our colleagues, a total of 70 already, who have signed on to \ncosponsor H.R. 381, the Return to Prudent Banking Act. This bipartisan \nbill would restore the provisions of the Glass-Steagall banking law \nthat separated prudent banking from wild speculation in the financial \nrealm.\n  Yesterday marked the 16th year, to the day, that Congress repealed \nthe Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, bestowing on financial institutions and \ninvestment firms the ability to put the life savings and deposits of \nthe American people at greater risk.\n  I was one of the 57 Members of this Congress who voted against that \nrepeal of Glass-Steagall. At that time, my colleagues and I were told \nby Wall Street that the banks were strangled by outdated restrictions, \nthat the repeal was a modern experiment in deregulation; so Congress \nrepealed this bedrock law, over our objections.\n  Look where that decision took America. We witnessed a terrible market \ncrash in 2008; now, slow growth and the outrageous enormous \naccumulation of banking assets in a handful of institutions like JP \nMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America. They are raking in \nrecord-shattering profits while paying depositors almost nothing on \ntheir interest or on certificates of deposit as wages for working-class \nAmericans continue to flatline.\n  The original Glass-Steagall Act served our country well. It laid the \nfoundation for an unprecedented half century without financial panics \nor crises. Just as important, it contributed to a right-sized banking \nsystem focused on serving our economy and society as a whole rather \nthan enriching itself at everyone else's expense.\n  This Congress must reinstate the regulatory prudence of the Glass-\nSteagall Act. Without these proper safeguards, it is only a matter of \ntime before Wall Street's greedy operatives once again steer the \nAmerican economy over the precipice.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 381, the Return to \nPrudent Banking Act of 2015. Help restore prudence, discipline, and \nsanity to our financial system and, in turn, real economic growth to \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8145-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PROVIDING FOR AN ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE TWO HOUSES\n\n  Mr. WOODALL.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I do want to commend my friend from \nGeorgia. He speaks eloquently.\n  I hated to lose dear friend, John Linder, from here in this body. He \nwas a brilliant man, with great class. But since he is gone, I am \ndelighted to have Rob Woodall here in his stead--just clear-thinking, \narticulate, and makes the case that the American people need to hear.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Speaking of messages, Mr. Speaker, the American people need to hear, \nthis is November 5, 2015. It was November 5, 2009, when a major in the \nUnited States Army at Fort Hood, Texas, killed Americans.\n  He had given plenty of warning signs that he was a ticking time bomb \nwho was going to kill Americans, particularly American soldiers, \nespecially if he were ordered to go overseas because he would much \nprefer to kill American soldiers than he would go overseas and risk \nkilling a fellow Muslim.\n  Having heard about people in the United States Army, as I was in for \n4 years, who had to deal with Major Hasan, it is appalling that \npolitical correctness led to this man's being allowed to remain in the \nmilitary, ever being promoted, and being assigned to counsel troubled \nsoldiers. Incredible. But political correctness has become more and \nmore prominent.\n  It was November 5, 2009. President Obama had been in office since \nJanuary of that year. Major Hasan had been in the military during the \nBush administration. He should never have been promoted.\n  There were warning signs that we heard about after the fact, but \nnobody wanted to be the one to stand up and say: ``This man is a \nthreat. He is a radical Islamist. He is a threat not only to the good \norder and discipline of the United States military, he is a threat to \nthe very lives of our military members.''\n  Mr. Speaker, our military let those victims down at Fort Hood, Texas, \nbefore the shooting ever occurred. That is almost unbearable. But what \nbecomes\n\n[[Page H8146]]\n\nunbearable is the fact that 6 years later victims of Major Hasan who \nare still alive are still being mistreated by this administration.\n  An article by Jacob Brooks and J.C. Jones in the Killeen Daily Herald \ntoday in the paper said: ``Six years after the November 5, 2009, \nshooting at Fort Hood, at least one victim is still fighting for \noverdue benefits. Former Fort Hood Staff Sergeant Alonzo Lunsford, Jr., \nsaid pain, betrayal, disrespect, and patriotism all come to mind when \nhe thinks about that tragic day. He said, 'It is a lot. It is really a \nlot that goes through my head.'''\n  He was shot seven times by Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist who \nopened fire on unsuspecting fellow soldiers at a Fort Hood medical \nprocessing building for deploying soldiers.\n  Six years later, the building has been torn down. Many of the \nsoldiers who were there have since moved on, are either no longer in \nthe Army or stationed elsewhere.\n  Hasan, an Army major at the time of the shooting, was found guilty of \nkilling 12 soldiers and 1 civilian on August 23, 2013, following a 12-\nday court martial at Fort Hood. Days later he was sentenced to die and \nis currently on death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, awaiting \nautomatic appeals.\n  Mr. Speaker, it took Congress battling and finally putting language \nin a bill that the Army and the Defense Department finally could not \nignore that finally put enough pressure on the Army to do the right \nthing by these victims, and that is--for Heaven's sake, they were \nvictims of an attack in the war against America by radical Islam.\n  As Muslim friends in the Middle East, leaders in the Middle East who \nare Muslims, have asked on different visits I have had in the Middle \nEast: Why is it that this administration does not understand radical \nIslamists, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood, is at war with the \nUnited States? You keep helping the people who are at war with you, the \nMuslim Brotherhood.\n  They recognize it all over the Middle East. Muslims over there \nscratch their heads--moderate Muslims--and wonder what is wrong with \nAmerica.\n  I met a number of the survivors of the shooting 6 years ago today \nwhen the Purple Hearts were finally awarded. A number of us were there \nfrom Congress because it was an important day and they needed to know \nMembers of Congress do care.\n  So we were there as representatives of this body and all of those \nwithin it who recognize the loss and the sacrifice occurred at the \nhands of someone who is at war with the United States, a part of the \nbigger radical Islamist movement.\n  It is rather ironic that, as we think about and talk about the \nviolations of the Iran treaty--yes, it is a treaty, despite the \nSenate's unwillingness to call it what it is and the administration \nobviously won't call it what it is--but the violations of the Iran \ntreaty by Iran are still resulting in this administration's sending \nbillions and billions and billions and billions of dollars to people \nwho want to kill us and to eliminate our way of life.\n  Yet, this same administration that is sending billions and billions \nand billions of dollars to our enemy can't scrape together mere \nhundreds of dollars to send to someone like Staff Sergeant Alonzo \nLunsford.\n  The article says he is now in North Carolina. I was impressed when I \nmet him. He seems to be a very sharp man, a patriot, someone who cares \nabout America. But like many of the victims, the wounds go even deeper \nthan the shots that were fired. In his case, seven times he was shot. \nOh, what a horrible day.\n  And, yet, this administration becomes accomplices to the after-the-\ncrime episode and damage by still refusing to acknowledge it for what \nit was and pay these patriotic servicemembers the money they have \ncoming as people who were wounded in the line of duty.\n  It is ridiculous that this administration will send billions and \nbillions to our enemies who have already said that, with all the \nbillions Obama is going to make sure that we get, we are going to be \nable to finance more, help Hamas more, help Hezbollah more. We are \ngoing to be able to help those who kill Americans.\n  What does the administration do? They want to make sure that nothing \ngets in the way of their sending money to people that want to kill \nAmericans and people who have killed Americans.\n  A report out just this week indicates that Iran may be responsible \nfor at least 12 percent of the Americans killed in Iraq. I can't help \nbut think, based on those I have talked to in trips to Iraq and those \nwho have researched even further, that when we get to the bottom line, \nit will likely be a lot more than 12 percent.\n  But even so, the country, the radical Islamist leaders in charge, are \nguilty of killing Americans, and this administration rewards them by \nsending them money and, whether it is intentional or sheer intentional \nneglect, refuses to acknowledge the patriotism and the act of war \nagainst our members of the United States Army and the United States \nmilitary and the one civilian that was killed, refuses to acknowledge \nand adequately appreciate those patriots that were killed or wounded in \nthe line of duty in an act of war by Major Nidal Hasan.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, the question arises: If this administration, either \nthrough neglect or intent, is so calloused and uncaring towards its own \nmilitary members, then what is going on now that is going to result in \nfuture Americans, military members, being killed? How many more Major \nNidal Hasans are there in the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marines?\n  God, I hope and pray that people like Nidal Hasan are not still being \npromoted because nobody wants to--in this administration, under this \nadministration, under this Commander in Chief--rise up and say: This \nguy is giving all the indications of being a radical Islamist that will \none day explode and kill Americans.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we have seen record numbers of generals--officers with \nstars on their epaulets--being fired. Personally, I recognize Edward \nSnowden to be a traitor. I have tried felony cases, including death \npenalty cases.\n  Coupled with my experience here in Congress of trying to advise and \nhelp whistle-blowers and having seen this administration turn against \nwhistle-blowers, use their own department they work in to destroy their \ncareers, use the Department of Justice to harass them, and if it is \nsomebody that has very damaging evidence about wrongdoing by this \nadministration, then they will convene a grand jury to investigate and \nharass, never mind that it drives a spouse to the hospital near \nbreakdown, never mind the damage that it does to those patriotic \nwhistle-blowers who just want the government to do the right thing in \nall things.\n  I have to recognize, if I were sentencing Edward Snowden for his \ntreason, that in this administration someone that were to come forth--\nif Edward Snowden had done this and come before superiors in this \nadministration, he would likely have been destroyed, a grand jury \nconvened, attempts to put him in jail, attempts to destroy his \nevidence.\n  That would have to be taken as evidence in mitigation of whatever the \nsentence was for the treason because, under this administration, I have \nstruggled with people who wanted to get the truth out.\n  Where do you go? Eric Holder, as Attorney General, was not going to \nhelp a whistle-blower if they had information that was damaging to the \nadministration. No. He was the head of the largest criminal defense \nfirm in America defending the actions in this administration and going \nafter and trying to destroy anybody who came forth with damaging \nevidence, particularly if it could have come before the election in \n2012.\n  Loretta Lynch will always be a blot on the reputation of the United \nStates Senate because she made clear she thought that the things Eric \nHolder did in violation of the Constitution, in contempt of Congress, \nthe disingenuity and dishonesty, were okay in her book, and they \nconfirmed her anyway. So the indications are things haven't gotten any \nbetter than they were.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  What do you do if you are a patriotic whistleblower in this \nadministration and you want to out Nidal Hasan, you want to come \nforward with documentation that shows this administration has acted \ninappropriately? It has been\n\n[[Page H8147]]\n\nmade clear to people, you raise your head up to try to speak up and \nspeak truth, then we will make you rue the day you ever worked for the \ngovernment.\n  We won't help with mere hundreds of dollars to American patriots who \nwere wounded in an act of war, and, obviously, 13 killed in an act of \nwar by radical Islamists. We won't even call radical Islam what \nmoderate Muslims in the Middle East recognize that it is. And a man of \ngreat courage I think will end up being recognized as one of the great \nleaders in the Middle East of any age. President el-Sisi gets the back \nof the hand most of the time from this administration. When he has had \nthe courage to stand up to imams in a room, looking them in the eye, \nand say: It is time to take back our religion from the radicals.\n  Because of his courage, because of his recognizing the threat that \nradical Islam is, not only to Christians and Jews, but to moderate \nMuslims, then there is no doubt there are people that want to kill him, \nwhen this administration ought to be doing everything they can to help \nthem.\n  I was asked by Egyptian leaders: Does your President not understand \nthat the Apache helicopters that he promised the Muslim Brother Morsi \nthat he withheld for so long, that we used those to keep the Suez Canal \nopen, does he not want the Suez Canal open? Does President Obama not \ncare? Well, that would certainly be the indication if you look at the \nactions of his administration.\n  When I was in Egypt in September, people who desperately want to be \nfriends with the United States, they yearn for freedom, they yearn for \na free Egypt, free of radical Islam, even though they are Muslims \nthemselves, they want to be friends with freedom-loving Americans, and \nyet with dozens and dozens and dozens of leaders from countries around \nthe world, including Russia, top leaders from countries around the \nworld, being there to note the incredible historic event in world \nhistory when Egypt, after having gotten rid of the radical Islamist \nMuslim Brother Morsi, who was refusing to keep his conduct within the \nrequirements of their Constitution, was removed after the biggest \npeaceful demonstration in the history of the world. Over 30 million \npeople are said to have gone to the streets to demand his removal.\n  After Morsi is removed, people of vision like el-Sisi took over and \nthey dug another lane to the one Suez Canal, so there are two lanes for \na big part of it there. That was a historic day in June. The people of \nEgypt should have been lauded by all of those in this administration.\n  Yet, not only did this administration not care to recognize the great \nhistoric fete of Egypt struggling as it is to achieve greatness once \nagain, they didn't even send anybody from Washington. My friend Darrell \nIssa went. Congress was represented.\n  I was not allowed to go, of course, because Speaker Boehner wasn't \nallowing people like me who spoke up for what we believe is right to \ntravel. And, according to his staff, Speaker Boehner saw taxpayer-\nfunded travel as a reward for people that apparently voted like he \nwanted them to, which kind of sounds like it would be a crime.\n  But, nonetheless, we were represented. Congress was represented \nthere, but not the administration. Leaders from around the world were \nthere. Not this administration.\n  It is time to recognize the good Muslims, the moderate Muslims in the \nworld, with whom we can be friends, who want to be our friends, who \nwant to work with us, and recognize those, like the Muslim Brotherhood, \nwho want to destroy our way of life. And it is time to stop the \npolitical correctness that got 13 people killed at Fort Hood 6 years \nago today and got so many more wounded.\n  Since this administration doesn't want to properly recognize efforts \nto keep the Middle East peaceful and out of the hands of radical \nIslamists, like the Muslim Brotherhood, well, we had the Iran treaty \nthat this administration pushed and the Senate refused to take up and \nvote on as a treaty.\n  The Corker bill clearly didn't apply because the Iranian treaty did \ninclude terms about ballistic missiles, about weapons buying, about \nrelease of money under the sanctions. It did change the terms of the \nnonproliferation treaty. It was clearly a treaty.\n  It really will be another blot on the Senate's reputation that they \ndid not stop that. By taking a vote on ratification, it wouldn't have \ngotten the two-thirds required. And then we could have prevented the \n$100 billion plus--we are told $100 billion or so each year \nthereafter--that will be going to a country that, according to this \nnews this week, where `` `Death to America' Stands Despite the Nuclear \nDeal.'' This report from AFP, dated November 2, from Tehran, says, \n``the Islamic Republic will not abandon the slogan of `Death to \nAmerica' despite its July nuclear accord with world powers.\n  ``The martyr-nurturing nation of Iran is not at all prepared to \nabandoned the slogan of `Death to America' under the pretext of a \nnuclear agreement,'' 192 members of Iran's 290-seat parliament said in \na statement carried by state news agency IRNA.\n  ``They said the slogan, chanted at the weekly Friday prayers in \nmosques and at protests, had `turned into the symbol of the Islamic \nrepublic and all struggling nations.' ''\n  So let's look, Mr. Speaker, at what has occurred since the Iran \ntreaty that was not ratified was placed into being by this \nadministration and by the Senate looking the other way.\n  Well, they have had ballistic missile tests. They have had joint \nmilitary operations with Russia and Syria.\n  Those certainly violate the terms of the Iran deal.\n  They have had open violations of international travel bans. We have \nhad a cyber attack from there. We have had an arrest of a U.S. \nresident, Nazar Zaka. ``Death to America'' is still their chant.\n  And yet here is this story from October 21 by Reuters. It says:\n  ``The United States, Britain, France and Germany called on Wednesday \nfor the United Nations Security Council's Iran sanctions committee to \ntake action over a missile test by Tehran that they said violated a \nU.N. ban.\n  ``In a letter containing details on the launch, they said the \nballistic missile was `inherently capable of delivering a nuclear \nweapon.'\n  ``The letter, seen by Reuters, was sent to the committee after the \nUnited States raised the issue in the 15-member Security Council.\n  `` `We trust that this information will assist the Committee in its \nresponsibility to examine and take appropriate action in response to \nviolations of U.N. Security Council resolutions,' they wrote.''\n  ``Diplomats have said it was possible for the sanctions committee to \nblacklist additional Iranian individuals or entities if it determined \nthat the missile launch had breached the U.N. ban. However, they said \nRussia and China, which have opposed the sanctions on Iran's missile \nprogram, might block any such moves.\n\n  `` `The United States will continue to press the Security Council to \nrespond effectively to any future violations . . . Full and robust \nenforcement of all relevant U.N. measures is and will remain critical,' \nU.S. ambassador of the United Nations Samantha Power said in a \nstatement on Wednesday.''\n  Now, the reason that the United States has sent this letter, \nparticipated in it, asking the U.N. to take appropriate action, is \nbecause this administration is gutless to do what needs to be done. You \nhave Iran, it has been confirmed, that killed so many hundreds \nresponsible for the death of so many Americans. And this administration \nstruck a bad deal with them that could never get two-thirds of the \nSenate to ratify it, so we just act like it is a treaty that is \nratified, even though it isn't.\n  But it is gutless to stand up to Iran and say: You violated the deal. \nWe are not going to allow $100 billion to $150 billion to go to you \nwhile you continue to say ``death to America''; you continue to have \nballistic missile tests; you continue to have joint operations, in \nviolation of our deal, with Russia and Syria; you continue in open \nviolation of international travel bans; you continue to attack us or \nhave cyber attacks from your country; and you continue to stir up \nviolence against the United States. You are not getting any money.\n  How about giving just a little bit of that $100 billion to the \nvictims of Nidal Hasan? How about giving it to the victims of radical \nIslamist violence? How\n\n[[Page H8148]]\n\nabout giving it to the victims of over 400 days in captivity in Iran \nunder the Ayatollah Khamenei's leadership?\n  This administration has got to act. This is outrageous.\n  And then we have an International Business Times report, ``Iranian \nAirline Violates Terms of Nuclear Deal By Purchasing Planes To Use In \nSyrian War.'' This says:\n  ``One of Iran's commercial airlines last week bought a UK-\nmanufactured jet with the aim of using it to deliver Iranian soldiers \nand weapons to Syria . . . The purchase of the aircraft by an Iranian \nconcern represents a clear violation of the deal brokered by the \nadministration of U.S. President Barack Obama.''\n  It is outrageous. The Iran deal needs to be brought to an end. No \nmore money needs to go to Iran. No money for killers, for terrorists, \nbut money to the victims in our United States military.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/05/house-section/article/H8148-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.
