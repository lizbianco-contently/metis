The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, one of the great tragedies of our time \nis our failure to adequately deal with the needs of our veterans \nreturning home from Iraq and Afghanistan. We sent over 2 million brave \nmen and women to fight under very difficult circumstances, to say the \nvery least. While I was convinced from the beginning that the war was a \ntremendous mistake, that is all the more reason that we should work to \nprotect those veterans as they return home with wounds that are both \nvisible and, in some cases, unseen.\n  It is no secret that these returning veterans have placed quite a \nstrain on our VA facilities, which coincides with a national opioid \nepidemic. Prescription painkillers steal the lives of 78 Americans \nevery day. Over 20,000 were killed last year, and it often leads to \nheroin addiction if their supply of opioid pills is interrupted.\n  As veterans with PTSD, chronic pain, and any number of ailments are \nlooking for relief, lethal opioid overdoses among VA patients are \nalmost twice the national average. We are doing something wrong. This \nis at a time when the overwhelming number of veterans say to me that \nmarijuana has reduced PTSD symptoms and their dependency on addictive \nopioids. Yet the VA official policy prevents their doctors who know \nthem best from talking to our veterans about this, even in States where \nit is legal.\n  In 24 States, the District of Columbia, and Guam, medical marijuana \nat the recommendation of a physician is legal. In those States, it is \noften used as an alternative to the addictive opioids to treat chronic \npain. Fourteen States allow for medical marijuana to treat PTSD. Yet, \nveterans who are seeking relief from something that has proven to make \na difference for many of their peers cannot get help from their VA \ndoctor, even in States where medical marijuana is legal.\n  This is outrageous. It is time for us to acknowledge our debt to \nthose veterans and allow their personal VA physician, the doctor who \nknows them best, to be able to consult with them about medical \nmarijuana in accordance with State law.\n  My amendment doesn't authorize the possession or use of marijuana at \nVA facilities, but it would allow physicians to treat the whole patient \nand to give them their best advice. We should not force our veterans to \ngo to another doctor and pay for the service out of their own pocket \nwith somebody who doesn't know them as well as their own doctor.\n  I would strongly hope that my colleagues would vote in favor of the \nVeterans Equal Access amendment in the MILCON-VA bill coming forward \ntoday. These men and women who have done so much for us and come home \nseeking help in dealing with health and coping with their return \ndeserve our best. Forcing the VA to turn a blind eye to a potential \nuseful therapy--something that is perfectly legal in their State--is \nnot just shortsighted; I think it is cruel and unfair.\n  I have listened to the many stories of veterans who have found that \nmedical marijuana has made a huge difference in their return, recovery, \nand readjustment. Importantly, it doesn't subject them to the danger of \nbeing part of the opioid epidemic that has been visited upon our \nveterans.\n  We can help stop the tragedy of VA veterans dying of opioid overdoses \nat nearly twice the rate of the rest of the population by at least \nallowing their doctors to work with them, considering medical marijuana \nas an alternative therapy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2703-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2703-H2704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend \nthe service of law enforcement officers not only in Pennsylvania's \nFifth Congressional District, but across Pennsylvania and the entire \nUnited States. As this week is National Police Week, it is especially \nimportant that we recognize\n\n[[Page H2704]]\n\nthe sacrifices of these men and women, especially those who have given \ntheir lives in the line of duty.\n  Over the weekend, as part of National Police Week, communities across \nthe country observed Peace Officers Memorial Day. This observation was \ncreated in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy to pay special recognition \nto those law enforcement officers who have lost their lives while \nproviding for the safety and the protection of others.\n  Last year, five police officers lost their lives in Pennsylvania: \nOfficer Lloyd Reed in Westmoreland County, Patrolman John Wilding of \nScranton, Lieutenant Eric Eslary of Westmoreland County, Detective Paul \nKoropal of Allegheny County, and Sergeant Robert Wilson III of \nPhiladelphia. I know that I join my fellow members of the Pennsylvania \nHouse delegation in saying that their service to our Commonwealth will \nnot be forgotten.\n\n\n    Recognizing the Retirement of Venango County Chief Clerk/County \n                       Administrator Denise Jones\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nthe service of Denise Jones, who is the chief clerk and county \nadministrator for Venango County, located in Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District. After nearly 39 years of work for the county, \nDenise plans to retire next month.\n  She started in the 1970s with Venango County, and Denise has served \nin a number of different capacities. Those include as a human services \nplanner, as an administrative assistant, as an employee relations \nmanager, and then finally moving into the role of chief clerk and \ncounty administrator in 1993.\n  In addition to her service with the county, Denise serves on a number \nof boards dedicated to her community, including as board chair of the \nNorthwest Hospital Foundation, which is dedicated to providing high-\nquality health care for the residents of the Venango County area.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am always proud to talk about the local officials who \nare making a difference in their communities, dedicating their service \nto improving the lives of people in their communities. I know that \nDenise Jones is one of those people, and I wish her the best of luck in \nher retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2704-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE DUI REPORTING ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the DUI Reporting \nAct, a bill which I filed yesterday with my Judiciary Committee \ncolleague, Steve Chabot of Ohio. If enacted, this bill would plug a \nglaring hole in our Nation's drunk driving laws that enables repeat \noffenders to be tried as first-time offenders, and repeat offenders are \nthe ones most likely to cause serious accidents and death.\n  Currently, when police make a driving-under-the-influence arrest, \nthey don't always have access to information about all of the driver's \nprevious DUI convictions or arrests. The reason is because not all \nagencies report DUI arrests and/or convictions to the National Crime \nInformation Center, known as the NCIC. That is the national crime \ndatabase that is made instantly available to police and law enforcement \nright in their patrol cars.\n  The consequences of this lack of reporting can prove tragic. Last \nyear, there was an awful, awful accident, a crash in northern \nMississippi just outside of my district. Two teenage girls, Maddie \nKruse and Rachel Lynch, were headed out of Memphis on the way to a \nvacation. Their grandmother was driving the car. At about 6:30 in the \nmorning, a man who had registered .17 at 6:30 in the morning hit their \nvehicle and killed Maddie and Rachel. This man had accrued seven DUI \ncharges since 2008 but had been allowed to plead guilty five times to \nDUI first. He represented himself and had five first-offense DUI \nconvictions. Mississippi didn't have a system and still doesn't have a \nsystem to require those reportages.\n  This story broke my heart and, I believe, the hearts of everybody in \nthe Midsouth who read about it.\n  This was a drunk driver who should have been in jail serving time off \nthe road or have received treatment. The reason he wasn't, according to \nlocal investigations, is because none of his DUI history had been \nreported to the NCIC and was not available to the highway patrolman. \nWhen that patrolman ran his driving record in the national database, \nhis past DUI convictions never showed up because they weren't reported.\n  This is shameful in this day and age. This information should be \nreported so that law enforcement can get access to it and get drunk \ndrivers off the road and save lives like Maddie's and Rachel's. Our \nbill would make that happen by creating a financial incentive for \nStates to require DUI arrests and convictions to be reported to the \nNCIC and, therefore, available to law enforcement.\n  The bill is bipartisan. It has the support of people throughout the \ncountry; but in Memphis, Billy Bond, at the Prosecutor's Office, worked \non this for a while and tried to get laws like this passed. We have had \na good response from MADD.\n  This bill will save lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass \nit quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2704-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2704-H2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Bost) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a matter of \nnational security. Over the last several months, the National \nGeospatial-Intelligence Agency, or NGA, has been considering locations \nfor its new Western headquarters. The agency, which collects and \nanalyzes satellite maps in support of warfighters, has outgrown its \ncurrent location in St. Louis.\n  With construction of the new NGA-West facility scheduled to begin \nnext year, the question is: Where? There are two sites under \nconsideration. One is in north St. Louis. The other is in St. Clair \nCounty, Illinois, next to Scott Air Force Base.\n  This site, which I have a chart of, is shovel ready. It is 182 acres \nof undeveloped land with room to expand. It is free of cost to the \nAmerican taxpayers, with the county ready to hand over the deed to the \nNGA.\n  To help make their decision, the NGA enlisted the help of the Army \nCorps of Engineers to study the environmental impact. Unfortunately, we \nhave found that the Army Corps of Engineers' Environmental Impact \nStatement is deeply flawed. The report is filled with errors, \nomissions, and underestimated risks. It is clear that the Army Corps \ndid not provide an accurate accounting of the facts. The result is that \nthe NGA announced plans last month to relocate to north St. Louis. \nBefore that decision becomes final on June 2, I am here to set the \nrecord straight.\n  To the right of this chart, you will see St. Clair County, Illinois. \nThis is the site under consideration by the NGA. However, the Army \nCorps of Engineers' report included data related to St. Clair County, \nMissouri, and St. Clair County, Michigan. One is 263 miles away from \nthe actual site, and the other is 580 miles away from the actual site. \nThe report also highlighted a river that isn't even in southern \nIllinois.\n  When alerted to these embarrassing errors, the Army Corps of \nEngineers failed to correct them. Considering that the NGA is a mapping \nagency, maybe they could teach the Army Corps of Engineers how to read \none.\n  Now, let's look at the impact on mission security and public safety. \nClearly, a DOD mapping agency would be a prime target for those who \nwish to do harm against this agency. This chart shows evacuation zones \nif either location were attacked by a car bomb.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  You can see that St. Clair County has ample setback to protect local \nresidents and the site itself. The north St. Louis site, obviously, \ndoes not.\n  We now know that security was a top criteria for placement of the new \nNGA. We know that force protection standards have traditionally led to \ncolocating with existing military installations. So why are the \nstandards being ignored for this facility?\n  Let's look at the facts. We have already talked about the NGA belongs \nin St. Clair County. We have already talked about mission security. We \ntalked about public safety, and we saw the difference in the blast \nzones.\n  St. Clair County is the right choice for taxpayers. The Army Corps \nclaims\n\n[[Page H2705]]\n\nthe St. Clair County site would be 20 percent more expensive, but they \nhaven't even completed studies of the north St. Louis site. St. Clair \nCounty is shovel-ready now. North St. Louis is not.\n  Every year that we delay this, it adds $40 million to the cost to \nthis budget. St. Clair County has been proactive and transparent with \nthe environmental studies. North St. Louis hasn't even conducted its \nfull analysis. The north St. Louis site has significant unknowns, \nincluding reports of hazardous waste and potential contamination from \ncold war era testing. How can this decision be made without answers to \nthese very serious and health-related questions?\n  In terms of recruiting the next generation, Scott Air Force Base \nattracts the best of the best. Thousands of millennials work at Scott \nAir Force Base, and many already have their security clearance. \nFinally, St. Clair County has the roadways, railways, and \ninfrastructure to make NGA a success. North St. Louis will need to \nseize land through eminent domain and then create a network we already \nhave in place.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe the NGA is making a terrible mistake that \ncould have serious consequences. They didn't have the correct data. \nBefore this decision is made final, the people deserve the truth. Not \njust the people of St. Clair County, not just the people of north St. \nLouis, but we, the United States citizens.\n  That is why I have called for a full investigation by the Inspector \nGeneral's Office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2705-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER AND DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, this week, we \nrecognize infrastructure week, where we highlight infrastructure \ndevelopment in our country and its importance to our districts.\n  Now, we might think that infrastructure isn't very important, but we \ndepend on it in all aspects of our daily lives. Developed roads and \nbridges help to take our children to school or to take our kids to our \nnational parks. Our bridges, dams, and water are the infrastructure \nthat help to produce energy and provide us with clean drinking water. \nBroadband infrastructure ensures that everyone has access to learning \nand to information.\n  But, unfortunately, our infrastructure is deteriorating at an \nalarming rate. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that \nour crumbling infrastructure is costing each of us, each family, $3,400 \na year of our disposable income. When we take into consideration the \nincreasingly high cost of living, for example, in Orange County, \nCalifornia, where I live, then we see that our families are, once \nagain, footing a bill, and yet we are not making the investment that we \nneed. In fact, the United States spends significantly less of its GDP \nthan most developing countries for our national infrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, this lack of investment is apparent throughout our \ncountry. We saw it in Flint, Michigan. When infrastructure fails to \nprovide clean water, our communities suffer. In my home State of \nCalifornia, Porter Ranch, California, a massive gas leak released \n100,000 tons of methane gas into the air. These failed pipelines reach \nback to the 1950s.\n  With respect to our roads, the Department of Transportation found \nthat nearly 68 percent of California's roads are in poor or mediocre \ncondition, and almost 30 percent of California's bridges have been \nrecognized as structurally deficient.\n  As California enters its fourth year of a drought, we are seeing just \nhow crucial water infrastructure dollars can be during times of \nturmoil.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, we have to look no further than my home district to \nsee the positive effects of investing in infrastructure to help our \ncommunities. Since I was elected to the Congress almost 20 years ago, \nthe very first project that I championed was building a large factory, \nthe largest in the world, to reclaim our water, to recycle our water, \nand it is the world's largest advanced reclamation project. Today, that \nproject has recycled nearly 188 billion gallons of water, and it really \ncontinues to be the flagship of water recycling.\n  I have also fought to bring high-speed rail to California and led \nsending a letter to President Obama urging investment in the project, \nwhich will bring increased commercial and leisure travel.\n  With respect to transit, I recently led a letter from the California \ndelegation asking for $3.2 billion to fund the Capital Investment Grant \nProgram, a program which funds projects all the way from northern to \nsouthern California. The Capital Investment Grants will help fund \nprojects in my district, like the Orange County Streetcar, which \nincreases transportation transit through my area so people get out of \ntheir cars, we protect the environment, and we move people more \nefficiently.\n  Mr. Speaker, this Congress needs to get its act together and invest \nin infrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2705-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2705-H2706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WE NEED A PRO-GROWTH AGENDA TO RAISE WAGES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, Wendy's, one of the world's largest fast-food \nchains, plans to replace human employees with automated self-service \nkiosks in many of its 6,500 restaurants around the country and around \nthe world in an effort to counteract minimum wage hikes throughout the \nUnited States. I don't blame Wendy's at all. They can either react or \nthey can close up their doors, and then no one will be working.\n  The economics on the issue are pretty clear. Wendy's is doing what \nthey have to do to survive, and others will certainly follow suit. They \nwill adapt, or they will be gone.\n  When the government unnecessarily and unilaterally increases the cost \nof labor and imposes it on the job creators, the jobs are probably \ngoing to be replaced through automation and technological advancement. \nThis is nothing new. This technology is not new. Wendy's could have \ndone this a long time ago if they just wanted to maximize their \nprofits, as every single corporation in America seems to be accused of \ndoing these days. But these are the job creators. These are the job \nmakers. They have chosen now because they have no other choice.\n  Many people say that this is an artificial wage and that it actually \ndiscourages employment and distorts the market. Well, here is the \nproof. This is exactly what is happening. And don't blame Wendy's. They \nare trying to survive in a 2 percent economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's not lock out millions of people from their entry-\nlevel employment. I am a person who worked for less than minimum wage. \nOne time I asked my boss at the time, I said: ``Do I make minimum \nwage?'' And he said: ``No, you are not worth it.'' I was just barely in \nhigh school. I didn't have much to offer, except a strong back and \nshowing up on time with a good attitude, and he paid me for that, and I \nworked my way up.\n  The squeeze on the middle class is real. It is painful for tens of \nmillions of anxiety-ridden Americans who don't know whether they are \ngoing to have a job, even though it might be their entry-level job. It \nmight be the job that they could get in a 2 percent economy.\n  Some people say that we are just transferring the jobs to those who \nwill build kiosks or robots. Well, I have got to tell you, folks, I \nsuspect that those jobs are not minimum wage jobs, so that is not going \nto be of much help. And, oh, by the way, I suspect they won't be in \nyour hometown where your Wendy's is. So if you have got a job there and \nit is going to be displaced or replaced with one building a kiosk, \nunless you are planning to move to where they are building that, that \nis not going to be of much solace or help to your family.\n  What this country needs is a pro-growth agenda to help raise \neveryone's wages to provide the opportunity for everyone to get started \nsomewhere and then move up, just like I did, without hurting the people \nalready struggling to get by. What we don't need is more liberal, \nwrong-headed, unilateral, ideological-driven government regulation that \ndestroys our jobs and livelihoods.\n\n[[Page H2706]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2706-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Speier) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, since 1970, more Americans have died from \ndomestic gun violence than in every war since the American Revolution. \nIf all of the victims of gun violence since 1970 were put on a wall, \nlike the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, it would contain 1.5 million names \nand stretch 2\\1/2\\ miles. That is 25 times as long as the actual \nVietnam Veterans Memorial.\n  Congress is quick to offer moments of silence for some mass \nshootings, ignore most of them, and then proceed to do nothing else, \nexcept remain silent.\n  Each month that we are in session, I will read the names of every \nperson killed in a mass shooting during the previous month. I have also \ncreated my own memorial wall in the hallway outside of my office.\n  Here are the stories of the victims killed in the 41 mass shootings \nin April of this year. There have been so many people this month \naffected by mass shootings that I don't have time to list the injured, \njust those who were killed. Here are those who were killed:\n  Anpha Nguyen, 31, and Jerry Nguyen, 24, were killed inside a \nrestaurant owned by their uncle on April 1 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n  Jaime Wilson, 24, and Keiwuan Murray, 18, were killed on April 5 in \nSt. Augustine, Florida.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Duncan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, people all over the country are \nmoving from the high tax States to the low tax States. This is great \nfor my home State of Tennessee. Almost half the people I represent have \nmoved from someplace else; but it is not great for the country as a \nwhole, and we will face many problems in the future if the high tax \nStates do not start lowering their taxes and start trying to keep more \nof their people at home.\n  New York in the 1970s had 43 Members of the House. Now it has 27 \nMembers. After the 2010 Census, each Member was supposed to represent \nbetween 705,000 and 710,000 people. While, in the 1970s, congressional \ndistricts had much lower populations than now, if New York had had the \naverage growth of most States, it would have had about 11 million more \npeople than it now has.\n  Cities and States throughout the Northeast and the Midwest have been \nlosing populations or have been having growth lower than in most other \nStates for many years. Last year, a man from New Jersey told me his \nproperty taxes on a 2,800-square-foot house were $13,000. Plus, they \nhad State income tax on top of that. I told him the taxes on a similar-\nsized house in east Tennessee would probably be between $2,000 and \n$2,500, and there would be no State income tax on top.\n  Almost every week, when I am home in Tennessee, someone tells me a \nstory about how high the taxes are in the States they have moved from. \nOf course, it will be good for the young people of Tennessee if our \nlegislators keep taxes low and if people would keep moving there, \nbecause many new jobs will be created.\n  An example of the problems, though, that high taxes have created in \nthe States can be seen in Michigan's Flint water crisis. When taxes \nbecome too high, first, upper-income residents move out, then upper-\nmiddle, then, finally, middle-income. Then cities are left with a very \nlow tax base. The pressures are greatest to pay the teachers, the \npolicemen, and the firefighters first. The water infrastructure \nunderground is out of sight, out of mind, and is often neglected. Flint \nhas lost almost half of its population since the 1970s, as have many \ncities, large and small, throughout the high tax States of the \nNortheast and the Midwest. We are going to send a boatload of money to \nFlint because of all the publicity it has received, but we cannot do \nthat for every city and county in all of the high tax States.\n  I read a few days ago that Galesburg, Illinois, leaders are telling \ncitizens to drink only bottled water. It is not fair to my taxpayers in \nTennessee, where we have acted in fiscally responsible ways and have \nkept our taxes low, to have to now bail out all of the cities and \ncounties and even States that have acted in fiscally irresponsible \nways. Of course, the problems these wasteful, irresponsible, high tax \nareas that keep driving people out will be seen not just with \ninfrastructure, but all across the board--in education, in law \nenforcement, and in other areas. Puerto Rico is in big trouble now. \nMany people say Illinois is next.\n  I urge the high tax States all over the country to start drastically \nlowering their taxes. While this exodus of people from these States has \nbeen very good for States like Tennessee, it will not be good for the \nNation as a whole in the long run if it continues. It should also serve \nas a lesson or as a warning that almost every city or State in this \nNation and almost every country around the world that has had liberal, \nleftwing, big spending, high tax leadership is in serious financial \ntrouble.\n  Every young person who seems to be attracted to the false promises of \nsocialism should look at Cuba, where despite hundreds of miles of \nbeautiful oceanfront property and a wealth of interior natural \nresources, the average salary is $24 a month. They should also\n\n[[Page H2707]]\n\nlook at Venezuela, which has more oil than Saudi Arabia has. Their \neconomy is in shambles, and children are dying because they can't get \nfood and medical treatment.\n  That is what socialism gives the people, Mr. Speaker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2707-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE STATE OF HOMELESSNESS IN AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise because I am \ndeeply concerned about the homelessness crisis that is plaguing our \ncountry.\n  Homelessness affects the very fabric of our communities, and it \ndegrades the values upon which our country was built. Every American \nhas the right to safe, decent, and affordable housing; but according to \nthe latest estimates, nearly 600,000 Americans are currently homeless, \nover 83,000 of whom are chronically homeless and nearly 130,000 of whom \nare children who are under the age of 18, and these numbers are \nincreasing in some of our major cities. Sadly, in my own hometown, in \nLos Angeles, homelessness increased by a staggering 20 percent between \n2014 and 2015, and it continues to rise.\n  But this is not just about the numbers. When I visit our homeless \nneighbors on Skid Row in Los Angeles, I see how these Americans are \nfacing chronic mental and physical problems that make it even harder to \nrehabilitate their lives. When I speak to families that are dealing \nwith homelessness, I see the toll this housing insecurity is taking on \ntheir children, who can't concentrate in school because they are \nsleeping in cars at night.\n  There is a solution to this problem, Mr. Speaker. We just need the \npolitical will and resources. That is why earlier this year I \nintroduced comprehensive legislation to provide the resources we need \nto truly end homelessness in America.\n  My bill, H.R. 4888, the Ending Homelessness Act of 2016, would \nprovide over $13 billion over 5 years to strengthen programs and \ninitiatives that will help us end homelessness in this country. The \nmoney will help to create approximately 410,000 units of housing to end \nhomelessness for the estimated 407,000 homeless households in the \ncountry. This includes permanent supportive housing for the chronically \nhomeless, for Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher units, and deeply \naffordable units through the National Housing Trust Fund.\n  My bill would also provide the resources to increase the number of \noutreach workers on the streets, working with homeless populations. \nFurthermore, my bill would provide technical assistance to help States \nand localities align their health and housing systems.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has \nreported that major progress toward ending homelessness in this country \nhas virtually stalled without new funding. So there is a real need to \ninvest in our Federal housing programs and to support our local service \nproviders who are on the streets helping the homeless every day.\n  Passing H.R. 4888 would be an investment that would pay dividends in \nthe long run. Research has shown that when we provide housing to \nchronically homeless individuals, the cost to the taxpayer is \nsignificantly less than if we allowed them to remain homeless. For \nexample, Los Angeles County's Project 50 found that providing permanent \nsupportive housing to 50 chronically homeless individuals saved the \ncounty close to $250,000 over 2 years. Similar results have been found \nin other major cities as well as in small cities and in rural areas \nalike.\n  But this isn't just about the cost or the savings, Mr. Speaker. It is \nabout recognizing the crisis that we face as a Nation and having an \nhonest conversation about what we really need to do to put an end to \nhomelessness.\n  We are the richest country in the world, and every person should have \naccess to safe, decent, and affordable housing. This should be a \nbipartisan issue. We must, all of us, Democrats and Republicans, work \ntogether to finally end homelessness in this country once and for all.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, I will be on this floor every chance I get \nto force the real debate and the real conversation about this crisis \nthat we are confronted with in America. We cannot continue to walk past \nhomeless, helpless, mentally ill, physically ill homeless people on the \nstreets and pretend we don't see them. They are there. It is \nunconscionable that we allow this homelessness to continue to grow and \nto be on our streets.\n  In Los Angeles, when you go to so-called Skid Row, we have people on \nthe streets who are lined all the way up to the steps of City Hall.\n  Elected officials, ministers, community organizations, let's get \ntogether with our legislators, let's pass H.R. 4888, and stop the \nhomelessness in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2707-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2707-H2708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ECONOMIC, RETIREMENT, AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I want to discuss the \nissue of security with my colleagues--economic security, retirement \nsecurity, and national security--three issues that probably right now \nin my conversations with constituents is what we hear the most about.\n  Let's look at the picture of economic security, or the lack thereof, \nthat exists in our country and in our communities.\n  What I hear from my constituents is that the 5 percent unemployment \nrate is indeed misleading because over 90 million Americans have \ndropped out of the workforce. They are losing hope and are unemployed. \nThe Obama malaise, as I have constituents who like to term it, has \ncreated a workforce participation rate of 62.8 percent. Now, I want you \nto think about that. Of the eligible adults who are ready for the \nworkforce, 62.8 percent have a job and are able to work. That is the \nworst level since the Carter administration.\n  Our GDP is declining. Our economy grew at only half of a percent--\nhalf of a percent in the first quarter of 2016. That is lower than a \n1.4 percent expansion in the previous period, according to the Bureau \nof Economic Analysis. President Obama had a chance to create 40,000 \njobs, and he took a pass on it. He vetoed the Keystone pipeline so that \nhe could cement his legacy and stature as a liberal icon.\n  The American people are tired of being broke; they are tired of work \npermits that go to illegal aliens; and they are tired of $19.2 trillion \nin Federal debt. We need to get the government off the backs and out of \nthe pocketbooks of the American people. It is time to loosen \nregulations and lower taxes.\n  The issue of retirement security comes up so often in the \nconversations I have, especially with women, and it is important to \nnote what is happening with Social Security and Medicare. The Social \nSecurity retirement trust fund is set to run out of money by the year \n2034. That is not that far away. According to the Tax Foundation, under \nthe current wage indexing formula, benefits are projected to climb by \nmore than 150 percent, in real terms, over the next 75 years.\n  I have introduced H.R. 603, the Savings for Seniors Act, which \nestablishes within the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust \nFund a Social Security Surplus Protection Account to hold the Social \nSecurity surplus and prohibit it from being spent. Medicare has to be \naddressed as well. It is supposed to run out of money and be insolvent \nby 2030. We must make sure that seniors are secure, and we have to make \ncertain that the money they have already paid into the system, they are \nable to receive.\n  On the national security front, President Obama's very, very timid \nforeign policy has emboldened our enemies from the rise of ISIS, to \nRussian aggression in Ukraine and in the Middle East, to the Chinese \nmilitary expansion in the South China Sea. It has also left our allies \nasking: Where are you? You are not present as we try to address these \nissues.\n  What we have seen with President Obama, I think, is inexcusable. For \nexample, when the evil blade of ISIS decapitated Steven Sotloff in \n2014, President Obama was on the golf course minutes after telling the \nAmerican people: We will be relentless, and we\n\n[[Page H2708]]\n\nwill be vigilant to see that justice is done. Or, as he also calls it, \nleading from behind.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Two other glaring issues we face are the Syrian refugee program and \nour southern border.\n  There is currently no way to vet Syrian refugees, and I think this \nPresident is delusional if he thinks there is. I have introduced H.R. \n4218 to suspend refugee admissions until Congress passes a joint \nresolution approving the President's plan.\n  Meanwhile, our southern border is overrun again. Through the first 6 \nmonths of fiscal year 2016, which ended on March 31, border officials \napprehended 27,754 unaccompanied children. That is just shy of the \n28,579 number apprehended for all of 2014. Think about that comparison.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must provide economic, retirement, and national \nsecurity for all Americans. We must rise to the occasion and make \ncertain our Nation is secure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded not to engage in \npersonalities toward the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2708-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CALIFORNIA WATER LEGISLATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to work \ntogether on behalf of the people of California to get water legislation \npassed that will help fix California's broken water system.\n  Yes, Californians have been divided historically for decades for a \nnumber of reasons on how to fix our broken water system, but that must \nchange because we are living on borrowed time, and nothing has \nexplained that more clearly than the last 4 years of drought \nconditions.\n  Yesterday, the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nheld a hearing on Senator Dianne Feinstein's water legislation, the \nCalifornia Long-Term Provisions for Water Supply and Short-Term \nProvisions for Emergency Drought Relief Act. This week, Congressman \nJohn Garamendi introduced the House companion bill, legislation that I \nsupport as well.\n  The California Long-Term Provisions for Water Supply and Short-Term \nProvisions for Emergency Drought Relief Act would provide $1.3 billion \nin funding and support for desalinization, recycling efforts, and water \nstorage projects like Temperance Flat and the expansion of San Luis \nReservoir.\n  The bill would also direct State and Federal agencies to maximize \nwater supplies during the short term, while not violating existing \nenvironmental laws that protect threatened and endangered species.\n  Additionally, the legislation includes language that would generate \nand provide for scientifically managed reservoir operations which would \nallow us to, for example, raise the spillway gates at New Exchequer Dam \nin Merced County, providing an additional 50,000 acre-feet of water \nstorage for the Merced Irrigation District.\n  Finally, the bill would complement the ongoing efforts made by the \nrecent passage of a State water bond that I supported--$2.7 billion for \nadditional water storage in California.\n  In order to get California's water bill passed and signed into law, \nour Nation's Senators must understand that there is support for Senator \nDianne Feinstein's legislation among California Representatives in the \nHouse. That is why I am a cosponsor of the House companion legislation, \nH.R. 5247.\n  Now, there is room for modifications and changes in Senator \nFeinstein's legislation as well as the House bill, especially \nprovisions that deal with short-term fixes that would provide more \naccountability on how California's water system is operated year to \nyear. But if Congress is going to be able to provide some relief to the \npeople of California, which is a template for Western States--and, I \nwould say, the world--we must continue to move forward, and the passage \nof S. 2533 would undoubtedly be an important step in the right \ndirection.\n  Once S. 2533 is passed out of the Senate, the House and the Senate \nwill have the opportunity to go to conference to resolve the \ndifferences that exist in these water bills by each of the Chambers. \nThat is the normal process under which we usually conduct business.\n  I have consistently fought to bring more water to our San Joaquin \nValley, and that includes supporting the California water bill that the \nHouse passed last year, but we need to use all the water tools in our \nwater toolbox to fix the entire State's water needs.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will put aside their political \ndifferences which, for too long, have been a part of the problem and \njoin me in supporting the California Long-Term Provisions for Water \nSupply and Short-Term Provisions for Emergency Drought Relief Act, \nbecause fixing California's water system is dependent upon it. If we \ndon't pass this legislation and we don't work with Governor Brown in \nCalifornia, we cannot fix this broken water system.\n  So, finally, what is this about? It is about investing in our \ninfrastructure. We are living off the investments our parents and our \ngrandparents made a generation ago. This is Infrastructure Week. We \nought to be talking about investing in our infrastructure, not only in \nCalifornia, but around the country.\n  What else is this about? It is about helping the environment because, \nnotwithstanding the opposition to this legislation, the status quo is \nonly resulting in further deterioration of the environment.\n  Finally, what else is this about? It is about the reliability of our \nwater supply to maintain our farms. Maintaining our farms, after all, \nis a part of America's national security. We don't think about it that \nway, but having reliable, cost-effective food on America's dinner table \nevery night is about our national security. So it is about the \nsustainability, therefore, of our food supply and our way of life.\n  If we are going to fix this, we have to come together. We have to \nwork together. We have to get beyond our differences and beyond our \ntalking points.\n  If Congress is going to get anything done, we, in California, on our \nwater fixes, must come together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2708-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2708-H2709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUILDING SAFETY MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Barr) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark Building Safety Month, to \nrecognize the importance of building safety, and to congratulate the \nleadership of the International Code Council that develops and \npublishes the model building safety and energy efficiency model codes \nused in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and across the country. \nIncreasingly, these codes, developed in the United States, are being \nadopted in other nations as a model of safe construction.\n  Every year, there are sobering reminders about the key role that \nbuilding codes can have. Foreign nations still experience catastrophic \nlosses of life and property due to natural events and poor construction \npractices. These losses have been greatly reduced in this country \nthanks to the adoption of sound building practices.\n  Deadly fires, tornados, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, and other \nevents remind us of the critical need for strong buildings. As Congress \ndiscusses the need for resilience and greater energy efficiency in our \ncommunities, we are reminded in May that key elements of resilience and \nenergy efficiency are sound building and energy codes.\n  I want to congratulate the leaders of the ICC, which has sponsored \nBuilding Safety Month in May every year for over 30 years. The theme of \nthis year's Building Safety Month, appropriately, is ``Driving Growth \nThrough Innovation, Resilience, and Safety.''\n  The leadership board of the ICC, including my constituent, President \nAlex Olszowy, building inspection supervisor for the Lexington-Fayette \nUrban County Government in Kentucky, will join ICC's chief executive \nofficer, Dominic Sims, in Washington next week to discuss the critical \nneed to support the adoption and enforcement of current building codes \nto make sure Americans are safe at home, at work, at school, and at \nplay.\n  On this occasion, I also want to highlight the good work of the Code \nAdministrators Association of Kentucky, including president Jeff Camp \nand the other leaders of the Commonwealth's ICC chapter, and to thank \nthe thousands of men and women who work\n\n[[Page H2709]]\n\nevery day to make sure our buildings comply with building and fire \ncodes. Their work, largely unseen and often unnoticed, is critical to \nkeeping the American people safe.\n  The model building codes adopted by ICC members from all 50 States \nallow every community to share the advantage of adopting building codes \nthat are adaptable to local conditions but, at the same time, \nincorporate the very latest research, materials, and building \npractices.\n  This is achieved through a public-private partnership, saving local \njurisdictions from bearing the large expense of code revision, \nupdating, and coordination. These model codes are produced through the \ncooperation of thousands of local U.S. code officials working with the \nbuilding industry to produce codes that represent the consensus on what \nthe minimum safety requirements are and should be for various building \ntypes, all without a dime of Federal taxpayer money.\n  I should mention that the Architect of the Capitol maintains the \nsafety of this building and all House and Senate office buildings by \nfollowing the requirements in the current International Building Code.\n  So congratulations and a heartfelt thanks to the hardworking members \nand leadership of the International Code Council during this Building \nSafety Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2709-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HOUSTON, TEXAS, FLOODING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this is a continuation of my \nmission of mercy, a mission that I gladly accept because a great \nAmerican city has been declared a disaster area: a great American city \nwith 2-plus million people, a great American city where we speak more \nthan 100 different languages, a great American city where we appreciate \ndiversity and we celebrate it. In fact, we have developed a symbiotic \nrelationship, a symbiosis such that we can do together what we could \nnever do apart. A great American city, Houston, Texas, within Harris \nCounty, has been declared a disaster area; and it has been declared a \ndisaster area, Mr. Speaker, because of the flooding that takes place in \nHouston, Texas.\n  I asked that my staff prepare some intelligence for me to share so as \nto paint a picture of what this flooding is like in Houston, Texas.\n  In Houston, Texas, on the tax day flood--so-called because it was the \nlast day to file for taxes this year--we had this tax day flood, and it \nhas caused damages that will approximate $2 billion. The good news is \nthat that is revised down because the estimate initially was that it \nwould be more.\n  In Houston, Texas, over 100 neighborhoods experienced some flooding.\n  In Houston, Texas, a great American city, we had 240 billion--billion \nwith a B--240 billion gallons of water. A billion is still 1,000 \nmillion. So we have had 2,000-million-plus gallons of water in Houston, \nTexas. And that was on one day. This is enough water to fill the \nAstrodome 750 times over.\n  In Houston, Texas, we had more than 1,200 high water rescues, people \nstranded, lives at risk in Houston, Texas, a major American city, a \ngreat American city declared a disaster area.\n  In Houston, Texas, there was 8.85 inches of rainfall--that broke the \nprevious record from 1976--and, I might add, in some areas, 17 inches \nof water. That was all a part of the tax day floods. There were 121,000 \npeople without power.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is significant, but it is also significant to note \nthat this is not the first time. Within the last year, 12 months, we \nhad the Memorial Day flood, with similar circumstances and $2 billion \nin damages.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the last 20 years, we have had at least one day of \nflooding in Houston, Texas, that has been called to the attention of \nthe people in Washington, D.C., and I'm doing so now.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Mr. Speaker, as bad as these things are, all of these damages that I \nhave called to our attention, there is something more significant, \nsomething more meaningful that is happening in Houston, Texas, and that \nis lives are being lost. In the tax day flood, we lost nine lives, Mr. \nSpeaker--nine lives--people who left home going to work, assuming that \nthey would drive their cars and return home.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have, in Houston, what are called flash floods. Even \npeople who are judicious and prudent can sometimes find themselves in \ncircumstances from which they cannot extricate themselves because of \nthe way the water comes in so quickly--flash floods, nine lives lost, a \ngreat American city declared a disaster area.\n  Houston needs a lifeline. When you are drowning in water, you need a \nlifeline. Well, there is a lifeline. The lifeline is H.R. 5025, the \n2016 Tax Day Floods Supplemental Funding Act. This is a supplemental \nfunding bill, which means it is not an earmark. It is the kind of thing \nwe do when we have emergencies to contend with. We have done this \nbefore when we have had the storms on the East Coast. We have done this \nbefore, when we had New Orleans, Louisiana, and Katrina. We have done \nit when we have had fires. We have done it when we have had the \ntornadic activities. This is reasonable. It is prudent. It is \njudicious. It is something we ought to do to rescue, to throw a \nlifeline to a great American city that has been declared a disaster \narea.\n  Well, the good news is, Mr. Speaker, we are recovering; but I hate to \nsay, and I regret to say, I am reluctant to say, we are not out of the \nwoods yet. We are not out of the woods yet, Mr. Speaker, because today \nthere is an 80 percent chance of precipitation. Tomorrow, there is an \n80 percent chance.\n  I beg that we support H.R. 5025 and extend a lifeline to Houston, \nTexas, a great American city.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2709-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2016 \ngraduating class of the ELITE Youth Outreach program.\n  ELITE is a wonderful program that teaches at-risk youth in our local \ncommunities in central Illinois on how to gain employment, communicate \neffectively, behave responsibly, and dress appropriately. The program \nwas founded by Carl Cannon, a Peoria-born native who served his country \nas a military officer and drill instructor. Now he is dedicated to \ntraining and inspiring youth to overcome barriers to success, as he did \nhimself.\n  In 2013, Carl Cannon received the FBI's Director's Community \nLeadership Award. This week, FBI Director James Comey will travel from \nWashington, D.C., to Peoria to address this year's ELITE graduating \nclass.\n  I would like to commend Carl Cannon and his staff for their \ndedication to these students and recognize the transformative effect \nhis program has had on youth in our Peoria area.\n  I would also like to thank FBI Director Comey for supporting this \nworthy program with his presence this week in Peoria.\n  Finally, I would like to congratulate the students who have completed \nthis program. You should feel proud of your accomplishments. You have a \ncommunity and national and local leaders who believe in you, and we \nsupport you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2710-6", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS.

We \nwere told we couldn't afford it.\n  But American taxpayers spent $87 billion rebuilding the roads and \nbridges of Afghanistan. We spent $73 billion rebuilding the roads and \nbridges of Iraq--off budget and unpaid for.\n  Congress needs to get its priorities straight.

Young people who participate in \nHead Start have increased graduation rates, are less likely to become \npregnant as teens, have improved economic opportunities, and are less \nlikely to be involved in crime.\n  Every dollar invested in Head Start saves up to $7 in future costs.\n  In the 20th century, the United States set the standard in education \nand had the highest graduation rates around the world. Today, we rank \n12th in college graduation and 26th in access to preschool for 4-year-\nolds.\n  If we are serious about providing the next generation with the skills \nthey need to be successful and to compete in a global economy, it is \ncritical that we significantly increase our investments in Head Start.\n  Congratulations to Head Start on your 51st anniversary.

Jones on his retirement after decades of \noutstanding service to his community and to our Nation.\n  After serving his country in the Air Force, which included time at \nthe 911th Airlift Wing in Pittsburgh, Chief Jones embarked upon a \ncareer in law enforcement.\n  He is a graduate of both Municipal Police Officers' Training Academy \nand the Pennsylvania Deputy Sheriff's Training Program in Carlisle, \nPennsylvania.\n  He started with the city of Beaver Falls Police Department in 1994, \nand by 2008, he was chief of police.

Forty-one percent of the roads \nin my home State of Connecticut are rated in poor condition.

Mr. Speaker, the Ninth Circuit Court is on a roll this \nweek. First, they upheld gun rights in northern California. Now they \nhave tossed out yet another frivolous lawsuit on salvage operations for \nforestry after a fire.\n  Operations in western Siskiyou County on what is known as the west \nside fire--a fire that occurred in the summer and fall of 2014--are now \nfinally proceeding where the value of that wood can be still, perhaps, \nhopefully, salvaged almost a year and a half later. Though it is only a \nscant 4 percent that they are going after in this harvest project here, \nyou would think with the number of frivolous lawsuits and wailing over \nthe project that we were causing an environmental disaster; yet the \ndisaster has already occurred with the devastating fire.\n  I am glad to see that the court ruled that some of the salvage \noperation can occur, because now the forest can actually recover. It \ncan have an economic base to do so instead of merely coming out of the \nU.S. Treasury, and the people in the area can be employed in doing it \nin this forest fire recovery.\n  It will be a positive for the habitat, a positive for the spotted \nowl. This is what we need to do in the long term. Salvage is an \nimportant part of forestry after a fire and not reinventing the wheel \nevery single time we need to do the salvage and have lawsuits over it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2711-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF ERIC BRADLEY\n\n  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL.

Mr. Speaker, I rise with great news about the city of \nGalesburg, Illinois.\n  About a month ago, I spoke on this floor, and I urged the city to \napply for low-interest, federally funded loans\n\n[[Page H2712]]\n\nthrough the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund. Many officials \nexpressed legitimate concerns about the impact that might have on their \nbudgets, so I worked with the city as well as with the U.S. and the \nIllinois EPA to see if those loans could be forgiven.\n  Today I am so proud to announce that I have received assurances that \nup to $4 million in Federal funding will be forgiven. That will happen \nas soon as the city completes its application and receives formal \napproval.\n  Mr. Speaker, all communities face challenges. What separates the \ngreat ones from the rest is whether communities can come together and \nsolve these challenges. We still have work to do to protect children \nfrom lead exposure, but Galesburg is a great city, and I am proud that \nwe are taking this important step together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2712-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS.

Mr. Speaker, the annual defense bill before the House \ntoday removes $18 billion from the overseas war account to fund \nactivities that are not related to war. It is unfortunate that the \nRepublican majority, which claims to be fiscally responsible, is \nraiding OCO in order to blow past bipartisan spending agreements. This \nbudget gimmick would require an $18 billion supplemental next April--\nonly halfway through the fiscal year--to restore overseas funding for \nAmerica's troops.\n  This is no way to govern the Pentagon, and it is doing a disservice \nto our men and women in uniform by pushing for this. Defense Secretary \nAsh Carter has said that removing overseas funding during wartime is \n``objectionable on the face of it.''\n  It is my hope and the hope of many others on the committee that \nfunding for the overseas account will be restored on the House floor \nbefore the bill is voted on.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the defense bill until these funds are \nrestored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2712-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HEAD START'S 51ST ANNIVERSARY\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, today is the 51st \nanniversary of Head Start.\n  Fifty-one years ago, in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson announced the \ngroundbreaking program. In that year, a shy little girl and the \ndaughter of Mexican immigrants enrolled in Head Start, and it changed \nher life. That little girl was me.\n  In this Chamber, when we fiercely debate funding education, we are \nsometimes too removed from the reality of the everyday struggles that \nare facing America's children and just how wide that opportunity gap \nis.\n  Even though I stand before you here as a Congresswoman, I also stand \nbefore you as a child of Head Start. Universal, early childhood \neducation is the best investment we can make to close that education \ngap. I know this because I am living proof of it. Head Start was not \nmerely something that helped me; it has helped 32 million children and \ntheir parents to prepare for school. It has prepared them for life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2712-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROTECTING AND DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF LGBT EMPLOYEES IN THE DEFENSE \n                           AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  (Mr. ISRAEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, today and this week we will debate the \nnational defense authorization. This is part of our most fundamental \nobligation as Members of Congress, to protect and defend the \nConstitution of the United States of America.\n  However, there is a provision that is inserted into this bill that \ndoesn't protect and defend--it discriminates. It is a provision in this \nbill that would effectively stop an executive order that says that \nFederal contractors cannot discriminate against employees because they \nhappen to be LGBT. I want to say this again. In the defense \nauthorization, House Republicans have inserted a provision to empower \nand enable the discrimination of LGBT employees. That is not protecting \nand defending. That is discrimination. That is divisive. It is \ndisgusting.\n  Our job is to protect and defend the American people and not inject \nthe defense budget with ideologies that are based on protecting a \npolitical base, Mr. Speaker. It is a disservice to our troops, and it \nis a disservice to our national security to inject such poisonous \nlanguage into a defense budget that is meant to protect and defend the \nconstitutional rights of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2712-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL VOLUNTEER FIRE COUNCIL\n\n  (Mr. PASCRELL asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PASCRELL.

The brave men and women who \nvolunteer their time are professionals who put their lives on the line \nevery day.\n  Founded in 1976, the NVFC came together in Chicago to provide a \nunified voice for volunteer firefighters across our Nation. With this \nguiding vision, the NVFC has grown its ranks to a board comprised of 49 \nState fire service associations and with a membership of nearly 20,000 \nindividual and department members. Today, volunteers have a strong \nvoice at the table when it comes to critical fire and emergency service \nissues thanks to the NVFC.\n  The organization has been there to meet the challenges that \nvolunteers face and to address critical issues every day.

Res. 716\n\n       Whereas the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising has \n     a particular resonance in the United States;\n       Whereas, from the foundation of the United States, Irish \n     people and the millions of United States citizens of Irish \n     descent have helped to shape its history;\n       Whereas, in the words of President John F. Kennedy, ``No \n     people ever believed more deeply in the cause of Irish \n     freedom than the people of the United States'';\n       Whereas 5 of the 7 signatories of the 1916 Proclamation of \n     Independence spent periods of time in the United States that \n     significantly influenced their thinking and actions;\n       Whereas the United States is the only foreign country \n     specifically mentioned in the Proclamation;\n       Whereas the contemporary ties between the United States and \n     Ireland are of extraordinary depth and breadth;\n       Whereas continued United States engagement in the Northern \n     Ireland peace process is vital to safeguarding the gains made \n     since the Good Friday Agreement;\n       Whereas the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising \n     offers an opportunity for remembrance, reconciliation, and \n     reimagining of the future;\n       Whereas, on the 17th and 18th of May 2016, the Taoiseach \n     (Prime Minister of Ireland) will visit Washington, DC, for \n     events commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter \n     Rising; and\n       Whereas more than 200 other commemorative events will take \n     place across the United States to mark the anniversary: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) recalls the special ties between Ireland and the United \n     States, continually sustained and strengthened throughout the \n     intertwined history of both countries;\n       (2) welcomes the program of commemorations in the United \n     States marking the 100th anniversary of Ireland's 1916 \n     Rising, including the events taking place in Washington DC; \n     and\n       (3) recognizes the importance of nurturing and renewing the \n     unique relationship between the United States and Ireland and \n     their peoples into the future.\n\n               Amendment Offered by Mr. King of New York\n\n  Mr. KING of New York.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule for consideration of both H.R. 5243, the Zika Response \nAppropriations Act of 2016, and H.R. 4974, the Military Construction \nand Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 5243 under a closed rule \nwith an hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and \nranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, along with a motion \nto recommit.\n  In addition, the rule provides for an open rule for consideration of \nthe MILCON-VA appropriations bill for FY 2017. It also provides for a \nmotion to recommit on the MILCON-VA bill.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the rule includes three budget provisions, \nwhich allow for the enforcement of the OCO firewall, allow for Members \nto deposit savings from their amendments in a spending reduction \naccount, and provides limitations on advance appropriations consistent \nwith the budget resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present H.R. 5243 to the House for its \nconsideration. As I said in the Rules Committee yesterday, the debate \nover this legislation isn't about whether or not we provide resources \nfor Zika, it is about whether or not we pay for it through our existing \nresources or just add it to the national debt. I am pleased that we \nhave chosen the former course.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5243 provides an additional $622.1 million, for a \ntotal of over $1.2 billion to fight the Zika outbreak. H.R. 5243 \nprovides additional money to the Centers for Disease Control for \nmosquito control and programs for prenatal care, delivery, and \npostpartum care. In addition, we provide the NIH with the resources \nneeded to develop vaccines and diagnostic tests.\n  In addition, as opposed to the President's request, this legislation \nmaintains important oversight restrictions on the use of these funds. \nUnderstandably, they must be used solely for Zika. The President's \nsupplemental request, in addition to not being paid for, would allow \nthe so-called emergency funds to be used for almost anything.\n  Importantly, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is fully offset by using \nleftover, unobligated Ebola funds and the unused Health and Human \nServices administrative funding. In addition, Mr. Speaker, this \nlegislation reflects the emergency of this situation by making these \nfunds available through the end of this fiscal year.\n  Yesterday, Chairman Rogers told the Rules Committee that a standalone \npiece of legislation stands the best chance of becoming law. If we were \nto attach this measure as part of one of the fiscal year 2017 \nappropriations bills, as the Senate has done, there is no guarantee \nthat it would be enacted swiftly. In my opinion, the best way to ensure \nits quick enactment is through standalone legislation, like H.R. 5243.\n  In addition to the Zika response appropriations bill, this rule \nallows for the consideration of the first appropriations bill \nconsidered by the House for FY 2017, the MILCON-VA appropriations bill.\n  I am pleased that the House is, once again, going through regular \norder and considering appropriations bills under an open process. As a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, I am always proud that we can \nbring these bills up under an open process where all Members have the \nopportunity to bring their ideas for an up-or-down vote by the entire \nHouse.\n  H.R. 4974 provides $73.5 billion in discretionary funding for the \nVeterans Administration, a 3-percent increase over FY16. In addition, \nit includes important oversight and good government provisions, like \npreventing the closure of Guantanamo Bay, prohibiting bonuses for all \nVA Senior Executive Service personnel, and increased oversight, like \nrequiring large-scale construction projects to be managed by an outside \nentity so that mistakes like the Denver VA health facility, now $1 \nbillion over budget, will never be repeated.\n  I am encouraged by the hard work of Chairman Rogers and Ranking \nMember Lowey for their commitment to regular order and ensuring that \nthe power of the purse is one that this House can continue to exercise. \nBoth the Zika Response Appropriations Act and the FY 2017 MILCON-VA \nbill demonstrate our commitment to that end.\n  I urge support for the rule and the underlying legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nI thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for yielding me the \ncustomary 30 minutes for debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for H.R. 4974, the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, and H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations \nAct.\n  There are many things to praise in the military construction and VA \nappropriations bill. This is the first of the FY17 appropriations bills \nto reach the floor, and I hope that we soon have the opportunity to \nvote on other important appropriations packages.\n  The legislation, as pointed out by my good friend, provides $81.6 \nbillion in total discretionary funding for fiscal year 2017 to fund \nmilitary construction projects and programs within the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. It provides funding to hire 242 new VA staff to help \nreduce the VA's backlog in processing claims, as well as important \nfunding for mental health programs and suicide prevention outreach. \nCertain VA medical services, including long-term care for veterans and \nsupport services for caregivers, are also included in this bill, which \nincrease health program funding by approximately 5 percent as compared \nto the last fiscal year.\n  As co-chair of the Congressional Homelessness Caucus, I also welcome \nthe inclusion of the President's full fiscal year '17 request for \nveterans homelessness outreach programs in this legislation. We have \nmade great progress in our work to end veteran homelessness, and these \nprograms play a critical role in getting our veterans off the streets.\n\n[[Page H2715]]\n\n  However, despite these points, the bill is not without criticism. The \nadditional language that indiscriminately denies performance awards as \nwell as the inclusion of other ideologically divisive provisions that \nare outside the scope of this legislation, to me, are problematic. \nBecause of these provisions, the President has indicated that he will \nveto this legislation in its current form. So it is my hope that we can \nwork together to present a final package that will be able to become \nlaw, providing the important funding that our military servicemen and -\nwomen, their spouses, and our veterans need and rightly deserve.\n  I now turn to debate the Republican majority's so-called response to \nZika. Despite any hope I had that the generally bipartisan effort \ncrafting the military construction and VA appropriations bill may \nperhaps signal that my friends in the majority are suddenly able to \ngovern responsibly, I am beyond disappointed in the inadequate measure \npresented here today.\n\n  Nearly 3 months ago, the President requested Congress to provide $1.9 \nmillion to combat the spread of the Zika virus. This number was based \non what our Nation's top experts and scientists at the National \nInstitutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and elsewhere \nbelieve is needed to meet the challenges of this impending public \nhealth emergency.\n  Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, our national \ntop expert on infectious diseases, has warned that if we don't provide \nfunding at this level, and I quote him, ``that is going to have a very \nserious negative impact on our ability to get the job done.''\n  So, naturally, after these warnings and nearly 3 months after the \nadministration's request, what have my friends in the Republican \nmajority presented today? A bill with a funding level less than one-\nthird of the amount our Nation's top doctors tell us is needed to win \nthe fight against the Zika virus.\n  I fear that in trying to address the Zika virus, my Republican \ncolleagues are many days late and many dollars short. This decision \nrisks worsening an already severe crisis. As of May 11, the Centers for \nDisease Control reports the following: In the continental United \nStates, there have been 503 reported travel-associated cases of Zika. \nIn the United States territories, including Puerto Rico, American \nSamoa, and the United States Virgin Islands, there are 698 locally \nacquired vector-borne cases reported.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  While these numbers may seem small, we must take into account that we \nare not even in the summer months, and mosquito season has not even \nstarted. Despite these troubling figures, if you want to learn what is \nmost important to the majority and their response to this emergency, \none need look no further than the summary of this bill prepared by the \nCommittee on Appropriations Republicans. At the top of that summary, \nthey noted for their Members that the funding was ``entirely offset.'' \nThis statement was underlined, bolded, and italicized.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are facing a public health emergency, and apparently \nthe most important thing to my friends on the other side isn't that we \naddress this emergency head-on with adequate and robust emergency \nfunding but, rather, that we make sure what little funding they are \nallocated doesn't cost new money to do so. I guess my Republican \nfriends will be at ease in the face of this looming public health \nemergency knowing that their response to pay for it is ``offset.''\n  One would think that the duty to provide an appropriate level of \nfunding to respond to a national health crisis would be enough to \ngarner a ``yes'' vote from the Republican majority. Apparently not.\n  I represent one of the States that everyone agrees will be hardest \nhit by the Zika virus. Indeed, Florida already reported 106 travel-\nrelated cases. Twenty-two of the cases in Florida are from Palm Beach \nand Broward County, areas that I represent. When the summer months come \nand this emergency worsens, I don't think my constituents will be at \nease knowing that at least the money Republicans approved of was an \noffset.\n  Later, Mrs. Nita Lowey, the ranking member of the Committee on \nAppropriations, the subject matter for today, is going to make \nstatements. I haven't had an opportunity to talk with her this morning, \nbut yesterday in the Committee on Rules I asked her whether or not, \nwhen other emergencies have come up, it has been required that they be \noffset, and her response was that it was not.\n  She, like myself, has been here during a lot of emergencies that we \nmust and, rightly, should address for the American citizenry. This \nhappens to be one more, and here we are haggling about offset rather \nthan addressing the seriousness of this public national health \nemergency.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to begin by agreeing with my friend in terms of the \nappropriations process itself. He is right to celebrate the appearance \nof one of the bills down here under an open rule, just as I am sure my \nfriend is aware, the Committee on Appropriations, under Mr. Rogers' and \nMrs. Lowey's able leadership, has actually produced a series of bills \nready and lined up. So I have no doubt this is the first of many \nbills--I would hope all bills--that we eventually see on the floor that \nevery Member has an opportunity to come down here and amend as they see \nfit.\n  I also want to appreciate what my friend had to say about the VA and \nmilitary construction bill. I think he is absolutely correct. That is \none of our very best subcommittees. Chairman Dent and Congressman \nBishop are chair and ranking member. They work together extremely well. \nWhile I know my friend has some concerns with specific provisions of \nthat, again, this is a process. As he knows, this is our opening \nprocess. We will see what happens. I think at the end of the day, that \nparticular legislation will garner a great deal of bipartisan support, \nin part because of the very points my good friend made in talking about \nthe bill.\n  Now let's move to Zika. Here, we obviously have a different point of \nview. Let me posit some things, Mr. Speaker, that perhaps those \nwatching this debate and discussion aren't aware of.\n  First, $600 million has already been deployed for Zika. That was out \nof money set aside for both Ebola and other infectious diseases. That \nmoney, by the way, totaled over $5 billion originally. There is still \nclose to $3 billion of it left. It was to be spent over several years.\n  So when the President made his request, the initial response from \nChairman Rogers was, spend this money now. Don't wait on Congress to \nact. You have got available resources. The administration eventually \nagreed with that point of view.\n  So to this point, nothing has been left undone because of money. \nEverything the Federal Government has wanted to do has been fully \nfunded. And, indeed, in that fund, there is still well over $2 billion, \nso literally everything it plans to do in the timeframe it plans to do \nit can be done. So that is $600 million of the $1.9 billion immediately \navailable.\n  This bill would provide another $622 million, which is actually more \nmoney than the administration plans to spend in this fiscal year. So \nthey will have more than enough resources. In the bill, there is \nactually money included for the National Institutes of Health that will \nnot be spent until next year as they work through the process of \ndeveloping vaccines and diagnostics. So there is more than adequate \nfunding here.\n  Finally, in the remainder of the year, when we get to the Labor-HHS \nbill and the foreign operations bill, we will put in literally hundreds \nof millions more money for fiscal year 2017. That $1.9 billion isn't to \nbe used right now. It is to be used over a 2-year period, so you don't \nneed all of it right now.\n  The key difference is not the amount of money. The key difference is, \nnumber one, this is offset. My friend is correct about that. It is paid \nfor. Rather than saying we are going to just immediately add an \nadditional $1.9 billion to the national debt, say: Look, we have money \nset aside; we have got money here we can offset through other unused \nfunds, and we have got money in the regular appropriations process for \nnext year.\n  All of this can and should be paid for. Frankly, it is not like a \nHurricane\n\n[[Page H2716]]\n\nSandy or a Hurricane Katrina with massive damage, immediate response \nrequired. This is actually smaller, more manageable, and these are \nmoneys spent over not a short period of time, but over a couple of \nyears. So this is actually the prudent way to actually move forward on \nthis money.\n  But again, the important thing to know is everything that has needed \nto be done has been done. There hasn't been anything delayed. Nothing \nhas been set back. Frankly, what Mr. Rogers offers us will actually \nspeed money to the process.\n  The debate, here again, as I said in my opening remarks, isn't about \nZika; it is about whether or not you want to pay for the response, and \nthat requires some tough choices to be made. That means other things \nthat aren't emergency might not get as much funding.\n  The administration, like anybody else, if they can have their cake \nand eat it too, is delighted to do so. The more prudent path is to \nactually pay for the emergency that you have if you can. If you can't, \nthen you move to something bigger. But in this case, we have the \nability to do that, and I think we ought to do it.\n  I would hope our friends work with us on this. We see that this is an \nemergency. We have provided money immediately. We are moving now, \nprudently, to provide additional money, more than is needed in the \nshort term and, frankly, as the bills roll out, you will see that there \nwill be additional money yet to come--money that, by the way, was not \nintended to be spent until next year anyway. So there is no reason to \nspend it all right now.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am \ngoing to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up the Democratic \nalternative Zika bill that provides the administration with the $1.9 \nbillion its top scientific and medical experts say is needed to mount a \nrobust response to the Zika crisis without jeopardizing its ability to \naddress other public health threats, like Ebola.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Appropriations and my good friend, to discuss our \nproposal.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, the Republican Zika bill provides $622 \nmillion, about one-third of the $1.9 billion requested. The bill also \nsteals more Ebola funding as an offset instead of replenishing what was \nalready redirected to Zika. We don't offset spending to respond to \nemergencies, and we certainly don't steal from prior emergency response \nefforts still underway when a new emergency arises.\n  Let's just consider, my friends, recent history.\n  Emergency funding was provided to respond to both Ebola and H1N1. In \nlast year's omnibus, Congress used emergency funding without offsets to \npay for wildland fire suppression, mostly in the West. Congress also \nprovided emergency funding to respond to two hurricanes and flooding in \nthe Carolinas and Texas, again without offsets.\n  When those disasters struck, we didn't steal money from prior \ndisaster response, like the emergency funding provided for hurricane \ndamage in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida; or storms in \nWest Virginia; or tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kentucky. In fact, after \nthe 2013 Oklahoma tornadoes, my friend, Chairman Rogers, said: ``I \ndon't think disasters of this type should be offset. We have an \nobligation to help these people.''\n  Now that the Zika public health emergency has ravaged Brazil, spread \nto Puerto Rico, and threatens an outbreak in the continental United \nStates, suddenly Republicans insist on shortchanging efforts to ensure \nthe deadly Ebola virus doesn't reemerge to pay for Zika response. The \nmoney they would take from Ebola isn't nearly enough to prevent the \nspread of the deadly Zika virus that especially endangers pregnant \nwomen and children who could be born with very severe disabilities.\n  If the previous question is defeated, Mr. Hastings will amend the \nrule to offer my bill, H.R. 5044, as a substitute, providing the full \n$1.9 billion the administration requested without offsets to ensure an \nadequate response to Zika that doesn't rob our Ebola response. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me begin by thanking my good friend for her wonderful work on \nthat committee. She has had the opportunity to serve on her \nsubcommittee when she was a subcommittee chairman and now to work with \nher ranking member. There is no better person than Nita Lowey on that \ncommittee.\n  However, we are going to disagree a little bit here. First of all, \nwhen you say the bill only provides a third, of course, you have \nalready got a third. The first $600 million is the first third. That \nhas already been deployed. It is being spent. This is the next third. \nThe remaining third is money that will be spent--by the way, not this \nyear, but next year--and it will be presented in the normal \nappropriations bills.\n  I happen to chair one of those committees, the so-called Labor-HHS \nSubcommittee, the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation. We will have hundreds of millions of dollars in that bill \nfor next year's Zika response. So to suggest that somebody is being \nshortchanged, the money is just being prudently laid out at an \nappropriate pace and paid for along the way. That is point number one.\n  Point number two, again, this isn't a debate about the disease. It \nwas this committee and our chairman who immediately responded and said: \nYou have extra money left.\n  Now, by the way, the Ebola money, if you go back and look at the \nlegislation, is Ebola and other infectious diseases.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  In other words, when Congress appropriated that, they knew they might \nbe appropriating more than was needed for Ebola and there might be \nother crises to come up. So that money is being used exactly the way it \nis supposed to be used.\n  The Appropriations Committee has assured that both the CDC and the \nNIH and the administration that, should additional money be required--\nand there is still almost $2 million of Ebola money--and if you need \nmore and you are going to spend it over the next several years, come \nback and we will sit down and we will work with you and get you the \nmoney.\n  So this suggestion that somehow the fight against Ebola has been \nsidelined or cut short or shortchanged, again, is simply not true.\n  My friends use a lot of rhetoric here, largely to hide the fact that \nwhile we have got plenty of available money both set aside in the \nnormal appropriations process and certainly in this bill of Chairman \nRogers to pay for things, they just simply want to add it to the \nnational debt. They don't want to use available resources. They don't \nwant to operate within the normal Appropriations Committee, I guess \nbecause they want to spend that money someplace else.\n  To suggest that anybody is disingenuous or shortchanging either Zika \nor Ebola simply doesn't square with reality. It was Congress, after \nall--a Republican majority in the House and a Democratic majority in \nthe Senate, but, frankly, a genuinely bipartisan effort--that voted the \n$5 billion-plus for Ebola in the first place.\n  Last year, the President asked for a billion-dollar increase at the \nNational Institutes of Health. We gave him a $2 billion increase. I \ncan't remember the precise number last year, but I do remember we \nappropriated more for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nthan the President requested.\n  So it is not as if these things are not a priority. I think they are \na priority on both sides of the aisle. We have proven that by bringing \nappropriations bills to the floor beyond what the President requested. \nBut we think the prudent thing to do is not just willy-nilly add $1.9 \nbillion worth of debt on the American taxpayer, particularly when the \nmoney is at hand to pay for what we need right now and we have an \nappropriations bill coming up in June\n\n[[Page H2717]]\n\nwhere the rest of it can be taken care of and we can actually monitor \nthis thing.\n  On the Ebola crisis, we may well have appropriated more than we \nneeded to. That is why we have the other infectious diseases. In fact, \nif you look at the administration's budget proposal, they actually were \ntaking $40 million out of this same pot of money to spend on unrelated \nmalaria suppression abroad.\n  I am not quarreling with that--that is fine--but it suggests, again, \neven the administration thought, ``Well, maybe there is more money than \nwe need in here for Ebola, or we can count on Congress to come back,'' \nwhich, by the way, is true if they need more money.\n  This is all about trying to circumvent the appropriations process and \ntrying to add debt when there are sufficient resources available. If \nthere were not, then that would be another matter. I agree with my \nfriends: the response is important. But in this case, because the \nresponse is spread out over 2 years, you have plenty of time. And this \nis a relatively modest amount of money. This isn't like an $80 billion \nexpenditure that we had for Hurricane Sandy. We can do this in a \nthoughtful and prudent way and avoid the debt that is associated with \nemergency spending.\n  We want to continue to work with the administration. We have \ndemonstrated in the past that we are willing to fund NIH and CDC above \nadministration-recommended levels. We responded quickly during the \nEbola emergency. We think this is the appropriate way to go.\n  The Senate is moving a vehicle, as we all know. At some point, if we \npass this--and I think we will--we will sit down with our friends, and \nwe will hammer out a common response. But, again, do remember that \nnothing is not being done for lack of money. Everything the \nadministration has wanted to do to date, it has had the resources to \ndo. And we will continue to make sure that it does.\n  At the end of the day, we think they ought to be paid for, since we \nhave the ability to do that. And that is what we are trying to \naccomplish: keep debt off the back of the American taxpayer, if we \npossibly can. In this case, we can and we should.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, before yielding to my good friend from Texas, I include \nin the Record a letter from the White House over the signature of Shaun \nDonovan, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Susan \nRice, National Security Adviser, directed to the Speaker of the House, \nPaul D. Ryan, on April 26, 2016.\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan: As you are aware, on February 22, the \n     Administration transmitted to Congress its formal request for \n     $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental funding to address the \n     public health threat posed by the Zika virus. Sixty-four days \n     have passed since this initial request; yet still Congress \n     has not acted.\n       Since the time the Administration transmitted its request, \n     the public health threat posed by the Zika virus has \n     increased. After careful review of existing evidence, \n     scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC) concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of \n     microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. The Zika \n     virus has spread in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands and abroad. As of April 20, there were 891 \n     confirmed Zika cases in the continental United States and \n     U.S. territories, including 81 pregnant women with confirmed \n     cases of Zika. Based on similar experiences with other \n     diseases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito--believed \n     to be the primary carrier of the Zika virus--scientists at \n     the CDC expect there could be local transmission within the \n     continental U.S. in the summer months. Updated estimate range \n     maps show that these mosquitoes have been found in cities as \n     far north as San Francisco, Kansas City and New York City.\n       In the absence of action from Congress to address the Zika \n     virus, the Administration has taken concrete and aggressive \n     steps to help keep America safe from this growing public \n     health threat. The Administration is working closely with \n     State and local governments to prepare for outbreaks in the \n     continental United States and to respond to the current \n     outbreak in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. We are \n     expanding mosquito control surveillance and laboratory \n     capacity; developing improved diagnostics as well as \n     vaccines; supporting affected expectant mothers, and \n     supporting other Zika response efforts in Puerto Rico, the \n     U.S. territories, the continental United States, and abroad. \n     These efforts are crucial, but they are costly and they fall \n     well outside of current agency appropriations. To meet these \n     immediate needs, the Administration conducted a careful \n     examination of existing Ebola balances and identified $510 \n     million to redirect towards Zika response activities. We have \n     also redirected an additional $79 million from other \n     activities. This reprogramming, while necessary, is not \n     without cost. It is particularly painful at a time when state \n     and local public health departments are already strained.\n       While this immediate infusion of resources is necessary to \n     enable the Administration to take critical first steps in our \n     response to the public health threat posed by Zika, it is \n     insufficient. Without significant additional appropriations \n     this summer, the Nation's efforts to comprehensively respond \n     to the disease will be severely undermined. In particular, \n     the Administration may need to suspend crucial activities, \n     such as mosquito control and surveillance in the absence of \n     emergency supplemental funding. State and local governments \n     that manage mosquito control and response operations will not \n     be able to hire needed responders to engage in mosquito \n     mitigation efforts. Additionally, the Administration's \n     ability to move to the next phase of vaccine development, \n     which requires multi-year commitments from the Government to \n     encourage the private sector to prioritize Zika research and \n     development, could be jeopardized. Without emergency \n     supplemental funding, the development of faster and more \n     accurate diagnostic tests also will be impeded. The \n     Administration may not be able to conduct follow up of \n     children born to pregnant women with Zika to better \n     understand the range of Zika impacts, particularly those \n     health effects that are not evident at birth. The \n     supplemental request is also needed to replenish the amounts \n     that we are now spending from our Ebola accounts to fund \n     Zika-related activities. This will ensure we have sufficient \n     contingency funds to address unanticipated needs related to \n     both Zika and Ebola. As we have seen with both Ebola and \n     Zika, there are still many unknowns about the science and \n     scale of the outbreak and how it will impact mothers, babies, \n     and health systems domestically and abroad.\n       The Administration is pleased to learn that there is \n     bipartisan support for providing emergency funding to address \n     the Zika crisis, but we remain concerned about the adequacy \n     and speed of this response. To properly protect the American \n     public, and in particular pregnant women and their newborns, \n     Congress must fund the Administration's request of $1.9 \n     billion and find a path forward to address this public health \n     emergency immediately. The American people deserve action \n     now. With the summer months fast approaching, we continue to \n     believe that the Zika supplemental should not be considered \n     as part of the regular appropriations process, as it relates \n     to funding we must receive this year in order to most \n     effectively prepare for and mitigate the impact of the virus.\n       We urge you to pass free-standing emergency supplemental \n     funding legislation at the level requested by the \n     Administration before Congress leaves town for the Memorial \n     Day recess. We look forward to working with you to protect \n     the safety and health of all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Shaun Donovan,\n       Director, The Office of Management and Budget.\n     Susan Rice,\n       National Security Advisor.\n\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Excerpting from that letter a portion of the first \nparagraph on the second page, let me read what is said, in partial \nresponse to my good friend from Oklahoma:\n  ``Without significant additional appropriations this summer, the \nNation's efforts to comprehensively respond to the disease will be \nseverely undermined. In particular, the administration may need to \nsuspend crucial activities, such as mosquito control and surveillance, \nin the absence of emergency supplemental funding.\n  ``State and local governments that manage mosquito control and \nresponse operations will not be able to hire needed responders to \nengage in mosquito mitigation efforts. Additionally, the \nadministration's ability to move to the next phase of vaccine \ndevelopment, which requires multiyear commitments from the government \nto encourage the private sector to prioritize Zika research and \ndevelopment, could be jeopardized.\n  ``Without emergency supplemental funding, the development of faster \nand more accurate diagnostic tests also will be impeded. The \nadministration may not be able to conduct followup of children born to \npregnant women with\n\n[[Page H2718]]\n\nZika to better understand the range of Zika impacts, particularly those \nhealth effects that are not evident at birth.\n  ``The supplemental request is also needed to replenish the amounts \nthat we are now spending from our Ebola accounts to fund Zika-related \nactivities. This will ensure we have sufficient contingency funds to \naddress unanticipated needs related to both Zika and Ebola. As we have \nseen with both Ebola and Zika, there are still many unknowns about the \nscience and scale of the outbreak and how it will impact mothers, \nbabies, and health systems domestically and abroad.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al \nGreen), my good friend.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned. I am concerned \nbecause, while the mosquito is not the unbeatable foe, it is the \ndeadliest living organism on the Earth. The deadliest life form is the \nmosquito.\n  Annually, the mosquito kills 1 million humans, mostly from malaria, I \nmust tell you, but I must tell you that they also kill by way of the \nWest Nile virus. In Houston, Texas, we have had people contract the \nWest Nile virus. We have people die. I would also mention that they are \nthe greatest survivors. They survived the dinosaurs.\n  We are dealing with a deadly foe. Make no mistake, the size should \nnot in any way cause us to believe that this is something we can take \nas less than a deadly enemy that we have to confront.\n  The World Health Organization has indicated that there may be as many \nas 4 million cases of the Zika virus from Zika-carrying mosquitoes in \nthe Americas. As of February 1, we had seven confirmed cases in \nHouston, Texas.\n  It appears, from what I have read, that standing water activates \nthem. It appears that rain can activate these mosquitos. If this is \ntrue, in Houston, Texas, given that we have just had the so-called tax \nday flood and because we are still being inundated with rain quite \nregularly--an 80 percent chance of rain today in Houston, an 80 percent \nchance tomorrow--it appears that we have the makings of a special \nproblem in Houston, Texas.\n  So, I am gravely concerned. I hope that we do all that we can to make \nsure that we get the necessary equipment and the necessary funding so \nthat this enemy can be confronted properly.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by actually agreeing with my friends \nand, certainly, my good friend from Texas. He is right about the danger \nthat we are dealing with. My friend from Florida is certainly right \nabout the severity of this. I think where they are wrong is the \nsuggestion that nothing has been done; $600 million has been deployed.\n  This bill is actually a response to the very letter that my good \nfriend from Florida read. This does provide the next third of the \nrequested money by the administration. And, frankly, the bill extends \nthis into next year to address the concerns my friend expressed about \nhaving a multiyear commitment.\n  The money in here for the National Institutes of Health, which is the \nlead agency in developing vaccine and diagnostics, is fully funded for \nwhat they have asked to be funded for next year. So this actually does \nthat.\n  Now, we will have an additional bill through committee in June where \nwe will provide additional resources for the CDC for next year and \nwhatever other things needed.\n  The total spending here on both sides is about the same. It is being \ndeployed right now. This is a response to some of the concerns. What \nconcerns my friends, I think, is they would just prefer not to pay for \nit. They would just prefer to add it to the national debt. Well, gosh, \nthat is a great thing to do, but that is probably how we ended up with \na deficit of over half a billion dollars for FY 2017 and a national \ndebt of over $19 trillion.\n  If this were something that we couldn't handle any other way--that we \nonly had an emergency--I would agree with my friends. I did that when \nwe had the Sandy relief. There was no other way for something that \nlarge. That is not the case here. This is $1.9 billion. Most of that \nmoney is coming out of the Labor-HHS bill, which, by the way, spends \n$163 billion a year.\n  If you can't fund $1.9 billion spaced over 2 years in a bill that \nprovides in that period of time around $320 billion, you are just not \ntrying.\n  This is all about being able to spend someplace else. And, again, not \none thing has not been done. Everything that anybody in the Federal \nGovernment has wanted to do, they have been able to do. In addition, \nthe Ebola money is not just the Ebola money; it is Ebola and other \ninfectious diseases. That is what it was there for. It was not just \nmeant to be spent only on Ebola.\n  Even after the $600 million, even after the money that is offset in \nthis bill, which is roughly at $350 million, that fund still will have \nalmost $2 billion in it that can deploy any way against infectious \ndiseases that the administration says it needs, and it has the \ncommitment of Appropriations, which has demonstrated again and again \nthat it will do this: If you run short in this area, we will backfill. \nThat is why we have appropriations bills moving now. We can take care \nof you. But we can do it within the budget limits negotiated with the \nadministration. That is prudent management of the money.\n  So, given the track record here, both in responding on Ebola and \nputting more money in the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control than \nthe administration expected and now moving quickly to be helpful here, \nI think we have either a misunderstanding or a manufactured crisis.\n  There is no crisis. There is a real challenge, and money needs to \nmove toward it now. That is exactly what we have done. That is exactly \nwhat we are doing in this bill. That is exactly what we will do in the \nappropriations bills that will be presented in Congress as the \nappropriations season progresses.\n  With that, I want to reassure my friend that the resources will be \nthere. They have been there thus far. They will continue to be there.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Doggett), my good friend.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the indifference by some in this Congress \nto a looming public health crisis is truly stunning.\n  This Republican bill cuts the emergency funding request for the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention by 80 percent. That is $4 \nout of every $5 it asks for that will be eliminated.\n  The Zika virus is a terrible virus. It eats away at the brain of a \nfetus and results in a family tragedy of a child who is born with very \nsevere birth defects. It will require costly lifetime care.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Zika can be sexually transmitted, and it has spread to many parts of \nTexas. We have Texas-tough mosquitoes, and the season is just beginning \nthere. We are on the cusp of an epidemic spreading across our region; \nmeanwhile, the Republicans are refusing to provide the resources to \nprevent it.\n  Now, I appreciate the very reassuring words that we have been hearing \nhere, but just this morning I sat down and met with the Director of the \nCenters for Disease Control, Dr. Tom Frieden, and I asked him: What \ndifference does it make that $4 out of every $5 you have asked for are \nbeing cut?\n  He said in our discussion: If this Republican bill is approved to \ndeny this vital CDC and NIH funding, we will not be able to develop the \ntools to diagnose the virus, combat the mosquitoes, and develop a safe \nand effective vaccine against it.\n  He said: We cannot monitor all of those who are being infected, have \nalready been infected, and the neighbors around them that another \nmosquito bite might transmit the virus to them.\n  He said: We cannot get back to Texas and other States' general \nemergency preparedness funds that we have taken away in order to try to \nfight the Zika virus.\n  To do the job effectively, this Administration needs more than four \nmonths of temporary funding. It needs long-term contracting authority \nto get at this crisis and to prevent it.\n  I think that disease control and prevention represents some of our \nbest and most effective investments in health. We can save a lifetime \nof suffering to so many families, and we can save millions of dollars \nof public and private monies that these children\n\n[[Page H2719]]\n\nborn with severe birth defects will have.\n  The gentleman is correct that the Republican Senate is considering \nthis matter. In fact, it not only considered it, but, finally, \nyesterday it approved legislation that offers almost twice as much in \nthe way of resources to address this crisis as the bill the gentleman \nis promoting today includes.\n  I say let's join together and reject this rule--reject it, and demand \nthat the Republican leadership respond with the funding necessary to \nprotect families across America from an emerging Zika tragedy.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to always recognize my good friend from Texas, who is really \none of my good friends in this body.\n  But I am not surprised that the Senate bill is twice as much money \nbecause it runs for twice the time. This bill runs to September 30th. \nThe Senate bill runs until September 30, 2017, so they are not \nmaterially that different.\n  What we have said is we would deal with next year's problem in the \nappropriations process for this year.\n  Now, again, I know my friend's concern is legitimate. I do. I don't \nhave any doubt about it. But I point out one more time, $600 million \nhas been appropriated or has been made available. This is an additional \n$600 million. This $1.2 billion for the time of this fiscal year is \nactually more than the administration had planned to spend in this \nperiod. It reaches into next year, but they will have it available for \nthis year if they need it.\n  They have another nearly $2 billion in Ebola/other infectious \ndiseases money, and they have the assurance that additional things are \ncoming.\n  The only difference here is, are you going to pay for it? Or are you \njust going to add it to the national credit card, another $2 billion, \nroughly, on the national debt, when you have the resources and the time \navailable to operate within the appropriation system?\n  So this debate, as I have said repeatedly, isn't about Zika. It is \nabout whether you pay to deal with Zika, or whether you would just like \nto do whatever you want to do and forget about paying for it.\n  Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury indefinitely. So this is a \nresponsible, well-thought-through measure. It is fully paid for.\n  Nobody is short of resources, nobody will be short of resources. The \nmoney is available to do whatever the administration wants to do. It is \nwell aware of that fact. And these are additional resources deployed \nhere, with the assurance of other resources that will be deployed \nduring the course of the normal appropriations process.\n  So I fail to see, when the amount of money is essentially the same on \nboth sides over essentially the same period, why we keep going back and \nacting as if this $600 million is all there is. There is another 600 \nthat has already been spent. There is more coming. It is coming in a \nregular way.\n  The only thing that upsets my friends on the other side is it is \nbeing paid for. I mean, how outrageous: we are actually going to pay \nfor a government activity that is important for us to accomplish, with \nthe assurance that if more is needed, more will be made available.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is the simple difference here, despite all the \ndiscussion about the disease, about readiness, is who is willing to pay \nfor what needs to be done and who, frankly, would just prefer to put on \nit the national credit card.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), my very good friend.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Members, I thank my colleague \nfrom the Committee on Rules and my classmate for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and to H.R. \n5243.\n  The last three Democratic speakers are from Texas. The Southeastern \nStates are ground zero for Zika and other diseases. It is the first \nknown vector-borne disease to cause microcephaly and other severe fetal \nbrain defects.\n  Our knowledge of the disease and how it is transmitted and its \ncomplications have evolved rapidly since the epidemic began, but there \nis still a lot unknown. We do not have rapid diagnostic tests or an \neffective vaccine against this virus.\n  The mosquito vector is actively present in several parts of the \nUnited States, including Houston and the Southern States. Current \nvector control efforts are uncoordinated and inadequate.\n  Cases of Zika are being introduced frequently by returning travelers, \nand mosquito season is rapidly approaching our community.\n  As of May 11, there were more than 1,200 confirmed Zika cases in the \ncontinental U.S. and U.S. territories. Robust action is required to \nprotect Americans, and this bill falls dramatically short of the \nresponse this epidemic demands.\n  H.R. 5243 only provides a third of the funds necessary to respond to \na Zika outbreak and, even worse, a large portion of the funding is \ntaken from money Congress has appropriated to respond to the Ebola \ncrisis. We are taking money away from researching Ebola cures to put on \nZika. Ebola will not go away. We cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.\n  My good friend from Oklahoma, I know in 2003, we sent legislators up \nto his district. I hope in Texas we don't send mosquitos up to his \ndistrict, because that could happen.\n  Congress has a constitutional and moral duty to protect the health \nand welfare of our country. I am saddened to say this bill fails to \nuphold our responsibilities to the American people.\n  Crises of this magnitude demand robust, multi-year investments in our \npublic health infrastructure, vaccine, diagnostic development, and \ntransmission control.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Funding to fight the Zika virus must be \ntreated as an emergency that is similar to past emergencies, like Ebola \nand H1N1 viruses. It should not be offset or use previously \nappropriated funds for other public health priorities. Doing so will \nonly continue the broken cycle of lurching from outbreak to outbreak.\n  Even worse, this bill only funds the Department of Health and Human \nServices' response until September 30. Mosquitos don't follow our \nfiscal year. This threat is real, immediate, and grave.\n  On behalf of American families, mothers, and the next generation, we \nmust do better.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and bring meaningful \nlegislation to the floor that adequately and responsibly funds our \nresponse to the Zika virus.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My good friend, Mr. Gene Green--and he is my good friend--as I \nrecall, those Texas legislators were called the Killer Bees. And if you \nwant to compare them to mosquitos, I will leave you that luxury and \nthat political risk. We just call Texas legislators welcome guests. So \nthey are welcome to come any time.\n  In terms of the point, though, I think I agree with much of what you \nsay, other than the last part of what you said about adequately, \nresponsibly funding. That is exactly what we are doing.\n  The total amount of money here we are talking about, my friends keep \nforgetting about this $600 million that has already been deployed, and \nthey keep suggesting that this is like only Ebola money.\n  That is not the way the legislation is written. It is written for \nEbola and other infectious diseases. In other words, we are using that \nmoney exactly the way we are supposed to use it, not shortchanging \nanybody.\n  If we need money later--because this is money that is to be spent \nover multiple years--we will come back and put it in. But that money, \nfrankly, if it had not been available, there would not have been an \nimmediate response possible. It was available, so it is being used in \nthe appropriate way.\n  This is the next third. So when we hear this talk about only a third \nof what the administration requested, we have already done a third. We \nare getting ready to do the next third, and we are telling you, in \nbills that are coming\n\n[[Page H2720]]\n\nto the floor, both State and foreign ops, and Labor-HHS, that there \nwill be additional money that will essentially total about what the \nadministration has asked to spend.\n  We recognize that these things do develop, do change. Our \nunderstanding of them changes over time. This is actually a thoughtful \nway to do this. But the assurance has been made: if you need more \nmoney, then you have got it. We will work with you. We will find a way \nto do it. Our assistance is, if we can pay for it, then we do pay for \nit; and that is exactly what we do in this bill.\n  We hear comparisons, erroneous comparisons, you are only doing half \nas much as the Republicans in the Senate. No. We are doing it through \nSeptember 30 of this year. They are doing it through September 30 of \nnext year. The amounts are essentially about the same.\n  The difference, then, is also the same, frankly, with all due respect \nto my friends in the Senate, we are offsetting and paying for this. And \nthat just seems, to us, the prudent way to do it, not to put more debt \non the back of the American taxpayer when you don't have to.\n  If we had some emergency that called for hundreds of billions of \ndollars or something of that nature, that would be different. That is \nnot what we are dealing with here.\n  Now, I have a lot of respect for my friend's concerns, but the \nchairman of our committee actually led a delegation to South America \npartially on this issue recently. I happened to have the privilege of \ngoing along with Chairman Rogers.\n  We stopped in Peru, where there is a Naval research station we have \noperated for decades. It normally focuses on tropical diseases--we have \na lot of issues with that when our military is deployed in those \nareas--but it is working around the clock on Zika and is doing some \ngreat work.\n  Then we went to Brazil, which is really the epicenter of this \noutbreak; sat down and talked with the Centers for Disease Control \npeople on the ground, which we did; talked with the Brazilian \ngovernment, which we did; saw, as Brazil was deploying literally \nhundreds of thousands, 220,000 of its own military personnel, to go \ndoor to door.\n  So I think probably Chairman Rogers has as good a grasp, with all due \nrespect, as anybody in this body on what is being done, what needs to \nbe done, and how to proceed.\n  At every step along the way, he has shown that resources are going to \nbe made available. They have been, but they are being made available in \na responsible, prudent way, with appropriate oversight, in a timely \nmanner, but in a manner which is offset and paid for.\n  That is what I think the American people want us to do: take care of \nwhat is important, do it right, do it responsibly, and pay for it if \nyou have the funds available before you automatically add it to the \ncredit card that our kids and grandkids are going to someday have to \npay off.\n  So we will continue to work with our friends. We will work with our \ncolleagues in the Senate. But to suggest for 1 minute that the Federal \nGovernment doesn't have the resources it needs, when it has much more \nthan it has asked sitting still unobligated in funds, is just simply \nnot the case. It has the money it needs. It is getting the resources in \nthe right way. We are simply paying for them.\n  I know that is hard for some of my friends to accept, but it is \nactually the appropriate way to proceed. We actually should do more of \nthis in this body rather than less.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has become clear that the Republican leadership has \neither abdicated its authority to govern to the far right of its party, \nor never had the wherewithal to do so in the first place.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Either way, the American people are tired of this majority's \ninability to address the issues facing our country.\n  During the 114th Congress, Republicans have brought to the floor \nbills with absolutely no hope of becoming law, strictly partisan \nmeasures that were more messaging bills than serious legislative \nproposals. We saw it a couple of weeks ago with a string of bills \nattacking the Internal Revenue Service to score political points during \ntax day.\n  None of that is going to become law. We have seen it with bills to \nweaken environmental protections or to limit a woman's right to choose. \nNow we see it with a bill that the President has threatened to veto \nbecause Republicans have included ideological riders. The majority \nseems to be more focused on scoring political points than actually \ngetting to the business of governing.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle attempt to merely swat \naway the looming public health crisis posed by the Zika virus. This \napproach is as lacking in leadership as it is callous. I can guarantee \nyou that the mosquitos carrying the Zika virus do not care if you are a \nDemocrat or a Republican. They do not care if the money used to stop \nthem is offset. But I can promise my Republican friends, pinching \npennies on basic investments to address a public health emergency will \ninevitably heighten costs--in dollars and lives--down the road.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank, as always, my \ngood friend from Florida. He is truly a delight to work with, one of \nthe really great Members in this body. Not surprisingly, he knows I \ndisagree with him on his characterization of the current Congress, \nbecause saying that we haven't done anything is forgetting what has \nactually happened.\n  This is the first Congress to pass a multiyear highway bill since \n2005 and the first one to overhaul common education since 2002. Last \nweek, we had opioid legislation on this floor that we all know is \ncritical and is certainly going to come into law, and it will be \nfunded. We had the first real human trafficking bill; an overhaul of \nthe Veterans Administration; a budget agreement that meant we had no \nclosures and no debt crisis; more funding for the National Institutes \nof Health--it has been one of the central issues in this debate--than \nthe President asked for last year, more new funding; and the same thing \nfor the Centers for Disease Control. So I actually argue it has been a \npretty productive Congress in many, many ways.\n  In terms of Zika, though, let's again get back and just clarify \nthings. The President asked for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. The \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee immediately said: You have got \nplenty of money. Use whatever you want; $600 million of that was used. \nIf you need that replenished, we will replenish that in the normal \ncourse of appropriations.\n  He now brings to the floor a bill that carries the next third of the \nfunding that the administration has asked for, fully offset, money that \nis more than they expect to spend from now until September 30. Some of \nthat money is available into next year, certainly the money that the \nNIH would need for diagnostics and vaccines. We will bring to the floor \nthe rest of it.\n  So the only thing that we really differ on is should we pay for this \nmajor effort or not when we have the resources. We have the resources. \nOurs is paid for. The administration's proposal is not. It is just that \nsimple. Do you just want to add $1.9 billion, or do you want to \nresponsibly work the problem?\n  This committee, the Appropriations Committee, has been at the \nforefront of responding to this every step along the way. It will \ncontinue to do so. We will work with our friends.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, the Constitution gives the Congress the \npower of the purse. Article I, section 9 gives that authority to \nCongress. While the President has every right and duty to submit a \nsupplemental appropriations request, it is the duty of Congress to \nexamine that request and provide for the funds and conditions it feels \nappropriate to execute them. That is exactly what we have done on Zika, \nand that is exactly what we have done on MILCON-VA.\n  With that in mind, I would encourage my friends to support the rule \nand the underlying legislation.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n[[Page H2721]]\n\n  \n\n\n          An amendment to H. Res. 736 Offered by Mr. Hastings\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     5044) making supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2016 \n     to respond to Zika virus. The first reading of the bill shall \n     be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration \n     of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to \n     the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among \n     and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of \n     the Committee on Appropriations and the chair and ranking \n     minority member of the Committee on the Budget. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XLX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 5044.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . . [and] has \n     no substantive legislative or policy implications \n     whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said. \n     Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative \n     Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th \n     edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the \n     previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is \n     generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority \n     Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . . When \n     the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of \n     the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to \n     ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then \n     controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or \n     yield for the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2721-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2721-H2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4909, NATIONAL DEFENSE \n                 AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 735 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 735\n\n       Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the state of the Union for further \n     consideration of the bill (H.R. 4909) to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities \n     of the Department of Defense and for military construction, \n     to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal \n     year, and for other purposes.\n       Sec. 2.

Amendments en bloc offered pursuant \n     to this section shall be considered as read, shall be \n     debatable for 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by \n     the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Armed Services or their designees, shall not be subject to \n     amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division \n     of the question in the House or in the Committee of the \n     Whole.\n       Sec. 4.

The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for \n1 hour.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alabama?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 735 provides for continued \nconsideration of H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2017.\n  The resolution provides for a structured rule and makes in order 120 \namendments. These amendments are on top of the 61 amendments that were \nmade in order by yesterday's rule. That is a combined 181 amendments on \none bill.\n  As I mentioned during yesterday's debate, the NDAA process has always \nbeen bipartisan. In fact, Congress has successfully passed the NDAA for \neach of the last 54 years. That is a really impressive accomplishment. \nI hope this year is no different.\n\n[[Page H2722]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my colleagues that the NDAA passed out \nof the Armed Services Committee by a vote of 60-2. That vote total is \nvery, very impressive and demonstrates the bipartisan nature in which \nour committee, the Armed Services Committee, operates.\n  Another thing I really appreciate about the NDAA process is how open \nit is and how so many different Members are able to have input into the \nfinal product. The first round of amendment debate yesterday was an \nexample of a healthy debate on a wide range of amendments.\n  You look around the country, and so many of our communities are home \nto important military assets and programs. Some communities are home to \nmilitary bases where we are training our future fighters. Other \ncommunities contribute to our military success with industry suppliers; \nand every single community across the country is home to \nservicemembers, whether Active Duty, Guard, or Reserve. Each of these \ncommunities faces unique challenges and offer different perspectives. \nThat is why I believe it is so important that we have such an open \nprocess to allow a wide range of views to be discussed and debated.\n  During the Armed Services Committee process, we considered 248 \namendments. When you add up the amendments considered at the committee \nlevel to the amendments we will consider on the floor, it brings us to \na huge total of 429 amendments on one bill. These amendments cover a \nrange of important issues from National Guard to cybersecurity, to \nsexual assault, to religious freedom, to military health care. Looking \nat specific security threats we face, these amendments address issues \nrelating to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Europe, Russia, and \nmany more places.\n  I know my colleague from Massachusetts is particularly interested in \nthe Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF, debate, as I am. \nAlthough the Foreign Affairs Committee, not the Armed Services \nCommittee, has jurisdiction over AUMFs, I was pleased that we were able \nto obtain the committee's approval for Ms. Lee's amendment to be made \nin order so the House can debate this issue on the floor. I know that \ndoesn't go as far as my colleague from Massachusetts would want it to \ngo, and I hope that there is a time when this body, after hearings in \nappropriate committees of jurisdiction, can have a full and informed \ndebate on a new AUMF, but we cannot do that under these circumstances \ntoday and give the American people the full and fair hearing that they \ndeserve.\n  A few of my colleagues have also expressed concerns about the way \nthis NDAA is funded. This rule makes in order an amendment by Mr. \nEllison that would cut money out of the overseas contingency operations \naccount. While I think these concerns are misguided, this rule allows \nthat debate to take place.\n  The rule makes in order an amendment by our Rules Committee \ncolleague, Mr. Polis, which would put in place a 1 percent across-the-\nboard reduction in total spending under the NDAA. Again, I think this \nwould be a grave error, but this rule provides for that important \ndebate.\n  We have heard bipartisan concerns about visa programs for certain at-\nrisk populations in Afghanistan, and this amendment makes in order a \nbipartisan amendment by Mr. Blumenauer to reform the Special Immigrant \nVisa program.\n  The rule allows for debate on another bipartisan amendment that would \nrequire the Department of Defense to report on China's activities in \nthe South China Sea in their annual report on Chinese military power. I \nthink this is an issue that is particularly important.\n  I hope this gets my point across that we have taken a comprehensive \nlook at national security issues and allowed a wide range of Members, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, to bring their amendments forward.\n  We hear a lot about the need for an open process. Again, I am very \npleased that, between the Armed Services Committee and the House floor, \n429 amendments will be considered. Given the large number of \namendments, I want to thank our Rules Committee staff who put in very \nlate hours to help sort through the amendments. I know it wasn't easy \nwork, but we certainly appreciate all that they do and the extra hours \nthey put in to help facilitate this debate.\n  Yesterday, I outlined why the National Defense Authorization Act is \nso critically important. I talked about the critical investment the \nbill makes to boost our military readiness. I discussed how the bill \nincreases accountability and efficiency at the Pentagon, and I \nhighlighted some of the critical reforms included in the bill.\n  I won't rehash these points, but I do want to reemphasize one key \npoint: every day we send our servicemembers into dangerous situations. \nWhen we do so, we don't send them into battle as Democrats or \nRepublicans. We send them into battle as Americans.\n  So as we continue working through this bill, I want to again plead \nwith my colleagues to avoid making this about politics. Instead, let's \nmake this about America and about ensuring our servicemembers have \nsound policy and the resources they need in order to keep our country \nsafe. We shouldn't--and, quite frankly, we can't--let politics get in \nthe way of passing this critical national security bill. Our military \nmen and women deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 735 and \nthe underlying bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama \n(Mr. Byrne) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield \nmyself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honorable \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Thornberry, and the \nranking member, Mr. Smith of Washington, for once again working in a \nbipartisan manner to bring before this House H.R. 4909, the 2017 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. I don't agree with everything that \nis in this bill. In fact, there is a lot I do disagree with. But I \nappreciate that the chairman and the ranking member always treat all \nMembers submitting amendments to the NDAA with respect, and that is \nvery much appreciated.\n  But I must rise in very strong opposition to this structured rule \nbecause there are very serious issues that merit the time and attention \nof this House that were submitted to the Rules Committee by Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle, which have not been included in this \nstructured rule. Almost 200 amendments were not made in order. As a \nDemocrat, I am used to being shut out by the Republican majority, but \ndozens of Republican amendments were blocked as well.\n  Let me say to my Republican friends who did not have their amendment \nmade in order: If you don't want this to be a pattern, then vote ``no'' \non this rule; if you don't want this to be a precedent, then vote \n``no'' on this rule. Send a message to your leadership that, in fact, \nyou want a more open and transparent process. Don't go along just to \nget along. Don't be a cheap date when it comes to an open process in \nthis House. The issues that are involved with the Defense Authorization \nAct are too important to be just blocked with no debate, no \ndeliberation, and no votes. My friend talks about an open process. Open \nprocess, my foot. It is not an open process. Almost 200 amendments were \nnot made in order. That is just not right.\n  Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing that disturbs me in particular \nabout this structured rule, it is how it fails the American people once \nagain in not allowing substantial debate about the issues of war and \npeace. Mr. Speaker, nothing is more critical than the issues of war and \npeace.\n  And once again, the Republicans on the Rules Committee have ensured \nthat no amendment that deals with authorizing the current U.S. military \nengagements in Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan was made in order. The only \namendment made in order is the one offered by the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lee) to repeal the 2001 AUMF for Afghanistan, an \namendment that she has courageously offered for several years now.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the amendments not made in order was an amendment\n\n[[Page H2723]]\n\noffered by me and several colleagues to prohibit the use of any U.S. \nfunds after April 30, 2017, for the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces to \nIraq or Syria in the fight against the Islamic State if an AUMF has not \nbeen enacted. This was a bipartisan amendment offered by \nRepresentatives Jones, Garamendi, Yoho, Lee of California, Cicilline, \nand myself.\n  And let me make one thing very clear, Mr. Speaker: this amendment is \nnot an AUMF. There is not one single syllable in this amendment that \nreflects the language of an AUMF.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee was very \nclear during the committee markup of the NDAA that AUMF amendments were \nnot the jurisdiction of his committee but, rather, the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. But this amendment is not an AUMF. And it is germane, by the \nway.\n  My amendment only prohibits the obligation and expenditure of funds \nafter April 30, which is the chairman's chosen date for the cutoff of \nall OCO funding, and then only for the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces \nto Iraq and Syria to combat ISIS, unless an authorization for that \npurpose has been enacted.\n  Quite simply, if you want the money to fight a war, then pass an \nAUMF. This amendment doesn't care who writes it. It doesn't care when \nit is debated or approved. It just requires that an AUMF be enacted by \nApril 30. If not, no more funds for U.S. troops in the air, on the \nwater, or on the ground until an AUMF is enacted.\n  All this amendment asks is that Congress do its job. We ask our men \nand women in the military to do their jobs, and Heaven only knows, they \ncarry out their duty with courage, honor, and professionalism. I only \nask that Congress do the same. This should not be too much to ask.\n  We have sent our uniformed men and women into harm's way in Syria and \nIraq for nearly 2 years now and still Congress refuses to do its duty \nand authorize their deployment. We have been bombing, we have got boots \non the ground and engaged in combat, and we have had troops killed in \naction, yet this Congress can't seem to debate and vote on an AUMF.\n  I personally believe that endless wars, endless bombing, and an ever-\nexpanding U.S. military footprint in the Middle East is not a \nsubstitute for efforts aimed at reconciliation and political solutions. \nThe status quo will not make the world more secure. I know some of my \ncolleagues differ with me, and that is fine, but let's have the debate. \nLet's have clarity in what we are doing, and let's make sure that what \nwe are doing works. Dodging responsibility only means that these wars \nwill remain on remote control, and that is sad.\n  Last night in the Rules Committee, we heard lots and lots and lots of \nexcuses. One of my favorite excuses that we heard last night was that \n10 minutes would not be enough time to debate such a serious matter as \nwhat my amendment proposes. Well, Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee can \nassign as much time as it wants to debate an amendment. That is what we \nare there for. Two hours, 3 hours, 3 days, 3 weeks if it wishes. That \nis what the Rules Committee is supposed to do: provide serious time to \ndebate serious issues.\n  I heard that the Foreign Affairs Committee should be and would be \ndrafting an AUMF. Fine. Terrific. If it comes out and is enacted before \nApril 30, then it would fit right in with my amendment. But if this \nHouse continues to dawdle and whine and shirk its duties, then there \nshould be no more money after April 30 for a war that hasn't been \nauthorized by Congress.\n  I was told that the Republican leadership doesn't like the AUMF that \nthe President sent to Congress over a year ago. Well, neither do I. I \nthink it is too broad. But, Mr. Speaker, if the majority or anyone here \ndoesn't like the President's AUMF, then it is the duty of Congress to \ndraft debate and vote upon its own version of an AUMF and send the bill \nback to the President for his signature or veto. That is how the system \nworks, or at least that is how it would work if this House ever managed \nto do its job.\n  I was told that the next President wouldn't have enough time to \nfigure out an AUMF for Iraq and Syria by April 30. But, Mr. Speaker, I \ndidn't choose April 30 as a date when all funds for the Overseas \nContingency Operations account would be cut off. That date is built \ninto the NDAA already. If April 30 is enough time for a new President \nand new Congress to ask for more money for these wars that are \nsupplemental, then it should be plenty of time for Congress to take up \nand debate an AUMF.\n  Now, of course, this Congress or the next one should and could take \nup an AUMF any day it so desires. I remember, in 2014, that Speaker \nBoehner told us that it would be better for the 114th Congress to \ndebate and pass an AUMF for Iraq and Syria rather than the 113th \nCongress. Well, here we are 16\\1/2\\ months into the 114th Congress with \nno thought of taking up an AUMF on battling the Islamic State.\n  I guess this Congress is just too damned chicken to do its job when \nit comes to war, and we are going to kick the can into the 115th \nCongress or maybe the 116th Congress. Enough with the excuses, enough. \nIn fact, I remember, last year, Speaker Ryan said an AUMF for Iraq and \nSyria for the war against the Islamic State would be one of the first \nthings this Congress would take up this year. Well, here we are in the \nmiddle of May and there is no AUMF in sight, just the same old tired \nexcuses, the same cowardice, the same political posturing.\n  There is no shortage of Members of Congress talking tough against \nISIS. We hear it all the time on the House floor. But let's be honest: \nthat takes absolutely no courage at all. None of us are on the \nfrontlines in Syria or Iraq. We are all safe and sound in the U.S. \nCapitol.\n  But think for a minute. What must be going through the minds of our \ntroops when they see a Congress that doesn't even have the guts to \ndebate these wars while they have been put in harm's way?\n  Every single Member of this House should be ashamed. Our collective \nsilence--our collective indifference--is dismissive of our \nconstitutional responsibility. This Chamber is guilty of moral \ncowardice.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are nearly 200 reasons to oppose this rule, and \nthat is how many of the amendments submitted to the Rules Committee \nwere not made in order under either the first rule to the NDAA or \ntoday's rule. Basically, 50 percent of all amendments submitted are not \nbeing allowed a chance to be heard.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this rule. I urge my colleagues to \nshow some backbone and demand that the majority leadership of this \nHouse carry out its constitutional duty to debate and vote on an AUMF \nfor Iraq and Syria.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts raises some very important points. It \nwould be appropriate for our Foreign Affairs Committee to take up those \npoints and consider them after we have had a lot of hearings, including \nan opportunity for a notice to the American people so the American \npeople can be heard.\n  Coming up with this sort of an idea that it is just going to come \nthrough the Rules Committee without any hearing, without any real \nexpertise in the Rules Committee to consider it, and then putting it on \nthe floor for limited debate is not the way to do it.\n  Now, I must admit I have some reservations about establishing a hard \nstop of April 30 of next year. Saying that we are going to allow the \nnext President to come forward with a new OCO proposal before April 30 \nof next year, which we did 8 years ago, is not the same thing. What my \ncolleague is proposing is a hard stop. That is exactly what the \nPresident did in Iraq: a hard stop. We pulled out, and look what \nhappened: absolute chaos, a nation that has gone from being a nation \ninto being a nation in total dissolution.\n  We came close to doing the same thing in Afghanistan. Thankfully, the \nPresident has pulled back from that. Because when we telegraph to our \nenemies, ``Hey, we are out of here after a certain date,'' they know \nwhen we are leaving, they know when we are stopping, and they know \nexactly how to time their activities against us. I don't think we \nshould give that opportunity to our enemies.\n  Now, I completely agree with my colleague from Massachusetts that we\n\n[[Page H2724]]\n\nneed a new AUMF. I have said that on multiple occasions. I have signed \nletters to that effect. And I do believe that we have a situation in \nSyria that is not authorized, as it should be under the law.\n  Why are we in this situation? Because we have yet to receive a \nstrategy from the Obama administration on how to prosecute that war. We \nhad the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard) before the committee last \nnight. She has fought over there. She knows this better than just about \nanybody in this room. She laid out clear deficiencies in the \nadministration's so-called plan, which they sent over to the Armed \nServices Committee 45 days later, and only after we had to browbeat the \nSecretary of Defense to meeting its statutory responsibility.\n  And she laid out clearly what we need to do in terms of a strategy. \nWe have yet to get that from the Commander in Chief of our own Armed \nForces. If we would get that, if we would get a clear strategy for \nvictory, not a clear strategy for some pie in the sky, we are going to \narm some Free Syrian Army that is not working, then I think we could \nhave something to work on to bring to this floor. The problem is we are \nhaving to put ourselves in the place of the Commander in Chief, which \nis not what the Constitution calls for, nor will it work. We are going \nto continue to struggle with this because of the failure of this \nadministration, not because of the failure of this House.\n  I agree with the gentleman: I want to see a new AUMF. I want to see \nit go through hearings. I want to see it debated on this floor so I can \nvote for it or against it, and everybody can vote for it or against it. \nBut the proposal he makes is not the right way to do that, so I hope \nthat we continue to reject it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  With respect to the gentleman, I don't think we agree with each \nother. The reason why we are doing this is because Congress has failed \nto act. The time for an AUMF is before you put troops in harm's way. \nSome of us tried before we entered into this latest Syrian war to \nactually have a debate on an AUMF, and we were denied that opportunity. \nWe are reengaged in Iraq. We asked before we did that, ``Let's have an \nAUMF,'' and we were denied that opportunity. We have been denied and \ndenied and denied and denied.\n  All we are saying is that we ought to do our job. The President \nsubmitted an AUMF to Congress. He did his job. You don't like it--I \ndon't like what he submitted either--but he did his job. He doesn't \ncontrol what we do here. We decide what to do. The Foreign Affairs \nCommittee 2 years ago could have taken this issue up. They didn't. They \nare not taking it up now. Here we are 2 years into these latest \nconflicts and nothing. It is shameful. Come on. We ought to come \ntogether, even if we disagree on what our strategy should be, and \ndebate this.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  We have no trouble sending our young men and women into harm's way; \nyet when it comes to doing our job, all of a sudden we have 1,000 \nexcuses why we can't do it. That is unacceptable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nKilmer).\n  Mr. KILMER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the NDAA is about ensuring that we have the best trained \nand equipped fighting force in the world. It is about honoring our \ncommitment to the men and women who serve and to their families. It is \nnot about targeting proud Americans simply based on who they love; but \nthis rule would effectively discriminate against LGBT men and women who \nserve our Nation as private contractors.\n  This rule runs contrary to our values. It runs contrary to what we \nbelieve in. It runs contrary to the idea that we treat everyone with \nequal respect. It also runs contrary to what the majority said it \nwants--a transparent process, allowing the House to work its will. This \nrule blocks an amendment that was offered by my Republican colleague, \nCharlie Dent, to strip this discriminatory provision from even being \nconsidered.\n  As we approach Memorial Day, our focus should be on providing our \nservicemembers with the proper tools so that they may carry out their \nmissions, not on pushing forward provisions that target LGBT Americans. \nLet's vote down this rule. Let's strip this harmful policy from the \nNDAA so that we remain committed to equal rights, and let's get back to \ndebating how best to support our troops.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's comment. This is something that we had \nsome significant discussion about last night in the Committee on Rules.\n  Let's make sure that the facts are straight. There is not one single \nthing in this bill that discriminates against anybody. In fact, in the \nprovision he is talking about, there is not one single mention of LGBT.\n  What is in that provision is a clear application by this law of \nprotections of religious liberties that people have enjoyed in this \ncountry since the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act--one of the \nhallmarks of the legislative achievements of this body and an act, I \nbelieve, everybody in this body supports today. It says that the \nreligious protections in that law that we are all so proud of should be \nenjoyed by people who have Federal contracts. Private parties that \ncontract with the government should enjoy religious freedom. That is \nnot discrimination. That is protecting the rights of the American \npeople. Sometimes we get confused around here about that, and we are \ngetting confused in the military bill about that, and that is very \ntroublesome.\n  Let's talk about the First Amendment.\n  The First Amendment says that the government can't do anything to \nrestrict the expression of religion, the practice of religion, the \nbelief of religion by anybody in this country. It is called the Free \nExercise Clause. We have forgotten the Free Exercise Clause in this \nbody and in this country. We need to go back to it.\n  About 20 years ago, this body passed the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act. It was so popular that it passed by a voice vote. It \nhad just a handful of people who voted against it in the Senate. It \nspecifically requires that we do exactly what is in this bill. We are \nbeing consistent with that law by putting this provision in there.\n  What do we do with this particular provision?\n  We say that the provisions of title VII in the 1964 act and the \nprovisions that regard this in the Americans with Disabilities Act \napply to private contractors with the Federal Government. That is not \ndiscrimination. By anybody's definition, that is not discrimination. To \ntry to turn it into that is doing something on a bill that is talking \nabout the defense of this country, which is just not appropriate.\n  It is absolutely appropriate that the Committee on Rules rejected \nthat amendment. If the people on the other side of the aisle or on our \nside of the aisle want to have this debate, there are other forums and \nother times to do it. When we are talking about the defense of this \ncountry, it is not the right time.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In the dead of night in the Committee on Armed Services, House \nRepublicans added what we believe is discriminatory language to the \nNDAA, which would effectively overturn President Obama's historic \nexecutive order that protects LGBT workers in Federal contracts, \ntherefore, enabling discrimination with taxpayer funds. That is what we \nbelieve.\n  We had a very vigorous debate in the Committee on Rules last night, \nand the gentleman defended his position quite ferociously; but we \nbelieve it is discrimination, plain and simple. An amendment was \noffered by a Republican Member to strike that discriminatory language \nfrom the bill. It was germane, and the Committee on Rules decided on \nits own not to make it in order.\n  The Committee on Rules shouldn't be about making decisions on issues \nthat, I think, the entire Congress has an interest in debating and in \nvoting on, but, unilaterally, the Republicans in the Committee on Rules \nlast night said: No, we are not going to make a\n\n[[Page H2725]]\n\nRepublican amendment in order that would have struck what we believe is \ndiscriminatory language.\n  That is not an open and transparent process. That is shutting the \nprocess down in a way that, I think, demeans this House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer), the distinguished Democratic whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. This is not \nconsistent with what the Speaker and the other leaders of the \nRepublican Party have said they were going to do. It is inconsistent \nwith how they said they were going to manage this House. It is \ninconsistent with the rights of the American people to have their \nRepresentatives vote on issues of great importance, which, of course, \nis what the Speaker and Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Cantor said in this book, \n``Young Guns.''\n  I am going to read a paragraph from this book. This is in Paul Ryan's \nsection, under his heading, the Speaker of the House:\n  ``The new Washington way,'' in speaking about what was apparently the \nstuff he didn't like, ``isn't open debate broadcast on C-SPAN; it is \nclosed-door, backroom deals. The Washington way doesn't seek input from \nboth sides of the issue; it muscles through bills on strict one-party \nvotes. And the Washington way,'' speaking clearly of the way the \nmajority of the Democrats were leading, ``isn't interested in honest \nup-or-down votes on transformational programs. It rigs the process,'' \nit reads, ``to produce the outcome it desires through any means \nnecessary.''\n  That is exactly what is happening in this rule--exactly. Paul Ryan \nand the young guns promised transparency, openness, and the House's \nbeing allowed to work its will.\n  So what has happened in the Committee on Rules?\n  Exactly the opposite. No transparency--a muzzling of the Members of \nthe House of Representatives in not allowing a vote--but simply, \nunilaterally, in the dead of night, pocketing an amendment that was \nadopted in the committee that says that women would be treated just \nlike men.\n\n  Now, I know that is a revolutionary concept for some on your side of \nthe aisle here, and I know you certainly didn't want your Members to \nvote on that extraordinarily controversial issue. So in the dead of \nnight, without any debate, without a vote in the Committee on Rules, it \nwas simply put in the chairman's pocket, and 434 of us were ripped out \nof the process. The young guns said that wouldn't happen. Now, the \nyoung guns, by the way, so we all understand, are the Speaker and the \nmajority leader now.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HOYER. Ladies and gentlemen, we ought to reject this rule, and \nthe American people ought to reject this rule. The American people \nought to say: bring the issues to the floor and let the House work its \nwill. That is why they elected us, not to have the chairman of the \nCommittee on Rules say: Sorry, you don't get to vote.\n  He wasn't elected dictator; Steny Hoyer wasn't elected dictator; Jim \nMcGovern wasn't elected dictator. We were elected to be one of 435 \npeople to make policies for this country and for our people.\n  Reject this rule. Bring democracy back to the House of \nRepresentatives. Let the people's representatives set policy in the \nlight of day.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Maryland. He wasn't \non the floor when I spoke earlier. Perhaps he didn't hear that, between \nthe Committee on Armed Services and on this floor, 429 amendments have \nbeen made in order--181 for this floor alone. That is an open process, \nand it is a far more open process than what this House saw when other \npeople were in charge. This is the process that the American people \nhave a right to expect, and they are getting exactly what they were \ntold they were going to get.\n  Mr. Speaker, the provision that he is referring to, a provision \nregarding including women in the draft, was, in fact, offered in the \nmiddle of the night without there being any hearings in the Committee \non Armed Services, without there being any notice to the American \npeople. There wasn't an adequate hearing; there wasn't an adequate \nopportunity for everybody to be heard. So the decision was made that \nthe better way to do it, if we are going to consider it--and it \nprobably is something we need to consider at some time--is to do it \nthrough a regular committee process, where we notice it to the American \npeople, where we have hearings, and when people can be heard. Then we \ncan have a full and honest debate with the American people having had a \nchance to weigh in.\n  I disagree with the gentleman from Maryland. I think this is exactly \nthe appropriate process. If we are going to take up something of that \nmagnitude, we ought to do it right and not do it because of an \namendment that was offered as sort of a last-minute thing in the middle \nof the night when we are considering this bill.\n  I have great respect for the gentleman from Maryland. He was not \nthere when it was offered. He was not there during the Committee on \nRules' consideration last night, so he is probably not fully aware of \nthe number of amendments that we have both in the committee and on the \nfloor today--429 amendments. This is an open process.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer).\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for protecting us from \nourselves. That seems to be somewhat paternalistic, of course.\n  As I understand it--and I was not there, but it wouldn't have \nmattered whether I was in the Committee on Rules--it was not done in \nopen session in the Committee on Rules. The Committee on Armed Services \nvoted upon it, and apparently the majority of your side lost, and they \ndon't want us to consider it, and they don't want to subject your \nMembers to voting on it and letting the American people know where you \nstand.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to address all remarks \nto the Chair and not to each other.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, while millions of Americans are struggling to get by and \nsustain their families, Republicans are trying to make it easier for \nemployers to steal their wages. Right now we know that there are \nreports of at least $5 million in stolen wages and penalties from the \nU.S. contract companies.\n  Last month, Representative John Kline, my colleague and friend, \nintroduced an amendment to this bill to block the President's Fair Pay \nand Safe Workplaces Executive Order at the Department of Defense. This \nexecutive order that the President issued helps ensure companies with \nFederal contracts are following Federal labor laws, like protections \nagainst wage theft, workplace safety rules, and the right for workers \nto organize. It is the result of years of advocacy by workers, labor \nrights activists, members of the Progressive Caucus, and Members of \nCongress generally.\n  This week I introduced an amendment to strike Mr. Kline's language. \nLet's at least have a debate about it. Let's at least debate whether or \nnot workers should get protection from wage theft. I guess that was one \nof those amendments that didn't quite make it through the process.\n  It is no surprise that the Republican-led Committee on Rules didn't \ngive us a vote on our amendment, because they don't want to have to \ndebate this in front of the American people. The American people might \nlike to know that there are companies that are stealing workers' wages \nbut that the President is trying to protect those workers. Now the \nRepublican majority is trying to stop the President from protecting \nthose workers.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, now, the President's executive order isn't \npunitive. It actually helps companies to follow the rules.\n\n[[Page H2726]]\n\n  Debarment is the last resort, and it is the clear nuclear option for \ncompanies that refuse to correct their behavior, but Republicans don't \nlike it. Instead of helping companies that are fair to workers, they \nwant to make it easier for companies that steal workers' wages.\n  Workers aren't the only ones who should be outraged. This amendment \nactually gives a leg up to contractors who don't play by the rules, \nputting companies who are doing right at a disadvantage.\n  Please vote ``no'' on this rule for this and many other reasons.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I wasn't able to respond to that last comment from the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer). I want to make sure that he knows--and everybody \nin the House knows--that during the consideration of the rule we passed \nyesterday, an amendment was offered in the Rules Committee to strip out \nthis executing amendment. That was offered in the Rules Committee and \nrejected by the Rules Committee in an open vote. Our meetings are on C-\nSPAN. They are not behind closed doors. Everybody can watch what we do.\n  Then yesterday we came on the floor, and that rule was offered on \nthis floor and there was a full debate. I know; I was here for it. I \nmanaged that rule as well. After that full debate, this House voted, \nand voted by a clear majority to adopt the rule.\n  So we went through a democratic process. We went through an open and \nclear process, both to consider that particular issue and consider the \nrule itself, and the House acted its will.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Give me a break. To insinuate that this is somehow all on the level \nor an open process, I take exception to that characterization.\n  The amendment that the distinguished minority whip was referring to \nwas put into the rule. It was a self-executing amendment so that the \nmajority here did not have an opportunity here to vote up or down on it \non its own merits. Instead, they were forced to vote up or down on a \nrule that made in order a whole bunch of amendments on a variety of \nissues where they could vote up or down on, but not on this. So to \ndefend this process, a process that is indefensible, is getting a \nlittle tired.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule for a \nnumber of reasons: because it doesn't make a proper AUMF in order, \nbecause it fails to make in order an amendment I cosponsored along with \nRepresentatives Dent, Smith, and several others.\n  The bill contains language adopted by the Committee on Armed Services \nat 1 in the morning the other day with no warning that would \neffectively overturn President Obama's executive order protecting LGBT \nworkers for companies with private contracts. In other words, private \ncontractors using our Federal tax dollars in any area--not just in the \ndefense area, by the way--would be allowed to fire someone just because \nthey are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. This is unacceptable, \nit is cruel, and it is totally unnecessary.\n  Now, the distinguished gentleman said that the language contains \nnothing referring to gay or lesbian people; it simply protects \nreligious liberty. It says that private contractors, in the exercise of \ntheir religious liberty, may discriminate. It disallows the President's \nexecutive order, and so the effect is that private contractors may \ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual identity or gender if that is their \nreligious belief.\n  No one has said it for years on this floor, but they used to, that it \nis okay to say: My religious belief says I shouldn't hire a Black \nperson or a Jewish person.\n  We don't think that is acceptable, and we don't call that religious \nliberty. But we now call religious liberty the ability of a private \ncontractor to fire someone or refuse to hire them just because they are \ngay or lesbian. That is cruel and unacceptable.\n  Why not allow the House to vote on whether or not to include this \ntype of hateful language in the defense bill? Why not allow a vote on \nthe Dent-Smith amendment? Must we let this bigotry and intolerance win \nthe day?\n  We ought to defeat this rule. I, for one, will not vote for the \nentire bill if this language is included in it. We must strip this \ntoxic, hateful measure from the NDAA, if not through an amendment, then \nin conference. We ought to ensure that no Federal contractor has the \nability to fire someone just because of who they are or who they love \nand because they profess that it is their religious belief. So they \ncannot be allowed to impose their religious beliefs on hiring and \nfiring other people. We must continue to fight until all Americans have \nthe rights they deserve.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  With regard to the amendment in question, it was considered late at \nnight because of the fair and open process we have in the committee. \nAnd it took us that long--from 10 in the morning until that time of the \nnight--to get to it. Everybody knew it was coming because it was \nnoticed and everybody had a copy of it well in advance. So it wasn't a \nsurprise to anybody. Everybody knew it was coming.\n  Now, the particular provision itself does not contain anything close \nto a word like discrimination. But just so we can make the record \nstraight, I am going to read it:\n\n       Any branch or agency of the Federal Government shall, with \n     respect to any religious corporation, religious association, \n     religious educational institution, or religious society that \n     is a recipient of or offeror for a Federal Government \n     contract, subcontract, grant, purchase order, or cooperative \n     agreement, provide protections and exemptions consistent with \n     section 702(a) and 703(e)(2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n     and section 103(d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990.\n\n  It doesn't provide discrimination. It provides protection for rights, \nand, unfortunately, people want to try to twist it around to be \nsomething it simply is not.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Many of us on this side, including many Republicans--because a \nRepublican actually offered the amendment to strike this provision that \nthe gentleman referred to because they thought it was discriminatory--\nwe think it is potential discrimination against members of the LGBT \ncommunity.\n  But here is the deal--I get you disagree with us--but what is wrong \nwith allowing an amendment that is germane, to debate it and vote on \nit? I mean, where does the Rules Committee get off saying you can't \nhave that debate, you can't have that vote?\n  It is germane.\n  Now, we could disagree. We think it is discrimination. We ought to \nhave that vote, and the Rules Committee denied us. This is another \nreason for Democrats and Republicans to vote down this rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nLoretta Sanchez).\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nexpress a deep disappointment in the Rules Committee's decision to \nthrow out three of the amendments I put forward.\n  By not doing those amendments, you failed to provide to those serving \nour country the same necessary health services that all of us get now \nguaranteed under ACA. You refused to take steps to protect young \nathletes attending United States military academies. And you neglected \nto provide congressional oversight on over $1 trillion worth that this \ncountry plans to invest in our nuclear deterrents.\n  We need to fix the current TRICARE system so that we can ensure that \nservicemembers are provided the same access to preventive health \nservices as those ensured under the ACA, including gestational diabetes \nwith no copayments, smoking cessation, et cetera.\n  My second amendment was simple. It directed the Secretary of Defense \nto conduct a study on the effects of concussions in contact sports, \nincluding hockey, football, lacrosse, and soccer at our United States \nservice academies. We all know that we see what concussions can do to \npeople.\n  The third amendment was to simply direct the Department of Defense to \ninclude a 25-year plan to look at our nuclear spending.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H2727]]\n\n  I was listening to my friend from Massachusetts talk about what he \nconsiders to be discriminatory. Well, I am going to go through the list \nagain.\n  Do we consider the First Amendment to the Constitution to be \ndiscriminatory? Do we consider the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nthat passed this House by a voice vote to be discriminatory? Do we \nconsider title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to be discriminatory? \nDo we consider the Americans with Disabilities Act to be \ndiscriminatory?\n  Because that and only those things are what are contained in this \nprovision.\n  So we can call things discriminatory, but when you look at the actual \ntext of it and understand what they actually are, they are protecting \nbasic rights. And that is what we should be all about.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the gentleman reciting the Republican talking points of \nthe Republican leadership, but that doesn't explain why the amendment \nto strike this provision was not made in order.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  Our armed service chiefs and secretaries have requested two results \nfrom Congress in defense: stability and predictability in the budget.\n  Instead of adhering to their requests, this bill actually creates a \ncontentious budget environment next April that causes even more harm to \nour military.\n  The bill is full of contradiction. It authorizes funds for over \n50,000 more troops, but no money to send them anywhere after April. It \nauthorizes much-needed equipment, but not any money to employ it on the \nbattlefield. It authorizes 9,800 troops in Afghanistan, just not any \nmoney to keep them there during the actual fighting season.\n  It sends a message to our allies that we are only 60 percent \ncommitted to our missions with them, and it sends the message to our \nadversaries that we are only 60 percent committed to stopping them.\n  It is like we are a basketball team who bought new uniforms, \nrecruited highly skilled players, built a new facility, and didn't even \nhave any money left to play the second half of the season. No team wins \nunder those circumstances. It doesn't matter how many state-of-the-art \nweapons you have or how well-trained your troops are, you can't win if \nyou don't show up.\n  Much like General Breedlove, who believes ``virtual presence means \nactual absence,'' I believe this is a virtual plan and will be an \nactual disaster.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and ``no'' on the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  With great respect to the gentlewoman, she, I am sure, was not here \nyesterday and was not listening when I said this: that provision she is \nreferring to, which gives the next President the opportunity to make \nchanges in the overseas contingency operation account, is exactly what \nthis House did in 2008, the last time we were about to change \nadministrations. Then-Senator Obama voted for it. Then-Senator Kerry \nvoted for it. Then-Senator Biden voted for it. This is not new. This is \nstandard when you are changing administrations. Nothing more. Nothing \nless.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman how many \nmore speakers he has on his side?\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I believe I am the only speaker from my side.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against this \nrule. Almost 200 germane amendments, substantive amendments were not \nmade in order.\n  Again, I am used to, as a Democrat, having the Republicans shut me \nout every chance they get; but to my Republican colleagues who were \nshut out on their legitimate amendments, the germane amendments, stand \nwith us and send a signal to your leadership that this closed process \nis unacceptable.\n  My colleague, Mr. Byrne, talks about this being an open process. We \nmust have different definitions of openness because when almost 200 \namendments are shut out--and, by the way, on top of all of that, there \nwere really kind of unusual shenanigans in the Rules Committee about \nself-executing amendments so that we don't have an opportunity to even \nvote up or down on them--that is not an open process. That is something \nwe should try to move away from.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am going to close as I began by saying to my \ncolleagues to please vote against this rule because it does not make in \norder the opportunity for us to be able to debate the issues of war and \npeace when it comes to Iraq and Syria.\n  We have been involved in Syria and again in Iraq now for almost 2 \nyears. By the way, we left Iraq not because President Obama wanted us \nto, but because the Iraqi Parliament voted us to leave. That is a \nlittle bit of history that my colleague left out.\n  The time to debate an AUMF, an Authorization for Use of Military \nForce, was before we commit our forces into harm's way. Many of us, \nDemocrats and Republicans, pleaded with the leadership to let us have \nthat opportunity, for us to work in a bipartisan way to see whether we \ncould come together. And time and time and time again, we were denied \nthat ability, that right.\n  Now, we are being told: Well, you know, this is not the time. We \ndon't have enough time to do it. Maybe the Committee on Foreign Affairs \nshould do it, but this is not the place to do it.\n  When is?\n  You have waited for over 2 years. Nothing. I will say that these \nexcuses, they are insulting to the American people, but more \nimportantly and more significantly, they are insulting to the men and \nwomen who are in harm's way. They do their job. They do what we have \nasked them to do, but yet we don't have the guts to do what we are \nsupposed to do. Shame on all of us for allowing this to go on this long \nwithout debating these wars.\n  The President of the United States submitted an AUMF. I have problems \nwith it. I think it is too broad. If you don't like it, fine. Then come \nup with a new idea, but doing nothing is not an option.\n  Read the Constitution. We have an obligation. We are not living up to \nit. Do what is right by the American people, by the men and women who \nrisk their lives every day because we have put them into harm's way.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  It is absolutely unconscionable that we can't even have the ability \nto debate the amendment that I offered to be able to say that we are \nnot going to continue funding these wars unless Congress does its job. \nThat is the least we can do, and yet the Committee on Rules said no. It \nis germane, it is in order, there is no problem, but because some \nmajority in the Committee on Rules says, ``No, we are not going to do \nit,'' everybody is denied that right? It is a bipartisan amendment. \nThis is not just a Democratic concern. There are a lot of Republicans \nwho share my views on this as well.\n  Let's do our job. Stop being so chicken when it comes to debating \nissues of war and peace. This is the time when we ought to come \ntogether and do the right thing. Vote ``no'' on this closed rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hold in my hand all 1,271 pages of the underlying \nbill, and it is filled with the things that we need to do to defend the \nAmerican people. As interesting as the debate we have just had has \nbeen, think of how much of it had nothing to do with defending the \nAmerican people, which is what we are supposed to be here about, which \nis the single most important thing that we do.\n  My colleague talked about guts. The guts I care about are the guts of \nthe fighting men and women of the United States. We have a solemn \nobligation to them to pass this bill, to make sure that we are doing \neverything to supply them, to train them, to make sure that they are \nready, to make sure we have reformed the Pentagon so that the Pentagon \nis doing its job by them, so that we have a policy that will make sure \nthat we are defending the American people. That is what this law is all \nabout.\n\n[[Page H2728]]\n\n  The rule itself makes in order, between yesterday and today, 181 \namendments. That is on top of over 200 amendments that were considered \nas part of this bill. This has been a completely open and transparent \nprocess and will continue to be as we consider it over the next several \nhours.\n  Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution \n735 and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on adoption of the resolution will be followed by 5-minute \nvotes on ordering the previous question on House Resolution 736 and \nadoption of House Resolution 736, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 230, \nnays 175, not voting 28, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 200]\n\n

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title III, add the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 3__. ALTERNATIVE ENERGY USE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Cost Competitiveness Requirement.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of Defense shall not purchase alternative \n     energy unless such energy is equivalent to conventional \n     energy in terms of cost and capabilities.\n       (2) Cost calculation.--The cost of each energy source \n     described in paragraph (1) shall be calculated on a pre-tax \n     basis in terms of life-cycle cost. Such calculation shall \n     take into account--\n       (A) all associated Federal grants, subsidies and tax \n     incentives applied from the point of production to \n     consumption;\n       (B) fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs; \n     and\n\n[[Page H2733]]\n\n       (C) in the case of fuel, fully burdened costs, including \n     all associated transportation and security from the point of \n     purchase to delivery to the end user.\n       (b) Prohibition on Renewable Energy Mandates.--None of the \n     funds authorized to be appropriated this Act or otherwise \n     made available for fiscal year 2017 for the Department of \n     Defense shall be used to carry out any provision of law that \n     requires the Department of Defense--\n       (1) to consume renewable energy, unless such energy meets \n     the requirements of subsection (a); or\n       (2) to reduce the overall amount of energy consumed by the \n     Department.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Buck) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak \nabout this amendment to the 2017 NDAA.\n  Since taking office in 2009, President Obama's administration has \nforced its green energy agenda on the American people despite the \ndevastating costs.\n  For our military, this means a mandate to purchase renewable energy \nand to incorporate climate change into almost every aspect of training, \nregardless of cost or efficiency. As you might imagine, these mandates \nresult in some absurd wastes of money. Every cent spent by the \nDepartment of Defense on the incorporation of the administration's \nclimate change agenda is a cent lost for the defense of the American \npeople.\n  The U.S. military should be focused on defending American citizens, \nnot serving as a playground for the green energy movement. Moreover, \nspending the American people's tax dollars on crony capitalism is \ndespicable. Renewable energy should be free to compete in the energy \nmarketplace. American families shouldn't be asked to subsidize costly, \ninefficient, and uncompetitive green energy with their hard-earned tax \ndollars.\n  My amendment ends this wasteful and dangerous practice; it prohibits \nrenewable energy mandates placed on the Department of Defense; and \nensures that every unit of energy our military purchases is the most \ncost-effective option available.\n  I ask for support on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik.)\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I stand today opposed to this amendment, as \nthe representative of Fort Drum, an Army post that is 100 percent \nenergy-independent and self-sustainable, relying solely on biomass \nenergy.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment would impede military facilities, like \nDrum, from continuing to pursue energy solutions that enhance national \nsecurity, training capabilities, and operational flexibility.\n  Fort Drum and the north country serve as models for operating \ngovernment facilities more efficiently, where ReEnergy, our alternative \npartner, positively affects the Army and has created 300-plus jobs \nthroughout our community.\n  Providing our military with resilient energy ensures our \nservicemembers remain able to respond to any threats at any time. DOD's \nuse of alternative energy strengthens their ability to conduct \ncombative operations, humanitarian response, and protects our national \nsecurity.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment which would \nhave a detrimental effect on alternative energy technologies that make \nour troops safer, increases combat effectiveness, and severely \nundercuts programs like those at Fort Drum.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Peters), a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I am also opposed to this amendment.\n  The DOD's employment of alternative energy is not about hugging \ntrees; it is about improving our mission capabilities and saving lives.\n  The military's investments in alternative energy technologies not \nonly make our troops safer and increase combat effectiveness, but they \nalso reap government energy savings. Renewable energy systems reduce \nour reliance on foreign oil and have saved lives by cutting down on \nrefueling trips in the battlefields.\n  Around 3,000 American soldiers were killed or wounded in Afghanistan \nwhile protecting fuel convoys. The military is already adopting \ncutting-edge renewable energy technologies, like transportable solar \npanels and backpacks used by marines to generate electricity.\n  Last August, I was at Naval Base Coronado when the Navy signed the \nlargest renewable energy purchase by the Federal Government in history. \nThe project will provide 210 megawatts of energy at an estimated \nsavings of $90 million over the length of the contract.\n  Since 2009, the department estimates that they have saved over $1 \nbillion through renewable energy projects on installations.\n  As we consider how to allocate the limited resources we have to \nsupport our servicemembers and keep Americans safe, it is \ncounterproductive at best to prohibit the military from using funds on \ncost-saving alternative sources of energy and redirecting it toward \nmission priorities. A 21st century military with the capability to \ncounter new and dynamic threats cannot be powered by the energy of \nyesterday.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's support of this \namendment and not opposition to this amendment. This amendment simply \nsays that the military must determine the most cost-effective method. \nIt does not ban renewables at all.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Gibson.)\n  Mr. GIBSON. I thank the ranking member and appreciate his leadership.\n  Mr. Chair, I am sure that the gentleman from Colorado has the best \nintentions. And, with respect, I ask him to withdraw the amendment \nbecause it is very problematic, as it is currently worded, prohibiting \nthe reduction of energy consumption. I mean, this is important not only \nin terms of savings itself but, quite candidly, for saving lives.\n  After four combat tours in Iraq, we found any way possible to reduce \nthe amount of convoys to go forward into our most forward positions and \noutposts because we knew every time that we were on the road, we could \nbe at risk; we could lose lives.\n  I appreciate the effort to save money. And I think that if the \ngentleman withdraws the amendment and works with the committee, I am \nsure that we can find a way to move forward on that score.\n  But, as Ms. Stefanik mentioned, her post at Fort Drum really is \nreliant on--or is certainly benefiting from this biomass endeavor that \nis right there at Fort Drum.\n  So I want to thank Mr. Smith for yielding me the time, and I \ncertainly respect to the gentleman who offered the amendment.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Walz).\n  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I join my colleagues, national security \nexperts, military leaders, and America's energy producers, and rise in \nstrong opposition to this amendment.\n  The Department of Defense's use of alternative energy as accelerated \nin recent years and strengthened the military's ability to conduct \ncombat operations, humanitarian response, and homeland defense.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  In short, it has improved the readiness of the Armed Forces to \nprotect freedom overseas. DOD is the largest consumer of energy in the \nworld, 117 million barrels of oil. Every 25 cent increase in a gallon \nof gas costs $1 billion to the American taxpayers and $1 billion less \nto the troops.\n  DOD's fuel costs from 2005 to 2011 were so volatile, the costs went \nfrom to $4.5 billion to $17.3 billion, even though we reduced our usage \nby 4 percent. An example of this is the U.S. Pacific Fleet in 2012 \nfaced a $200 million budget\n\n[[Page H2734]]\n\ngap that had to be filled by taking money from elsewhere because of \nrising fuel costs.\n  This willingness to not look at all American homegrown energy and \nsecurity is simply wrongheaded. And the idea that it costs more to do \nthis--it costs $83 billion more to protect shipping oil coming from \noverseas.\n  I ask my colleagues to resist this amendment.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of the \ntime.\n  I agree with my colleagues, three of whom have served in the military \nand understand the need for this.\n  This is an investment. This is an investment in alternatives. If we \nare tied to oil, tied to fossil fuels, and have no alternative--right \nnow they are cheap, but then they go up in costs. And they are also far \nmore difficult to get into the field, as Mr. Gibson pointed out. This \nis an investment to give us the alternatives that we need.\n  Nothing is more important to the success of a military--past the \npeople who serve--than the ability to get the fuel they need, whatever \nform it comes in. This is an investment in developing much-needed \nalternatives.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, the fact that this amendment requires the \nmilitary to choose the most cost-effective energy source allows the \nmilitary to spend its money on those priorities, rather than on energy.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

It is now in order to \nconsider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 114-571.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title III, add the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 3__. PROHIBITION ON CARRYING OUT CERTAIN AUTHORITIES \n                   RELATING TO CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for \n     fiscal year 2017 for the Department of Defense may be \n     obligated or expended to carry out the provisions described \n     in subsection (b).\n       (b) Provisions.--The provisions described in this \n     subsection are the following:\n       (1) Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6(b)(iii), and 6(c) of Executive \n     Order 13653 (78 Fed. Reg. 66817, relating to preparing the \n     United States for the impacts of climate change).\n       (2) Sections 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15(b) \n     of Executive Order 13693 (80 Fed. Reg. 15869, relating to \n     planning for Federal sustainability in the next decade).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Fleming) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, my amendment prevents scarce dollars from \nbeing wasted to fund two of President Obama's executive orders \nregarding climate change and green energy. These are dollars that \nshould go to the readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  A similar amendment has already been adopted by voice vote for the \npast 2 years during House floor consideration of the Defense \nappropriations bills.\n  My amendment is supported by 28 outside organizations, including the \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, Americans for Prosperity, Council for \nCitizens Against Government Waste, and many others.\n  These executive orders require the Department of Defense to \nsquander--squander--precious defense dollars by incorporating climate \nchange bureaucracies into its acquisition and military operations and \nto waste money on green energy projects. EPA bureaucrats and other \npolitical appointees are directing our military commanders on how to \nrun their installations and procure green weapons, which undermines \nongoing acquisition reforms in the NDAA. These activities are simply \nnot the mission of the U.S. military.\n  Regarding DOD's energy policy, decisions by installation commanders \nand DOD personnel need to be driven by requirements for actual cost-\neffectiveness, readiness, not arbitrary and inflexible green energy \nquotas and CO2 benchmarks. My amendment does not prevent the \nDOD from considering renewable energy projects where it makes sense. \nBut these decisions should not be driven by these mandates.\n  Take, for example, the Naval Station Norfolk, where the solar array \ncost the Navy $21 million but only provided 2 percent of the base's \nelectricity. According to the Inspector General's Office, it will take \n447 years for the savings to pay the cost of the project. However, \nsolar panels usually only last about 25 years.\n  These mandates are diverting limited military resources to Solyndra-\nstyle boondoggles while sacrificing our military's readiness, \nmodernization, and end strength. In a time of declining defense \nbudgets, we need to ensure that every dollar spent goes directly to \nsupport the lethality of our Armed Forces.\n  Again, my amendment is similar to repeated efforts by the House to \nprevent national security dollars from being wasted to advance the \nPresident's onerous green energy and climate change requirements. So I \nask that the House continue that opposition to this nondefense agenda \nby supporting my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Peters).\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment.\n  In January of this year, the Pentagon issued a directive saying: \n``The Department of Defense must be able to adapt current and future \noperations to address the impacts of climate change in order to \nmaintain an effective and efficient U.S. military.''\n  This followed a DOD report to Congress released last July that said: \n``Climate change is an urgent and growing threat to our national \nsecurity, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, \nand conflicts over basic resources such as food and water . . . and the \nscope, scale, and intensity of these impacts are projected to \nincrease.''\n  From 2006 to 2010, Syria experienced overwhelming refugee flows that \nDOD characterized as a climate-related security risk creating negative \neffects on human security and requiring DOD involvement and resources.\n  In 2014, the Pentagon reported that the impacts of climate change may \nincrease the frequency, scale, and complexity of future missions, while \nat the same time undermining the capacity of our domestic installation \nto support training activities.\n  The readiness of our military depends on being able to train and \nequip the most advanced force in the world, but the threat of rising \nsea levels from escalating temperatures and melting icecaps could put \ndozens of military installations at risk.\n  San Diego is home to the largest concentration of military forces in \nthe world. With seven military installations in my district alone, \nrising sea levels, drought, and finding reliable energy sources all \npose challenges. San Diego military installations are investing in \nenergy security and increasing\n\n[[Page H2735]]\n\nwater and energy efficiency. We should not undermine those efforts.\n  This amendment is an attempt by top politicians to prevent the \nDepartment of Defense, which is tasked with maintaining a strong \nmilitary, keeping all Americans safe, and protecting our global \ninterests from addressing what they call an urgent and growing threat \nto our own national security. But national defense is not about \npolitics or ideology. It is about security, readiness, and continuing \nto field the most dynamic and effective military in the world. We \ncannot have that if we ignore science and the concerns of the brightest \nmilitary minds in the United States of America.\n  I oppose this reckless amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 2 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Washington has 2\\3/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I would respond, first of all, by saying I \nthink we all see the reports. If you are on Armed Services, you hear \nour generals talk about how our readiness is in dire straits, that we \ncan't respond to the challenges around the world.\n  At a time like this, why would we want to pay 5 or 10 times the \nnominal amount for fuel? It makes no sense.\n  To my colleague who wants to argue climate change: fine, we can argue \nthat. But this is not the place to debate that.\n  You see, my amendment allows for the Department of Defense to do \nwhatever is best for our Armed Forces. Whether you agree with climate \nchange or not, it doesn't matter. All we say is let's free up the DOD, \nour Armed Forces, and our generals to do the right thing.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Obama administration issued two critical executive \norders directing Federal agencies to take responsibility for \nanticipating and responding to the effects of climate change.\n  This amendment that is being proposed would block the Department of \nDefense from undertaking that effort. The amendment is ill-advised. It \ndoesn't protect and prepare the American people for the impacts of \nclimate change, and it won't help our military operate in a new \nsecurity environment created by climate change.\n  Climate change poses a significant security threat to the United \nStates and the world at large. But don't take it from me. Our Nation's \nmilitary leaders are saying we need to prepare for this new threat. The \nproponents of this amendment should listen to the military experts, not \nthe special interest polluters that benefit from climate denial and the \nstatus quo.\n\n  As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have been \nfrustrated that the Republican majority has refused to hold serious \nhearings on the urgent problem of climate change, so Democrats on that \ncommittee went to Annapolis in my State to hold a climate change field \nforum.\n  We heard testimony from Vice Admiral Ted Carter, the Superintendent \nof the Naval Academy. He told us that our future military leaders are \nlearning about the science of climate change and the national security \nconsequences that stem from it. He testified that because the Naval \nAcademy sits on the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, they have several \nprojects in motion to address sea level rise and the increased \nregularity of flooding. They are retrofitting older buildings and \nbuilding new facilities that double as seawalls to protect the campus.\n  Vice Admiral Carter also told harrowing stories of sailing aircraft \ncarriers in between two massive hurricanes and equipment that short-\ncircuited in waters with surface temperatures in excess of 100 degrees.\n  Certainly my colleagues on the Republican side would not deny that \nthese are consequential problems. Leaders like Admiral Carter cannot \nafford the luxury of ideological climate denial. He is taking the right \nsteps to address climate change. We should support him and our other \nmilitary leaders. Unfortunately, this amendment would do the opposite. \nFor that reason, I urge its defeat.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, again, my amendment is not a debate about \nclimate change, regardless of where you fall on that issue. All this \ndoes is free up DOD to make the vital important decisions on that, \ninstead of handcuffing it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, actually, it precisely does \nhandcuff them by telling them how to make their decisions, saying they \ncan't make a decision based on their belief that needs for alternatives \nto fossil fuels are important. If we don't wish to handcuff them, don't \noffer an amendment telling them that they have to spend their money in \na certain way. That is exactly what this amendment does.\n  Again, there are multiple reasons for making these investments in \nalternative energy. I will return to one that was raised by Mr. Gibson.\n  Out in the field, you need multiple different sources of energy. If \nyou can get a situation where you have properly developed solar power \nor thermal power and you can use that on the spot where you are at, \ninstead of relying on trucks to bring in diesel or gasoline, you are \nsaving lives.\n  This is an investment in making our military more prepared. What this \namendment does is it restricts the ability of the Department of Defense \nto make that investment. If you don't want to restrict them, don't \nrestrict them.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the ranking \nmember, all my amendment does is holds the status quo before these two \nexecutive orders; and that is, the commanders in the field and the \ngenerals at the Pentagon can do whatever is best for the military, \nwhether or not it has to do with saving money or spending more money on \nalternative forms of energy.\n  My amendment frees them up. It does not restrict them in any way.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Fleming).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana \nwill be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Pearce\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       After section 7004, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7005.

Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, in January of 1993, the BRAC Commission closed\n\n[[Page H2737]]\n\nFort Wingate in New Mexico. Fort Wingate was destined and designated to \ngo to two tribes, equitably divided between the two--the Navajo Nation \nand the Zunis.\n  During the past 12 years, I have been involved in negotiations back \nand forth between the tribes. The lands were occupied ancestrally by \nboth tribes. There have been many long, ongoing discussions between all \nof the parties. We have gotten signatures in the past from different \nmembers of the Navajo government. We currently have a letter dated May \n16, 2016, in which it states that it is the opinion of the Navajo \nNation that the land division and the terms developed between the two \ntribes would provide a solution to the land division.\n  All we are asking is that the agreed-upon maps be distributed in \naccordance with the terms, signed by the speaker of the Navajo Nation \nand the Zunis. That is the purpose of this amendment today. It is a \nfairly simple distribution according to the provisions that are listed \nin the BRAC ruling of January 1993.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment in \nits current form and at this particular time.\n  This amendment, as it has been pointed out, directly impacts two \nfederally recognized tribal nations: the Navajo Nation and the Zuni \nPueblo Nation in New Mexico.\n  They have been working with the Department of Defense to resolve the \ndisposition of this excess Federal land. The Navajo is one of the \ntribes that would receive the land in transfer, and it is opposed to \nsome of the language that is still occurring in this amendment. The \nPearce amendment, unfortunately, claims a provision that would require \na right-of-way in perpetuity to the Navajo, and the Navajo agrees, it \nis my understanding, to work toward some of the land transfer.\n  I ask the gentleman: Are they aware that the Navajo doesn't agree in \nhaving this land transfer go in perpetuity and that it would like to \nwork something else out?\n  I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, that is a provision that I, personally, did \nnot put into the bill. It came from the committee of jurisdiction, the \nNatural Resources Committee. They insisted on it because it is \nprevailing language under the law.\n  The objection in the letter from the Navajo, which I was just showing \nthe gentlewoman previously, describes that, and the language reads that \nthey have so far failed to acquire a new right-of-way with the U.S. \nArmy and now have come to Congress to address their error.\n  What has happened is that the right-of-way has yielded, and the \nlanguage here was language that has previously been set up by the \ncommittee in order to address this.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chair, there is some disagreement as to how this language should \nbe structured. I don't think we should be pushing through something \nthat the Navajo Nation now finds controversial but that wasn't \ncontroversial when working with the Department of Defense and making \nsure that they had the right-of-way and access to the land.\n  It is a sovereign nation. There are only 10 minutes of debate. There \nseems to be a little bit of uncertainty as to where the Navajo Nation \nis coming down on the particular language that the gentleman has. I do \nnot fault the gentleman for bringing the language forward, as Chairman \nBishop has changed from what the original conversation had been between \nthe sovereign nation and the Department of Defense by putting the \nperpetuity in it.\n  I believe we should respect the right of sovereignty of the tribe, \nand I believe at this time we should defeat the amendment. I would like \nto work with the gentleman to come up with language that is acceptable \nboth for the Department of Defense and the two tribal nations. They \nwere so very close. I would like to make that happen.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Again, addressing the gentlewoman, those are the subjects \nthat Mr. Lujan and I have agreed that we would work on in conference. I \nthink that we are more than willing to accommodate, but to stall this \nout now--this is the last vehicle this year. Literally, we are out of \ntime. I would gladly accept the gentlewoman's help in the conference \ncommittee, and I want to resolve this. Again, I have been working on it \nfor 12 years. We go and we get the signatures. It has been very arduous \non the parts of all, and I understand the difficulty when you have \naboriginal lands.\n  Again, when I look at the language, it is language that was \npreviously established in the Ho-Chunk Nation distribution. The \nlanguage literally is set in precedent, and the committee explains to \nus there is not much option there; but I am more than willing to work \non the issue with the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. PEARCE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with the \ngentleman. I am sure we can come up with an accomodation that will make \neveryone satisfied.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, what we are trying to do \nis put into the hands of two Indian nations land that has been \ndesignated for them since 1993. I think that all parties just want it \nto be done in the right fashion. We are so close at this point that I \nwould really appreciate the fact that we put it in this bill, that we \ninclude it, and move it into the conference. I am certain that with the \nSenator's input, they will be listening to the same concerns as the \ngentlewoman is listening to.\n  Again, I appreciate the help of Mr. Young, Mr. Lujan--all of those \nparties--and both Chairman Thornberry and Chairman Bishop.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, in closing, again, I just appreciate the \nconsideration by the gentlewoman.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 1 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY.

ACCESS TO WIRELESS HIGH-SPEED INTERNET AND NETWORK \n                   CONNECTIONS FOR CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE ARMED \n                   FORCES DEPLOYED OVERSEAS.\n\n       Consistent with section 2492a of title 10, United States \n     Code, the Secretary of Defense is encouraged to enter into \n     contracts with third-party vendors in order to provide \n     members of the Armed Forces who are deployed overseas at any \n     United States military facility, at which wireless high-speed \n     Internet and network connections are otherwise available, \n     with access to such Internet and network connections without \n     charge.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nSmith) each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Farenthold).\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, which \nis included in here, that encourages the Department of Defense to \nprovide free Wi-Fi access of the Internet to military personnel who are \ndeployed overseas.\n  Right now our military personnel, in some instances, are required to \npay twice as much as a typical American family would pay for access to \nthe Internet. Access to the Internet is a way for our troops to keep \ntheir morale high by staying in touch with their families back home by \nusing technology like FaceTime and Skype.\n  This amendment does not require any expenditure by the military. It \nmerely instructs the military to work towards this goal: to make it \navailable where possible and to indicate that it should be a priority. \nIt doesn't cost anything, but it is a great morale booster, and it \nshould be great for our troops.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  I speak about the broader bill. Unfortunately, something happened in \nthe Rules Committee yesterday that has been happening far too often in \nrecent years. This was much debated during the debate over the rule, \nbut I didn't have a chance to come and talk about it.\n  There was an amendment added in committee that overturns an executive\n\n[[Page H2740]]\n\norder by the President. The executive order basically says: if you \ndiscriminate against the LGBT community, you will not be allowed to get \ngovernment contracts.\n  That executive order also had an exception for religious \norganizations. The amendment that was added in committee--and it is \nmuch debated as to what it did or didn't do, but my reading of it is \nthat it dramatically expands that exception and basically increases the \nability of defense firms and subcontractors to discriminate against the \nLGBT community.\n  The larger problem here is: Why couldn't we vote on it?\n  It puts our Members in the position of voting for a defense bill that \nhas what we believe to be discriminatory language in it without our \neven having had the opportunity to have voted to remove that language.\n  This is something that has happened for the last 3 or 4 years on an \nincreasing basis. It used to be that this was an open rule. With the \ndefense bill, you basically offered an amendment; you had a debate; and \nyou had a chance. Then we started to shrink them down a little bit. \nNow, in the last couple of years, anything that is inconvenient for the \nmajority to vote on or, even more distressingly, anything that they \nthink will make it inconvenient for us to vote on the bill gets struck.\n  That is not the way the Rules Committee is supposed to work. They are \nsupposed to give us the opportunity to vote on these amendments. They, \nagain, have narrowly crafted it down to just the amendments that they \nlike. Having this discriminatory provision within the defense bill, in \naddition to all of the other problems, has forced me to the point at \nwhich I am actually going to oppose the bill, which I do not want to do \nand did not want to do; but I hope, in the future, the Rules Committee \nwill at least give us a chance to vote.\n  We had a robust debate about the substance of this particular \namendment earlier. Again, it is not so much about the substance of the \nparticular amendment. It is about the opportunity for our Members to \nhave a vote. If we could go on record and vote against that amendment \non the floor--do our best to strip it out--then at least we are on \nrecord. Here, we are simply forced to vote for a defense bill that \ncontains discriminatory language that we do not support.\n  I hope, in the future, the Rules Committee will stop doing this, will \nlet the democratic process work, will give us the opportunity to vote, \naccept the outcome of that vote, and move forward.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  My understanding is that the provision that the gentleman refers to \nis a restatement of religious liberties from the 1964 Civil Rights Act. \nWhat that tells me, if he opposes the bill based on that, is that there \nare Members who are looking for some excuse to vote against this bill. \nYou can always find one. I can find one myself. I don't think that is \nthe right thing to do, however, for the men and women who serve our \nNation.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. \nPoliquin).\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chair, each month across our great country, our \nbrave men and women in the National Guard and the Armed Forces Reserves \nleave their homes and report for duty. Each month they train on the \nground and in the air and on the sea so that they are ready at a \nmoment's notice to fight for our freedom. Our guardsmen and reservists \noften travel long distances to their training sites, and their travel \ncosts often exceed their monthly training pay, which forces them to buy \ngas, meals, and sometimes hotel rooms out of pocket.\n  Right now, today, under existing law, if you work for the IRS or the \nEPA or some other Federal Government agency, you are granted a tax \ndeduction for out-of-pocket travel expenses if you travel beyond 50 \nmiles of your home; but if you are a guardsman or a woman or if you are \nin the Reserves, you need to travel more than 100 miles to receive the \nsame benefits.\n  Mr. Chair, this is not fair, and this is not right. I urge everybody \nto endorse and support my amendment No. 300.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nO'Rourke) will control the time of the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nSmith).\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, for many years, the Air Force used perfluorinated \nchemicals in its compound for firefighting foam, but in the past few \nyears, very high levels of these PFCs have been discovered in the fish \nnear the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, Michigan, which is \nin my district. Tests have revealed the presence of PFCs as well in the \ngroundwater that people who live near the former Air Force base depend \nupon.\n  The CDC and the EPA have both said that PFCs can be potentially \nharmful to people's health, though there is still not clear guidance as \nto what is a safe level of exposure, especially in the long term; \nalthough, there is great concern on this question.\n  I have asked the Air Force as well as the State of Michigan to \nprovide bottled water to those identified individuals who are living \nnear Wurtsmith whose water may be contaminated by PFCs at least until \nmore research is done on the safety of their water. My amendment would \nrequire the Department of Defense to do whatever it can to prevent \nfurther exposure to PFCs.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the \namendment to renew the 1-year ban on the Obama administration or any \nother administration from using any Department of Defense funds to \nimplement the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, a treaty which, by the \nway, has never been ratified by our Senate.\n  Specifically, the amendment bans the use of Department of Defense \nfunds for the ATT Secretariat, a body that was created for effectively \nimplementing the ATT according to the treaty's supporters.\n  Last August, ATT member nations organized the Conference of States \nParties to the ATT, a conference in which we did not have a vote and \nwhich decided that American taxpayers are now on the hook to pay 22 \npercent of the expenses of this annual meeting. This taxpayer money \nwould go directly to the ATT Secretariat and become part of its core \nbudget. My amendment prevents these hardworking American taxpayer \ndollars from flowing into the coffers of those who are working to \nimplement the ATT.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including this in the \nen bloc amendment, and I urge all my colleagues to stand in support of \nour Second Amendment and of our Nation's sovereignty and vote in \nsupport of this amendment to renew the annual ban on the funding of the \nUnited Nations Arms Trade Treaty.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Hastings).\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Chair, my amendment would exempt reimbursement for \nmedical expenses from the Department of Veterans Affairs calculation of \nannual income when determining pension eligibility for veterans. This \namendment is a version of H.R. 4994, the Veterans Pensions Protection \nAct, bipartisan legislation endorsed by the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and others.\n  A few years ago, a disabled veteran and a constituent of mine was \nstruck by a vehicle while crossing the street. After receiving \ninsurance compensation for his injuries, he lost his pension. This is \nbecause, under current law, compensation for medical expenses, \nincluding insurance settlement payments or reimbursements, are \nconsidered income by the VA.\n  We effectively punish our veterans when they receive these types of \ncompensation after suffering medical emergencies like the one I just \noutlined. This is, quite simply, wrong. My amendment will rectify this.\n  I ask the House to support this amendment.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold) to discuss an additional \namendment he has.\n\n[[Page H2741]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of an amendment \nthat directs our service academies to notify the Members of Congress of \nacceptees at least 48 hours before publishing the acceptance or letting \nthe acceptee know.\n  As most Members of this body know, we are actually the interviewing \nsource for the service academies. Young men and women seeking to serve \nthis country attending a service academy apply for a nomination from \ntheir Member of Congress, most often go through a very lengthy vetting \nprocess, and we develop a relationship with these young men and women.\n  Historically, the service academies have allowed us to call them and \ntell them they are accepted and congratulate them. This year, in some \ninstances, the service academies have quit doing that, which was a \nlongstanding practice.\n  I believe that it is appropriate that those who interview and work so \nhard to get those young men and women into our service academies should \nbe the ones delivering the news to them rather than them reading it on \na Web site or in a piece of mail.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment when it comes before \nthe House.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Himes).\n  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank both the chairman of \nthe committee and the ranking member for the opportunity to offer this \namendment, which would be a very straightforward amendment, which \nsimply requires the Department of Defense to report to the Congress on \nthe policies, doctrine, procedures, and authorities, as well as the \ndefinitions associated with a cyber attack on the United States.\n  This is a small step in a larger very, very important effort that \nChairman Westmoreland and I have been working on for some period of \ntime now to try to bring some clarity to what is, today, kind of the \nWild West in the cyber realm. In the kinetic realm, we understand very \nclearly what an act of war is. We understand our doctrine for \nresponding as such.\n  In the cyber realm, we don't know exactly when a crime becomes an act \nof war, how to deal with an asymmetric actor versus a nation-state. It \nis terribly important that we begin the process, with other nations \naround the world, of establishing some clarity on these points. That \nwon't help our adversaries, but it will remove uncertainty from the \nsystem in this new and very, very important realm.\n  Again, I thank the leadership of the House Armed Services Committee \nand hope this amendment will be supported.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time on \nthis en bloc amendment.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Polis).\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the committee for \nincluding, en bloc, my amendment No. 59, which is a step to look at \ncommonsense, cost-saving proposals that the United States Navy itself \nhas offered earlier this year that could save as much as $900 million \nby consolidating carrier Air Force wings from 10 to 9.\n  In the fiscal year 2017 budget request, the Navy asked Congress to \nreallocate their 10th carrier wing into their 9 existing wings, which \nthey feel would boost readiness and save money.\n  I understand there is reluctance to make what I believe is a \nstrategic, cost-effective move, and that is why I offer my amendment \ntoday, directing the Secretary of Defense to offer Congress a study on \nthis issue. As Vice Admiral Michael Shoemaker said: ``Restructuring to \nnine carrier air wings is the most efficient use of those operational \nforces to meet global requirements.''\n  The study will serve as an important step in realizing a more \nefficient, capable, cost-effective Navy. I am very encouraged that the \ncommittee was willing to include this en bloc today, and I see this as \nan important first step toward recognizing increased readiness as well \nas cost savings.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in \npermitting me to speak on the en bloc amendment, and I appreciate the \ncommittee having accepted the amendment dealing with cost \naccountability for the B-21 bomber. This is a new weapon that has both \nconventional and nuclear weapons capability.\n  We are in a situation now where there is tremendous stress on our \nDefense Department budget with a whole range of weaponry. I think it is \nmore important now than ever that we are able to understand exactly \nwhat we are getting into, how much this is going to cost. There is \nabout $1.4 billion already into this. We ought to be able to know what \nthe total commitment is being made, to be able to have appropriate \ndecisions made by Congress.\n  I am deeply concerned that the Defense Department, to this point, has \nresisted giving an appraisal of what the total cost is going to be, \nsomehow fearing that, if the total budget were available, that would \ngive too much information to our adversaries about the weight, size, \nand range of the plane. I think not. I think the real danger here is \nthat the American public and Congress would know what the costs are. \nThis is not an acceptable approach as we deal with these critical \nquestions.\n  It is important, Mr. Chairman, that we have full transparency about \nwhat the costs are going to be for these massive, expensive, and, in \nsome cases, questionable weapons systems. This is not an argument for \nor against it. It is an argument for transparency and being able to \nknow what we are getting into.\n  The worst of all possible worlds is making commitments and then \nfinding, 5 and 10 years down the line, that we can't follow through on \nthem or they result in cannibalizing other important priorities. I \nwould think that this is one area that we could all agree we need to \nhave this transparency and have this information available.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, this seems to me to be a priority going \nforward, given the experience we have had with cost overruns and given \nhow many elements that this committee is trying to juggle. The demands \non the committee, I think, are remarkable. It is not a job that I envy. \nThese are hard decisions that are being made.\n  The Department of Defense can do a favor for themselves and for us by \nbeing fully transparent so we know what we should be budgeting for in \nthe future and that they can be held accountable for performance.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to speak about one of the amendments that is in \nthis en bloc package offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. \nMulvaney). My understanding of that amendment is that it tries to have \na clearer process by which we fund the military, and that is a goal for \nwhich I have enormous sympathy.\n  We clearly need to have more predictable funding for the military. \nThat is true on behalf of our military commanders and all the troops. \nIt is true on behalf of industry. It is true on behalf of budgeting in \nthe government.\n  I personally also agree we need to do away with the artificial caps \nthat have caused such difficulty for the military in recent years. I \nalso believe that it would be beneficial if administrations did not \nplay political budgetary games.\n  For example, in this year's budget, the President requests a very low \nnumber for Israeli missile defense, knowing full well that the \nCongress, on a bipartisan basis, is not going to let that go through. \nWe are going to be more responsible. So they are counting on us to have \nto cut other programs so that we can do what they should have done to \nbegin with. There are all sorts of tactics that are used in developing \nbudgets. There has got to be a better way.\n  Apparently, some administration political appointees have been urging \nMembers of the House to call the approach in this bill a gimmick. \nActually, I have heard that term used a few times on the floor over the \nlast couple of days.\n\n[[Page H2742]]\n\n  Well, one question I have is: Was it a gimmick in 2008 when, under \nDemocratic majority, this House used exactly the same approach in fully \nfunding the base requirements for the year and then had a bridge fund \nthat allowed the new President to evaluate deployments and the funding \nand to make adjustments, which President Obama took advantage of? That \nis what it was intended for. Now, why was it okay then, but it is a \ngimmick now? It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, someone would consider that \na double standard.\n  Would Members rather that we continue to cannibalize aircraft and \ndeny pilots the minimum amount of training they are supposed to get? \nAre Members content to have class A mishaps continue to go up in \nservice after service, or is the desire to score political points so \nstrong that Members would rather let those trends continue rather than \ndeal with them here in this bill before us?\n  Mr. Chairman, my point is that I agree there has got to be a better \nway. But I also believe that we have a choice before us today, and that \nis whether we fund the training, the maintenance, the end strength, the \nmodernization that starts to fix the problems that I have talked about \nor we stick with name-calling, we look for excuses to vote ``no'' and \nallow those problems to get worse. Lives are at stake.\n  So while I don't know that I agree with all the particulars of the \ngentleman from South Carolina's amendment, I think he raises important \nissues. Therefore, I urge Members to support that amendment as part of \nthis en bloc package and resolve to try to put partisanship and excuses \naside and think about the men and women who serve and what is in their \nbest interest.\n  I urge adoption of the en bloc amendments.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n\n                   Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 12XX. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Authorization for Use of Military \n     Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is hereby \n     repealed.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The repeal contained in subsection \n     (a)--\n       (1) takes effect on the date that is 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) applies with respect to each operation or other action \n     that is being carried out pursuant to the Authorization for \n     Use of Military Force initiated before such effective date.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, first let me just thank the Committee on Rules \nChairman Sessions and Ranking Member Slaughter and all of the members \nof the committee for making this amendment in order.\n  My amendment is very straightforward. It would, after 90 days of \nenactment of this act, repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force which Congress passed into law September 14, 2001. When \nwe repeal this 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, Congress \nwould finally be forced to debate and vote on a specific AUMF to \naddress the ISIL threat.\n  Now, I voted against the 2001 authorization because I believed it \nopened the door for any President to wage endless war without a \ncongressional debate or a vote, and I believe, quite frankly, that \nhistory has borne that out.\n  I include in the Record a new report from the Congressional Research \nService.\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                                     May 11, 2016.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     Subject: Presidential References to the 2001 Authorization \n         for Use of Military Force in Publicly Available Executive \n         Actions and Reports to Congress.\n     From: Matthew Weed, Specialist in Foreign Policy Legislation.\n     This memorandum was prepared to enable distribution to more \n         than one congressional office.\n       This memorandum sets out information and analysis \n     concerning presidential references in official notifications \n     and records to the Authorization for Use of Military Force \n     (2001 AUMF; Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1541 note), \n     enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist \n     attacks on the United States, to justify and undertake \n     military and other action. It contains very brief discussions \n     of the relevant provisions of the 2001 AUMF, and the uses of \n     U.S. armed forces connected with 2001 AUMF authority, as well \n     as excerpted language and other information from the \n     notifications.\n\n\n     Use of Military Force Authorization Language in the 2001 AUMF\n\n       Section 2(a) of the 2001 AUMF authorizes the use of force \n     in response to the September 11 attacks:\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       * * *\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--That the President is authorized to use \n     all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, \n     organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, \n     committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on \n     September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or \n     persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international \n     terrorism against the United States by such nations, \n     organizations or persons.\n       The 2001 AUMF does not include a specified congressional \n     reporting requirement, but states that the authorization is \n     not intended to supersede any requirement of the War Powers \n     Resolution, which does require congressional reporting for \n     initial and continuing deployments of U.S. armed forces into \n     imminent or ongoing hostilities.\n\n\n      Executive Branch Policy Concerning Utilization of 2001 AUMF \n                             Authorization\n\n       Prior to the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic \n     State that began in summer 2014, executive branch officials \n     made statements that included certain interpretations \n     concerning the 2001 AUMF, including the following \n     interpretations:\n       The 2001 AUMF is primarily an authorization to enter into \n     and prosecute an armed conflict against Al Qaeda and the \n     Taliban in Afghanistan.\n       The 2001 AUMF authorizes the President to use military \n     force against Al Qaeda and the Taliban outside Afghanistan, \n     but such uses of force must meet a higher standard of threat \n     to the United States and must use limited, precise methods \n     against specific individual targets rather than general \n     military action against enemy forces.\n       Because the 2001 AUMF authorizes U.S. involvement in an \n     international armed conflict, the international law of armed \n     conflict informs the authority within the 2001 AUMF. This law \n     permits the use of military force against forces associated \n     with Al Qaeda and the Taliban as co-belligerents; such forces \n     must be operating in some sort of coordination and \n     cooperation with Al Qaeda and/or the Taliban, not just share \n     similar goals, objectives, or ideologies.\n       According to the Obama Administration, this interpretation \n     of the scope of 2001 AUMF authority fits within the overall \n     framework of presidential power to use military force against \n     those posing a threat to U.S. national security and U.S. \n     interests. In situations where the 2001 AUMF or other \n     relevant legislation does not seem to authorize a given use \n     of military force or related activity, the executive branch \n     will determine whether the President's Article II powers as \n     Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, as interpreted by the \n     executive branch itself, might authorize such actions. In \n     this way, similar U.S. military action to meet U.S. \n     counterterrorism objectives might be interpreted to fall \n     under different authorities, of which the 2001 AUMF is just \n     one, albeit important, example.\n\n\n  Records of Executive Actions and Presidential Reporting to Congress \n                       Referencing the 2001 AUMF\n\n       CRS has located 37 relevant occurrences of an official \n     record, disclosed publicly, of presidential reference to the \n     2001 AUMF in connection with initiating or continuing \n     wilitary or related action (including nonlethal military \n     activities such as detentions and military trials). Of the 37 \n     occurrences, 18 were made during the Bush Administration, and \n     19 have been made during the Obama Administration. The \n     notifications reference both statutory and constitutional \n     authority for the President to take such action, as well as \n     statutory provisions requiring congressional notification, \n     including reference to provisions in the 2001 AUMF. As will \n     be discussed in detail below, the manner in which Presidents \n     have presented information on military deployments and \n     actions in these notifications, the constitutional and \n     statutory authority for such actions, and the reporting \n     requirements for such actions, have changed over time.\n\n[[Page H2743]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n  Notifications of Deploying U.S. Armed Forces and/or Using Military \n               Force Involving Reference to the 2001 AUMF\n\n       Both President Bush and President Obama have provided \n     formal notifications of military deployments and/or action to \n     Congress at various times since enactment of the 2001 AUMF, \n     referring to that authorization to various degrees and ends. \n     While presidential reports to Congress concerning the use of \n     military force and other activities undertaken by the U.S. \n     armed forces initially provided a fairly simple and \n     straightforward discussion of actions and related \n     authorities, over time these reports became increasingly \n     detailed, complicated, and difficult to decipher with regard \n     to determining applicable presidential authority. At all \n     times, both Presidents have relied primarily on their \n     constitutional Article II powers as Commander in Chief and \n     Chief Executive. In many instances, reference to 2001 AUMF \n     authority has been supplementary and indirect; in only a few \n     cases has a President relied directly on 2001 AUMF authority \n     as justification for a military operation, deployment, or \n     other action. This is not to say that 2001 AUMF authority \n     does not serve as a sole or primary legal basis for military \n     action in any given situation reported in a notification, \n     only that the notification language is susceptible to more \n     than one interpretation when it concerns presidential \n     authority to use to military force or undertake other \n     military action.\n       Below are provided several tables of information concerning \n     presidential notifications and records of other executive \n     action referencing the 2001 AUMF. Each table provides:\n       a date of each notification or record;\n       the relevant military activity, location, and/or purpose of \n     such activities, as available;\n       the constitutional and statutory authority provided in the \n     notification or record as provided; and\n       the reference to applicable reporting requirements \n     precipitating each respective notification or record.\n       For Tables 1-8, each set out in its own section with \n     accompanying analysis, each table includes a group of \n     notifications that are similar in composition and content. \n     Each subsequent table and section, therefore, denotes a \n     change in composition of the notifications referencing the \n     2001 AUMF in some way.\n     Initial Reporting in the Aftermath of the September 11, 2001 \n         Attacks\n       President Bush's reports to Congress concerning military \n     deployments in the weeks following the September 11, 2001 \n     terror attacks were relatively concise, focusing on the need \n     to address the terrorist threat in the immediate aftermath of \n     the attacks, and the deployments and actions taken in \n     response to such threat. The first notification on September \n     24, 2001 references deployments to ``a number of foreign \n     nations'' in the ``Central and Pacific Command areas of \n     operations.'' Major military operations in Afghanistan had \n     not yet commenced. The second notification on October 9, 2001 \n     includes similar information but also notifies Congress of \n     the commencement of combat against Al Qaeda and the Taliban \n     in Afghanistan. In these two notifications, President Bush \n     stated that he had taken the actions described pursuant to \n     his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief \n     Executive. In both notifications, he referred to the 2001 \n     AUMF as evidencing the continuing support of Congress, but \n     did not specifically state he had taken such action pursuant \n     to 2001 AUMF authority. The President stated in these \n     notifications that he was reporting on these actions to \n     Congress consistent with both the War Powers Resolution and \n     the 2001 AUMF. It is possible to conclude that reporting \n     action consistent with the 2001 AUMF would mean that the \n     action was considered taken pursuant to 2001 AUMF authority.\n\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to encourage all my colleagues to read \nthis report. It shows that this authorization has, in fact, become that \nblank check for war. In the more than 14 years since its passage, it \nhas been used 37 times in 14 countries to wage war with little or no \ncongressional oversight. It has been used 18 times by President Bush \nand 19 times by President Obama.\n  This report only looks at unclassified incidents. How many other \ntimes has it been used without the knowledge of Congress or the \nAmerican people? Not only has this authorization been used to justify \nmilitary action thousands of miles away, it has also been used much \ncloser to home to allow warrantless surveillance and wiretaps, \nindefinite detention practices at GTMO, and targeted killing by drones, \nincluding of American citizens. It has also been cited as the authority \nfor the nearly 2-year-long war against ISIL, a war that Congress has \nnever debated, voted on, or specifically authorized.\n  Mr. Chairman, our brave servicemen and -women continue to be deployed \naround the world. Whether they are combat troops or not, they are in \ncombat zones. They are risking their lives. Don't we at least owe them \nour representation in terms of our job to debate and vote on the cost \nand consequences of the war? I think we owe them that.\n  If we all agree that ISIL must be degraded and dismantled, then why \nis Congress missing in action? Every day more bombs fall. We have \nalready lost three brave servicemen. We have already spent more than \n$9.6 billion, and we spend an additional $615,000 per hour.\n  I know that while we may not share a common position on what the \nshape of any new AUMF to address ISIL might look like, I know that many \nof us do agree that the overly broad and almost 15-year-old AUMF \nrepresents a major and very concerning deterioration of congressional \noversight. That means a lack of involvement and input and voice of the \nAmerican people.\n  Let's repeal this blank check and finally, 90 days later, debate and \nvote on an AUMF to address the ISIL threat.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the distinguished chairman of \nthe Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment which would \nunilaterally end the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda.\n  Mr. Chair, ISIS grew out of al Qaeda in Iraq. The President has \ndetermined that the 2001 AUMF allows the United States to target ISIS. \nBoth the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs agree \nthat they have full legal authority to combat ISIS, and Congress has \nsupported that view by appropriating funds.\n  Many Members want to enact a new AUMF to renew the authority to fight \nISIS and support our troops, but this amendment fails to do so. We must \nunderstand that a new AUMF cannot give President Obama any more \nauthority to fight ISIS than he currently claims. It could give him \nless. The President asked for less in his proposal. It is clear many \nwant an AUMF that limits the authority of this President and the next \nPresident.\n  The administration still does not have the broad, overarching \nstrategy needed to defeat these radical Islamist terrorists. Once the \nPresident provides that strategy, this House can have an informed \ndebate over a new AUMF, but this amendment would leave us with no \nstrategy and no authority. That is irresponsible.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, let me just make one comment before yielding to \nmy colleague from Minnesota.\n  First, the President has sent over an AUMF. He sent this over 15 \nmonths ago. The Speaker yet has to take this Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force up. The President has asked for it. Why don't we do our \njob? We could at least either bring the one that he sent over, or we \nneed to put our own on the floor.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. \nEllison).\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California has 1\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's \namendment.\n  I want to just say that the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) is \nabsolutely wrong when he says there would be a unilateral ending to the \nstruggle against Daesh, or ISIL. The only way that would happen is if \nwe do not take up a new AUMF that would authorize us to take on that \nbattle.\n  What we need to do is take on our constitutional responsibility. We \ncannot abdicate it with this out-of-date AUMF that is only tenuously \nconnected to many of the conflicts we see arising today. We have a \nresponsibility under the Constitution, Article I, section 8, to debate \nand vote, up or down, use of force. We should do that. We should do it \nnow. There is nothing to prevent us from passing a new one or crafting \nour own or passing the President's unless we abdicate that \nresponsibility.\n  This allows us to criticize anything the President does and yet, at \nthe same time, never take responsibility for\n\n[[Page H2744]]\n\npassing our own AUMF adapted for the moment that we are in. That is not \nright.\n  I support the gentlewoman's amendment.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, I will just close by saying my amendment is \nenacted 90 days after the signing of this law. That means we have 90 \ndays to debate and vote upon an ISIL-specific Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force. We need to do our job. We have a constitutional \nresponsibility to do our job. Unfortunately, Congress is missing in \naction. We need to do exactly what the American people sent us to do.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, no one can contest the gentlewoman from California's \nsincerity on this issue. On September 14, 2001, when this House passed \nthe Authorization for the Use of Military Force that she is talking \nabout, 3 days after 3,000 Americans had been murdered on 9/11, the vote \nin this House was 420-1, and the one person who voted against this AUMF \nwas the gentlewoman from California who offered this amendment. So her \nsincerity cannot be questioned.\n  I also, by the way, happen to agree with her that we need to update \nthis AUMF. As a matter of fact, this House passed, twice, provisions \nthat I had authored to update the 2001 AUMF. We passed it in 2011; we \npassed it in 2012. Unfortunately, the administration says: No, we are \nopposed to that; the one we have got is just fine. And the Senate took \nthat position, and so it did not get passed into law.\n  But to say, now, to unilaterally repeal the 2001 AUMF on which the \nadministration is relying for all its counterterrorism activities not \nonly against al Qaeda, but against ISIS and others, to repeal it now, I \nbelieve, would be a mistake. There are still real dangers in the world \nfrom terrorists. I don't think I need to remind Members of Paris, of \nBrussels, of San Bernardino, and just today, of Baghdad.\n\n  The other point I want to make, Mr. Chairman, is I think we all \nunderestimate the catastrophes that have been avoided--in other words, \nthe terrorist plots, what they wanted to do, what they tried to do--\nthat were thwarted. Sometimes they were thwarted just because we were \nlucky, but a lot of times they were thwarted because of the work of the \nmen and women in the military, the men and women in the intelligence \ncommunity, the men and women in law enforcement doing a lot of hard \nwork, sacrificing, some of them losing their lives to make sure that we \ndid not have a repeat of the 3,000 people murdered on 9/11.\n  We owe them, Mr. Chairman, more than just a thank-you. We owe them \nwhatever preparation, whatever equipment, whatever support they need to \ncontinue to battle terrorists today. That is what this bill tries to \ndo: to make sure that we don't send people out in the Middle East to \nbomb terrorists on airplanes that cannot fly, that cannot be \nmaintained, that we don't wear our pilots and our mechanics out. That \nis readiness. That is what we are talking about in this bill. That is \nwhat we have an obligation in this House to do for them who do so much \nfor us.\n  I oppose the gentlewoman's amendment. As I say, I have tremendous \nrespect for her views and the sincerity with which she holds them. I \nthink it results in a more dangerous world.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. 1098. REDUCTION OF AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Reduction.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, but subject to subsection (b), the President, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of \n     Energy, and the Administrator for Nuclear Security, shall \n     make such reductions in the amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated under this Act in such manner as the President \n     considers appropriate to achieve an aggregate reduction of 1 \n     percent of the total amount of funds authorized to be \n     appropriated under this Act. Such reduction shall be in \n     addition to any other reduction of funds required by law.\n       (b) Exclusions.--In carrying out subsection (a), the \n     President shall not reduce the amount of funds for the \n     following accounts:\n       (1) Military personnel, reserve personnel, and National \n     Guard personnel accounts of the Department of Defense.\n       (2) The Defense Health Program account.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Polis) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, this is a very simple amendment. When we look \nat our country's national security, it is important to make sure that \nwe don't mortgage our national security because fiscal security is an \nimportant part of protecting our country.\n  My amendment would give authority to the President of the United \nStates and the Secretary of Defense to reduce the overall amount of \nmoney authorized by this bill by 1 percent. It simply cuts defense \nspending by 1 percent.\n  As you know, we spend as much as the rest of the world, combined, on \ndefense. We want to have a strong defense, but of course, as you know, \nthis current authorization exceeds the levels of the Budget Control \nAct, even with this 1 percent reduction, which is really a compromise. \nIt only reduces it by $5.5 billion and, in fact, continues to authorize \nat a level of $10 billion more than the bipartisan Budget Control Act.\n  In a bill in which we overfunded multiple accounts and weapons \nsystems above the request level of the military, I think 1 percent is a \nvery reasonable request. It is about $5.5 billion. It is certainly \npossible to find these cuts. In fact, they are very likely to occur \nbecause, again, if we conform to the Budget Control Act, there would \nactually be a larger cut than even this humble one that we are offering \nbefore you today.\n  As an example, the bill authorizes $9.5 billion in nuclear weapons \nactivities alone. We could pass my amendment. Even if we allocated the \nentire cuts to nuclear weapons, we would still be spending $4 billion \non nuclear weapons. I think the estimate is we would then have enough \nto destroy the entire world and wipe out life as we know it three times \ninstead of six times. How much is enough?\n  There are plenty of other programs that we could look at. Of course, \nit should not be Congress making those decisions in a political manner; \nit should be the military and the executive. I imagine they would start \nwith accounts that Congress has chosen to overfund.\n  At some point, we have to stand up for fiscal security and realize \nthat mortgaging our future and our children's future to Saudi Arabia \nand China does not enhance our national security; it detracts from it.\n  My amendment is a small first step toward taking a stand against a \nmilitary budget that we simply cannot afford. We need to reduce our \nbudget deficit. This is a very small and simple way to start. We can \nmake these strategic cuts and, of course, still fully protect our \nnational security and even enhance it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment and take this \nmodest step toward fiscal responsibility as a compromise between the \nBudget Control Act levels and the committee authorization levels.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H2745]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  This amendment cuts defense below the President's request, below last \nyear's funding, and below what the last Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff said was the lower, ragged edge of what it takes to defend this \ncountry.\n  Let's just put in a little bit of context here. This bill, counting \nOCO and everything, is a whopping one-half of 1 percent over what we \nspent last year. One-half of 1 percent. Inflation is supposed to be 2.1 \npercent. So what it really means is this bill, even in real dollars, is \na cut, even as it is.\n  This bill is 23 percent less than we were spending on defense in real \nterms in 2010. Mr. Chairman, the world is not 23 percent safer now than \nit was 6 years ago. And yet the gentleman from Colorado's amendment \nwould cut that even further.\n  This bill stays within the amount requested by the President. It \nmeets the need for base requirements and provides a bridge fund for \ndeployments, just like Democratic majorities did for the last change of \nadministration. And I think that is the most reasonable response.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom the great State of California (Ms. Lee), a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to first thank Congressman Polis for \nyielding time and for his work to ensure that our Nation's fiscal \nsecurity is secure through this amendment. It is an honor to cosponsor \nthis amendment with him. I want to thank the ranking member also for \nguiding us through this very difficult bill to make sure that we all \nknow what is included in the bill.\n  I just have to say, our amendment, I think, would take a modest step \nin making this bill a lot better to help us rein in the over-the-top, \nquite frankly, Pentagon spending, while protecting the pay or health \nbenefit accounts of our brave servicemen and -women and their families.\n  Over the last 15 years, Pentagon spending has ballooned by 50 percent \nin real terms. Pentagon spending now consumes more than half of the \nFederal discretionary budget. That is just outrageous.\n  Recently, The New York Times made this case in their editorial called \n``A Better, Not Fatter, Defense Budget,'' which I include for the \nRecord.\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 9, 2016]\n\n                  A Better, Not Fatter, Defense Budget\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       To hear some military commanders and members of Congress \n     talk, the American military is worn out and in desperate need \n     of more money. After more than a decade in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan, they say, troops are lagging in training and new \n     weaponry, which is jeopardizing their ability to defeat the \n     Islamic State and deal with potential conflicts with Russia \n     and China.\n       While increased funding for some programs may be needed, \n     total military spending, at nearly $600 billion annually, is \n     not too low. The trouble is, the investment has often yielded \n     poor results, with the Pentagon, Congress and the White House \n     all making bad judgments, playing budget games and falling \n     under the sway of defense industry lobbyists. Current \n     military spending is 50 percent higher in real terms than it \n     was before 9/11, yet the number of active duty and reserve \n     troops is 6 percent smaller.\n       For nearly a decade after 9/11, the Pentagon had a virtual \n     blank check; the base defense budget rose, in adjusted \n     dollars, from $378 billion in 1998 to $600 billion in 2010. \n     As the military fought Al Qaeda and the Taliban, billions of \n     dollars were squandered on unnecessary items, including new \n     weapons that ran late and over budget like the troubled F-35 \n     jet fighter.\n       The waste and the budget games continue with the House \n     Armed Services Committee approving a $583 billion total \n     defense authorization bill for 2017 last month that skirts \n     the across-the-board caps imposed by Congress in 2011 on \n     discretionary federal spending.\n       The caps are supposed to restrain domestic and military \n     spending equally, but defense hawks have insisted on throwing \n     more money at the Pentagon. That doesn't encourage efficiency \n     or wise choices. The panel took $18 billion from a $59 \n     billion off-budget account, which has become a slush fund \n     renewed annually to finance the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and \n     other trouble spots, and is not subject to the budget caps, \n     and repurposed that money for use in the $524 billion base \n     military budget.\n       The move will underwrite the purchase of more ships, jet \n     fighters, helicopters and other big-ticket weapons that the \n     Pentagon didn't request and will keep the Army from falling \n     below 480,000 active-duty troops. It also means the war \n     account will run out of money next April. Representative Mac \n     Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the committee, \n     apparently assumes the next president will be forced to ask \n     for, and Congress will be forced to approve, more money for \n     the war account. This sleight of hand runs the risk that \n     troops overseas, at some point, could be deprived of some \n     resources, at least temporarily. The full House should reject \n     this maneuver.\n       Many defense experts, liberals and centrists as well as \n     hawks, agree that more investment is needed in maintenance, \n     training and modernizing aging weapons and equipment. These \n     needs were identified years ago, yet the Pentagon and \n     Congress have chosen to invest in excessively costly high-\n     tech weaponry while deferring maintenance and other \n     operational expenses.\n       The Pentagon can do with far fewer than the 1,700 F-35s it \n     plans on buying. It should pare back on President Obama's $1 \n     trillion plan to replace nearly every missile, submarine, \n     aircraft and warhead in the nuclear arsenal. Defense \n     officials recently reported that 22 percent of all military \n     bases will not be needed by 2019. Civilian positions will \n     have to be reduced, while reforms in health care and the \n     military procurement system need to be carried out. All of \n     these changes make good sense, given the savings they would \n     bring. But they are politically unpalatable; base closings, \n     for instance, have been stubbornly resisted in recent years \n     by lawmakers fearful of angering voters by eliminating jobs \n     in communities that are economically dependent on those \n     bases.\n       Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert with the Center for \n     Strategic and International Studies, says that sustaining the \n     current military force of roughly two million and paying for \n     all the new weapons systems will cost billions more than \n     Congress has allowed under the budget caps. To maintain \n     sensible troop levels, Congress and the administration need \n     to begin honestly addressing the hard fiscal choices that \n     they have largely been loath to make.\n\n  Ms. LEE. The article lists program after program, many of which our \ngenerals did not ask for, that have cost taxpayers billions without \nmaking us any safer.\n  Clearly, we also need to audit the Pentagon. That is why I am pleased \nthe House adopted the Burgess-Lee amendment yesterday to require a \nreport on auditability and help keep moving toward auditing the \nPentagon. While we were working on that, we should take every \nopportunity to address Pentagon spending.\n  The article in The New York Times sets forth: ``The waste and the \nbudget games continue with the House Armed Services Committee approving \na $583 billion total defense authorization.''\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Wittman), the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee \non Readiness.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to reiterate the importance of \nmaking sure that we are funding defense at the President's request. The \nFY 2017 request, I think, is minimally adequate, but it is not just me. \nThe administration's own Secretary of the Army Murphy stated that this \nbudget request is minimally adequate and that we are taking a high risk \nas an Army and as a Nation when the Army is funded at this level. So \nthere is still risk there with this level of funding.\n  As the chairman pointed out, we live in a more dangerous world today, \nbut we see our Marine Corps and Air Force having to go to aircraft that \nare museum exhibits to cannibalize parts to bring them in to have a \nminimally operational cadre of aircraft.\n  We see this, too, when we talk about only 9 of the 20 B-1 bombers are \navailable today because they are lacking parts and when we have 30 \npercent or less of our Marine Corps helicopters available because they \nare lacking parts. We see that, in a squadron of 14 jets, only 3 in the \nMarine Corps are available because they are lacking parts.\n  It is irresponsible not to provide to the brave men and women that \nserve this Nation the things that they need. We are asking them to go \ninto harm's way. We are asking them to do tremendously difficult jobs. \nWe are asking them to maintain safety. Yet we are not providing them \nthe resources necessary.\n  This amendment would do even more to take away what is already a \nchallenging situation for those brave men and women that are doing a \ntremendous job and that, as their leaders have said, are being stressed \nto the breaking point because they do not have the basic resources to \nkeep those aircraft flying, to keep those ships on the\n\n[[Page H2746]]\n\nwater, to keep those systems necessary to be able to perform the job \nthat we have asked them to do.\n  We have an obligation as a Nation that, when we ask those brave men \nand women to go into harm's way, to support them. It is unconscionable \nwhen we don't do that, when we have situations like 84 percent of our \nMarine Corps aircraft are in a nonready status, based on a 10-year \naverage.\n  So when we talk about taking dollars away, what signal does that send \nto the brave men and women serving in the military? I think this \namendment cuts to the heart of what we must do as a Nation, and that is \nto rebuild readiness, not degrade readiness.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, there are a number of programs which \nCongress has forced spending on the military that even the military has \nnot requested.\n  As an example, we blocked the Navy from making a sound fiscal \ndecision saving $900 million to shutter a carrier air wing. There are a \ndozen more Black Hawk and Apache helicopters than requested by the \nmilitary to meet our national defense needs. There are two extra V-22 \nOspreys that were not requested, 500 extra Javelin missiles above the \nrequest, 500 more extra Hydra guided rockets, and 75 extra Sidewinder \nmissiles.\n  These are just some of the examples of some the low-hanging fruit \nthat we can use to restore military funding to a more fiscally \nresponsible manner.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado raising the \nissue that he just raised because it gives me the opportunity to affirm \nthat many of the programs he was just mentioning like the Black Hawks, \nfor example, have been requested by many of the Members on his side of \nthe aisle. And they were included in the unfunded requirements list \nfrom the Army.\n  So the way it works is we get all sorts of requests from Members on \nboth sides of the aisle. Each of the services gives us a list of what \nthey would like to have had in the budget request but the \nadministration took out, and then where the two match up as Member \npriorities and service priorities, that is what these funds are.\n  It is not that they weren't asked for from the military. It is the \nmilitary wanted them but OMB took them out. And when you have many \nMembers, particularly on the Black Hawks, the V-22s, the LCS, and a \nnumber of the items he just mentioned on his side of the aisle, asking \nfor them as well as the service, then that becomes part of the \nmodernization priority.\n  Let me just make one other point. In the Black Hawk case \nspecifically, these new Black Hawks will replace helicopters that were \nbuilt in 1979, for which we cannot get parts, which have very \nrestricted flight envelopes because of all the restrictions. They can't \nbe repaired. They can't do everything the Army wants them to do.\n  So the administration did not ask for any. Many Members on the \nDemocratic side asked for some. We put them in here. And that is the \nway to fix readiness: by replacing a 1979 helicopter with a 2016 \nhelicopter.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 2 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY.

Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nSmith) each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, I am very grateful to Chairman Thornberry for \nallowing me to present this amendment.\n  Today, I rise in support of my amendment to the NDAA in support of \nthe U-2, known as the Dragon Lady, one of the must successful spy \nplanes ever built. Its unique capabilities have served our Nation's \nhigh-altitude intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission \nfor decades.\n  What many don't know is that the U-2 is not a cold war relic. It is \nstill current. The most recent ones were made in the 1980s. U-2s are \ncurrently flying more hours today than at any point since the end of \nthe cold war and have been deployed in our ongoing efforts to defeat \nISIS.\n  Flying at an altitude of 70,000 feet, the U-2 is able to reach \nheights other spy planes cannot. Because the U-2 can reach such \nextraordinary heights, it is able to use high-tech sensors to increase \nits ability to collect intelligence.\n  Other unique features of the U-2 include cloud-piercing radar and \ninterchangeable nose cones. The U-2 can also take incredible high-\nresolution photographs on a 10,500-foot reel wet film.\n  My amendment to the NDAA will prevent the Air Force from retiring the \nU-2. It is absolutely essential to our ability to meet our high-\naltitude intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance needs.\n  In addition to aiding in the fight against ISIS, General Philip \nBreedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander and the head of U.S. forces \nin Europe, called for the use of U-2s in countering the strategic \nthreat posed by Vladimir Putin.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. General Breedlove said:\n  ``EUCOM needs additional intelligence collection platforms, such as \nthe U-2 or the RC-135, to assist the increased collection requirements \nin the theatre.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I listened to the frustration of the \nchairman describing the process, and I sympathize with that. I have sat \nand admitted that this committee has one of the most difficult tasks, \nbecause as long as we are sort of unhinged here from the reality and \nthe accountability of how they all work out, we will have people make \nrequests for this or the administration will leave something out there, \nand it is difficult for the committee to try to make sense of reality \nout of these conflicting requests.\n  Out of this, I think there is an elephant in the room of an \nunrealistic, unsustainable, and unnecessary trillion-dollar path we are \non for the nuclear triad of bombers, land-based missiles, and the \nsubmarines.\n  These are weapons that we have never used in 71 years. These are \nweapons that do not help us with the major challenges that vex this \ncommittee right now in terms of military readiness, the challenges \ndealing with ISIS, dealing with encroachment by the Chinese, problems \nwith Russia.\n  These are weapons that didn't stop Russian aggression in the Crimea \nor Ukraine or Chinese encroachment. These are weapons that don't deter \nthe greatest nuclear threat we face, which is nuclear materials falling \ninto the hands of extremist elements from rogue nations like North \nKorea or some of our purported friends in Pakistan.\n  These are the threats that we face. And this muscle-bound nuclear \ntriad that we are going to spend a trillion dollars on does not help \nus.\n  There is enough blame, I think, to go around. The administration made \nan agreement to upgrade and modernize all these nuclear weapons in \ntheir effort to get the nonproliferation treaty advanced. I think it \nwas a foolish bargain, an expensive bargain. They are not going to be \naround to have to deliver on the trillion dollars. They are nibbling \naround the edges and moving these things forward and leaving the big \ndecisions for the future.\n  They have actually made it worse by not fighting aggressively for \nnonproliferation resources to help us keep these materials out of the \nhands of the extremists and retire nuclear weapons that are floating \naround the world now.\n  We have more nuclear weapons than we need, more nuclear weapons than \nwe can use, more nuclear weapons than we can afford. We can debate \nwhether we have enough to destroy the world 3 times, 5 times, or 10 \ntimes. What is ironic is that we never have that debate on the floor of \nthe House on how the tradeoffs occur, what the threats to conventional \nmilitary capacity are, and how they fit into an overall scheme of \naffairs.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I suggest this is the least-effective part of our \noverall\n\n[[Page H2749]]\n\ndefense inventory. I would hope that, in the future, when maybe we have \na new administration willing to turn a page, when we have a Congress \nthat is willing to entertain a broad and robust debate about this \ncritical issue, that we can deal with an effort to rein in this \ntrillion-dollar spending folly that is going to have disastrous effects \nfor our military readiness in the years ahead.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Chairman, the reason these weapons have not been used since 1945 \nis that we have had a credible nuclear deterrent. The fastest way to \nhave a more dangerous, destabilized world is for the credibility of \nthat deterrent to erode, and I worry about that.\n  Secondly, if you look at what is planned with upgrading the weapons \nand the delivery systems, at no point does it become more than 11 \npercent of the U.S. defense budget. That is a pretty good investment to \nmake sure that they are not used, and I suggest that it is well worth \nthe investment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, the amendment I offer today, in cooperation with the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) requires a report simply from \nthe Secretary of Defense, detailing the quantity, composition, and lost \nincome of survivors currently affected by the Dependency and Indemnity \nCompensation offset to the Survivor Benefit Program.\n  It continues this body's crucial, bipartisan effort to find a \nfeasible solution for the disgraceful way we shortchange and penalize \nour military widows and widowers.\n  This mandatory offset hurts those who have already given more to \nfreedom than most of us ever will, the life of a spouse.\n  It hurts women like the Army Sergeant First Class who recently \ncontacted me. She is an Afghan veteran herself, mother of three. \nTragically, she also is a Gold Star Wife due to the death of her \nhusband in Iraq in 2004. As a young widow of a servicemember who died \nas a result of his service, she is not eligible to receive the full \namount of her benefits, making the burden of living without her spouse \nthat much more difficult at a time of enormous adjustment for their \nfamily. What's more, if she were a Federal civil service survivor, she \ncould receive both benefits.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. If she were a civil service survivor, she could receive \nboth benefits; and if she were over the age of 37, she could receive \nboth benefits. Her husband gave his life for liberty. She is a veteran, \ntoo. We must honor their sacrifice as we honor the sacrifice of any \nother American who dies in service to our Nation, and find a way to fix \nthis awkward offset.\n  This report will help us better define the situation so we can find \njust solutions. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke), a member of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my colleague from \nFlorida's amendment to create a Judge Advocate General career \nlitigation track in the Army and the U.S. Air Force.\n  The legislation provides the Army and Air Force JAG officers with \ntrial and prosecutorial experience that is absolutely critical.\n  Currently, Army and Air Force JAGs lack experience, as multiple \nreports have said. As a matter of fact, a shocking 89 percent of \nmilitary prosecutors only have 10 or fewer contested cases. This \ninexperience is a disservice to those who seek justice under the \nUniform Code of Military Justice.\n  Anyone who has suffered a transgression and sexual assault or other \ncrime while serving in the military, quite frankly, deserves the best.\n  The Navy has implemented this litigation path and is already reaping \ngreat results. It is time for the Air Force and the Army to follow \nsuit.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I want to make clear that my opposition to the bill at this point is \nnot just based on the exclusion of the amendment that would have lifted \nthe discrimination against the LGBT community. That was sort of the \nlast straw.\n  I was on the fence about this bill from the very beginning because, \nunderstand that this bill continues the pattern of the last few years, \nof putting our defense on a fiscal path to nowhere, a fiscal path \ntowards a cliff of not having the money to fund what needs to be funded \nbecause the Budget Control Act remains in place.\n  Now, the chairman repeatedly says that in 2008, we did this when a \nnew administration was coming in. We only funded half of the overseas \ncontingency operation fund, knowing the supplemental was coming.\n  There was no Budget Control Act in 2008. The Budget Control Act is in \nplace. Even if we get a supplemental in April--and in this Congress, \ngetting additional money is no guarantee--the Budget Control Act \nremains in place, and this Congress has shown a complete unwillingness \nto get rid of it.\n  So what we are doing by funding all of these programs that some of my \ncolleagues have started, we are funding a defense that we cannot \nsustain.\n  I think the best example of this is the military wanted to cut the \nsize of the Marine Corps and the Army. Now, the levels that they wanted \nto cut them to were levels that no one in the defense community wanted \nto cut them to, but that was the amount of money that they have \navailable under the Budget Control Act.\n  As soon as we repeal the Budget Control Act, we will have a lot \neasier conversation about how to fund defense; but what we are doing to \nnational security right now is we are creating a bow wave that they \nwill not be able to absorb.\n  When the Budget Control Act kicks in again next year, all of a sudden \nthe Army and the Marine Corps will have to, like that, cut--my numbers \nmay be off a little bit here--30,000 in the Army, 10,000 in the Marine \nCorps. You can't really do that in any sort of reasonable way. It will \nbe incredibly disruptive to the military, incredibly disruptive to \nreadiness.\n  Now, I will agree with the chairman that a passionate case can be \nmade for spending more on defense. Heck, if we spent a trillion dollars \non defense, a passionate case could be made for spending even more than \nthat when you look at the threat environment. But we have the money we \nhave.\n  He also cited that, in 2010 numbers, we are now 23 percent below \nwhere we are at, and that is true. But we are 23 percent below where we \nare at because of the 2011 Budget Control Act which, again, this House \nrefuses to repeal.\n  So instead of dealing with the amount of money that Congress has \nforced the Department of Defense to deal with, we fantasize that more \nmoney will appear, and in that fantasy, we put the military in an \nimpossible situation.\n  We start all of these programs. There is not the money to finish \nthose programs. And maybe someone can tell me where this money is going \nto come from, how it is going to magically appear, when we are $19 \ntrillion in debt--I forget off the top of my head what the deficit is \nthis year, but it is somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 or $600 \nbillion--deficits for as far as the eye can see; the Freedom Caucus on \nthe Republican side refusing to spend any more money.\n  This money is not going to appear. And so what we are going to have \nis we are going to have a military that has to cut drastically and \nirresponsibly in the blink of an eye because we refused to let them do \nit responsibly.\n  I would urge Members to read Secretary Carter's testimony before the \nSenate earlier this week or last week where he outlined what a \ndevastating impact this defense bill will have on our national security \nwhen the bills that it is charging actually come due.\n  Now, that is the primary reason to oppose this bill; contemplating \nswallowing that and hoping that, like last year, we could fix that in \nconference.\n  But in addition to that, to have discriminatory provisions in it \nbrings me\n\n[[Page H2750]]\n\nback to 2009, when the Republicans opposed the defense bill because it \nhad an antihate crime piece of legislation attached to it.\n  There are reasons to oppose the defense bill other than you just \ndon't really like people who serve in the military, and that is a \ncondescending and irresponsible argument to make against those who \nwould oppose the bill.\n  If we continue down this funding path, we are not serving the \nmilitary. All of these readiness disasters that we keep hearing about \nhave, in part, happened because of the way this committee and the \nAppropriations Committee has funded defense for the last 3 or 4 years, \nby taking from readiness to fund a wide variety of programs, including \nthe beginning of the $1 trillion Mr. Blumenauer talked about for our \nnuclear deterrent.\n  We are not making choices. We refuse to get rid of the A-10. We \nrefuse to lay off 11 cruisers. We refuse to allow the military to \nshrink its size and, instead, we keep putting it on a credit card and \nhoping that the money will appear.\n\n  Well, when that money doesn't appear--and it is not going to. I \nhaven't seen money just sort of burst out of nowhere in my lifetime. \nMaybe we will be lucky and maybe it will be the first time--but it puts \nthe Department of Defense in a tenuous position.\n  We need to start making choices based on the money that we actually \nhave. This bill doesn't do that.\n  Six months from now, our troops serving in Afghanistan and Iraq will \nhave no money, and we hope that problem fixes itself. That is a \nnational security reason for opposing this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I think I made clear a few moments ago that I believe \nwe need to have a better way to fund defense, a more predictable way. \nBut, Mr. Chairman, I am not willing to wait to support the military \nuntil that is done. I am not willing to wait until we have tax reform \nand entitlement reform and all sorts of other things before I am \nwilling to stand up and support the military. There are lives at stake \ntoday, and we have enormous challenges in the future, there is no \nquestion, budgetary and otherwise.\n  But I think it would be a mistake if I were to say we have all these \nchallenges coming down the road, therefore, I am not going to fix this \nproblem that is affecting pilots, mechanics, others today. We can do \nsomething about it today.\n  As a matter of fact, the gentleman talks about the Budget Control \nAct. We have made some alterations to the Budget Control Act for each \nof the last 4 years because of this problem.\n  I think most people, at least on both sides of the aisle, realize \nthat when you cut defense 23 percent since 2010, and the world is not \n23 percent safer, we are not asking our military folks for 23 percent \nfewer deployments, that something has got to give.\n  So there has been--it has been painful, it has been messy, it has not \nbeen ideal, but there has been some alterations to the Budget Control \nAct.\n  I said a while ago that I am for doing away with these artificial \ncaps. The Budget Control Act did not work as anyone, I think, intended. \nThere was never the mandatory spending reform that was the goal.\n  And what bore the brunt of the cuts?\n  Defense.\n  Fifteen percent of the budget has absorbed 50 percent of the cuts \nunder the Budget Control Act. That is wrong.\n  Now, I think if Members on both sides of the aisle committed to \nworking together to fix that, we could. Now, that would involve not \nhaving a President use the military as a hostage to try to force more \ndomestic spending, which is what this President has done. That would \nmean that we focus on trying to fix defense, and understand that all of \nus have other priorities that we need to also work on at the same time.\n  But we are always going to have different budget laws and different \ncircumstances. I still do not understand how a Democratic majority, in \n2008, could use this approach, to give the new President the benefit of \nthe doubt, the benefit of a fresh look; and when we try to do the same \nfor the next President, who none of us know who it is going to be, but \nwhen we try to use the same approach, all of a sudden then you just \ncan't do it. It is irresponsible, it is a gimmick, and all sorts of \nnames.\n  The gentleman mentioned that we are not making choices and mentioned \nspecifically the A-10.\n  Mr. Chairman, there are a lot more things that I would like to have \ndone in this bill, lots of additional programs I would like to have \nauthorized. We had to make difficult choices.\n  But just to take the A-10 for an example, the administration has \nproposed eliminating the A-10 for the past several years. This Congress \nreached a different judgment on that. That is what the Constitution, by \nthe way, says we are supposed to do. It is our job to raise and \nsupport, build and maintain the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  On the A-10 program, we reached a different conclusion. We decided \nthat, until you have something to take its place, we shouldn't get rid \nof it.\n  And you know what?\n  The Secretary of Defense has testified that it has been devastating \nin its use against ISIS today. If we had eliminated it, it wouldn't be \nthere.\n  So sometimes our judgment--and we have a long list of instances where \nCongress, under majorities of both parties, have exercised a different \njudgment from the administration and where we were proved right. So we \nmake tough choices. Sometimes our choices actually turn out to look \npretty good in hindsight.\n  But the bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is we could all wait to support a \ndefense bill until some far-off condition were met. It is easy to vote \n``no'' unless something happens or unless some condition is met; but \nfor this, if only that. That is easy.\n  But that does not fix the immediate problems that face the men and \nwomen who volunteer to defend our country, the problems that they are \nfacing today. That is what we are trying to do with this bill. We don't \nactually fix them. We just start to turn it around.\n  I don't think there is an excuse that justifies opposing doing what \nis right for them, and that is the reason I believe that this bill \nshould be supported. I hope Members will support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Ellison\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 1215(b)--\n       (1) strike paragraphs (2), (3), and (4);\n       (2) in paragraph (6), insert ``and'' after ``2018;'';\n       (3) in paragraph (7), strike ``; and'' and insert a period; \n     and\n       (4) strike paragraph (8).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes language telling the \nPresident to expand our mission in Afghanistan, language that tells the \nPresident to put more of our troops in harm's way, to go backwards \ntowards a combat mission in Afghanistan.\n  Now, Republicans may not say it, but the effect is exactly what they \nare pushing for--moving the United States military and the United \nStates back toward a combat mission in Afghanistan, not forward away \nfrom one. Worse yet, they are pushing for an expanded mission before \nthe new commander on the ground, General John Nicholson, finishes his \nreview. That is right. Congress is giving instructions to the President \nbefore the current commander has weighed in. This is a mistake.\n\n[[Page H2751]]\n\n  So the opening line of the sense of Congress tells the President to \nleave 9,800 troops in Afghanistan next year. The current plan calls for \n5,500. This sets the tone for what is next. Unfortunately, the \namendment that strikes this language was not ruled in order.\n  My amendment starts by striking the next provision. The Republicans \nwant our military to unilaterally strike the Taliban. Now, of course, \nthese people are absolutely bad news, but the State Department does not \nrecognize them as a terrorist organization at this time. This is a \ndecision that should be based on military considerations.\n  Thus, our counterterrorism mission is allowed to strike and go after \nDaesh and al Qaeda, but the mission regarding the Taliban is defensive \nin nature; and if that is going to be changed, it should be based on \nmilitary considerations, not just through a piece of legislation.\n  In fact, the Afghans are leading all missions against the Taliban, \nand this has been happening well before we transitioned to a noncombat \nmission. So let's not call for going back to combat mission tactics, \nespecially when the commander has not asked for it.\n  Finally, I would like to talk about a particular provision that is \nclose to me. I would like to address what I regard as actually a \ntroubling piece in the provision, which says, and I will quote from the \nproposed legislation:\n\n       The United States military personnel who are tasked with \n     the mission of providing combat search and rescue support, \n     casualty evacuation, and medical support should not be \n     counted as part of any force management level limitation on \n     the number of United States ground forces in Afghanistan.\n\n  This is a mistake. I believe that our medical personnel and others \nshould be considered boots on the ground, contrary to the language in \nthe provision. Combat medics carry weapons, they take casualties, and \nthey are killed. Why shouldn't we count them? It doesn't seem to make \nsense to me. One of the closest people in the whole wide world to me is \nan Active Duty military combat medic, and if they are in a war zone, I \nwant them counted.\n  So with that, I ask for my amendment to be approved and included, and \nI ask that we listen to military people on the ground before we start \ntrying to tell them what to do, and that we absolutely count combat \nmedics and people who do rescue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner), the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTactical Air and Land Forces.\n  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I am going to try to make some sense of \nthis.\n  We just had an amendment where we were debating providing the \nAuthorization of Use of Military Force to the President, and we wanted \nto make certain that the President had the authority, and this is the \nportion of our bill where we actually provide authority. The word \n``authority'' is throughout these sections that are, by this amendment, \nbeing asked to be deleted. But as Mr. Ellison stated, we should look to \nthe commanders on the ground. So let's look at what they have said.\n  General Campbell, testifying about the Haqqani network, said that it \nremains the most capable threat to U.S. and coalition forces.\n  Now, what does threat mean? It means that they are trying to kill us \nand our coalition forces. It is a State Department-designated terrorist \norganization which harbors al Qaeda and is the most lethal actor on the \nbattlefield. These provisions that will be deleted relate to our \nability to fight them.\n  Approximately 30 percent of district centers are under Taliban \ncontrol and influence or are at such risk, says General Campbell.\n  Now, General Nicholson, who is currently the commander, is doing his \nreview. That is correct. But what we are doing in these provisions is \nproviding the status quo. We are not presuming that he is going to come \nback and say: Let's cut; we can go do this with less troops. We are \nallowing that he would have the same resources that General Campbell \nhad so that he would have an ability to defend our troops.\n  Basically, if you go down to these paragraphs that are being deleted, \nthis comes down to some fairly easy decisions:\n  If you believe that ISIL is not a threat to our troops, vote for this \namendment.\n  If you believe that ISIL is not a threat to our allies in the Middle \nEast, vote for this amendment.\n  If you believe that the killings that were directed and inspired by \nISIL in Brussels and Paris are not a threat to our Nation or our NATO \nallies, vote for this amendment.\n  If you believe that it is okay for the Taliban to control portions of \nAfghan territory, even though al Qaeda planned and directed 9/11 under \nTaliban-controlled Afghanistan, vote for this amendment.\n  If you believe that the U.S. and NATO troops should be responsible \nfor Afghan security, and not Afghan security forces, vote for this \namendment.\n  If you believe, however, that we have a responsibility for our \nnational security and to our troops, vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, first, let me thank Congressman Ellison for \nyielding and for his tremendous leadership. This amendment is extremely \nimportant.\n  Today I rise to urge my colleagues to support this amendment and, \nreally, allow our ground commanders to do their job. Now, of course, \ntime and time again, Congress has refused to do its job. From Zika \nfunding to confirming a new Supreme Court Justice, we failed to do our \njob.\n  Instead of letting Congress do its job, the majority only seems \ninterested in Congress doing other peoples' jobs, and that is including \nour military commanders. There is no way we should be allowing this to \nhappen.\n\n  Make no mistake, Republicans are trying to expand the U.S. mission in \nAfghanistan and further expand America's longest war. For nearly 15 \nyears, we have been fighting a war in Afghanistan. Our brave servicemen \nand -women have gone way beyond the call of duty. They have done \neverything we have asked them to do. It is past time to bring them home \nto their families and to their children. But minimally, we should not \nbe telling our military leaders what to do in a war zone, especially \nbefore they have completed their on-the-ground assessment.\n  So I hope that we vote ``yes'' on this commonsense amendment. While \nour young men and women are in Afghanistan, until we bring them home, \nlet's use the best type of intelligence, the best information, and the \nbest direction that the ground commanders have determined based on \ntheir ground assessment in this war.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, just to be clear, the underlying provisions which the \ngentleman's amendment would strike are sense of Congress provisions. \nBasically, it is the sense of Congress that the ground commanders ought \nto make these decisions.\n  Unfortunately, artificial troop caps and overly restrictive \nrequirements on our military increase the danger that our military \nfaces in Afghanistan. So if you draw down too low the number of people \nyou have, for example, then you don't have enough to protect yourself. \nThat is part of what we are seeing in Afghanistan.\n  If you tie the military's hands and say, ``Okay. You cannot go after \nthis enemy, even though they may pose the most deadly threat to you,'' \nthen you increase the danger to our military. That is exactly what \nthese provisions try to deal with.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Afghans are doing the fighting in Afghanistan. They \nare advancing and getting more capable all the time, but they still \nneed us to be there and to advise and assist them.\n  Just to look briefly at some of the provisions that the gentleman \nwould strike, one says that the commander in\n\n[[Page H2752]]\n\nAfghanistan has the authority to strike the Haqqani network. They are \nthe ones that pose, in many people's eyes, the biggest threat for big \nbombings and so forth in that region. Why would we not allow our \nmilitary commander, if he wants to, if he thinks it is right, to strike \nthem?\n  Another provision the gentleman strikes is the one that says that we \nought to have resources to go after ISIS. Remember, Mr. Chairman, that \nit is not just al Qaeda and the Taliban that are growing in \nAfghanistan. ISIS is growing there, too. This just says we ought to do \nsomething about that. The gentleman's amendment would strike it.\n  On troop caps, part of what is happening in Afghanistan is that we \nare artificially limiting the number of people there. As I mentioned, \nthat increases the danger to the troops we do have there. Otherwise, we \nare bringing some people in on a temporary basis or hiring contractors \nto do the job.\n  So these artificial troop caps mean that commanders and the \nadministration have got to find all these ways around it, but they \nstill increase the danger that the people we do have there face. That \ndoesn't make sense. There are still dangers in Afghanistan to our \nnational security.\n  These provisions the gentleman would strike just try to untie the \nhands of our military so they can deal with it on a military basis, not \na political basis.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I urge Members to do \nlikewise.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Ellison\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 1502 and insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 1502.

Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge support for my amendment to \nH.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.\n  The overseas contingency operations account is supposed to provide \nemergency funding for wars and unexpected operations overseas, \noperations that cannot be planned for in the base budget.\n  Republicans are raiding this account. They are taking money from \nmissions designed to protect our Nation from imminent threats to feed \nthe military industrial complex. They argue that this makes our \nmilitary stronger and that it improves our national security; but what \nit really does is, the Republicans have taken money from operations \noverseas and put it towards money for procurement, for nonwar needs, so \nmuch so that the operators would only be funded through 2017, April of \nnext year. My amendment puts the money back.\n  Mr. Chairman, Secretary Carter stated that this gimmick is gambling \n``with warfighter money at a time of war.'' He said: ``It would spend \nmoney taken from the war account on things that are not DOD's highest \npriorities across the joint force.''\n  My amendment takes the $9.4 billion taken for procurement on items \nlike extra F-35s and the littoral combat ship, which the Pentagon did \nnot prioritize, and puts the funds back in the OCO operations and \nmaintenance account.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mr. Chair, $26 million of that money will go to preventing suicides \namongst our military, as the President's request for this was $26 \nmillion lower than the amount we appropriated in 2016. This problem is \nnot going down, and it should not receive less support from us.\n  In summary, we are putting money back where it belongs. We are \nsupporting our troops on the ground. We are supporting those services \noverseas. We are supporting military readiness. We are supporting the \npriorities of the Pentagon and the President, not those of the defense \nindustry.\n  And I will say, Mr. Chairman, that if I were to ask you who I got a \ncall from and ask you to guess, did I get a call from the President's \noffice or the Pentagon or Boeing, the answer would be number three, \nBoeing. That is who called me and doesn't like this particular \namendment. In fact, we didn't hear from the others. We heard from the \nindustry, the special interests.\n  Let's just say the Republicans do push through extra funds for OCO \nnext year. This would still be shortchanging domestic programs that \nwill have to be cut to pay for the defense industry.\n  We all know that Republicans won't let us raise taxes to cover \nadditional costs. We won't be able to take on more debt. Americans are \ngoing to suffer under the Republicans' scheme to give the Pentagon \nequipment and the industry just more.\n  I oppose it, and I urge support for my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Turner).\n  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, when we read our newspapers, we certainly \nknow that the world is becoming a much less safe place. The conflicts \naround the world and the ability of our military to respond are \nincredibly important. But also, if you read the newspaper, you \nunderstand that our military is at a critical juncture. The effects of \nsequestration have significantly undermined the readiness of our \nmilitary.\n  The argument that Mr. Ellison is making about what pot of money funds \ncome out of is kind of irrelevant in that his amendment isn't pure and \nthat he doesn't take all of the money out of one pot and move it into \nanother. He only takes a portion. The President does the same thing in \nthis shell game of where dollars come from. It is not an issue of where \ndo dollars come from. It is an issue of, where do they go?\n  If you read this bill, the issue of where these go, which is what Mr. \nEllison wants to stop, is moneys that go to readiness. It goes to the \nability of our military to be prepared.\n  The Admiral Vice Chief of Staff, General Daniel Allyn, recently \nexplained that to build readiness ``the Army has been forced to cancel \nor delay military construction, sustainment, restoration,\n\n[[Page H2753]]\n\nand modernization across our posts, camps, and stations. Additionally, \nthe Army reduced key installation services, individual training \nprograms, and modernization.'' In essence, readiness.\n  This amendment strips away funding from critical programs that have \nbeen identified by our military services that were not fully funded by \nthe President's budget request that go to readiness. We are currently \nin a readiness crisis.\n  Marine pilots are having to cannibalize museum parts to get their F-\n18s ready to deploy. Of the Marine Corps 271 strike aircraft, only 46 \ncan fly. Of the most severe type of aviation accidents, Marines are 84 \npercent above their 10-year average. The Air Force maintainers are also \ncannibalizing museum parts to get aircraft in the air. Of the 20 B-1 \nbombers, which are workhorses in Iraq and Syria, only 9 can fly due to \nparts and maintenance shortfalls. Pilots are getting less than half of \ntheir training required during a time when our adversaries are becoming \nincreasingly capable and technologically advanced.\n  The Air Force's Vice Chief of Staff, David Goldfein, recently stated \nduring congressional testimony that lower than planned funding levels \nhave resulted in one of the smallest, oldest, and least ready forces \nacross the full-spectrum of operations in our history.\n  Voting for this amendment supports cutting our troops' strength, \ncutting training and maintenance, forcing our armed services to \nmaintain crumbling facilities, and forcing our servicemembers to \ncontinue to rely on faulty and worn out equipment.\n  It is not an issue of what pot this money comes out of. It is a \nmatter of where it goes. It needs to go for our servicemembers, so vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Rice of South Carolina). The gentleman from \nMinnesota has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentleman for yielding, and \nfor introducing this amendment, and for his leadership to end waste, \nfraud, and abuse at the Pentagon.\n  This amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, would stop Republicans \nfrom using the overseas contingency operation fund as a piggy bank for \nmore wasteful Pentagon spending. Yes, it really does appear that \nChristmas is coming in May for the military-industrial complex.\n  Right now, Republicans have robbed critical programs, like military \nsuicide prevention, and redirected that money to the OCO fund where \nthere is no accountability, no transparency, or oversight. By funneling \nthis money to the OCO account, Republicans are shortchanging lifesaving \nprograms to fund wasteful programs, like the F-35 and tanks that rust \nin the Nevada desert.\n  Even the Pentagon say they don't want these programs funded. Yet, \nRepublicans are jeopardizing our real national security priorities to \nfurther enrich the military-industrial complex.\n\n  Our troops deserve better, Mr. Chairman. This is a dangerous \nbudgeting gimmick. This amendment would end the OCO fraud and return \nthe funds to the important programs that they were intended for.\n  Let's end this scheme and put the money back into where it belongs, \nand that is protecting our troops and the American people.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, let me just conclude by saying that it is \ntime to put resources where they are needed, among suicide prevention \nand directly to our troops, not into simply more military-industrial \ncomplex procurement stuff, not just to help private business feed its \nbottom line profit, but to help our soldiers and to help our military \non the ground, when needed.\n  I urge support for my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, just to be clear, the President in his budget request \ntakes some of the OCO dollars and uses it to meet base requirements. He \ndoes that in his budget. It is not a question of whether it is done or \nnot. The question is, how much?\n  And even though the President uses OCO dollars to help meet base \nshortfalls, his own Comptroller in the defense budget review writes, \neven though they do that in the President's budget request: ``The \nDepartment will continue to experience gaps in training and maintenance \nover the near term and have a reduced margin of error in dealing with \nrisks of uncertainty in a dynamic and shifting security environment.''\n  In other words, even the President's own budget documents say that it \nis not enough what he has done. So what we try to do is we try to do \nmore. We are not going to do it all, but we try to do more to make sure \nthat the training and maintenance that our troops are entitled to are \nprovided. What that means is we should not send anyone out on a mission \nfor which they are not fully prepared and fully supported.\n  The problem is, as I mentioned awhile ago with the Black Hawk \nexample, some of these folks have to fly helicopters that were made in \n1979. I, myself, saw a fighter plane that President Reagan sent to bomb \nMuammar Qadhafi in 1986, and they couldn't find the parts for it. The \npilot tried. He figured out a way to take a part off of a museum \naircraft and tried to make it fit, but the holes were drilled in the \nwrong place, so it didn't work.\n  The only thing you can do to replace a helicopter made in 1979 or an \nairplane that was flown on a mission in 1986 is to get a new one. So \nthat is what the procurement is.\n  As I mentioned a few moments ago, we have had a number of people from \nthe Democratic side of the aisle who have asked for C-40s, MQ-4s, Black \nHawks, B-22s, F-18s, F-35s, C-130s. Now, they didn't just invent that. \nThe reason that Democratic Members have asked for those things above \nand beyond what the President submitted is because there is a real need \nand because the only way we are going to fix some of these readiness \nproblems, in addition to more money for training and maintenance, more \nmoney for facilities, and preventing further cuts in end strength, is \nto replace some of this old equipment with new equipment. That is what \nwe do. The gentleman would undo that. I think his amendment should be \ndefeated.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 3 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 735, I \noffer amendments en bloc.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendments en bloc.\n  Amendments en bloc No. 3 consisting of amendment Nos. 20, 36, 37, 39, \n48, 49, 52, 53, 59, and 63 printed in House Report 114-571, offered by \nMr. Thornberry of Texas:\n\n\n          amendment no. 20 offered by mr. thornberry of texas\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 12XX.

Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMoulton) each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak first about an amendment to be \nconsidered in a later en bloc regarding Special Immigrant Visas. I want \nto call attention to the urgent need to continue the Special Immigrant \nVisa program for Afghans who worked for U.S. forces.\n  This bipartisan amendment, backed by several veterans on the \ncommittee, would remove the unfortunate narrowing of eligibility \nrequirements included in the mark, which would prevent hundreds of \nAfghans whose lives are at risk because of their work for our country \nfrom even being considered for resettlement in the United States.\n  The narrowing of eligibility intentionally excludes hundreds of \nAfghans who worked for the State Department, USAID, and U.S. security \ncontractors in a number of capacities, many of whom face well-\ndocumented death threats due to their work with our government, \nregardless of whether that was with frontline troops or on an American \nbase.\n  By narrowing eligibility, the program would erode the expectations of \nhundreds of Afghan staff whose lives remain in danger because of their \nwork for the U.S. mission and also make it more difficult to hire and \nretain qualified Afghan staff in the future who are essential to \nachieving our diplomatic and assistance goals.\n  For that risk and sacrifice, the very least we can do is offer them a \nchance to stay live, to keep living, rather than abandoning them to the \nsame enemies they united with us to destroy.\n  One of the things I was most proud of as a Marine infantry officer \nwas that we never let our enemies make us compromise our values. One of \nthose values is a solemn commitment to our allies and to our brothers \nin arms.\n  I urge your support on the floor in following through on our \ncommitment to our Afghan partners.\n  I also want to comment on the fact that the chairman of the committee \nand I worked to resolve some differences that we had on understanding \nthe concerns of our diplomatic mission in Afghanistan. I appreciate \nvery much his work with me on that to support our troops and mission \noverseas.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from \nMassachusetts, and he is exactly right. He and other Members are very \nconcerned about this issue. He has talked to me about it a number of \ntimes.\n  I have been concerned that there was abuse of this system. That was \ngathered from visits I have made to Afghanistan, including last year.\n  But I very much appreciate the points that the gentleman from \nMassachusetts has made. I think he and others who have worked on this \nissue have come up with a good amendment. I support it.\n  All of us agree that if someone has risked their lives or would be in \ndanger for supporting the United States and our folks in Afghanistan, \nthen that person needs protection. None of us want to see the program \nabused.\n  But I am convinced that the changes that the gentleman has been \ninstrumental in working out are helpful. I support it. And I thank him \nfor his efforts on doing this.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIowa (Mr. Young).\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I will be brief.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission, our men and women who are \ndefending our Nation and their families are twice as likely to fall \nvictim to\n\n[[Page H2757]]\n\nidentity theft and fraud. Because they protect us, we need to do more \nto protect them and their families from scammers who take advantage of \ntheir service. My amendment No. 177 simply requires the Department of \nDefense to report to Congress on its efforts to protect their \ninformation.\n  I thank the chairman for working with me on this amendment, and I \nlook forward to working the committee to better protect those who \nsacrifice so much to defend our Nation. I also thank my co-chair of the \nBipartisan Congressional Task Force to Combat Identity Theft and Fraud, \nthe gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema), for her great work. She has \nbeen a great partner in helping to protect taxpayers and now our \nservicemembers from having their identities stolen.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nArizona (Ms. Sinema).\n  Ms. SINEMA. I thank Chairman Thornberry and Mr. Moulton for \nsupporting the Young-Sinema amendment. I thank Congressman Young for \nworking with me and others in offering this bipartisan amendment to \nprotect members of the Armed Forces and their families from identity \ntheft.\n  My home State of Arizona is one of the top 10 States that is affected \nby identity theft. Military families are among those most targeted and \nmost at risk for these crimes. Our amendment improves the Department of \nDefense's efforts to protect military families' financial information \nfrom identity theft. I am committed to working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to combat identity theft and financial fraud.\n  Again, I thank my friend, Congressman Young, for working with me on \nthis important, commonsense amendment.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Among the amendments in this en bloc package is one that I have \nauthored to establish a global engagement center. I thank my cosponsors \nof this amendment, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Langevin, the chair and ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats & Capabilities. I also \nthank Chairman Royce, who has worked with us. Included in this \namendment are reforms of the Broadcasting Board of Governors that he \nand his ranking member have worked on for some time.\n  Mr. Chair, it has been a source of great frustration for me that our \ngovernment has seemed to be so inept in the battle of ideas against the \nterrorists.\n  I first introduced a bill on this topic in 2005. Today there is a lot \nof talk not only of the so-called physical caliphate that ISIS claims, \nbut of the virtual caliphate. Unless and until we can be more effective \nat engaging in the battle of ideas, we will not succeed in defeating \nterrorism.\n  It is not just the terrorists we have to worry about. We have seen \nthe Russians lie and use deception for military gain. We have seen \nsimilar sorts of tactics by the Chinese in their building these islands \nout in the South China Sea and elsewhere around the world.\n  This amendment requires the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \nDefense, and others--the executive branch--to get their act together, \ncoordinate, and more effectively engage in the battle of ideas. I hope \nit helps. As I say, this is a crucial battlefield, and our country \nneeds to do better in this field.\n  Mr. Chair, as I have no further speakers at this point, I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Maxine Waters).\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I am appreciative to the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts for allowing me to speak on my amendment.\n  Mr. Chair and Members, a lack of opportunity for Federal contracting \nis one of the main factors of the widening racial wealth gap. As the \nNation's largest employer, the Federal Government has a critical \nresponsibility to focus on increasing minority and female inclusion in \nthe job market; yet, only a fraction of Federal contracts goes to \nminority- or female-owned businesses. This is partly why the wealth gap \nand extreme disparities in racial incomes continue.\n  Amendment No. 49 ensures that we meet important contracting goals by \nanalyzing a 5-year study by the GAO on how the DOD contracts with \nminority- and female-owned businesses. While there are many ways the \ngovernment can address the issue of more equitable contracting, one \nimportant and more immediate impact, I believe, the Federal Government \ncan have is by providing more opportunities for minority-owned \nbusinesses.\n  The DOD spends roughly $285 billion a year on contracting, more than \nall Federal agencies combined. With such large purchasing power, it is \nimperative that these funds are used not only to provide the best \nservices for the Department of Defense, but also to distribute fairly \nand wisely in all communities.\n  The study proposed is the first step toward identifying where those \nopportunities lie for great inclusion. This amendment further \nemphasizes and underscores the importance of minorities in both our \nlocal and national communities.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for \nyielding and also for his service to the Nation. I thank the ranking \nmember of the full committee, Mr. Smith; the chairman of the full \ncommittee, Mr. Thornberry; and the Rules Committee for accepting this \namendment. Let me thank the gentlemen doubly and triply for being kind \nenough to accept this amendment on a regular basis, and I am going to \npersist because I believe it is important.\n  Mr. Chair, let me make a big pronouncement or announcement or \nbreaking news: there are women in the United States military. I want to \nsay that again. There are women in the United States military.\n  My amendment deals with triple negative breast cancer. It calls for \nthe increased collaboration between the DOD and the National Institutes \nof Health to combat triple negative breast cancer. This amendment \ndirects the Department of Defense to identify specific genetic and \nmolecular targets and biomarkers for TNBC. ``Triple negative breast \ncancer'' is a term used to describe breast cancer. Its cells do not \nhave estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors and does not have an \nexcess of HER2 protein on its cell membrane of tumor cells.\n  I am not in the military. I have had many family members in the \nmilitary, but I would venture to say this is a case in which you have \nbattalions, and you are on the field, and you have a difficult enemy \nwho keeps moving away from your sight and your target. Though you have \nused overlapping forces, you can't seem to pinpoint the enemy. \nUltimately you are victorious, but that is because you collaborate and \nyou work together. This makes commonly used tests and methods to detect \nbreast cancer not as effective, meaning the ordinary style of fighting \ndoes not work for triple negative breast cancer.\n  Seventy percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast \ncancer do not live more than 5 years after being diagnosed. It is \nimportant to note that TNBC affects women under 50 years of age, and it \nmakes up more than 30 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses, \nspecifically in African American women.\n\n  The collaboration between the Department of Defense and the NIH to \ncombat triple negative breast cancer can support the development of \nmultiple targeted therapies for this devastating disease and can help \nwomen in the United States military, those who are serving our country. \nTriple negative breast cancer is a specific strain of breast cancer for \nwhich no targeted treatment is available.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. MOULTON. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman so very much.\n  Mr. Chair, it is a disease, however, that can be conquered. Triple \nnegative breast cancer, TNBC, accounts for between 13 percent and 25 \npercent of all breast cancers in the United States. It is of a higher \ngrade, and it onsets at a\n\n[[Page H2758]]\n\nyoung age. That means these women are in the United States military.\n  Finally, because it continues, there is a need for research funding \nfor biomarker selection, drug discovery, and clinical trials that will \nlead to the early detection of TNBC and to the development of multiple \ntargeted therapies to treat this awful disease. My amendment would \nprovide for that.\n  In coming from Houston, Texas, with MD Anderson Cancer Center, I can \ntell you that they are looking at major research that can be very \nhelpful between the NIH and the Department of Defense. I hope my \namendment will stay in this particular bill, and I hope it will go to \nthe Senate and will be signed by the President.\n  Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Adam Smith and \nthe Rules Committee for making in order and including Jackson Lee \nAmendment and including it in En Bloc Amendment Number 2 to the \n``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.''\n  This is the first of 3 Jackson Lee amendments made in order by the \nHouse Rules Committee.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 45, calls for increased collaboration \nbetween the DoD and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to combat \nTriple Negative Breast Cancer.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 45 directs the DoD and NIH to \ncollaborate to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer.\n  This amendment directs the Department of Defense to identify specific \ngenetic and molecular targets and biomarkers for TNBC.\n  ``Triple Negative Breast Cancer'' is a term used to describe breast \ncancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone \nreceptors, and do not have an excess of the ``HER2'' protein on their \ncell membrane of tumor cells.\n  This makes commonly used tests and methods to detect breast cancer \nnot as effective.\n  This is a serious illness that affects between 10-17% of female \nbreast cancer patients and this condition is more likely to cause death \nthan the most common form of breast cancer.\n  Seventy percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast \ncancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 45 will help to save lives.\n  TNBC disproportionately impacts younger women, African American \nwomen, Hispanic/Latina women, and women with a ``BRCA1 genetic \nmutation, which is prevalent in Jewish women.\n  TNBC usually affects women under 50 years of age and makes up more \nthan 30% of all breast cancer diagnoses in African Americans. Black \nwomen are far more susceptible to this dangerous subtype than white or \nHispanic women.\n  The collaboration between the Department of Defense and NIH to combat \nTriple Negative Breast Cancer can support the development of multiple \ntargeted therapies for this devastating disease.\n  Triple negative breast cancer is a specific strain of breast cancer \nfor which no targeted treatment is available.\n  The American Cancer Society calls this particular strain of breast \ncancer ``an aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates.''\n  Triple negative breast cancer is a term used to describe breast \ncancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone \nreceptors, and do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their cell \nmembrane of tumor cells\n  In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control predicted that that year \n26,840 black women would be diagnosed with TNBC.\n  The overall incidence rate of breast cancer is 10% lower in African \nAmerican women than white women.\n  African American women have a five year survival rate of 78% after \ndiagnosis as compared to 90% for white women.\n  The incidence rate of breast cancer among women under 45 is higher \nfor African American women compared to white women.\n  Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells: TNBC accounts for between 13% \nand 25% of all breast cancer in the United States; usually of a higher \ngrade and size; onset at a younger age; are more aggressive; are more \nlikely to metastasize.\n  Currently, 70% of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer \ndo not live more than five years after being diagnosed.\n  African American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple-\nnegative breast cancer than White women.\n  African-American women have prevalence TNBC of 26% versus 16% in non-\nAfrican-American women.\n  African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger \ntumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer.\n  Currently there is no targeted treatment for TNBC.\n  Breast cancers with specific, targeted treatment methods, such as \nhormone and gene based strains, have higher survival rates than the \ntriple negative subtype, highlighting the need for a targeted \ntreatment.\n  Because there continues to be a need for research funding for \nbiomarker selection, drug discovery, and clinical trial designs that \nwill lead to the early detection of TNBC and to the development of \nmultiple targeted therapies to treat this awful disease Jackson Lee \nAmendment Number 45 included in En Bloc 2 is essential to paving a way \nfor advancements in these areas.\n  I thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for including \nthese amendments in the En Bloc Amendment Number 2, and I urge all \nMembers to join me in voting for its adoption.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Lipinski).\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I rise in support of an amendment I offered along with Mrs. Comstock.\n  It seeks to expand the SkillBridge job training program by directing \nunit commanders to encourage participation by departing servicemembers. \nIt also directs the DOD to form a comprehensive study so that they can \nevaluate and improve the program as needed. The SkillBridge initiative \nhelps returning veterans by providing them with job training and \napprenticeship programs in areas that span every sector of the \nworkforce.\n  This program has already trained around 4,500 servicemembers, and the \n18 SkillBridge programs claim to have an employment success rate of 100 \npercent. Encouraging participation will help more of our veterans find \nemployment when they reenter civilian life, which is something we need \nto do all we can to promote.\n  I thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for supporting \nthis amendment in this bloc. I urge my colleagues to support the bloc.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I would like to discuss an amendment to come up in a future en bloc \npackage.\n  I joined a vast array of foreign policy experts and retired \ngenerals--and even Israel's own nuclear commission--in supporting the \nnuclear deal with Iran because, although it was an imperfect deal, \nnobody could articulate a better pathway to a better deal to prevent \nIran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The nuclear deal, however, is \nonly that--a nuclear deal. As when President Reagan was negotiating \nnuclear deals with the Soviets, we make these agreements with our \nenemies, not with our friends, and we must not forget that Iran remains \nopposed to us in a vast array of other ways. As with the Soviets, \nenforcement of the deal requires continued vigilance.\n  My amendment would require the President to notify Congress whenever \nIran conducts a ballistic missile launch and inform Congress as to the \nactions the President will take in response, including diplomatic \nefforts to pursue additional sanctions and the passage of a United \nNations Security Council resolution.\n  While we have been successful in deterring Iran from building a \nnuclear weapon with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, we must \ncontinue to apply pressure to deter further actions that destabilize \nthis fragile region and threaten our allies.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of the en bloc \npackage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Carter of Georgia). The question is on the \namendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nThornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Zinke\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, I offer amendment No. 10 as the designee of \nMrs. Lummis from the great State of Wyoming.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title XVI, add the following \n     new section:\n\n[[Page H2759]]\n\n  \n\n\n     SEC. 16__. MATTERS RELATED TO INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC \n                   MISSILES.\n\n       (a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     maintain and modernize a responsive and alert \n     intercontinental ballistic missile force to ensure robust \n     nuclear deterrence by preventing any adversary from believing \n     it can carry out a small, surprise, first-strike attack on \n     the United States that disarms the strategic forces of the \n     United States.\n       (b) Prohibition.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided by paragraph (2), none \n     of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or \n     otherwise made available for fiscal year 2017 shall be \n     obligated or expended for--\n       (A) reducing, or preparing to reduce, the responsiveness or \n     alert level of the intercontinental ballistic missiles of the \n     United States; or\n       (B) reducing, or preparing to reduce, the quantity of \n     deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles of the United \n     States to a number less than 400.\n       (2) Exception.--The prohibition in paragraph (1) shall not \n     apply to any of the following activities:\n       (A) The maintenance or sustainment of intercontinental \n     ballistic missiles.\n       (B) Ensuring the safety, security, or reliability of \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n       (C) Reduction in the number of deployed intercontinental \n     ballistic missiles that are carried out in compliance with--\n       (i) the limitations of the New START Treaty (as defined in \n     section 494(a)(2)(D) of title 10, United States Code); and\n       (ii) section 1644 of the Carl Levin an Howard P. ``Buck'' \n     McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2015 (Public Law 113-291; 128 Stat. 3651; 10 U.S.C. 494 \n     note).\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Air Force and \n     the Chairman of the Nuclear Weapons Council shall submit to \n     the congressional defense committees a report regarding \n     efforts to carry out section 1057 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66; 10 \n     U.S.C. 495 note).\n       (2) Elements.--The report under paragraph (1) shall include \n     the following with respect to the period of the expected \n     lifespan of the Minuteman III system:\n       (A) The number of nuclear warheads required to support the \n     capability to redeploy multiple independently retargetable \n     reentry vehicles across the full intercontinental ballistic \n     missile fleet.\n       (B) The current and planned (until 2030) readiness state of \n     nuclear warheads intended to support the capability to \n     redeploy multiple independently retargetable reentry vehicles \n     across the full intercontinental ballistic missile fleet, \n     including which portion of the active or inactive stockpile \n     such warheads are classified within.\n       (C) The current and planned (until 2030) reserve of \n     components or subsystems required to redeploy multiple \n     independently retargetable reentry vehicles across the full \n     intercontinental ballistic missile fleet, including the plans \n     or industrial capability and capacity to produce more such \n     components or subsystems, if needed.\n       (D) The current and planned (until 2030) time required to \n     commence redeployment of multiple independently retargetable \n     reentry vehicles across the intercontinental ballistic \n     missile fleet, including the time required to finish \n     deployment across the full fleet.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Montana (Mr. Zinke) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this amendment to highlight the importance of \nmaintaining our nuclear deterrence. This amendment will ensure that our \nland-based nuclear ICBMs are ready at a moment's notice and are not \nplaced on a reduced-alert status.\n  President Reagan had it right. He championed the notion of peace \nthrough strength. Those wise words still apply today, even greater. The \nharsh reality is that we live in an increasingly unstable international \nenvironment. Nuclear deterrence provided by the triad has been the \nbackbone of our national security posture for over half a century. Just \nlast fall, the Secretary of Defense stated: ``The nuclear deterrent is \na must-have . . . It is the foundation. It's the bedrock and it needs \nto remain healthy . . . ''\n  Montana is a proud defender of our triad, and our troops are always \nready. Our ICBMs should be, too.\n  As more nation-states, including Iran, begin to defy international \nlaws and pursue nuclear and ballistic missiles, it is critical that we \ndo not scale back our nuclear deterrence.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Having previously served as the chairman of the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee for several years, I am intimately familiar with our \nintercontinental ballistic missile forces and the important role ICBM \ndeterrence plays when it comes to our national defense. While I \nunderstand the intent of this amendment, it is fundamentally \nunnecessary, dramatically overreaching, and lacks meaningful policy \nreform.\n  The budget request for FY 2017 contains no funding for reducing the \nalert level or reducing the number of deployed ICBMs below 400, and \nthere are no plans to do so in the future. Furthermore, the statement \nof policy with regard to ICBMs, which is legally binding, significantly \noverreaches. It states that modernization of the ICBMs and retaining an \nalert ICBM force is necessary to ensure robust nuclear deterrence by \npreventing any adversary from believing it can carry out a small, \nsurprise, first-strike attack which disarms the strategic forces of the \nUnited States.\n  However, this disregards the crucial and fundamental role of \nsubmarines that provide assured, survivable second-strike capability, \nwhich would dissuade an adversary from even thinking they could launch \na disarming attack against the United States.\n  If we include any legislation on ICBMs, Mr. Chairman, it should be \nthat we increase accountability and ensure that we are improving the \nmorale and culture inside the Air Force with regard to nuclear weapons. \nSome of the serious and embarrassing problems that have plagued the \nICBM missileers and security forces in recent years unfortunately \ncontinues, such as the Air Force base in Wyoming where 14 enlisted \nairmen in the security forces were being investigated for drug use just \nseveral weeks ago. I see nothing in this amendment that addresses that \nproblem, nor do I see anything in the bill that addresses that issue.\n  If we are going to talk about keeping ICBMs, it should be in a \nmeaningful way, instead of yet another annual amendment driven by what \nseems like parochial interests in highlighting their role, particularly \nat the exclusion of other legs of the nuclear triad.\n  While the committee tried to work with Ms. Lummis, Mr. Chairman, to \navail the amendment of some of these concerns, bipartisan negotiations \nwas seemingly rejected.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I hope that we are able to make some of these \nadjustments as we conference with the Senate, but I urge my colleagues \nto oppose this amendment as offered.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the \ngreat State of North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chairman, reducing our ICBM alertness is reducing our \nreadiness, and the whole point of the Defense Authorization Act is to \nensure our military readiness.\n  The ICBMs have been a very effective deterrent to enemy aggression \nfor decades. This amendment is simply a deterrent to those who would \ntry to reduce our readiness by reducing our alertness and reducing the \nnumber of ICBMs. This would be a dangerous step, contrary to the \nlongstanding policies of our defense and certainly a bad posture.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the \ngreat State of Alabama (Mr. Rogers).\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, as chairman of the Strategic \nForces Subcommittee, I understand that the responsiveness and \ndistributed nature of our ICBMs are their most critical feature and \ntheir unique contribution to our nuclear triad.\n  Without ICBMs, an adversary would only need to strike less than 10 \ntargets to disarm our nuclear forces. With ICBMs, an adversary needs to \nstrike hundreds of hardened targets deep in the American homeland. That \nis a much more difficult proposition and is at the very heart of \ndeterrence.\n  This is not a parochial issue or a political issue. This is a \nprofound national security issue. De-alerting our\n\n[[Page H2760]]\n\nICBMs or unilaterally cutting their numbers is a terrible idea.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, as I previously stated--and with all due \nrespect to my colleague--this bill contains no funding for reducing the \nalert level or reducing the number of deployed ICBMs below 400, and \nthere are no plans to do so in the future.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and \nhis leadership on this, and I think he laid it out very clearly.\n  This is an imaginary problem, but it is an area that actually needs \nto have some attention to it. He referenced recent problems in terms of \npotential drug abuse. You know they found the cheating earlier because \nthey were investigating drug abuse when they found out that there was \ncheating on the readiness test.\n  I would advise my colleagues to read Eric Schlosser's ``Command and \nControl,'' a fascinating study about the history of American nuclear \nweapons and problems that we have had, mistakes that were made, and \nnear misses.\n  There are serious issues that we need to be thinking in terms of the \nreadiness and how it goes forward. We need to think clearly about what \nwe do in the future, what is the right level of deterrence, and how are \nwe going to adequately analyze it.\n  454 land-based missiles are not necessarily a magic number that we \nshould be freezing on a permanent basis. Looking at what happens going \nforward with the trillion-dollar commitment with missiles that are \nsubmarine based--we have our bombers; we have land based--and being \nable to have a critical appraisal of how much deterrence is enough and \nlook at problems, such as security lapses, training problems, drug \nproblems, this is not a situation that we should just sort of happily \nfreeze for the next go-around and maintain that any adjustment to this \nor even evaluating an adjustment is somehow a threat to national \nsecurity.\n  The real problems that we face dealing with international terrorism \nand the potential of nuclear weapons falling into rogue hands, those \nare very real problems that we need to be doing more. This vast nuclear \ntriad that we will spend a trillion dollars on does not help us with \nthose challenges. Rather than hollow out the military, we ought to be \nlooking at potential changes going forward.\n  This amendment is ill-advised, unnecessary, and is the wrong \ndirection we should be going.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, this amendment is about ensuring that our \nnuclear deterrence that has protected this country for over 70 years \nremains strong and viable.\n  Yesterday, this body passed a measure to keep our nukes safe. It is \nnow time to ensure they are ready at a moment's notice. There is no \nreason to have a nuclear force unless they are ready.\n  To lower the alert posture of our land-based ICBMs would result in a \n2-week delay before our ICBMs would be ready to use. This would cripple \nour ability to respond quickly, which is the entire point of having a \nnuclear triad.\n  In the military, we always hope for the best but plan for the worse. \nWhile I hope we never have to use our nuclear weapons--and, indeed, I \nbelieve everyone in this body does--to lower their posture status of \nland-based ICBMs would unnecessarily put us at risk.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Lamborn\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XXXV add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. GAO REPORT ON MARITIME SECURITY FLEET PROGRAM.\n\n       Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act the Comptroller General of the United States shall \n     study and report to the relevant congressional committees on \n     the following:\n       (1) The justification for the size of the Maritime Security \n     Fleet established under chapter 531 of title 46, United \n     States Code, given present national defense operational \n     requirements for such fleet, and how the annual per-vessel \n     payment under that chapter corresponds to the costs of \n     operating vessels in such Fleet.\n       (2) The difference in costs between the Maritime Security \n     Fleet program and other options for achieving the same \n     objectives as that program, such as--\n       (A) procurement by the United States of a national defense \n     sealift fleet;\n       (B) contracting for United States-flag vessels and foreign-\n     flag vessels on a temporary basis; and\n       (C) other potential options.\n       (3) Instances, examined in detail, in which use of foreign-\n     flag, foreign-crewed vessels for national defense sealift \n     purposes has hindered national security or impeded United \n     States military operations.\n       (4) Comparison, in detail, of volumes and types of--\n       (A) Federal cargo that has been carried on foreign-flagged \n     vessels; and\n       (B) Federal cargo that has been carried on vessels in the \n     Maritime Security Fleet.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas and \ncommittee staff for their willingness to work with me on this \namendment. I fought long and hard to get this museum the recognition it \ndeserves, and I am very pleased that we have a path forward where we \ncan finally achieve that.\n  My amendment simply recognizes this museum in Colorado Springs as the \nNational Museum of World War II Aviation. This amendment does not \nauthorize any funds. The museum is not seeking Federal funds and does \nnot have plans to do so in the future.\n  The National Museum of World War II Aviation has taken great care to \nfocus its story line on an aspect of military history that has not been \nfully explored by other national military museums. The intent is to \naugment the tremendous work that is being done by those museums, not to \nduplicate or replace it.\n  It is the only museum in the United States that exists to exclusively \npreserve and promote an understanding of the role of aviation in \nwinning World War II. It is dedicated to celebrating the American \nspirit and to recognizing the teamwork, patriotism, and courage of the \nmen and women who fought, as well as those on the home front who \nmobilized and supported the national aviation effort.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) for the purpose \nof engaging in a colloquy.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) \nhas been a strong advocate for this museum, and I certainly appreciate \nhim bringing it to the committee's attention and to the attention of \nthe House.\n  Many Members share the gentleman's commitment to the preservation of \nhistoric aircraft, and I will certainly work with him on this and \nrelated issues.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, based on that reassurance and on that \npledge to work together, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Sanford\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike subsections (b) and (c) of section 2856 and insert \n     the following:\n\n[[Page H2761]]\n\n       (b) Recognition.--Congress recognizes the National Museum \n     of World War II Aviation in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as \n     America's National World War II Aviation Museum.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Sanford) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I rise with a very simple amendment. It \nwould do nothing more than call for a GAO report of the maritime \nsecurity fleet. I do so because I think that we would all acknowledge \nthat knowledge is power, and the ability to look very closely at what \nis happening within that fleet, I think, is important. I would also say \nthat, as a believer that defense is a core function of the Federal \nGovernment, we would want to have transparency in the way that we \nexpend those funds in pursuit of our Nation's defense.\n  I think that this is important in light of the fact that overall \nfunding has risen by about $89 million here over the last, I guess, \nfunding cycle. You have seen the per-ship stipend go from $3.5 million \nto $5 million.\n  There has not been a study of what is happening within that fleet of \nships for more than 12 years, and so, again, this is not in any way \nprescriptive in nature as to what should or shouldn't happen or the \nmerits or demerits of the program. It is simply saying might we not \nlearn a little bit more of what is happening within that fleet, and \nthat is it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The gentleman from South Carolina is correctly concerned about the \nexpenditure of money. I would suggest to him that this study is a waste \nof the expenditure of money by the GAO and, hence, the taxpayers of the \nUnited States.\n  Studies about the MSP have been available over many, many years; and \nin fact, there is now, in the Office of Management and Budget, a \ncomprehensive study that was commissioned by the Assistant Secretary of \nthe Navy. The gentleman can certainly contact OMB and get that study \nand, quite probably, get all the information he is going to request in \nthis particular analysis and, furthermore, not have to waste taxpayer \nmoney in the process.\n  I would point out to the gentleman a statement that was made on \nJanuary 17 of this year concerning the MSP program by General Darren \nMcDew, commander of US TRANSCOM. This is the guy who is responsible for \nmoving men, women, materiel, and equipment around the world.\n  He said: ``Our overwhelming success was due in large part to the \n10,000 U.S. mariners who sped 220 shiploads of decisive U.S. combat \npower throughout the buildup known as Operation Desert Shield. Without \nthose mariners and vessels, our ability to project decisive force and \ndemonstrate our national resolve would have been a mere fraction of \nwhat was required to ensure the swift victory the world witnessed. \nSimply put, moving an army of decisive size and power can only be \naccomplished by sea,'' and the MSP is the central part of that.\n  We don't need this study. What we need is strong support for the MSP.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I would say to my colleague that, again, what \nwe would all recognize is that OMB is different than the Government \nAccountability Office. The OMB is fundamentally executive branch in \nnature. I think there is a real value to having a third party \nindependent look at what is happening with the study. Again, it is not \nprescriptive in nature, but having that third party look, I think, is \nthat much more important in all of our justifications of this program \nor other programs like it.\n  I would also say this, in terms of ``waste of money,'' as we know, \nGAO is funded through the legislative branch. This would not involve an \nadditional expenditure of money. It would be incorporated into the \nexpenditures that currently take place within the legislative branch \nand, again, GAO, by extension. In that regard, I think it would be a \ngood use of taxpayer money to take a look that has not been taken in \nmore than 12 years.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, that is the first time I have ever heard \nthat expenditure by the House of Representatives is not taxpayer money, \nbut I guess some people can claim that.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes).\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank the gentleman for offering this amendment. I know how committed \nhe is to national defense and to fiscal responsibility in the country. \nHowever, one of the things that we haven't talked about in this \namendment is it asks us to look at outsourcing this to foreign \ncountries to be able to do, and I think today I rise not just as \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, but \nalso on behalf of my good friend Mr. Courtney, who is the ranking \nmember on that subcommittee and who has given us authority to say that \nhe is opposed to this as well for these reasons.\n  The sealift, if we lose that sealift, we have lost the lifeblood to \nour warfighters because that is the vessel, that is the lifeline that \nkeeps them and sustains them. The very question for us is this: If that \nballoon goes up and the bell rings, are we going to trust a foreign \npower to hold in their hand that very lifeblood for our men and women \nand our warfighters?\n  I want to remind everyone in the House that in World War II, 1 in 26 \nmerchant mariners were actually killed. It was a higher rate of loss \nthan any other service. The rate was so high, in fact, that the \nmerchant marine concealed it because they were afraid they couldn't \nfind enough mariners if the true danger of the services were known.\n  So our big question here is, even if we came back with a study that \nsaid it might be cheaper to outsource it, would anyone in this room \ndare place that trust in a foreign country? I think very clearly we \nwould not.\n  Mr. Chairman, also these decisions are probably best made by military \ntransportation command, sealift command, and maritime command, and they \nhave said there is no guarantee whatsoever that a foreign-flagged fleet \nwill sail into harm's way if we need them. They have said a 60-ship \ncapability is extremely important, and they have said that foreign-\nflagged ships which might be cheaper cannot be relied on for critical \nnational security missions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I hope we will oppose this amendment, we will reject \nit.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I would say this: in essence, we already \nhave outsourced this. I think the question about the maritime security \nfleet is that it is currently run by a foreign-flagged fleet of \nvessels. If I am not mistaken, it is almost exclusively run by Maersk, \nwhich is a foreign-flagged vessel.\n  The question of this amendment is to say: Might not there be other \nways of doing it? Maybe this is the best way to do it. Maybe there are \nother ways to do it. But this notion of not being willing to look, not \nbeing willing to have a third party validate or, if you will, take a \nlook and say this makes sense or, no, there is a better way of skinning \nthis cat both for the military and for the taxpayer, I think again \nwarrants, in this case, the study by the GAO.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In Desert Storm I, back in the 1990s, a ship that was manned by \nPakistanis was loaded at the docks, began to sail, and turned around \nbecause the crew refused to go into that zone. We cannot\n\n[[Page H2762]]\n\nallow that to happen ever again. The MSP was started specifically to \nprovide that kind of sealift power that we need to move our men, \nmateriel, and equipment, wherever they may be needed in the world. It \ndoes us little good to spend $680 billion on a Defense appropriation \nbill and not be able to get where the trouble is. Do away with the MSP, \nand that is where you are headed with this, moving toward foreign flags \nand, indeed, Maersk is operated by a foreign country, but it is \nlicensed to operate in the United States with American sailors on \nAmerican ships for the MSP program.\n  We don't need to waste money on this. The studies are available \ndating back to 2006, 2009, and, more recently, with the OMB study. We \ndon't need to waste our money. We need to get on with supporting the \nMSP program. I ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I would again go back to the basics. This \nstipend goes to Maersk presently. It has been raised from $3.5 million \nto $5 million. Maybe that is the best thing in the world to do; maybe \nit is not. But I think it is worthy of study, particularly given the \nfact that we have raised the stipend by $89 million over the last year, \nparticularly given the fact that we have not looked at this issue from \nthe standpoint of an outside third-party validation from the GAO for \nmore than 12 years.\n  It is for that reason I simply say, again, in no way prescriptively, \nit is worth a look. And again, given the fact that the Government \nAccountability Office does regular studies on a whole host of different \nissues on a very regular basis, I think this is worthy, given the \nadditional $89 million that was spent last year.\n  I would ask for a ``yes'' vote.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 18 Offered by Mr. Thornberry\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 1045 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1045. PROTECTION OF CERTAIN FEDERAL SPECTRUM OPERATIONS.\n\n       Section 1004 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (Public \n     Law 114-74; 47 U.S.C. 921 note) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(d) Protection of Certain Federal Spectrum Operations.--\n     If the report required by subsection (a) determines that \n     reallocation and auction of the spectrum described in the \n     report would harm national security by impacting existing \n     terrestrial Federal spectrum operations at the Nevada Test \n     and Training Range, the Commission, in coordination with the \n     Secretary shall, prior to the auction described in subsection \n     (c)(1)(B), establish rules for licensees in such spectrum \n     sufficient to mitigate harmful interference to such \n     operations.\n       ``(e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to affect any requirement under section 1062(b) \n     of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2000 (47 U.S.C. 921 note; Public Law 106-65).''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Spectrum Pipeline Act was included in the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015 that we passed in December. Now, \napparently, there has developed some disagreement among lawyers about \nwhether that had some effect on section 1062(b) of the fiscal year 2000 \nNational Defense Authorization Act related to spectrum.\n  My amendment simply clarifies what everyone that I know of agrees on, \nand that is it was never intended to have any effect. We have assurance \nfrom the Office of Management and Budget that was their intention. I \nappreciate Chairman Fred Upton, who has worked with us on this \namendment, saying that was not his intention. Basically, Mr. Chairman, \nI see this as a technical amendment to resolve some disagreement among \nlawyers.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, the Nation's spectrum is one of our most \nvaluable natural resources. Under the bipartisan oversight of the \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce, one spectrum auction alone last year \nraised more than $40 billion. It is imperative that we continue our \nbipartisan management of this valuable national asset, but to do that \nwe must follow regular order through the proper committee of \njurisdiction. That is the only way that we can make sure that we \ncontinue proper congressional oversight.\n  This amendment that we are considering today was made public 1 day \nago. This process runs counter to our successful bipartisan efforts to \nmanage spectrum well. It does not allow the relevant agencies adequate \ntime to weigh in, and it does not allow interested stakeholders to \nprovide meaningful input.\n  I appreciate my colleague's efforts to improve this amendment, but \nthese are extremely complicated issues of national importance. They \ncannot be put together overnight.\n  Earlier today when the rule for consideration of this bill was \ndebated here on the floor, my Republican colleagues said that they \nchose to exclude some Democratic amendments because those amendments \ndid not go through the committee process. Well, the same can be said of \nthis amendment as well, Mr. Chairman.\n  If there are issues of national security underlying this amendment, \nthe Democrats on the Committee on Energy and Commerce stand ready to \nwork on them expeditiously, but we must stand by our commitment to \nregular order. The consequences of getting this wrong are simply too \nhigh.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Smith), the ranking member of the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, this is clearly a problem that \nwe need to work on. The chairman and I have worked together in talking \nabout it and making sure that our military assets are protected as we \ndeal with spectrum auctions.\n  I look forward to having the conversation in conference committee \nabout how to deal with this, but my concern is this is something that \nmany on the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and I as well, have \nworked on for a number of years. We worked with the Department of \nDefense for years to try and make sure that their equities were \nprotected. We talked with everyone we could conceivably talk with. This \nauction was originally set up to make sure that we protected those.\n  Now we are hearing a slightly new argument. I certainly want to make \nsure that the Department of Defense's interests are protected, but I \nalso want to make sure that they don't have absolute veto power on \nauctioning spectrum. That was sort of the law before all of the \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce and others worked on, and it really \ntied up a very valuable national asset, as Mr. Pallone points out.\n  I hope that as we get into conference committee we will figure out \nhow to both protect the interests of national security and the Defense, \nbut also make sure that, if spectrum can be safely made available, it \nis safely made available.\n  As I said, this was something that was worked on for a very long \ntime,\n\n[[Page H2763]]\n\nand we thought we had it worked out. So right at the eleventh hour \nhere, to have the Department of Defense say ``No, we want to change \nit'' is something I think we still need to examine more closely.\n  I thank Mr. Pallone for the time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time \nsimply to say this amendment, a version of this amendment, was filed \nlast week. Working with the Committee on Energy and Commerce, it has \nbeen revised. Again, the purpose of this amendment is--and what I think \nit clearly does is simply restate what everybody thought was the case--\nto resolve a disagreement among lawyers. That is the reason I call it, \nreally, a technical amendment. I hope that the House will adopt it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 4 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman \nfrom North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers).\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, this amendment does one \nthing: it maintains oversight and accountability of the Air Force. This \nwill ensure that the Air Force follows through on their promise of \nproviding adequate air support to ensure there is no negative impact on \nthe readiness of Fort Bragg paratroopers.\n  I have said this is a terrible decision, and today's amendment is \nabout holding the Air Force accountable. It will require the Secretary \nof the Army and the Air Force to evaluate and to report the levels of \nair support provided to Fort Bragg by the Air Force. As the \nRepresentative of Fort Bragg, this will allow me to monitor jump \nnumbers and ensure military readiness is not jeopardized in any way, \nshape, or form.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Langevin).\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I want to, first of all, thank my HASC \ncolleague across the aisle, ETC Chairman Wilson from the great State of \nSouth Carolina, for working with me on this bipartisan amendment to \nexpand talent exchange authorities within the DOD.\n  This amendment addresses a key challenge facing the Department, which \nis competition with the private sector to recruit and retain highly \nskilled talent.\n  As we understand right now, it is exceptionally competitive in, for \nexample, the IT and cybersecurity fields. We need to be able to retain, \nattract, and recruit the best and the brightest in this field, \nparticularly because salaries are very high and it is very difficult in \nmany ways for the DOD to compete in this space.\n  While we are very grateful, of course, for those who devote their \nlives to a military career, not everyone will give 20 or 30 years of \ntheir lives to the U.S. military. But there is certainly no shortage of \npatriotism across the private sector, and dedicating several months or \nyears of their lives to our national security is certainly a worthy \nendeavor.\n  This also gives DOD employees exposure to cutting-edge operational \ntechniques and best practices across a wide array of disciplines, while \ngiving private sector employees insight into how the Department \noperates.\n  Mr. Chairman, we must ensure that we are recruiting the best and the \nbrightest in order to uphold our national defenses.\n  This amendment has been sought after by the DOD. Again, there is \nbipartisan support on this amendment. It gives great flexibility to the \nDepartment to be able to work to bring in people of great talent from \nthe private sector for a period of time. Again, it also allows the DOD \nto have our men and women in uniform go to the private sector for a \ntime and learn best practices and what cutting-edge techniques and \ncapabilities are happening in the private sector.\n  So this is a good, commonsense amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his \nleadership in this very important endeavor.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment package, \nwhich includes my amendment that clarifies that the pilot program for \nprescription drug acquisition costs regarding TRICARE pharmacy benefits \nwill also include small business pharmacies.\n  Currently, the pilot program helps extend discounts to TRICARE \nbeneficiaries for prescription drugs filled at retail pharmacies. My \namendment simply clarifies that small business pharmacies are retail \npharmacies and will be included in this pilot program.\n  In many cases around the country, people are unlimited when it comes \nto which pharmacy they can have their preparations filled at. With this \namendment, we can ensure all pharmacies, both large and small \nretailers, will be included in this pilot program.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment package.\n  Mr MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to refer back to an amendment \nthat was in the previous en bloc that dealt with the special immigrant \nvisas.\n  I want to express my appreciation to the committee, the chairman, the \nranking member, and to the staff. This is a complicated issue. It is in \nyour bill, but it is not entirely within your jurisdiction. And there \nhas been an ebb and flow. It has been something that I have, as you \nknow, been working on for a decade, and that is for the United States \nto keep faith with the people in Afghanistan who made the mission \npossible--the people who literally risked their lives as guides, \nconstruction workers, interpreters, and truck drivers--the men and \nwomen who made it possible for us to succeed.\n  It isn't just the Department of Defense. There are men and women who \nworked with the State Department and USAID, which are an important part \nof our activities in those countries. Those foreign nationals are every \nbit at risk as somebody who is guiding our troops in the field.\n  I appreciate your willingness to put in the en bloc amendment a \nlittle bit of flexibility. I hope it is not the last word, because we \nneed to think seriously about what we do for the people who work on \nbase, people who work for the State Department, and the people who work \nfor USAID so that we are able to make sure that we have an adequate \nnumber of visas and that we don't have an arbitrarily short period of \ntime because the pipeline has been hopelessly complex and flawed.\n  We have been working with the bureaucracy in trying to make it work \nbetter, but that is an ongoing struggle. And the fact is, there are \ndifferent people with different committees who have different \norientations.\n  I hope that this en bloc amendment is just the start and that we can \ncontinue working with the chairman, with the minority party, with the \nstaff, and with the advocates and various people who are committed to \nmaking sure that we do right by the people who are at risk now of being \nkilled, murdered, tortured, and having family members killed.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished\n\n[[Page H2766]]\n\ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, North Carolina is a proud, strong military \nState. We are proud of the men and women who answer the call and risk \ntheir lives to protect us. I never, ever want them to be in a fair \nfight. I want them to always have the tools, the equipment, and the \ntraining needed to dominate and destroy the enemy. That is why I filed \nan amendment with my colleague, Renee Ellmers, to protect training of \nparatroopers at Fort Bragg, the epicenter of the universe.\n  As you may know, the Air Force has moved forward with plans to \ndeactivate the 440th Airlift Wing. This deactivation puts these young \nparatroopers, and indeed our very national security, at risk, as \nevidenced by the failure of the Air Force to meet current training \nrequirements.\n  For the sake of our national security, this amendment is absolutely \ncritical to hold the Air Force accountable and to ensure our rapid \nreaction forces are prepared for deployment at a moment's notice.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the bipartisan \namendment I have co-written with my colleague, Judge Ted Poe of Texas.\n  The amendment, which is part of the en bloc amendments, endorses an \nongoing effort at the Defense Security Cooperation Agency to develop a \ncomprehensive framework for the assessment, monitoring, and evaluation \nof security cooperation activities of the Department of Defense. It \nfollows a related monitoring evaluation amendment Judge Poe and I \noffered to the NDAA for FY 2016 and the committee retained, gratefully, \nin the 2017 bill.\n  Security cooperation with foreign security forces builds valuable \ninternational partnerships and enhances the ability of our partners to \ncarry out joint military operations and enhances American security \nwhile it is at it. However, few requirements are placed on these \nprograms to measure the impact of funding provided to our foreign \nsecurity partners. Looking at efficacy, does it work?\n  Judge Poe and I have led the effort to apply assessment, monitoring, \nand evaluation leading principles to U.S. foreign assistance \nadministered by the State Department, USAID, and other Federal \nagencies.\n  Last year, the House of Representatives passed our bill, the Foreign \nAid Transparency and Accountability, H.R. 3766. We should have a \nsimilar expectation of accountability for our security cooperation \nprograms as well.\n  I welcome the committee's bipartisan efforts to begin to reform, \nconsolidate, and modify the more than 120 security cooperation \nauthorities Congress has provided DOD over the years.\n  Notably, the underlying bill strengthens country-by-country reporting \nrequirements for security cooperation and begins to reorganize security \ncooperation authorities into one coherent separate section of title X \nof the U.S. Code.\n  Furthermore, the Senate is advancing an NDAA bill that requires DOD \nto produce an annual budget justification for security cooperation \nfunding.\n  There is obviously significant demand, Mr. Chairman, for more \ntransparency and accountability in terms of U.S. security cooperation. \nOur amendment is consistent with that demand, and it builds on the \ngreat work done by the committee in this area to define clear \nobjectives and metrics for security cooperation.\n  I want to thank the chairman, the ranking member, and both committee \nstaffs, minority and majority, for their excellent work and for their \nbipartisan approach to this and so many other issues in the bill.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, and I want to thank the chairman \nfor including it in the en bloc package.\n  My amendment increases funding for U.S. NORTHCOM's Joint Task Force \nNorth by $3 million to assist with its counternarcotics operations.\n  As part of my work as the chair of the Task Force to Combat the \nHeroin Epidemic, I traveled to the Mexican border earlier this spring \nto investigate sources of illegal fentanyl and heroin coming into the \ncountry. There I learned and had the opportunity to meet with the \ncommanding officers at the Joint Task Force North, the joint service \ncommand that supports Federal law enforcement agencies with resources \nto identify and interdict criminal activities conducted within the \nUnited States and its borders.\n  My goal is to ensure that Joint Task Force North receives the funding \nnecessary to continue their counternarcotics efforts.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman and the Armed Services Committee \nfor their work on the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, again, I thank the distinguished \ngentleman, and I also thank the chairman of the full committee, the \nranking member of the full committee, and the subcommittee chairs as \nwell.\n  I serve on the Homeland Security Committee, and I am constantly aware \nof the overlapping duties and responsibilities, Mr. Chairman, of the \nUnited States military, which has its confinement in certain areas, but \nalso working to secure the homeland.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment No. 64 in en bloc amendment No. 4 makes an \nimportant contribution to the bill by improving the effectiveness of \nU.S. Northern Command, or NORTHCOM, in fulfilling its critical mission \nof protecting the U.S. homeland in the event of war and to provide \nsupport to local, State, and Federal authorities in times of national \nemergency.\n  Specifically, here is what my amendment does. It develops and has in \nplace a leadership strategy that will strengthen and foster necessary \ninstitutional and interpersonal relationships with State and local \ngovernments. The backbone of securing the homeland is engaging State \nand local governments. Also, to develop an instructional program to \ntrain key personnel how to lead effectively in the event of a disaster \nwhen they do not have command authority to dictate actions.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  In addition, NORTHCOM, which was established in 2002 in the aftermath \nof the 9/11 attacks, is to bring the capabilities and the resources of \nthe U.S. military to the assistance the American people during a \ncatastrophic disaster like war or a pandemic outbreak of diseases, such \nas Ebola, Zika, SARS, or influenza; major earthquakes, floods, and \nnatural disasters; or terrorist attacks.\n  I live in the Gulf Coast, and I am well familiar with hurricanes, \nenormous rains that we have just experienced, needing to bring to bear \nmoving large numbers of people, housing large numbers of people.\n  And then this morning I spent time after time of dealing with the \nZika virus, which, again, our southern Gulf Coast region may be the \nepicenter.\n  Let me quote, for example, a quote from a renowned professor, Leonard \nMarcus, out of Harvard. What we are trying to do is: ``Effective \nemergency preparedness and response requires leadership that can \naccomplish perceptive coordination and communication amongst diverse \nagencies . . . ''\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Holding). The time of the gentlewoman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. The challenge is, as we learned from 9/11, \n``operating within their specified scope of authority, preparedness \nleaders in characteristic bureaucratic fashion often serve to bolster \nthe profile and import of their own organization, thereby creating a \nsilo effect . . . ''\n  So let me speak as that Homeland Security member and the person who \nhas been engaged in the crises or disasters in my own community. When \nwe collaborate we work better together. When we develop relationships, \nwe work better together.\n  Let me just offer a moment of personal privilege as someone speaking \nabout relationships. This bill has many good elements in it, and I am \npropelled\n\n[[Page H2767]]\n\nand committed to diversity and respecting all people.\n  I am saddened by the language that the Russell amendment has dealing \nwith the LGBT, and I am saddened that the Dent amendment was not \nallowed in. We need to build on collaborating with all people to secure \nAmerica and to make a better military.\n  I thank the gentleman for the support of my amendment in the en bloc.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in support of En Bloc Amendment Number 4 to H.R. \n4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, \noffered by Chairman Thornberry.\n  I want to express my thanks and appreciation to Chairman Thornberry \nand Ranking Member Smith, and their colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee for their work thank on this bill and their devotion to the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces.\n  I also thank Chairman Sessions and Ranking Member Slaughter of the \nRules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64, \nwhich is included in En Bloc Amendment Number 4.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 makes an important contribution to \nthe bill by improving the effectiveness of the Northern Command \n(``NORTHCOM'') in fulfilling its critical mission of protecting the \nU.S. homeland in event of war and to provide support to local, state, \nand federal authorities in times of national emergency.\n  Specifically, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 encourages NORTHCOM to:\n  1. Develop and has in place a leadership strategy that will \nstrengthen and foster necessary institutional and interpersonal \nrelationships with state and local governments; and\n  2. Develop an instructional program to train key personnel how to \nlead effectively in the event of a disaster when they do not have \ncommand authority to dictate actions.\n  A mission critical function of NORTHCOM, which was established in \n2002 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks is to bring the capabilities \nand the resources of the U.S. military to the assistance of the \nAmerican people during a catastrophic disaster like war, a pandemic \noutbreak of diseases such Ebola, Zika, Sars, or influenza; major \nearthquakes, floods, and natural disasters; or terrorist attacks like \nthose occurring on September 11, 2001 and at the Boston Marathon on \nApril 15, 2013.\n  NORTHCOM leaders will be much more effective in saving lives, \nprotecting assets, and enhancing resilience after the disaster has \noccurred if they are trained in the techniques of effective engagement \nwith civilian leadership.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 will help ensure that such training \nwill be available.\n  Mr. Chair, let me explain why this type of training--commonly \nreferred to as ``Resilience'' training is very important.\n  As stated in a highly influential journal article by Professor \nLeonard Marcus and his colleagues at Harvard's National Public \nLeadership Initiative, ``effective emergency preparedness and response \nrequires leadership that can accomplish perceptive coordination and \ncommunication amongst diverse agencies and sectors.'' (Leonard J. \nMarcus, Barry C. Dorn, and Joseph M. Henderson, Meta-Leadership and \nNational Emergency Preparedness: A Model to Build Government \nConnectivity, in Biosecurity And Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, \nPractice, And Science Volume 4, Number 2, 2006).\n  The challenge is, as we learned from the 9/11 Commission, operating \nwithin their specified scope of authority, preparedness leaders in \ncharacteristic bureaucratic fashion often serve to bolster the profile \nand import of their own organization, thereby creating a silo effect \nthat interferes with effective system wide planning and response.\n  Resilience training seeks to equip preparedness leaders overcome this \nobstacle of ``traditional silo thinking by teaching ``meta-\nleadership,'' a new type of overarching leadership that intentionally \nconnects the purposes and work of different organizations or \norganizational units.\n  Meta-leadership training enables leaders to provide guidance, \ndirection, and momentum across organizational lines that develop into a \nshared course of action and a commonality of purpose among people and \nagencies that are doing what may appear to be very different work.\n  Meta-leaders have the skill and training to imaginatively and \neffectively leverage system assets, information, and capacities, which \na particularly critical function for organizations with emergency \npreparedness responsibilities like responding to terrorist attacks, \nnatural disasters, or pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases like \nthe Ebola and the Zika Virus, which may disproportionately affect \npersons in the Gulf Coast region, including my congressional district \nin Houston, Texas.\n  As a senior and charter member of the Homeland Security Committee, \nand the Ranking Member of Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security, and Investigations, I have spent the better part of \nthe last decade and a half working to craft policies and provide the \nresources, personnel, equipment, and funding needed to protect the \nsecurity of our homeland and the American people.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 will help ensure that those \nresponsible for providing leadership in times of national emergency \nhave the skills and training to prevent, mitigate, or recover from any \nmajor catastrophe, disaster, or tragedy that could befall our nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support En Bloc Amendment Number 64 and thank \nthe Chairman and Ranking Member for including Jackson Lee Amendment \nNumber 64 in this important measure.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of two amendments I \noffered to this year's National Defense Authorization Act.\n  The amendment we are currently considering requires the DOD to report \non the effectiveness of efforts to detect and monitor drug trafficking, \nspecifically heroin and fentanyl, which is devastating my home State of \nMichigan and the entire country.\n  The United States Southern Command is already doing important work to \ninterdict drug runners and provide needed training to counternarcotic \nteams in Central America.\n  My amendment would help quantify those efforts and see what more can \nbe done to combat the heroin and fentanyl coming from this region.\n  The second bipartisan amendment, which we will consider later today, \nrequires DOD to verify it has sufficient access to Afghan accounts to \nguarantee effective audits.\n  It is important that our military has access to financial information \nto protect U.S. funds from waste, fraud, and abuse, and ensure taxpayer \nresources are being spent effectively.\n  I appreciate these amendments being included en bloc. I urge the \nsupport of my colleagues.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, and I \nthank the chairman for including it in the next en bloc amendment, one \nthat brings accountability to countries granting consent to Russian \nnaval vessels calling into port.\n  The aggressive posture and actions of the Russian Federation over the \nlast few years has profoundly changed the global landscape. Russia has \ninvaded Crimea, and currently still occupies that region. And Russia \ndirectly intervened militarily to shore up the Assad regime in Syria.\n  The common thread that runs through these two interventions is that \nof warm water ports for the Russian navy. Crimea's port in Sevastopol \nand Syria's port of Tartus provide Russia with access to the warm \nwaters of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, waters that are \nessential to Russia's reach of aggression.\n  Despite these aggressive actions, some countries are accommodating \nthe Russian navy by allowing warships and submarines to call into their \nports.\n  Spain, although a cherished NATO ally, grants Russia access to the \nports in its enclaves across the strategically important Strait of \nGibraltar, where the United Kingdom has a Permanent Joint Operating \nBase that hosts U.S. ships.\n  Furthermore, Greece and Malta have hosted Russian warships last year. \nThe recent high-profile visits to Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua by \nRussia's navy in recent years are also cause for concern.\n  Mr. Chairman, governments across the globe should be isolating the \nRussian navy, not accommodating it.\n  The Russian navy must constantly compete with geographic and \nstrategic disadvantages of lacking access to warm blue waters of the \nworld, but these disadvantages are forfeited when we lack a cohesive, \nunified effort to deny Russian vessels the ability to call into foreign \nports.\n  With the inclusion of this amendment, the Secretary of Defense will \nhave to report to Congress and, thus, the American people on these \ninstances. And I hope governments will think twice before offering up \ntheir ports to Putin's navy.\n\n[[Page H2768]]\n\n  I urge support of the underlying bill as well.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Illinois, (Mr. Kinzinger).\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of \namendment No. 74 in the en bloc, the Blumenauer Special Immigrant Visa \namendment. I just want to speak to the program broadly and quickly.\n  In Afghanistan, countless people put their lives on the line to serve \nas translators, basically being the middle person between American \ntroops and the population we are trying to secure.\n  Now, we promised them opportunity to come into the United States, but \nthis process has been bogged down by bureaucracy. In fact, many have \nbeen in this process for years, and still in the first steps because of \nthe bureaucracy on this.\n  Unfortunately, today, actually, many Afghans are being killed every \nday by the Taliban, by ISIS, by al Qaeda, as a result of having worked \nwith us.\n  I want to thank Representative Moulton and Representative Blumenauer \nfor their work on this. This is a bipartisan issue, and one that I \nthink we ought to take very seriously, keeping our commitment to those \nthat help us, because there will be a war again some day, and we ought \nto be able to maintain the trust of the population we are there to \nsecure.\n  So I thank Mr. Blumenauer for putting this amendment in, and I thank \nthe chairman for accepting it.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chair, I just think it is important to pause for a second and \njust think about what has just happened here. We have had a package of \namendments that have been discussed, about an equal number of \nRepublicans and Democrats. They have talked about very important issues \nand contributions that they have made, but if a Member then votes \nagainst final passage of the bill, the contributions are nullified.\n  And I think it is just important to step back and just reiterate that \nall of us have provisions in this bill we agree with and disagree with. \nWe place different values on different parts of the bill. But what has \nhappened before is that Members have put aside some personal \ndifferences and still paid attention to the larger purpose of the bill, \nwhich is to support the men and women who serve our country. I hope \nthat can happen again.\n  However proud Members may be of the various provisions--and there are \na lot of good provisions from both sides of the aisle--however proud \nthey may be of those, if you don't support the final bill, you are not \naccomplishing very much.\n  I hope Members not only will support this en bloc package, but the \nfinal measure.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 5 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY.

Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), the distinguished chair of \nour Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I thank Chairman Thornberry for his \nleadership of peace through strength.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of amendment No. 69, a \nbipartisan amendment submitted with Ranking Member Jim Langevin.\n  As we reach to secure cyberspace and protect American families from \nnew and emerging threats while encouraging innovation, we turn to the \nmutual benefit that public-private partnerships provide industry \nemployees and Department of Defense personnel.\n  We have seen the success of public-private partnerships already in \nthe IT field. This amendment will provide an opportunity to expand the \nbenefits of the talent exchange to all components of the Department of \nDefense.\n  The benefits to the military are clear. These partnerships provide \nthe ability for fresh talent and concepts from outside the government \nsector.\n  The private sector benefits as well by having the flexibility to gain \na unique insight into how the government operates and engage in public \nservice creating jobs.\n  This bipartisan amendment promotes choice and opportunity that will \nbenefit America's workers and the defense community. Actually, the \ncollaboration will benefit all American families. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Peters).\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support two amendments that we \nhave in the en bloc, the first on veteran hiring, a sense of Congress \namendment.\n  I rise to support a simple, but important effort that everyone in \nthis Chamber can agree on. My amendment adds to this bill a sense of \nCongress that the Department of Defense should seek ways to maximize \nthe number of veterans employed to build military construction \nprojects.\n  We are talking about good jobs here that can help our veterans make \nthe transition to civilian life. In places like San Diego, we have \nalready had a number of contractors employing highly skilled veterans \nto do this work.\n  Many Members of this Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, champion \nthe cause of hiring veterans. It is a policy we have incentivized the \nprivate sector to implement.\n  I hope Members will support this amendment and join in showing that \nour military readiness can be built by those who know personally how \nimportant that readiness is when fighting for our freedom.\n  I also want to speak on integrated missile defense. Mr. Chairman, \nIran is a chief sponsor of international terrorism, and regularly \nthreatens to obliterate Israel, our most important ally in the region.\n  Those who supported agreement last year to keep Iran from obtaining a \nnuclear weapon understood that the JCPOA does not eliminate all of \nIran's threats to the United States and our partners in the Middle \nEast.\n  My amendment would take further steps to support our allies in the \nregion and crack down on Iranian aggression.\n  By vocalizing our support for working with Israel, the Gulf \nCooperation Council, Jordan, and Egypt, to build an integrated missile \ndefense system, we can build off of the successes of Israel's existing \nmissile defense network.\n  I support the funding authorizations included in this year's defense \nbudget that will continue to support Israel's missile defense program. \nThrough a smart, targeted approach with our partners, we can continue \nto counter Iranian aggression and promote security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment package, \nwhich includes my amendment that ensures the safety of Naval Submarine \nBase Kings Bay.\n  Home to the Atlantic ballistic missile submarine fleet, Kings Bay's \ncontributions to national security and to the nuclear deterrence \ncapabilities of the U.S. fleet cannot be overstated.\n  Just south of the installation is a low-use general aviation airport \ncalled St. Mary's Airport. The flight lines for their airport take \ncivilian aircraft right over the base, raising a number of security \nconcerns for the installation and for the weapons packages stored \nthere.\n  The dangers this poses to our nuclear stockpile is glaring, and this \namendment is the first step in remedying that situation. This amendment \nwould allow for the relocation of the St. Mary's Airport service due to \nnational security concerns posed to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay.\n  This amendment has been a major priority for the Navy, and provides \nmuch-needed changes to security concerns that have been persistent for \na number of years.\n  With this amendment, we can protect our nuclear submarines while \nproviding new economic opportunities.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  MR. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Ruiz).\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, the \nCounter Iran Maritime Initiative.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Iran is a serious risk to our national security. We must remain \nvigilant. We must protect our troops and our allies in the Middle East. \nThis amendment will help stop illegal arms shipments from Iran to \nterrorists and protect our national security. My amendment will help \nkeep American troops and our allies in the region, including Israel, \nsafe.\n  It authorizes our military to provide training, equipment, supplies, \nand military construction to nations along the Persian Gulf, the \nArabian Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea.\n  I am glad that there is broad, bipartisan consensus on the need for \nthis amendment so that we can keep our troops safe and shore up the \nsafety of our allies in the region.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam).\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to tell you briefly about the Roskam amendment, \nwhich requires the President to provide Congress with a comprehensive \nreport on Iran's usage of commercial aircraft for military and \nterrorist activity. You say to yourself, Mr. Chairman: Why do we need \nthis? Why is this important?\n  Here is why. There is an important American company that is actively \ntalking to the Iranians about the possibility of selling aircraft to \nthem.\n  Here is the problem with that. Everybody--everybody--agrees that the \nIranians are the world's largest state sponsor of terror; and \ntherefore, it goes that if you give them something that is useful for \nmilitary purposes--that is, aircraft--it is fungible, and it can be \nused for any purpose. The notion that the Iranians are going to use \nBoeing\n\n[[Page H2772]]\n\naircraft, for example, simply to transport people on vacation back and \nforth within Iran is profoundly naive.\n  So what this amendment does is it puts the aircraft industry on \nnotice and it puts the Iranians on notice that we are very interested \nin what they are doing with commercial aircraft, for what purpose.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, thanks again to the Armed Services \nCommittee for making in order with the Rules Committee my three \namendments that I have discussed today, two that I have already \ndiscussed, and this one that I will now bring to my colleagues' \nattention.\n  Today, walking out of the bush of Nigeria, it was determined that \nanother Chibok girl has been found, discovered, or fled. The debate is \nwhether or not the military forces of Nigeria helped her out. What we \ndo know is that she was missing for 2 years, along with the 200-plus \ngirls that were taken. Fifty-seven of them escaped in the immediacy of \nthe hours, and six of them died, and this young woman has now come out \n2 years later.\n  Families are suffering, and Boko Haram has become one of the most \nvile and most vicious terrorist groups in the world. They are \naffiliated with ISIS, ISIL, but they have, if you will, no conformity \nto any protocol but killing. They have burned and killed Muslims and \nChristians alike, schools, homes, mosques, and churches. They have \ndecapitated people. They have sent 8-year-olds with bombs strapped to \ntheir bodies to kill.\n  So my amendment is very straightforward.\n  As I do this, let me say that a number of you have joined \nCongresswoman Frederica Wilson week after week wearing red to bring the \ngirls home. She joined me, and we traveled together within weeks of the \ngirls being taken in 2014. We confronted families, saw the pain, saw \nwomen with slashed throats that had healed, and we saw the leaders of \ngovernment who then were somewhat, if you will, challenged about this \ntask.\n  So my amendment is one that deals with collaboration. It is a sense \nof Congress that provides for condemning the ongoing violence, \nexpresses its support for the Nigerian people, and calls on the \nPresident to support Nigeria, Lake Chad Basin, and the international \ncommunity to ensure accountability for crimes against humanity.\n  It also asks for the initiative that we can engage the Department of \nDefense to assist the Government of Nigeria and countries in the Lake \nChad Basin to develop capacities to deploy and destroy Boko Haram, \nobviously with the use of possible security forces, recognizing the \nLeahy amendment, but also with technology.\n  Lives are still in the midst. Lives are still not being provided for.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Womack). The time of the gentlewoman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am asking that we collaborate with \nthe forces in Nigeria and the forces that have been part of the \nmultinational task force to be able to have a strategy that deals with \nBoko Haram.\n  This report can be critical in our efforts to empower and complement \nthe efforts of the Multinational Joint Task Force as well as the \ncommitment espoused at the recent Lake Chad Basin Regional Security \nSummit.\n  So I would say that we have to recognize that we now have an \nindividual. This young woman can give us the intelligence. I am \nconcerned that these girls cannot be rescued now. This is partly asking \nPresident Buhari of Nigeria to join in with this information--this new \ninformation, the collaboration that, hopefully, as we move through this \nlegislation, ongoing, right now--to rescue those girls and also support \nthe idea of a special envoy to focus on the dangers in the Lake Chad \nBasin region.\n  Let me compliment the African command. I met many of them when I was \nin Nigeria. I think it is an excellent command among all the other \ncommands. They can be dynamic in their work.\n  My resolution, my amendment, my sense of Congress, is to give us \nfocus to bring back the girls and save these girls. We have the \ninformation. Bring back these girls.\n  Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Adam Smith and \nthe Rules Committee for making in order and including Jackson Lee \nAmendment Number 99 and including it in En Bloc Amendment Number 8 to \nthe ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.''\n  This is the third of 3 Jackson Lee amendments made in order by the \nHouse Rules Committee.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 99, calls for a report on efforts to \ncombat Boko Haram in Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin.\n  In the wake of the Rules Committee making this Amendment in order, I \nhold in my hand an article entitled ``#BringBackOurGirls: Chibok Victim \nFound in Nigeria After 2 Years, Activist Says.''\n  Two years after her captivity, we learn that a 19 year Chibok school \ngirl named Ameina Nkeki was found Tuesday by the Civilian JTF vigilante \ngroup, which fights alongside the Nigerian military, in a village near \nthe Sambisa Forest.\n  Nkeki had a baby with her and told the militia members she had \nescaped from Boko Haram captivity.\n  Indeed, just last night right before presenting before the Rules \nCommittee on this Amendment, I met with a remarkable couple whose name \nI do not want to mention in order not to place their lives in danger.\n  This couple, through their NGO, helped in the rescue, recovery and \nreintegration of over 10 Chibok girls.\n  Because of their remarkable work, the girls are now able to continue \nto pursue their education. Unfortunately, the lives of these good \nSamaritans are now in jeopardy.\n  I plan to do everything in my power to make sure that they and the \npersons they seek to empower are not harmed.\n  This is why I have introduced the bipartisan measure H. Res. 528--\nExpressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the \nVictims of the Terror Protection Fund.\n  And this is why I am working on a measure related to a Special Envoy \non Boko Haram to the Lake Chad Basin.\n  Support for this Amendment is timely as it is:\n  1. Strongly condemns the ongoing violence and the systematic gross \nhuman rights violations against the people of Nigeria and the Lake Chad \nBasin carried out by Boko Haram;\n  2. Expresses support for the people of Nigeria and the Lake Chad \nBasin who wish to live in a peaceful, economically prosperous, and \ndemocratic region;\n  3. Calls on the President to support Nigerian, Lake Chad Basin, and \nInternational Community efforts to ensure accountability for crimes \nagainst humanity committed by Boko Haram against the people of Nigeria \nand the Lake Chad Basin, particularly young girls kidnapped from Chibok \nand other internally displaced persons affected by the actions of Boko \nHaram;\n  Additionally, the Report calls that no later than 90 days after the \ndate of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, the \nSecretary of State, and the Attorney General shall jointly submit to \nCongress a report on efforts to combat Boko Haram in Nigeria and the \nLake Chad Basin;\n  Among others, the report shall also include the following elements:\n  1. A description of initiatives undertaken by the Department of \nDefense to assist the Government of Nigeria and countries in the Lake \nChad Basin to develop capacities to deploy special forces to combat \nBoko Haram;\n  2. A description of United States' activities to enhance the capacity \nof Nigeria and the countries in the Lake Chad Basin to investigate and \nprosecute human rights violations perpetrated against the people of \nNigeria and the Lake Chad Basin by Boko Haram, al-Qaeda affiliates, and \nother terrorist organizations to promote respect for rule of law in \nNigeria and the Lake Chad Basin;\n  3. This report can be critical in our efforts to empower and \ncomplement the efforts of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) as \nwell as the commitments espoused at the recent Lake Chad Basin Regional \nSecurity Summit.\n  Mr. Chair, the U.S. war on terror has been waged for over a decade \nand the lesson is clear that our adversaries adapt very quickly because \nthey are not constrained by geographic limitations.\n  In the beginning it was only Al Qaeda--now the list includes Al \nShabaab, Boko Haram which last year affiliated itself with ISIS/ISIL.\n  Indeed, the data on persons affected by violent extremism is \nstaggering.\n  There are now more than 2.2 million Nigerians, and over 450,000 \ninternally-displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees in neighboring \nCameroon, Chad and Niger.\n  An estimated 4.2 million people in the Lake Chad Basin region face \nwater and food security crises, including 800,000 in Nigeria's\n\n[[Page H2773]]\n\nnorthern Borno and Yobe states, Nigeria, where an estimated 184 \nchildren a day risk starvation without the immediate provision of \nemergency food assistance.\n  Boko Haram continues to claim responsibility for atrocious and \ntargeted violence ranging from burnings, kidnappings and killings of \ncivilians and school children, such as the Chibok girls and a suicide \nbombing of the United Nations building in Abuja on August 26, 2011, \nthat killed 21 people and injured dozens more, many of them aid workers \nsupporting development projects across Nigeria.\n  Half of persons displaced are children.\n  I continue to commend the tireless efforts of the United Nations, \nUnited States officials, Regional Leaders, Civil Society Organizations, \nCommunity Groups and good Samaritans who have helped to support efforts \nof combatting Boko Haram and securing peace and security in Nigeria and \nthe Lake Chad Basin.\n  Through this Amendment, we will establish our strong support and \ncommitment for the protection and empowerment of the peoples of Nigeria \nand the Lake Chad Basin who continue to face the threat of terrorism \nand violent extremism from Syria to Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin \nwhich covers Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and everywhere in between.\n  As terrorist craft new strategies to threaten our homeland and harm \nour allies, it is in the U.S. security interest to double our \ncounterterrorism efforts that identify, engage and empower people who \nare victimized by terrorist groups like Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, Al \nQaeda and ISIS in Africa and Pakistan.\n  For this reason, our military must adapt as quickly and as seamlessly \nas our adversaries in empowering our allies.\n  Our message must be clear: the United States must expand its capacity \nto meet the terrorist threat where it emerges whether here in the \nhomeland or abroad.\n  The Nuremberg trials were essential in bringing to justice war \ncriminals who committed acts of barbarism against civilians and \nmilitary personnel during World War II, but a critical component of \nbringing war criminals to justice is the gathering and preservation of \nevidence.\n  No person whether they travel to a battle field and later return to \ntheir native country or live in the region where they commit acts of \nterrors should rest well because they believe that no one will come to \nseek justice on behalf of the millions of lives destroyed.\n  Our message must be clear: terrorism will not thrive on our watch.\n  I ask for your support of this Amendment.\n\n                             [May 18, 2016]\n\n   #BringBackOurGirls: Chibok Victim Found in Nigeria After 2 Years, \n                             Activist Says\n\n                          (By Alexander Smith)\n\n       The mass kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram from \n     the Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014 ignited an \n     international outcry. The ensuing#BringBackOurGirls campaign \n     was backed by the likes of Michelle Obama, while the U.S. and \n     other countries sent military assistance.\n       A handful of the kidnapped girls managed to escape early on \n     but most were never found.\n       Both Nigeria's military and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign \n     said Wednesday that one of the girls was now in safe hands--\n     but gave conflicting information on the circumstances and her \n     identity.\n       Bukky Shonibare, one of the strategic team members of the \n     #BringBackOurGirls campaign, told NBC News that a 19-year-old \n     named Ameina Nkeki was found Tuesday by the Civilian JTF \n     vigilante group, which fights alongside the Nigerian \n     military, in a village near the Sambisa Forest.\n       Nkeki had a baby with her and told the militia members she \n     had escaped from Boko Haram captivity, Shonibare said, noting \n     that the details of the girl's escape were not immediately \n     clear.\n       This is a major, major breakthrough--this is the \n     breakthrough we've been waiting for,'' she said.\n       Nkeki was taken to a military base in Damboa before being \n     brought to her mother and her former high-school head \n     teacher--both of whom positively confirmed her identify, \n     according to Shonibare.\n       The activists are ``100 percent sure that this was one of \n     the Chibok girls,'' Shonibare added.\n       Col. Sani Usman, a spokesman for the Nigerian Army, \n     confirmed via WhatsApp message that one of the kidnapped \n     Chibok girls had been recovered.\n       He added in a statement that the girl was ``rescued'' by \n     ``our troops'' near Damboa. It was not immediately clear if \n     he was referring to his soldiers or the JTF.\n       Usman's statement also identified the girl as Falmata \n     Mbalala--which did not correspond to the name given by \n     Shonibare and the Bring Back Our Girls movement.\n       Both Usman and Shonibare insisted they had the correct name \n     for the young woman. NBC News was not immediately able to \n     reconcile the differing accounts.\n       While the Chibok Girls drew the most international \n     attention, an estimated 2,000-plus women and girls have been \n     abducted during Boko Haram's violent campaign in Nigeria. \n     Chibok may not even be the largest group to be kidnapped, \n     with Human Rights Watch reporting that some 400 people were \n     taken from the town of Damasak last year.\n       The army gave details of a large-scale operation against \n     Boko Haram on Tuesday--the day the young woman was reportedly \n     found--in Sambisa forest.\n       The military said troops killed 15 Boko Haram fighters \n     after coming under heavy fire in the area of Alafa.\n       Troops also rescued 41 hostages--mainly women and children \n     the military added in a statement.\n       While Nigeria's government has publicly touted an \n     aggressive campaign to beat back Boko Haram, its failure to \n     find the girls has drawn criticism.\n       The news comes one day after the president's wife, Aisha \n     Buhari, presented ``symbolic'' checks to the mothers of the \n     missing girls.\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate Chairman \nThornberry's acceptance of my amendments No. 100 and No. 125. The first \nrecognizes the heroic efforts of the Pakistani doctor, Dr. Afridi, who \nhelped us bring to justice Osama bin Laden, the prime mover in the \nmassacre of 3,000 Americans on 9/11.\n  Dr. Afridi is a courageous hero who enabled us to destroy this \nterrorist monster. He continues to languish in a Pakistani dungeon. \nThis amendment was adopted by the House during consideration of past \ndefense authorization acts but was stripped out during conference \nnegotiations with the Senate. This is a shameful slap in the face to \nDr. Afridi and other heroic friends around the world who put themselves \nat risk to stand up with us.\n  Who will trust us? Who will stand with us if we betray our friends \nlike this? It is time to end this irrational support that we give to \nPakistan. It is only prudent that we increase--which is another one of \nthe amendments I talk about today--certification required to release \nAmerican military or economic aid to Pakistan.\n  It behooves us not to finance Pakistan's brutal suppression of ethnic \ngroups and religious minorities like the Baloch and the Sindhis who are \nunder attack today simply for seeking their political and religious \nfreedom.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join with me and to stand also with the \npeople around the world. Send a message: If you stand with the United \nStates, we will not forget you; we will stand with you. The people of \nthe United States and the United States Congress stand tall with you \nand appreciate that you have risked your lives in a way that saved \nAmerican lives.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and so I urge \nadoption of the en bloc amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support \nof the bipartisan amendment with Congressman Seth Moulton, No. 95, that \nwould increase transparency and accountability--in addition to \npromoting peace through strength.\n  In the past few months, the Tehran regime has repeatedly pushed the \nboundaries of the dangerous Iran deal and on United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions. Since January, the Iranian regime has tested at \nleast two intercontinental ballistic missiles, including one that had \nthe writing ``Israel should be wiped off the Earth,'' written in \nHebrew. These ICBMs have the ability to reach Israel and other allies \nin the Middle East from southeastern Europe to India.\n  Sadly, the American people have not received satisfactory answers \nabout why the actions by Iran are without repercussions. This amendment \nwill require a quick and clear response: Why or why not did the ICBM \ntests violate international agreements, and what response the \nadministration will take.\n  This bipartisan amendment will hold the administration accountable \nand require a timely and thorough report on our response to hostile \nactions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in support.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding).\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chairman, let me begin by thanking both Chairman \nThornberry and Chairman Royce for\n\n[[Page H2774]]\n\ntheir assistance in helping to craft this amendment, and also let me \nthank Ranking Member Engel and Dr. Bera, who joined Chairman Royce as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment truly is a testament to the broad, \nbipartisan support for the U.S.-India relationship here in Congress. \nOur agreement is straightforward. It seeks to promote greater defense \ntrade and encourage additional military cooperation between the United \nStates and India.\n  I believe that by requiring our government to take actions such as \nstrengthening the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative and \nencouraging combined military planning with India, we can make certain \nthat the U.S.-India defense relationship endures.\n  Mr. Chairman, given the dynamic nature of the Indo-Pacific region and \nits importance to our own national security and future economic growth, \nnow is the time to build on recent successes and propel the U.S.-India \nstrategic partnership forward.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Amendment Number \n70.\n  I want to thank Representative Connolly for his good work on this \namendment.\n  DOD is one of the last agencies that implement most of our foreign \naid to come up with an evaluation policy. USAID has one. The State \nDepartment has one. The Millennium Challenge Corporation has one. But \nnot DOD.\n  Evaluations do not just trace how money is spent. Evaluations help us \nfigure out if the money is achieving its intended outcome. Is it \nworking? Is it making a lasting difference?\n  The good news is that the DOD is working on an evaluation policy now. \nBut just because they are working on it doesn't mean it will get done. \nWe all know what bureaucrats can do if given the time.\n  Amendment Number 70 makes it clear that Congress supports a strong \nevaluation policy.\n  We should be doing rigorous evaluation on all our foreign aid because \nAmericans deserve to know how their money is being spent. And that's \njust the way it is.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The question is on the \namendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nThornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 6 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY.

SHAKIL AFRIDI.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The attacks of September 11, 2001, killed approximately \n     3,000 people, most of whom were Americans, but also included \n     hundreds of individuals with foreign citizenships, nearly 350 \n     New York Fire Department personnel, and about 50 law \n     enforcement officers.\n       (2) Downed United Airlines flight 93 was reportedly \n     intended, under the control of the al-Qaeda high-jackers, to \n     crash into the White House or the Capitol in an attempt to \n     kill the President of the United States or Members of the \n     United States Congress.\n       (3) The September 11, 2001, attacks were largely planned \n     and carried out by the al-Qaeda terrorist network led by \n     Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al Zawahiri, after which \n     Osama bin Laden enjoyed safe haven in Pakistan from where he \n     continued to plot deadly attacks against the United States \n     and the world.\n       (4) The United States has obligated nearly $30 billion \n     between 2002 and 2014 in United States taxpayer money for \n     security and economic aid to Pakistan.\n       (5) The United States very generously and swiftly responded \n     to the 2005 Kashmir Earthquake in Pakistan with more than \n     $200 million in emergency aid and the support of several \n     United States military aircraft, approximately 1,000 United \n     States military personnel, including medical specialists, \n     thousands of tents, blankets, water containers and a variety \n     of other emergency equipment.\n       (6) The United States again generously and swiftly \n     contributed approximately $150 million in emergency aid to \n     Pakistan following the 2010 Pakistan flood, in addition to \n     the service of nearly twenty United States military \n     helicopters, their flight crews, and other resources to \n     assist the Pakistan Army's relief efforts.\n       (7) The United States continues to work tirelessly to \n     support Pakistan's economic development, including millions \n     of dollars allocated towards the development of Pakistan's \n     energy infrastructure, health services and education system.\n       (8) The United States and Pakistan continue to have many \n     critical shared interests, both economic and security \n     related, which could be the foundation for a positive and \n     mutually beneficial partnership.\n       (9) Dr. Shakil Afridi, a Pakistani physician, is a hero to \n     whom the people of the United States, Pakistan and the world \n     owe a debt of gratitude for his help in finally locating \n     Osama bin Laden before more innocent American, Pakistani and \n     other lives were lost to this terrorist leader.\n       (10) Pakistan, the United States and the international \n     community had failed for nearly 10 years following attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, to locate and bring Osama bin Laden, who \n     continued to kill innocent civilians in the Middle East, \n     Asia, Europe, Africa and the United States, to justice \n     without the help of Dr. Afridi.\n       (11) The Government of Pakistan's imprisonment of Dr. \n     Afridi presents a serious and growing impediment to the \n     United States' bilateral relations with Pakistan.\n       (12) The Government of Pakistan has leveled and allowed \n     baseless charges against Dr. Afridi in a politically \n     motivated, spurious legal process.\n       (13) Dr. Afridi is currently imprisoned by the Government \n     of Pakistan, a deplorable and unconscionable situation which \n     calls into question Pakistan's actual commitment to \n     countering terrorism and undermines the notion that Pakistan \n     is a true ally in the struggle against terrorism.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Dr. Shakil Afridi is an international hero and that the \n     Government of Pakistan should release him immediately from \n     prison.\n\n\n          amendment no. 76 offered by mr. walberg of michigan\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XII (page 504, after line \n     25), add the following:\n\n[[Page H2775]]\n\n  \n\n\n     SEC. 1217.

Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers here at this point, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts \nfor yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the chairman and the \nranking member for including my amendment in the en bloc amendment. \nThis amendment will require a report detailing plans to inform American \nmanufacturers about opportunities to equip foreign militaries receiving \nU.S. assistance.\n  Each year, our country provides billions of dollars to our \ninternational partners in military assistance to foster security \nrelationships and to ensure our national security. This is a worthwhile \ninvestment necessary to preserve American interests abroad, but we need \nto make sure that American businesses, particularly American \nmanufacturers, are given ample opportunity to compete for these \ntaxpayer-funded contracts.\n  My amendment helps ensure American companies are aware of what \nopportunities are available to them and to their employees. By ensuring \nmore American companies are aware of these opportunities, we can \nsupport job growth among American companies, which in turn will support \nthe overall health of our economy and our Nation's defense industrial \nbase.\n  Increased competition also helps ensure that our international \npartners are provided with the highest quality products available, thus \nhelping to better secure their own better future and protecting our own \nnational security interests.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  The amendment simply ensures that American businesses have the \nopportunity to compete for these contracts so that as we are building \nup and securing our national security interests around the world, we \nare also strengthening American jobs, American manufacturing, and \ngrowing our economy.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n\n[[Page H2776]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak about a bipartisan amendment that \npassed the full Committee on Armed Services, and also had to go through \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee to be approved. It calls on the \nadministration to report to Congress on a comprehensive political and \nmilitary strategy for our fight against ISIS in the Middle East.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are sending troops back into Iraq today, just 7 or 8 \nyears after we pulled the last troops out. Many of the battles they are \nfighting have familiar names--Fallujah, Ramadi, and Haditha--battles \nthat we fought and won a long time ago. But we did not have a strategy \nto ensure the peace.\n  Mr. Clausewitz taught us about 200 years ago that war is an extension \nof politics.\n  We have to have a political endgame for our fight in Iraq, or we will \nfind ourselves continually going back there again and again. When Iraqi \npolitics fail, a new terrorist group sweeps in; and American troops are \nleft to pick up the mess.\n  If you think about what happened when ISIS swept in from Syria and \nentered western, then northern Iraq, the Iraqi army wasn't just \ndefeated by ISIS. The Iraqi Army put their weapons down and went home \nbecause they had lost faith in the Iraqi Government.\n  We must have a long-term, comprehensive political and military \nstrategy. We owe it to the troops to ensure that their efforts will not \nbe in vain.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan support for this amendment, both on the \nArmed Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I am \nespecially proud that the chairman worked with me to get it adopted. I \nam glad that it is included in the bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendments en bloc.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, on Sept. 22, 2011, Adm. Mike Mullen, \nthen chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee that the Haqqani Network was behind the 2011 \nattack on our embassy and a truck bombing that wounded more than 70 \nU.S. and NATO troops. Adm. Mullen went on to say, ``The Haqqani Network \nacts as a veritable arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence \nagency.''\n  Last year, the Haqqani Network and the Taliban killed more Afghan \ncivilians and troops than in any other year since the Taliban was \ntoppled in 2001.\n  My amendment adds a fourth condition on the aid to Pakistan. This new \ncondition requires the Administration to certify that Pakistan has \nshown progress in arresting and prosecuting Haqqani Network senior \nleaders and mid-level operatives.\n  This forces Pakistan to make a choice: either go after the Haqqani \nNetwork in a public way that it has never done before or lose hundreds \nof millions of dollars of US aid.\n  And that's just the way it is.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 7 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY.

Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this en bloc \npackage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I just want to say quickly, in the en bloc package, there was an \namendment that was put in there having to do with our development of a \nnew rocket engine and a new launch vehicle. I just want to thank \npublicly Mr. Rogers, the subcommittee chairman, who worked very closely \nwith me on developing this language.\n  We have got a lot of great things going on out there. There are a lot \nof American companies that are working hard to develop a new engine so \nwe will no longer have to rely on the Russian engine.\n\n[[Page H2779]]\n\n  The amendment that was included allows those companies to use some of \nthe money that the Air Force is providing for the development of a new \nengine, to use it also to develop a launch vehicle to go along with \nthat engine. We have got, like I said, great companies like Blue Origin \nin my district, Aerojet Rocketdyne--a lot of folks working on new \nvehicles--SpaceX as well. This amendment allows the money that the Air \nForce is providing not just to go to the engine but for some of it to \ngo to a launch vehicle as well. I think this will greatly reduce the \ncost of our launch costs for the Air Force, which has been a \nsignificantly problem recently.\n  So I thank Chairman Rogers for allowing us to offer that amendment \nand for working with me on it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my good friend Mr. \nRogers from Alabama for his work with me on this amendment.\n  The Intermediate Nuclear Forces or ``INF'' Treaty places limits on \nground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 \nand 5,500 kilometers.\n  In 2008, the Russians tested a missile within this prohibited range \nand were caught red handed.\n  But it took 3 years for the Administration to report any concern \nabout Russian compliance to Congress. It took a full 6 years for the \nState Department to officially find the Russians in violation. After \neight years, there have been no serious consequences for Russia's \nviolation of the treaty.\n  My amendment would prohibit government contracts with entities that \nhave contributed to Russia's violation of the INF Treaty.\n  Russia is not our ally, is not our friend, and we cannot take it at \nits word. Czar Putin is determined to restore Russia to its glory days. \nWe must respond with strength.\n  And that's just the way it is.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 8 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY.

Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nSmith) each will control 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  I just want to thank the chairman, and I want to thank the staff and \nthe Members for putting together this piece of legislation. It is \nalways a long process but I think a good process, in which we pull \ntogether a variety of different amendments. And, as the chairman has \nsaid many times, it is a bottom-up process. It starts with the Members \noffering their ideas in putting together the bill. I think, once again, \nwe have done that process fairly well.\n  The problem and the challenge, as I had mentioned earlier, comes from \nthe budget number and the problems that we face. I know the chairman \nhas said earlier, you know, we can't solve all these problems; so let's \nhelp the troops now.\n  The problem is, it is like you have got a credit card and you say: \nwow, off in the future there may be problems, but let's just buy \nwhatever we want, put it on the credit card now, and that will help \neverybody in the long run. But it doesn't. It is not helping the troops \nto pass a bill that has 6 months worth of funding for a yearlong's \nworth of overseas contingency operations, and it is not helping them to \nhope that the Budget Control Act goes away.\n  The chairman mentioned that last year we had this same problem and we \ndid wind up getting an agreement, and that is true. Part of the reason \nwe got that agreement, however, is because we, on this side, insisted \non that agreement and did not merely accept the defense bill that was \noffered without resolving those issues.\n  And, once again, we have to insist upon that: that it does not make \nsense to have the Budget Control Act and continue to insist on spending \nmore money on defense. Essentially, what the majority party wants is \nthey want a Ferrari, but they only want to provide the money to pay for \na Honda, and they keep hoping that somehow that extra money is going to \nappear. That hurts our troops.\n  We have heard all of these stories about the terrible state of our \nreadiness. Consistently, over the course of the last 4 years, the bill \nthat has been passed in the House and the Senate has put less money \ninto readiness than the President asked for. Why? Because they wanted \nto pay for a wide variety of programs, including the A-10, an important \nplane, we have heard.\n  I am not saying that there is anything in this bill that you can't \nmake an argument for as being important. The problem is it doesn't add \nup, and it leaves us in a position where the military is continually \nhaving to stare at a cliff, knowing that the money is not going to be \nthere and trying to figure out how to plan through that.\n  I want a more sensible process. We should fully fund the OCO and fund \nthe base budget at the level that it is funded at. If we don't find \nthat sufficient--and I know just about every member of the Armed \nServices Committee on the Republican side does not find that number \nsufficient--then provide the money. This isn't a matter of saying, \nwell, what has that got to do with this? That has got everything to do \nwith this.\n  If you are not willing to provide the money to pay for these \nprograms, starting them, or telling the military that they have to have \na fixed number of members of the Army and the Marine Corps, and then \nknowing that the money isn't going to be there a year from now, is not \nhelpful. We have to bring some sanity to the budget process. This bill, \nartfully, just imagines that 6 months from now, we will magically make \nup the extra money in OCO. That is a big problem that, once again, we \nneed to confront.\n  But just like last year, I am confident that we will come together in \nconference, we will talk about this, we will work it out, and we will \ncome up with a bill. But I hope that we will start understanding the \nmoney a little bit better and making this actually work so that the \nbill we pass is helping the men and women of the armed services who \nserve us so well.\n  So it is not about whether or not you support the troops or not; it \nis a matter of whether or not you think this bill is the best way to do \nit.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski).\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise to thank Ranking Member Smith and Chairman \nThornberry for an amendment that was included in one of the prior en \nbloc groups of amendments.\n  The amendment that I joined Mr. Pompeo in offering requires the DOD \nto report to Congress on the cooperation between Iran and the Russian \nFederation and the extent to which that cooperation affects our \nnational security interests.\n  Even before the Iran nuclear deal, we watched Tehran and Moscow \nbecome\n\n[[Page H2784]]\n\ncloser partners, as Russia announced it would lift its ban on selling \nadvanced missiles to Iran and began military cooperation with Iran in \nSyria to prop up the Assad government.\n  This year, Russia and Iran have worked together to undermine U.N. \nSecurity Council ballistic missile resolutions and announced an $800 \nmillion missile defense contract.\n  It is imperative that we fully understand the impact of this alliance \non our national security interests because both nations continue to be \nhostile towards the U.S. and our allies. This amendment will help do \njust that.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 5 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time just to, again, emphasize that this is a very, very important \npiece of legislation, and it is important that we get it right. This is \none step in the process.\n  At the committee level, we worked together and got the bill out. At \nthe time, I raised the concerns that I am raising now. I voted in favor \nof the bill, hoping that we would make improvements on the floor. \nInstead, we went the other way.\n  We had one amendment that was supported in the committee that the \nRules Committee stripped without allowing a vote, a rule that would \nhave women sign up for the Selective Service, an amendment that was \nsupported by my caucus. The Rules Committee didn't even allow us to \nhave a vote on that. They just stripped it.\n  On another one, on the amendment that we didn't like that was in the \nbill, they went the other way and didn't allow a vote on that to keep \nit in place. That is not a fair process.\n  I will say that there are ultimately two objections to this bill and \npreface it with one thing. I think the chairman in committee has been \nvery, very fair, has worked very well with Democrats, and I do \nappreciate that. The Rules Committee, on the other hand, has been the \nexact opposite. They have been completely and totally partisan in a way \nthat is not in keeping with the tradition of the Armed Services \nCommittee and the way we do business in a fair way: to allow members to \nhave votes on amendments that are important to them. They didn't do \nthat, and that made this bill even worse than it was when it came out \nof committee. I hope the Rules Committee will do better in the future. \nI don't think that is likely, but that is certainly one issue.\n  The second issue is, again, the funding. If we are really going to \nprovide for the troops, we have to realistically look at the next 10 \nyears and begin building a national security strategy that can support \nthem, based on the budget that we are prepared to provide. There is no \nnew revenue coming. Even if the budget caps go away, typically the way \nthe budget caps go away is they are extended for another year, and \nbasically we use 10-year money to pay for 1 year's worth of goods and \nservices, which only puts us in a further hole.\n  Lastly, I will point out those other portions of the budget. The \ndefense budget has grown as a proportion of the discretionary budget. \nIt is now over 55 percent of it.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Essentially, what the Republican party is trying to do is to spend \nall of the money on defense, and then there will be nothing left over \nfor the other priorities. Those other priorities do matter, and it is \nwrong to ask: Well, what has the defense bill got to do with our \ncrumbling infrastructure? What has the defense bill got to do with long \nlines at the TSA or at Homeland Security or at the Department of \nJustice or anywhere else?\n  It has got everything to do with it in a year when we don't have a \nbudget resolution, so we don't have set amounts of money for each bill. \nEvery dollar that we put into this is taking out of the overall \nallocation and is taking from all of those other priorities.\n  Yes, national security is incredibly important, but I think \ninfrastructure is important as well. I think the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is important, as is the Department of Justice, as is the \nDepartment of the Treasury, which tries to stop terrorists from raising \nmoney. What we are doing here is refusing to pass a budget resolution, \nto put the numbers in place, and then spending all of the money on \ndefense first--sorry. It is an exaggeration as it is not all of the \nmoney but more of the money than was agreed upon--and then what is left \nover goes to everything else. That is not a responsible way to budget. \nThat is not a responsible way to provide for this country.\n  For those reasons, I am going to oppose the bill. I hope, again, as \nwe did last year, we will work this out in conference, come up with a \nmore sensible approach, and have a bill that we can all support.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's comments that he believes I have tried \nto be fair with Members of the minority in constructing this bill. I \nhave tried to be; although I have to say, Mr. Chair, if one leans over \nbackwards to make sure Members of the minority contribute to the bill \neven to the point at which some of the provisions Members of the \nminority are interested in are opposed by Members of the majority--if \nyou still try to do that and yet Members of the minority vote against \nthe bill--I have got to ask myself: Why? Why do I do such things?\n  Just in the past hour and a half, maybe 2 hours, we have spent time \nwith basically equal numbers of Members on the Republican and \nDemocratic sides in their talking about their amendments--discussing \nvery important issues--but none of those issues happen without having \nthe bill pass. Yet I get the feeling that, at least for some Members, \nthere may always be that next bridge that we have got to get to before \nthey can support the bill.\n  Mr. Chair, the ranking member described my view really better than I \ndid. He said that my opinion is we have to help the troops now, and \nthat is exactly my view. Just think about what the alternative is: no, \nwe are not going to help the troops now because we are not sure where \nthe money is going to come from next year or 5 years from now or the \nnext 10 years. In the meantime, while we are not sure about all of \nthat, we are going to continue to let class A mishaps grow. What that \nmeans is more people stand in danger of losing their lives, but we are \ngoing to go ahead and allow that to happen because we don't know where \nthe money is going to come from or we object to this provision, et \ncetera.\n  It is absolutely true. My view is to help the troops now because now \nis the time that they are cannibalizing the aircraft, not getting the \nminimum number of training hours, seeing class A mishaps go up, have \nonly nine B-1s that are available to fly. The statistics go on and on.\n  Mr. Chair, the other point I would make is that readiness is not just \na question of funding the operation and maintenance accounts. That is \nreally what I have thought most of the time I have been here. What I \nhave come to understand, however, is that you can cut end strength, you \ncan cut the number of people in the military, down to the point that \nyou can never get ready. I think that is part of what the Air Force is \nfacing now. They have cut the number of people. We are 700 pilots \nshort, and we are 4,000 maintainers short. It doesn't matter how much \nmoney you are putting toward them when you have only so many mechanics. \nThe average experience of a mechanic in the military has dropped \nsignificantly just in the last 2 years. People are part of fixing \nreadiness, and procurement is part of fixing readiness.\n  How many times do I have to explain that you can't fix a 1979 Black \nHawk helicopter?\n  You have to get a new one. You can't replace an early 1980s F/A-18 \nmodel. There are no more parts for it. You have to replace it with an \nF-35. That is what we do in this bill.\n  Mr. Chair, I continue to be perplexed at how the funding approach \nthat was good and passed by a Democratic majority in 2008, between Bush \nand Obama, is somehow unacceptable between Obama and whoever is next. \nNone of us knows who is next. We don't\n\n[[Page H2785]]\n\nknow who is going to be the next President. To fully fund the readiness \nrequirements for the whole year so as to deal with those problems of \nmaintenance and training and people and procurement, to fully fund \nthose and then have the new President take a fresh look at the \ndeployments, seems to make sense. It sure made sense in 2008. I think \nit makes sense in 2016 as well.\n  Mr. Chair, the Rules Committee made in order 180 amendments for \nconsideration here on the floor. I understand not everybody's amendment \nwas made in order, but it is a little hard for me to understand how \npeople could complain about the process when 180 amendments were made \nin order, many by Democrats, many by Republicans. I realize not every \namendment was made in order, but, surely, a lot of topics have been \ndiscussed.\n  Finally, Mr. Chair, I just have to take a moment and read one of the \namendments that some Members have complained about that was placed into \nthe bill in committee by Mr. Russell of Oklahoma.\n  It reads:\n\n       Any branch or agency of the Federal Government shall \n     provide protections and exemptions consistent with section \n     702(a) and 703(e)(2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \n     section 103(d) of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n  That is it. It is one paragraph. That is it. I don't know who is \nopposed today to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or to the Americans with \nDisabilities Act of 1990. That is the reason I just get this feeling, \npersonally, that there may be those who are just looking for some \nexcuse to vote against the bill. The price of that is that readiness \nproblems--class A mishaps--will continue on the trend they are on.\n  Absolutely. Help the troops now. I can't predict the future. I don't \nknow who is going to be elected President. I don't know who is going to \nbe elected to Congress. I don't know what the budget will be in future \ntimes, but I know what I can do now. I know what I can do today. I can \nhelp the troops now. You bet. Sign me up.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 119 Offered by Ms. Bordallo\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 119 \nprinted in House Report 114-571.\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on the consideration of H.R. \n5243 and that I may include tabular material on the same.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise to present H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act.\n  The Zika virus clearly poses a great threat to public health not only \nin the United States, but around the globe. It has become increasingly \nimportant that we, the Congress, act to protect our most vulnerable, \nparticularly infants and pregnant women, from the risks of this \ndisease. Our response must be urgent, direct, and strategic, targeted \nat preventing the further spread of this disease.\n  The bill before you today provides $622.1 million to fight this \ndangerous virus. It prioritizes critical activities that must begin \nimmediately, such as vaccine development and mosquito control.\n  I was glad to see that the administration took our committee's advice \nand redirected $589 million from less urgent needs to fund immediate \nactions to respond to Zika. This was and is the most immediate source \nof funding in the fight against Zika.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  But given the severity of the crisis, it is clear we must do more. \nThe funds within this legislation will continue the Department of \nHealth and Human Services' and the Department of\n\n[[Page H2789]]\n\nState's critical efforts to fight the spread of this harmful disease \nfor the rest of the fiscal year of 2016 and beyond. This means that, in \ntotal, Congress will have provided over $1.2 billion so far with this \nbill to respond to Zika in fiscal year 2016.\n  I am proud that we have provided this funding in a responsible way. \nThe funding in this bill is entirely offset through rescissions of \nunobligated infectious disease funds that included Ebola or from \nwhatever leftover administrative balances there exists within HHS.\n  Importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill takes a thoughtful, strategic \napproach to how to address the fight against Zika, directing funds \nwhere they are needed most urgently and where they can do the most \ngood.\n  This legislation provides $170 million for the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention to support mosquito control efforts, disease \nsurveillance, international response, and public education. These funds \ncan also be used for emergency preparedness grants to State, local, and \nterritorial health departments that may confront reductions to their \nexisting budgets.\n  Within this total, up to $50 million is available for health programs \ntargeted at prenatal care, delivery and postpartum care, newborn health \nassessments, and care for infants with special needs related to Zika. \nThese funds are focused on States and territories currently \nexperiencing Zika outbreaks.\n  The National Institutes of Health received $230 million to help \nexpedite the research and development of Zika vaccines, making sure \nthese treatments can be made available to the public quickly and \nsafely.\n  For the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, \nBARDA, $103 million will be directed to development and production \nactivities for Zika, including for new rapid diagnostic tests and \nvaccines. Our response to Zika must also include cutting off the virus \nat its source, since mosquitos know no boundaries.\n  For the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, the bill provides a total of $119.1 million, $100 million \nof this total directed to mosquito control efforts. This also includes \nfunding for public education efforts aimed at reducing mosquito \nexposure. The remaining $19.1 million is provided to help manage and \noversee these programs.\n  As I noted earlier, we have taken the fiscally responsible step of \noffsetting every dollar spent in this bill. To go even further and to \nensure accountability, transparency, and effective use of tax dollars, \nwe have included strong oversight requirements.\n  For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services, the State \nDepartment, and USAID are required to submit spending plans to Congress \nbefore any funds can be spent. And we have directed $2 million total \nfor GAO and Inspector General oversight. The bill also reiterates \ncurrent, strong protections against the use of any funds for abortions.\n  The White House's request earlier on made none of these oversight \nefforts, allowing broad transfer authorities across the entire Federal \nGovernment and creating what I call ``slush'' funds with virtually no \nlimits.\n  This bill guarantees that every cent goes to address the problem at \nhand: fighting the Zika virus. This funding is critical to stop the \nspread of Zika and to protect our most vulnerable people, both here at \nhome and abroad. Every child deserves the chance at a full and healthy \nlife, and every mother deserves to see her child survive. This measure \nwill help make this happen for sure in an effective, efficient, and \nresponsible way.\n  Mr. Speaker, with this bill and its passage, the Congress will have \nseen to $1.2 billion just over the next 4\\1/2\\ months, the balance of \nthis fiscal year. The administration request of $1.9 billion was for \nseveral years. We, in this bill and the earlier transfer of funds from \nthe Ebola infectious disease fund, see to it that we put money on the \nproblem now, not waiting for further action.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5243.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H2790]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH180516.001\n\n\n\n[[Page H2791]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH180516.002\n\n\n\n[[Page H2792]]\n\n  \n\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In February, the World Health Organization declared Zika a public \nhealth emergency of international concern, and the President called for \n$1.9 billion to respond to the impending crisis to prevent the spread \nin our very own communities.\n  According to the National Governors Association, the Nation is on the \nthreshold of a public health emergency. In a separate letter, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, National League of Cities, National Association \nof County and City Health Officials wrote to urge Congress to provide \nemergency supplemental money for Zika, rather than repurpose money from \nother high-priority programs.\n  I include in the Record both letters.\n\n                                                     May 10, 2016.\n     Hon.

Patty Murray,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, \n         Health and Human Services & Education, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Cochran and Blunt and Senators Mikulski and \n     Murray: The U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of \n     Cities and National Association of County and City Health \n     Officials call on you to advance legislation without delay to \n     respond to the Zika virus. Our associations serve people in \n     cities and counties where the burden of Zika will be felt \n     directly.\n       Emerging infectious disease threats like Zika require \n     ongoing vigilance, but the particular risks from this virus \n     require immediate, additional investments. We urge Congress \n     to provide emergency supplemental funding for Zika rather \n     than repurpose money from other high priority programs at the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other \n     federal agencies that ensure our health security and public \n     health preparedness. CDC has already diverted more than $44 \n     million from public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) to \n     fund the Zika response. Backfilling this PHEP funding is \n     critical to making sure that communities are ready to respond \n     to all threats.\n       Although not a new virus, 2015 marked the first widespread \n     transmission of the Zika virus in the Americas. The virus is \n     spread primarily by mosquitoes and usually causes only mild \n     illness or no symptoms. However, in Brazil and other \n     countries affected by Zika there has already been a steep \n     increase in birth defects in infants born to mothers who were \n     infected during pregnancy. In January 2016, CDC warned women \n     who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant to avoid travel \n     to regions and countries with widespread Zika transmission or \n     to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes there. With the weather \n     getting warmer and increased numbers of mosquitos in many \n     places in the United States, Congress can no longer wait to \n     act.\n       In local communities, health departments are engaged in \n     educating the public and health care providers about Zika, \n     conducting prevention activities through mosquito eradication \n     and screening travelers from countries where the outbreak has \n     surfaced. Our associations urge you to act quickly in \n     providing emergency supplemental funding to the U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services to support the local \n     response to Zika with increased virus readiness and response \n     capacity focused on areas with ongoing Zika transmission; \n     enhanced laboratory, epidemiology and surveillance capacity \n     in at-risk areas and surge capacity through rapid response \n     teams to limit potential clusters of Zika virus in the United \n     States.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request.

As \n     with all such emergencies, advance planning and preparation \n     is essential to prevent injury and death.\n       A key component to averting infectious disease outbreaks is \n     to prevent incidence levels from reaching a critical `tipping \n     point,' after which there is a rapid increase in the number \n     of infections. This is particularly true of the Zika virus--\n     the most important way we can protect people is to minimize \n     infections and prevent a concentration of cases, which can \n     lead to outbreak and children born with severe, lifelong \n     birth defects such as microcephaly.\n       As Congress returns from recess today, the nation's \n     governors urge the Administration and Congress to work \n     together to reach agreement on the appropriate funding levels \n     needed to prepare for and combat the Zika virus. We also ask \n     they act as expeditiously as possible to ensure those funds \n     are available to states, territories and the public at \n     large.''\n\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, as summer approaches, the CDC confirmed \n1,204 cases, including more than 100 pregnant women in the continental \nUnited States, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories as of May 11. So \nfar all of the continental U.S. cases are associated with travel, but \nexperts expect the first locally transmitted cases in a matter of \nweeks.\n  The scientific community has concluded, after careful review, that \nZika can cause microcephaly resulting in miscarriage and other severe \nfetal brain defects, as well as adult neurological disorders.\n  When the House Republican leadership failed to act, the \nadministration was forced to redirect $589 million, mostly from \nemergency Ebola balances, to fund immediate efforts to respond to Zika. \nAccording to Dr. Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, the \nredirected funds allowed the United States to start work.\n  But we cannot finish what we need to do. The Republican bill does not \nallow us to finish the job either. It provides $622 million, less than \na third of what is needed.\n  The administration requested $743 million for State and local efforts \nto reduce mosquito populations as well as conduct public health studies \nof the Zika virus. The House Republican bill provides $120 million, \nplus an additional $50 million for block grants.\n  By providing such a small fraction of the requested amount, we would \nbe drastically underfunding State and local public health departments, \nhampering efforts to expand mosquito control and mitigation, and \nunnecessarily placing millions of pregnant women at risk.\n  In addition, the administration requested $246 million in direct \nassistance for Puerto Rico, an epicenter in the Zika outbreak. The \nHouse Republican bill does not provide this direct funding for Puerto \nRico, again, placing tens of thousands of pregnant women at risk.\n  In the past, Congress has come together in a bipartisan manner to \naddress and respond to emergencies from the Ebola and H1N1 viruses to \nnatural disasters and agreed that these emergencies should not be \noffset. When a tornado strikes, we don't steal money from the \nunfinished relief efforts for the last hurricane; yet House Republicans \nwould take more Ebola funding, risking that it could reemerge, and give \nless than it needed to stop the spread of Zika in communities \nthroughout the United States.\n  Without full funding to replenish Ebola accounts, we won't complete \ncommitments to fortify international public health systems or have \nhealth contingency funds in place to respond to outbreaks of either \ndisease or any other unanticipated public health crisis. That is why I \nintroduced H.R. 5044, which would provide the full emergency \nsupplemental to combat Zika and prevent the virus from spreading \nwithout risking investments in our public health infrastructure.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is the bill we should be debating today, not the \nHouse Republican Zika, which is a day late and a dollar short.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the chairman of the \nHouse Appropriations' Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation, and Related Agencies. He is also a member of the House Rules \nCommittee.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for \nyielding me the time I need.\n\n[[Page H2793]]\n\n  I want to begin my remarks by complimenting our chairman. Quite \nfrankly, I don't know anybody that has spent more time on this issue \nand devoted more thought to it than Chairman Rogers.\n  He took a codel down to the region. Our first stop was in Peru where \nwe stopped at a Naval research station. It has been there for many \ndecades. Their purpose normally is to look at tropical diseases, which \nthey are doing, but they have now switched their efforts primarily to \nZika, just as they should. So we were on top of this early.\n  Then we went to Brazil and, under Chairman Rogers' leadership, we had \nthe opportunity to meet with the Centers for Disease Control's people \non the ground and also talk to our colleagues in the Brazilian \nGovernment about the appropriate ways to move forward on this that were \ndone thoughtfully and responsibly.\n  What Chairman Rogers has laid before us is essentially a three-part \nplan that funds all the administration wants to do. The first is the \ninitial $600 million that would not be available had the chairman not \ndirected the administration to immediately use available funds.\n  Now, when we passed money for Ebola, if you go back and look at the \nlegislation, it was not only for Ebola. It was for Ebola and other \ninfectious diseases. Frankly, the money there may well be more than we \nneed for Ebola. But in any case, it is going to be spread over many \nyears. So because the chairman pushed hard on this, we actually have \n$600 million available immediately, and the message to the \nadministration was to start spending what you need to do now.\n  The second piece of this three-part plan is the bill that is in front \nof us today. It is over $600 million. As the chairman pointed out, this \nis two-thirds essentially of what the administration has requested and \nmore than they requested in this fiscal year. Remember, this bill is \nonly for this fiscal year.\n  So the next third will come in the bills that are presented by my \nsubcommittee and by my good friend, Chairman Granger's subcommittee, \nthe Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs.\n  So if you actually look at the total amount provided, it is about \nwhat the administration has requested, and it arrives in a timely \nmanner to meet all their needs. The one single critical difference is \nthat what the chairman has provided is fully offset.\n  Now, my very good friend from New York mentioned that, in \nemergencies, we don't normally offset. The reality is we do offset when \nwe can. She mentioned tornados. Let me give you an example.\n  In 2013, my home community of Moore, Oklahoma, was hit by tornados. \nThere was a question of whether or not there would be money available. \nThere was, in fact, money available. That money was in the FEMA \ndisaster relief fund. There was more than enough money in there that \nhad already been appropriated to use. That is what is true here again \ntoday.\n  We have more than enough money in the Ebola funds that we \nappropriated 2 years ago to actually take care of the initial phase of \nthis action and any other problem that comes up. This is now additional \nmoney on top of that.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  So the wise thing, it seems to me, is to actually use the funds that \nyou have set aside for these purposes. First, $600 million from the \nEbola money and infectious diseases. The next would be this. The next \ntranche of money would be in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation bill that I am privileged to be chairman of and will bring to \nthis floor in June, and my friend Ms. Granger will also bring forward \nadditional money in her bill to help with the efforts overseas.\n  So the simple fact is this really isn't an argument about Zika. It is \nan argument about whether you will pay to take care of the needs that \nwe have. We have more than enough funds in what we have already voted, \nwhat we will vote for here, and what we will provide next year to \nactually take care of the problem. The chairman has made an additional \ncommitment that if we need to backfill that money, if we are short for \nsome other infectious disease that none of us can anticipate or for \nEbola, we will take care of that during the regular appropriations \nprocess.\n  So this is, essentially, I think honestly, a solution in search of a \nproblem. The money is here. We have the money. We are appropriating the \nmoney. The administration has not failed to do one thing it wanted to \ndo because of lack of money. The money is available. The real question \nhere is: Are you going to offset that money and make sure that we don't \nadd another $1.9 billion to the national debt by using the money you \nhave got available or are you just going to simply charge it to the \nnational credit card? That is what my friends on the other side--with \nthe best of intentions, I am sure--are actually advocating. Let's just \nput the country $1.9 billion deeper in debt as opposed to using \navailable resources, appropriating additional resources and offsetting \nthem, and then using the normal appropriations process to go forward.\n  I want to commend the chairman, honestly, for being thoughtful, \ncareful, and prudent with taxpayer dollars. That is what this is all \nabout. If we work together, we can provide all the money that the \nadministration needs without increasing the national debt. If we do \nwhat our friends on the other side suggest, we will simply add $1.9 \nbillion more, and at the end of the day, we won't be in any different \nplace than we will be under the chairman's plan.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would recommend that we pass this legislation, build \non top of the $600 million we have already provided, and allow Ms. \nGranger and myself to bring forward to the full Congress the additional \nfunds that they need in the normal appropriations process.\n  Remember, this $1.9 billion isn't needed today. It is needed over a \nmultiyear period. We are providing it over a number of years, and we \nare doing it without adding to the national debt. It seems to me pretty \nclear.\n  Actually, both sides have the same aim here. We want to take care of \nan urgent healthcare problem. The difference is the chairman has \npresented--first, in the $600 million we have already deployed, and in \nthe $622 million that we will deploy in this bill, and the additional \nmoney that will come in the normal appropriations process--everything \nwe need. In some sense, this argument is an argument we don't need to \nhave unless your aim is simply to have $1.9 billion more.\n  I want to thank the chairman for what he has done. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my friends on the other side of the aisle. At \nthe end of the day, we will have more than enough money. The difference \nwill be we will not have added one cent to the national debt.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), a distinguished member of the \nCommittee on Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lowey for yielding and \nalso for her very steady and effective leadership on our committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Labor-HHS and State and Foreign \nOperations subcommittees, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. \n5243, which is the so-called Zika funding bill.\n  Earlier this week, the majority finally decided to act on Zika, yet \ntheir proposal shows just how unwilling they are to take this crisis \nseriously. Even now, they have offered barely one-third of the \nresources needed to fight Zika. Not only are my Republican colleagues' \nefforts 3 months late, they are also woefully inadequate to address \nthis major public health emergency.\n  If that weren't enough, Republicans have once again included poison \npills that have no place in this legislation. While we are trying to \nwork to protect our Nation's most vulnerable, including pregnant women \nand their children, the majority is putting politics over public \nhealth, and that is just wrong.\n  The Zika outbreak has already spread to more than 26 countries, \nincluding the United States and our territories. Sadly, there have been \ntwo Zika deaths in Puerto Rico. This summer, Americans living in \nSouthern States face tremendous risks from the virus.\n  Not only does this bill underfund our Zika response, it raids vital \nfunding for other dangerous infectious diseases, such as Ebola. Quite \nfrankly, we should\n\n[[Page H2794]]\n\nnot roll the dice should another Ebola outbreak occur. We know how this \nappropriations process works. I don't want to chance that. We \nappropriated Ebola funding for Ebola. This is not the time to rob Peter \nto pay Paul. The experts are clear. We need the full $1.9 billion \nrequest, emergency request, without offsets.\n  Now, we have seen war funding emergency supplementals fly through \nthis House without many questions raised. This is an emergency, and we \nneed to treat it as such.\n  Finally, this bill includes Hyde-like language, a dangerous rider \nthat denies access to abortion coverage for women if they are poor, a \nveteran, in the military, or a Federal Government employee. Let me be \nclear, politicians have no business denying a woman health coverage \nbased on her income, her employer, or her ZIP Code.\n  Once again, the majority has decided to put their extremist ideology \nover public health. Why in the world would they put this rider in this \nZika funding bill? It doesn't make any sense, and it is wrong.\n  It has been 3 months since the World Health Organization declared the \nZika virus as a public health emergency. That was February. Three \nmonths since the President requested emergency funds, the time to act \nis now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote to reject this bill and \nlet's instead pass a bill with adequate funding and without ideological \nantiwomen riders. The American people can't afford to wait much longer \nfor Congress to get this right.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Appropriations for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs.\n  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5243, the Zika \nResponse Appropriations Act.\n  This bill provides $622 million to respond to the Zika virus both at \nhome and abroad. As chair of the State and Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, I want to highlight \nfunds in the bill for the international response efforts to stop the \nvirus at its source. This includes mosquito control activities to stop \nthe spread of the virus, public information campaigns to get the \nmessage out about Zika, and evacuations of Americans when needed. These \nefforts will build on work that has already begun.\n\n  After my colleagues and I urged swift action, the administration \ndecided to redirect $589 million of funds already in hand to respond to \nthe Zika virus. This funding bill is the next step. It provides our \nbest estimate of what is needed for the remaining months of this fiscal \nyear. As we draft the fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills and \ninformation about the threat of Zika becomes more clear, we will \naddress at that time any additional requirements through our regular \nprocess.\n  Unlike the President's request, the activities supported in this bill \nare targeted and focused. This bill also contains strong oversight \nprovisions and is fully offset. H.R. 5243 provides what is needed now \nto respond to the Zika virus, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member on the Legislative \nBranch Subcommittee.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member, the \ngentlewoman from New York, for her leadership on this issue.\n  I join my colleagues in urging Congress to vote down this wholly \ninadequate legislation and take meaningful action to address the public \nhealth crisis the Centers for Disease Control called ``scarier than we \noriginally thought'' and support the President's request.\n  My home State of Florida leads the Nation in confirmed cases of the \nZika virus, with 113 people infected already and counting. Florida \nhealth officials declared a state of emergency in February. As we head \ninto mosquito season, as well as high travel season, we know the risk \nof Zika will rise.\n  We have seen the heartbreaking images of babies born with \nmicrocephaly. As researchers are continuing to learn more about the \ndifferent ways that Zika can be transmitted, it is critical that \nCongress provide the funding needed to thoroughly tackle this virus \nnow.\n  I am proud that we have transcended partisan lines in Florida at \nleast. Senators Nelson and Rubio as well as Governor Scott have all \nbeen outspoken advocates in support of the President's request to fight \nthis disease, which he made nearly 3 months ago.\n  I have heard many of my House Republican colleagues acknowledge the \ndevastating effects of this disease and the need for serious proposals \nto combat it. Sadly, the only serious part of the bill before us is how \nfar it is from meeting our Nation's needs in overcoming this public \nhealth crisis.\n  The bill that the Republican leadership has introduced will not \nprovide meaningful support to my constituents or constituents affected \nby this across the country. Among its many other shortcomings, this \nbill would raid funds from accounts designated for Ebola, which, as \nmany public health officials have testified already, is still a threat. \nRobbing Peter to pay Paul is irresponsible.\n  It also fails to provide any specific resources to Puerto Rico, where \nAmericans are suffering the greatest burden of what Dr. Thomas Frieden, \nthe Director of the Centers for Disease Control, recently called an \nepidemic. It continues attacks on a woman's ability to make her own \nreproductive health decisions, and, perhaps most astonishingly of all, \nthis bill only provides these limited and borrowed funds until \nSeptember 30, when they will then expire. Let me assure you that \nmosquitoes and diseases do not follow the congressional budget \ncalendar.\n  I urge the entire House to quickly pass legislation that I have \nintroduced along with my colleagues, Ranking Member Lowey and Ranking \nMember Rosa DeLauro, which would support the President's request of \n$1.9 billion. We cannot simply watch more people get infected with Zika \nas we dither over how we fund critical investments into vaccine \nresearch, prevention strategies, and finding a cure.\n  This is a mosquito-borne and sexually transmitted virus. Mosquitoes \ndon't know whether they are biting a Republican or a Democrat, and we \nshould not politicize this serious crisis.\n  The National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, and the Department of Health and Human Services have \nrepeatedly provided plans that clearly detail the need for these funds \nand how they would be spent.\n  Our local public health facilities, particularly in Florida, the Gulf \nStates, and Puerto Rico need added resources, as do our local mosquito \ncontrol programs. We need more investments into vector control and \nmosquito eradication. We need more public education, and we need more \nresources to ensure that people are able to protect themselves.\n  I will quote my colleague from the Senate, Senator Marco Rubio, that \nwe must--and I agree with him--we must get out in front of this. We \nwill only have ourselves to blame if we dither and don't do so.\n  So I say to my colleagues, we must act responsibly, we must respond \nappropriately, and we must do it quickly. This bill does not come close \nto doing that, so I will cast my vote against it in hopes we will reach \nan agreement that actually appropriates the amount of resources that \naddress this burgeoning crisis. My constituents cannot wait and neither \ncan yours.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I \nhave remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). The gentleman from Kentucky \nhas 13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from New York has 18 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson), the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Commerce, Justice, and Science.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, the Zika virus does pose a genuine \nemergency situation and, as in any emergency, requires a calm head, \nclear thinking, and rational approach to dealing with the problem, \nabsent of emotion. You have got to be careful and thoughtful about \nthese things.\n  As with any emergency situation, you have got to trust the experts, \nand the experts in the field have told us that the Ebola virus is no \nlonger as serious a threat as it was. That emergency has passed. We now \nneed to focus\n\n[[Page H2795]]\n\non the Zika virus, which we are beginning to see cases in the United \nStates.\n  So, in a thoughtful, careful, rational way, the Republican majority \nhas made certain that the money, our constituents' hard-earned tax \ndollars, is wisely and prudently spent.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  When we first recognized it, Chairman Rogers, Chairman Cole, and \nChairman Granger made sure there was $5 billion set aside in the \ncurrent year to fight Ebola and other infectious diseases. Nearly $2 \nbillion is still in that account for other infectious diseases.\n  And to deal with this Zika crisis, we have in this legislation \ntonight--which I urge my colleagues to support--added another $622 \nmillion that is completely offset. We have made savings and cuts in \nother areas of the government to make sure that our constituents' hard-\nearned taxpayers dollars are wisely spent.\n  We are not increasing spending. We are offsetting this $622 million \nto fight Zika in a thoughtful, intelligent, rational way, beginning \nwith funding mosquito control and prevention in those States with heavy \nmosquito populations.\n  Texas was inundated with rain this past April, and we got the threat \nof a large mosquito population that is very real. So this funding \ntonight, which is completely offset and paid for, will help combat that \nthreat.\n  Chairman Rogers, Chairman Cole, and Chairman Granger have provided \n$230 million to the National Institutes of Health in addition to--\nremember--the $2 billion that is still there from the current year to \nfight Ebola and other infectious diseases.\n  We have made sure that there is careful oversight of our \nconstituents' hard-earned tax dollars and to make certain that each \nagency has to report to Congress on how the money is going to be used. \nThey have to submit a spending plan. We have to make certain the \ndollars are going where they will do the most good. That is our \nresponsibility. That is our duty.\n  As good stewards of our constituents' hard-earned tax dollars, as \nguardians of the Treasury, we have a fiduciary duty to make sure that \nmoney is not wasted.\n  Chairman Rogers also put an expiration date on the funding to make \nsure that the money is not going to be transferred to other activities. \nIt has got to be spent on fighting this dreaded disease.\n  The only politicization that has taken place tonight are those who \nwould stand up in front of the people of the United States and try to \nmake it an emotional issue. We have got to approach this, as in any \ncrisis, in a calm, thoughtful, and intelligent way that makes sure that \nwe are targeting our constituents' hard-earned tax dollars where they \nwill do the most good.\n  Any additional funding that is necessary to fight this outbreak in \nthe next fiscal year can and will be considered as part of the normal \nappropriations process.\n  In a thoughtful, considerate way, Chairman Rogers has given us a bill \nto help solve this crisis, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the face of Zika: an innocent child harmed with \nthe disease--a disease that we could prevent.\n  Now, this disease is harming our fellow American citizens in Puerto \nRico and on the eastern side of the mainland.\n  Already, because of Washington's decades of neglect, Puerto Rico's \nhealth care system is broken. Last year, 500 doctors packed up and left \nthe island, never to return, and physicians are leaving at the rate of \none a day.\n  While Puerto Rico's health infrastructure is vulnerable, we are \nseeing this terrible disease take hold. More than 570 cases of \ninfection have already been reported in Puerto Rico, including almost \n50 pregnant women, and two deaths.\n  How dare anyone in this Chamber say that this is political. It is not \npolitical when we have people that are dying in Puerto Rico.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Now, what are House Republicans doing in response? \nThey are proposing less than one-third of the money needed to respond \nto Zika. They are providing no--zero--money targeted for Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. Speaker, look at this face again. Shame on this House for this \nfailure. Look at this face and then look in the mirror.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  This bill specifically mentions Puerto Rico. These moneys go to \nPuerto Rico, as well as to the rest of the territories and the States. \nSo the money will be there if this bill passes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nDiaz-Balart), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank Chairman Rogers \nfor his leadership on ensuring that the United States is able to do \neverything necessary to combat Zika, and do so immediately.\n  South Florida is ground zero in the United States for this disease. \nSo the funding that this bill provides is, frankly, critically \nimportant to Florida, especially, as we know, because mosquitos are \nmost active during the summer months. This horrible disease has the \ncapability to infect many, and we must focus on stopping it before it \ncontinues to spread.\n  So I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we need to provide every dollar \nneeded for Zika prevention, treatment, and response programs and, I \nwould repeat, not one penny less.\n  This bill is the second part of a three-pronged effort to combat this \ndisease. First was the almost $600 million in repurposed Ebola funds. \nNow we are providing an additional $622 million for, again, a total of \nover $1.2 billion to deal with this disease.\n  So let's be clear: if more funds are needed, Congress will step up \nand do what is necessary to make sure that, if those funds were \nnecessary sometime in the future, they would be available.\n  It is also crucial, Mr. Speaker, that President Obama's \nadministration and the Centers for Disease Control provide Congress \nwith detailed information as to how they plan to spend these proposed \nfunds.\n  Congress also has a responsibility to protect American taxpayers so \nthat their hard-earned dollars are spent efficiently and effectively, \nmuch unlike, Mr. Speaker, the fiasco with those so-called ``shovel-\nready'' programs. Let's make sure that we do not repeat that \nembarrassing fiasco and waste of taxpayers' money.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, as it does provide the \nfunds necessary to fight Zika immediately--immediately, Mr. Speaker--\nagain, while also making sure that we protect the hard-earned American \npeople's tax dollars.\n  I once again want to thank the chairman for doing this so quickly, so \nefficiently, because Florida is ground zero.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer), our distinguished Democratic whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I like Mr. Diaz-Balart. But if I get sick, I \nhope it doesn't take 90 days for the emergency responders to come to my \naid.\n  February 22 is when the administration said we needed this money. \nAlmost 90 days later, we are talking about one-third of what they said \nwas necessary.\n  Mr. Speaker, our Nation faces a very real and present danger from \nZika. Our people face that crisis. Already, more than 1,200 Americans, \nincluding more than 110 pregnant women, have confirmed cases of Zika \nvirus. Would that have been the case if we had acted on February 22? I \ndo not know. But I certainly wouldn't want to rely on this Congress to \nenact anything in a timely fashion.\n  We know that there is a link between Zika virus and severe birth \ndefects, including microcephaly, which can be life-threatening and for \nwhich there is no cure. We saw a tragic picture of a child.\n  Puerto Rico, with its 3.5 million American citizens, has been \nespecially\n\n[[Page H2796]]\n\nhard-hit and needs help from the Federal Government to prevent and \ncontain the spread of the virus and ensure access to health services \nfor those affected, particularly pregnant women and children.\n  Last week, Puerto Rico health officials reported the island's first \nconfirmed case of Zika-related microcephaly.\n  This is a public health crisis. And I guarantee you, if it had been a \nterrorist who had attacked, we would have responded on February 23.\n  The President has requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding to \ncombat the Zika outbreak, but that is not what House Republicans \nbrought to the floor today. Instead, they are putting forward \nlegislation that would provide just $662 million--less than a third, as \nI said.\n  That means we can't fully fund the development of a vaccine; \ndeployment of diagnostic testing, especially for pregnant women; and \nvector control to manage mosquito populations.\n  In addition to its inadequate funding level, the Republican bill \noffsets the spending by further depleting funds that were appropriated \nto combat the Ebola virus. I know they are going to say they are going \nto backfill it. I won't hold my breath.\n  The administration has already been forced to borrow more than half a \nbillion dollars in Ebola accounts, while Congressional Republicans \nignored its Zika supplemental funding request from February 22 to this \nday. That is no way--no way--to handle public health crises.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Republican side to join us to respond \neffectively to the President's request.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. HOYER. Representative Vern Buchanan of Florida, who supports the \nPresident's request, said last week--not Steny Hoyer, a Democrat--but \nVern Buchanan, a Republican:\n  ``All Members of Congress should take this virus seriously and put \naside partisanship-time is not on our side as the summer months draw \nnear.''\n  Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said in April:\n  Congress is ``going to have to explain to people why it is that we \nsat around for weeks and did nothing on something of this magnitude.''\n  That is Marco Rubio.\n  Let's work together to pass an emergency supplemental.\n  Steve Womack said this:\n  ``If we fail to deal with the issue and there are hardships that \nwould be posed on society in this country, you wouldn't be able to \ncompute those costs.'' ``It's a dice roll to get into an argument about \nZika funding and running the risk in having something catastrophic \nhappen and we own it.''\n  You will own it if this gets out of hand and we don't have the \nappropriate resources deployed now. It should have been 30 days ago, 60 \ndays ago, 90 days ago.\n  Let's not have this become a crisis. Let's act now on the full sum \nnecessary to meet this crisis.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Does the gentleman not realize, the request from the National \nInstitutes of Health for vaccine development, we put in $40 million and \nthe money transferred from the so-called Ebola fund; in this bill, \nthere is another $230 million just for vaccine development at NIH. That \nis every penny that they asked us for. So they are getting actually \nmore. They asked for $270 million, and we are delivering $270 million.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. \nYoung), a member of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. I thank Chairman Rogers for yielding, for his \nleadership, and for taking this seriously.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Zika Response \nAppropriations Act. There is no question the Zika crisis presents a \nserious threat to our Nation's public health and an immediate, \nimpactful response is required. The bill does such.\n  This important legislation provides funding immediately for the most \npressing needs, including care for infants and mothers, vaccine \ndevelopment, and efforts to control the spread of the disease.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: this is not the final word on the fight \nagainst Zika. The funding level we are discussing today quickly and \neffectively funds much-need efforts for the current fiscal year, 2016. \nIt is an immediate response, while making progress on regular order as \nwell. And we will fund fiscal year 2017 expenditures, so there will be \nmore.\n  As has already been said, this bill is fully offset by using leftover \nfunds to combat the Ebola outbreak and any unused administrative funds \nat the Department of Health and Humans Services.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  It is the responsible and thoughtful approach to an issue and mission \nwe all agree on, right, combating Zika?\n  Some have argued the bill should fully fund the President's request. \nThe fact that repurposed Ebola funds used to offset this bill remain \nunspent years later shows it is hard to predict how much it will cost \nto contain an outbreak, and where funds will be needed.\n  The House is acting quickly and responsibly, as we make repeated \nrequests of the administration to share a detailed plan. Repeatedly, we \nhave gotten incomplete responses. That is troubling.\n  The administration has no complete plan, but they want us to fund it. \nThat is simply the wrong approach.\n  Though we pass this bill today, work will continue tomorrow on fully \nfunding an effective and comprehensive plan to stop the Zika virus. We \nare doing this. As we gather the information, we need to move forward.\n  This bill responsibly and effectively provides the needed funding \nwhere the government is ready now to help those in need.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can argue about process in this Chamber all night, \nbut that will do nothing to help the women and children facing very \nreal health dangers caused by the Zika virus.\n  What will help them is passing this critical, targeted, and \nresponsible legislation now, which provides needed funding now, where \nit can actually be used.\n  Subcommittee Chairmen Cole and Granger, thank you for your leadership \non this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \narticulate gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking \nmember on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nEducation, and Related Agencies, who has been very clear on the need to \ncombat the Zika virus.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, this bill is woefully inadequate. The Zika \nvirus is a public health emergency. It is a crisis.\n  Last week, 1,204 confirmed cases in the United States and its \nterritories, over 100 of them pregnant women. One person has died.\n  Temperatures are rising already and reaching high levels in the \nUnited States in the areas where these mosquitoes thrive, and we are \ntold that this could spread to 30 States.\n  The Olympics are less than 80 days away in Brazil. We are going to \nsend our young men and women into harm's way.\n  The window for us to act on this effort is closing, and the \nmajority's Zika Response Appropriations Act is too little. It is too \nlate. It only provides a third of the President's request.\n  Without additional funding, the CDC will not be able to protect \npregnant women by better understanding the link between Zika and \nadverse health effects. They will not be able to control and mitigate \nmosquito populations before the epidemic spreads further.\n  They lose laboratory capacity, they lose the ability of surveillance \nas the outbreak is moving on.\n  The most immediate needs of State and local public health departments \nare woefully underfunded by the House Republican bill. Our States' and \nour municipalities' emergency funds have been slashed.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the list of all of the States in \nthis country and the loss of preparedness funds in order to be able to \ndeal with the crisis.\n\n\n[[Page H2797]]\n\n\n\n                                                               PHEP CUTS FROM ZIKA TRANSFER\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   Grantee                      Cuts (dollars)        Cuts (%)                  Grantee               Cuts (dollars)        Cuts (%)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama.....................................           -613,733              -6.90  Montana.......................           -139,375              -3.21\nAlaska......................................           -194,836              -4.63  N.

While the administration requested $743 million for \nCDC's public health activities, the House bill provides only $120 \nmillion, 84 percent below the request.\n  Who are we kidding?\n  This is going to put millions of pregnant women in danger. According \nto the CDC, pregnant women are already facing unacceptably long delays \nin learning Zika test results.\n  Physicians are advising women not to get pregnant. Pregnant women are \nscared to death about what is going to happen to the child that they \nare carrying. Director Tom Frieden has said that experts estimate a \nsingle child with birth defects can cost $10 million to care for.\n  We need to prevent this. And the amount of money that the majority \nhas talked about is inadequate to prevent it. If each child takes $10 \nmillion to care for, and we take a look at $622 million, we are going \nto look at our ability to take care of 62 children who might be \naffected with microcephaly. This says nothing about what the child's \nquality of life is, the delays in learning to speak, to walk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. It is a delay in learning to speak, walk, hear and eat. \nImagine.\n  But we can stop this crisis before it gets worse. We have to act now, \nand we have to fully fund the President's request. It is the \nresponsible thing to do. More importantly, it is the moral thing to do.\n  Months from now, when the results of our inaction become apparent, we \nwill ask ourselves, why did we delay? Why did we wait?\n  You know, I do not often quote Senator Marco Rubio, but yesterday he \nsaid this about the House bill, and I quote: ``Frankly, that's just not \ngoing to cut it. If we don't spend more than that on the front end, I \nthink we are going to spend a lot more later because the problem is not \ngoing to go away.''\n  I could not agree more. We need to act now. That is our \nresponsibility.\n  The President's request was in February. It is now almost the end of \nMay. People are suffering, and we have the power in this body to stop \nthat.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Joyce), a member of our committee.\n  Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5243, the \nZika Response Appropriations Act of 2016. I would like to acknowledge \nthe thoughtful leadership of Chairman Rogers on this matter.\n  The bill provides $622.1 million for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, the State Department, and USAID, to fight and prevent \nthe spread of the Zika virus. This funding will be available \nimmediately. This funding is for this fiscal year only, available \nSeptember 30, 2016. This funding is entirely offset.\n  Finally, the bill contains strong oversight measures to ensure \nresponsible and effective use of taxpayer dollars. The resources \nprovided in the bill are in addition to the $589 million the Obama \nadministration has already identified to repurpose to fight Zika. In \nother words, $1.2 billion will be in place to combat the virus.\n  Please stand with me today in support of H.R. 5243.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York has 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from New \nYork and let me thank the chairman of the full committee, and let me \nthank the health scientists and doctors who have given us the real \nstory of this case.\n  Mr. Speaker, the first Ebola case was in Texas, the first case in the \nUnited States. And the CDC says that we have not extinguished or \neliminated Ebola.\n  The proposal today is not $1.2 billion. It is $600 million because \nyou have taken $600 million or so out of the Ebola. And the doctors \nindicate that there are about 8 clusters or more of Ebola in Africa, \nwhere 85 CDC personnel are there. And if one case breaks out, we will \nneed 1,000 personnel to deal with it.\n  So what are we doing with the Zika funding if we are not providing \nthe Centers for Disease Control what they need, $10 million to care for \na child?\n  They do not have the tools in order to do it. They cannot. People \ncarrying the Zika virus do not know that they have the Zika virus and, \nas well, they have asked for $800 million, which you are not giving to \nthem.\n  This is the epicenter of the potential of the Zika virus in the \nUnited States.\n  The idea that there is sitting water in places like the Gulf region, \nthe idea that people travel, and the person who is traveling has a \nmosquito that bites them, and then they--that mosquito can transmit it.\n  Here are the mosquito cesspools in Houston, Texas.\n  So today I stand in opposition to the underlying proposal. We need \nthe $1.9 billion that the administration has asked for. We cannot rob \nfrom Peter to pay Paul.\n  If you listen to the diagnosis, or you listen to the assessment, the \ndoctors are saying that the Zika virus invades\n\n[[Page H2798]]\n\nthe brain of the baby and destroys that brain and, therefore, we do not \nknow the long-term effects of a woman or of those who have not yet been \nassessed of the Zika virus.\n  This is the wrong way to go. Vote against this bill. Give what the \nPresident wants and the CDC wants now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 5243, the ``Zika \nResponse Appropriations Act of 2016,'' because this appropriations \nmeasure falls short of what is needed to aggressively address the \nenormity of the Zika Virus threat to the Americas and the United \nStates, with particular concern for Puerto Rico.\n  I thank President Obama for his leadership in requesting $1.9 billion \nto address the threat of the Zika Virus, and facing congressional delay \nhe took funds from Ebola response to prepare the nation to face the \nZika Virus threat.\n  Let us not forget--Ebola was on our doorstep last year before \nCongress acted and there are still Ebola hot spots that are occurring, \nwhich have to be addressed, but we now lack the resources to deal with \nthat ever present threat.\n  I am committed to doing everything I can to address the threat of \nZika Virus, but I am not supportive of tricks or misguided strategies \nto get legislation to the House floor in the name of Zika prevention \nthat will do too little; and funding that will abruptly end on \nSeptember 30, 2016.\n  As the founder and Chair of the Children's Caucus and a senior member \nof the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am acutely aware of how \ndangerous the Zika Virus is to women who may be pregnant or may become \npregnant should they be exposed to the Caribbean.\n  Houston, Texas, like many cities, towns, and parishes along the Gulf \nCoast, has a tropical climate hospitable to mosquitoes that carry the \nZika Virus like parts of Central and South America, as well as the \nCaribbean.\n  For this reason, I am sympathetic to those members who have districts \nalong the Gulf Coast.\n  These Gulf Coast areas, which include Houston, the third largest city \nin the nation, are known to have both types of the Zika Virus carrying \nmosquitoes: the Aedes Aegypti the Asian Tiger Mosquito; which is why I \nheld a meeting in Houston on March 10, 2016 about this evolving health \nthreat.\n  I convened this meeting with Houston, Harris County and State \nofficials at every level of responsibility to combat the Zika Virus and \nto discuss preparations that would mitigate its.\n  The participants included Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National \nSchool of Tropical Medicine and Professor of Pediatrics at Baylor \nCollege of Medicine and Dr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County \nPublic Health Environmental Services Mosquito Control Division who gave \nstrong input on the critical need to address the threat on a multi-\npronged approach.\n  The potential for the Zika Virus outbreaks in the United States if we \ndo not act is real, and the people on the front lines are state and \nlocal governments who must prepare for mosquito season, establish \ncommunity oriented education campaigns, provide Zika Virus prevent \nresources to women who live in areas where poverty is present, and \nenvironmental remediation of mosquito breeding near where people live.\n  The assumption that everyone has air conditioning; window and door \nscreens that are in good repair or present at all; does not take into \nconsideration the pockets of poverty that are present in every major \ncity including many towns, counties, parishes, and cities along the \nGulf Coast.\n  The 18th Congressional District of Texas, which I represent, has a \ntropical climate and is very likely to confront the challenge of Zika \nVirus carrying mosquitoes before mosquito season ends in the fall.\n  Mr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County Public Health \nEnvironmental Services Mosquito Control Division stressed that we \ncannot spray our way out of the Zika Virus threat.\n  He was particularly cautious about the over use of spraying because \nof its collateral threat to the environment and people.\n  We should not forget that Flint, Michigan was an example of short-\nsighted thinking on the part of government decision makers, which \nresulted in the contamination of that city's water supply.\n  The participants in the meeting I held in Houston represented the \nsenior persons at every state and local agency with responsibility for \nZika Virus response.\n  The expert view of those present was that we need a unity of effort \nplan to address the Zika Virus in the Houston and Harris County area \nthat will include every aspect of the community.\n  The collective wisdom of these experts revealed that we should not \nlet the fear of the Zika Virus control public policy.\n  Instead we should get in front of the problem then we can control the \nZika Virus from its source--targeting mosquito breeding environments.\n  The real fight against the Zika Virus will be fought neighborhood by \nneighborhood and will rely upon the resources and expertise of local \ngovernment working closely with State governments supported by federal \ngovernment agencies.\n  The consensus of Texas, Houston, and Harris County experts is that we \nmake significant strides to stay ahead of the arrival of mosquito \ntransmission of Zika Virus if we act now.\n  The CDC said that for the period January 1, 2015 to May 11, 2016, the \nnumber of cases are as follows:\n\n\n                           the united states\n\n  Travel-associated cases reported: 503\n  Locally acquired through mosquito bites reported: 0\n  Total: 503\n  Pregnant: 48\n  Sexually transmitted: 10\n  Guillain-Barre syndrome: 1\n\n\n                             us territories\n\n  Travel-associated cases reported: 3\n  Mosquito acquired cases reported: 698\n  Total: 701\n  Pregnant: 65\n  Guillain-Barre syndrome: 5\n  There are 49 countries and territories in our hemisphere where \nmosquito borne transmission of the Zika Virus is the primary way the \nvirus is spread include:\n  American Samoa; Aruba; Belize; Barbados; Bolivia; Brazil; Bonaire; \nCape Verde; Central America; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Curacao; \nDominica; Dominican Republic; El Salvador; Ecuador; Fiji; French \nGuiana; Grenada; the Grenadines; Guatemala; Guadeloupe; Haiti; \nHonduras; Islands Guyana; Jamaica; Martinique; Kosrae (Federated States \nof Micronesia); Marshall Islands; Mexico; Nicaragua; New Caledonia; the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, Panama; Papua New Guinea, Paraguay; Peru; \nSamoa, a US territory; Saint Barthelemy; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; \nSaint Vincent; Saint Maarten; Suriname; Tonga; Trinidad and Tobago; US \nVirgin Islands, Venezuela and particular note is made by the CDC by \nlisting the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio 2016) separately.\n  As of May 11, 2016, there were more than 1,200 confirmed Zika cases \nin the continental United States and U.S. Territories, including over \n110 pregnant women with confirmed cases of the Zika virus.\n  The Zika virus is spreading in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, \nAmerican Samoa and abroad, and there will likely be mosquito-borne \ntransmission within the continental United States in the coming summer \nmonths.\n  The most important approach to control the spread of Zika Virus is \npoverty and the conditions that may exist in poor communities can be of \ngreatest risk for the Zika Virus breeding habitats for vector \nmosquitoes.\n  The spread of disease is opportunistic--Zika Virus is an \nopportunistic disease that is spread by 2 mosquitoes out of the 57 \nverities.\n  We should be planning to fight those 2 mosquitoes in a multi-pronged \nway with every resource we can bring to the battle.\n\n\n                      sources of zika virus spread\n\n  Poverty is where the mosquito will find places to breed in great \nnumbers, but these mosquitoes will not be limited to low income areas \nnor does the disease does not care how much someone earns.\n  The Aedes Aegypti or Yellow Fever mosquito has evolved to feed on \npeople for the blood needed to lay its eggs.\n  This mosquito can breed in as little as a cap of dirty water; it will \nbreed in aquariums in homes; pant water catching dishes; the well of \ndiscarded tires; puddles or pools of water; ditches; and children's \nwading pools;\n  Although water may evaporate mosquito eggs will remain viable and \nwhen it rains again or water is placed where they are the process for \nmosquitos development resumes.\n  Our enemies are those who illegal dump tires; open ditches, torn \nscreens, or no screens; tropical climates that create heat and humidity \nthat force people without air conditioning to open windows or face heat \nexhaustion.\n\n\n                   the battle against the zika virus\n\n  It might be hard for people who do not live in the tropical climates \nalong the Gulf Coast to understand what a heat index is--it is a \ncombination of temperature and humidity, which can mean that \ntemperatures in summer are over 100 degrees.\n  Zika Virus Prevention Kits like those being distributed in Puerto \nRico, which are vital to the effort there to protect women, will be \nessential to the fight against Zika Virus along the Gulf Coast.\n  These kits should include mosquito nets for beds.\n  Bed nets have proven to be essential in the battle to reduce malaria \nby providing protection and reducing the ability of biting insects to \ncome in contact with people.\n  Mosquito netting has fine holes that are big enough to allow breezes \nto easily pass through, but small enough to keep mosquitoes and other \nbiting insects out.\n\n[[Page H2799]]\n\n  The kits should also include DEET mosquito replant products that can \nbe sprayed on clothing to protect against mosquito bites.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should be preparing aggressively so that this nation \ndoes not have a reoccurrence of what happened during the Ebola crisis--\nwhen the Federal government seemed unprepared because this Congress was \nunmoved by the science, until domestic transmission of the disease were \nrecorded.\n\n\n                   what we know about the zika virus\n\n  The Zika Virus is a neurogenic virus that can attack the brain tissue \nof children in their mother's womb.\n  The Zika Virus will be difficult to detect and track in all cases \nbecause 4 in 5 people who get the disease will have no symptoms.\n  We know that 33 states have one or both of the vector mosquitoes.\n  Dr. Peter Hotez said that we can anticipate that the Americas \nincluding the United States can expect 4 million the Zika Virus cases \nin the next four months and to date there are over a million cases in \nBrazil.\n  The virus has been transmitted through sexual contact.\n  We know that evidence of the Zika Virus in newborns in the United \nStates may not become apparent until we are in the late fall or winter \nof next year.\n  The most serious outcome the Zika Virus exposure is birth defects \nthat can occur during pregnancy if the mother is exposed to the Zika \nVirus.\n  Infections of pregnant women can result in:\n  Still births;\n  The rate of Microcephaly based on Zika Virus exposure far exceeds \nthat number.\n  Microcephaly is brain underdevelopment either at birth or the brain \nfailing to develop properly after birth, which can cause:\n  Difficulty walking;\n  Difficulty hearing; and\n  Difficulty with speech.\n\n\n                          what we do not know\n\n  Researchers and scientists at the CDC; NIH and HHS do not know how \nthe disease attacks the nervous system of developing babies.\n  They cannot answer what the long term health prospects are for \nchildren born with such a severe brain birth defect.\n  They have not discovered the right vaccine to fight the disease--\nwhich requires care to be sure that it is safe and effective especially \nin pregnant women or women who may become pregnant.\n  They do not know what plan will work and to what degree if any a \ntight network of mosquito control established in areas most likely to \nhave the Zika Virus carrying mosquitoes will work as well.\n  How the Zika Virus may evolve over time and what they may mean for \nhuman health.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 5243, and support the President's \nrequest for $1.9 billion to fight the Zika Virus threat.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris), a member of our committee and a \nmedical physician.\n  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentlewoman from Texas. We \nshould be thankful for the scientists we have, whether it is at the \nCDC, whether it is at the NIH, those public health officials who are \ngoing to make sure that the mosquito control occurs that is necessary, \nto those who are at BARDA and other agencies where we develop the \nvaccines that are necessary, and do the necessary research.\n  This House bill, in distinction to the President's request, is \ntargeted and well thought out. This bill deals just with Zika. The \nPresident's request didn't. It dealt with whatever other infectious \ndisease comes down the road. Yet, Zika is what is in front of us now.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is going to take 2 to 3 years to complete the \nnecessary research and to complete the vaccine development and bring it \nto market.\n  This bill deals with the needs over the next 6 months. The \nadministration requested a total of about $1.6 billion in research, \nbecause there is about $300 million that has nothing to do, really, \nwith researching and curing Zika. So it is $1.6 billion over 3 years.\n  The House took the position we actually need to front-load that. We \nneed to deal with this fiscal year, so we put together a package of \n$1.2 billion to be spent over the next 6 months to make sure that we \nstart the necessary research, we start the vaccine development, and \ndeal with those outyears through the normal appropriations process \nwhich is going to take place over the next 2 years.\n  So our approach is actually a much more valid approach, targeted, \nwell thought out, will provide all the necessary funds to the CDC, NIH, \nfor the vaccine development and the mosquito control over the next 6 \nmonths, when we need it most, and then add additional funds as \nnecessary, as science learns more about what we need.\n  We can't possibly know what we need now. The administration put a \nrequest without possibly knowing what we need 2 or 3 years in the \nfuture. We will find out what we need and we will add those.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the right approach. This is actually more money \nup front than the administration has asked for, which is exactly the \ncorrect approach to deal with this imminent threat to the health of \nU.S. citizens here and in Puerto Rico.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, as an emergency medicine physician and a \npublic health expert myself, I rise today to strongly oppose this \ninadequate Zika funding bill, and to urge my colleagues to fully fund \nour Nation's efforts to fight the Zika virus.\n  In the emergency department, you don't just partially treat a \npatient. This is called negligence. You don't just take out a third of \nthe cancer. You don't just give a third of the antibiotic dose for a \nsevere pneumonia.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is less than a third of what is needed to \ntreat and protect women and their children from the Zika virus. It is \nless than a third of the prescription from the CDC and the experts \nneeded to protect American families from Zika.\n  Tomorrow I am voting ``no'' because I demand that we fully fund \nefforts to protect families, pregnant women and their children from \nZika.\n  Mr. Speaker, time is past due for you to do your job and address the \nZika virus threat. We must completely fund efforts to protect American \nfamilies from Zika. The American people deserve no less.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Florida (Ms. Graham).\n  Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, more than 120 Members and every Democrat of \nthe Florida delegation have asked for a vote on fully funding the fight \nagainst Zika.\n  In Florida, we have had more than 100 recorded cases of Zika. There \nis no doubt we are in the midst of a public health emergency. There are \npregnant women who are afraid to go out at night. As a mom myself, I am \nworried about my own daughter and her future. Our State's tourism \nindustry counts on thousands and thousands of people traveling to \nFlorida. Those provide thousands of jobs, and millions of dollars flow \ninto our economy. All of that is at risk.\n  We can't wait, and we shouldn't be forced to fight this virus with \none hand tied behind our back.\n  Scientists and our public health officials have asked for $1.9 \nbillion. We should stop playing games, Mr. Speaker, and fulfill the \nrequest.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I would like to repeat again, as a Member who has been in this House \nand has had the privilege of being part of many responses to \nemergencies, this is an emergency.\n  In last year's omnibus, Congress used emergency funding without \noffsets to pay for wildland fire suppression mostly in the West. \nCongress provided emergency funding to respond to two hurricanes and \nflooding in the Carolinas and Texas, again without offsets.\n  When those disasters struck, my colleagues, we didn't steal money \nfrom prior disaster response like the emergency funding provided for \nhurricane damage in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, \nstorms in West Virginia, and tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kentucky. We \npaid for those emergencies. We did not steal from any other account, my \ncolleagues.\n  In fact, after the 2013 Oklahoma tornadoes, my friend, Chairman \nRogers, told reporters: ``I don't think disasters of this type should \nbe offset. We have an obligation to help these people.''\n  So, my friends, I just want to emphasize again, we have a crisis. We \nhave\n\n[[Page H2800]]\n\npeople suffering. The potential is enormous. These are Americans. These \nare citizens. Whether it is here or in Puerto Rico, we have a \nresponsibility to respond.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, for those who are concerned that this is not an adequate \namount of money at the right time, let me just say this. The money that \nthe President requested of us, the $1.9 billion, was for the balance of \nthis year and all of next year--17\\1/2\\ months, $1.9 billion.\n  In this bill, plus what we earlier forced them to put into these \nmatters, almost $600 million, that $600 million, this $622 million is \njust for 4\\1/2\\ months, from now until the end of the fiscal year. I \nsay that is more than adequate. If there is more needed, when the \nregular appropriations bills come up for fiscal year 2017, you heard \nChairman Cole and Chairman Granger say we will put in the hopper \nwhatever is needed at that time. So this is wholly adequate. It is more \nthan adequate in terms of money.\n  Now, for those who are concerned about whether or not we are taking \ntoo much money away from Ebola, in the first place, that fund is not \njust for Ebola. When it was created 2 years ago, it was for Ebola and \nother infectious diseases. That is what we are dealing with here. We \nare asking the administration to use that money. This is an infectious \ndisease. You have got over $2 billion laying there unused left over \nfrom what was not spent in eradicating Ebola.\n  By the way, the World Health Organization now says that Ebola is no \nlonger an international emergency.\n  So the money in the so-called Ebola--I call it the infectious disease \naccount--that money is available and needs to be spent now. That is \nwhat we told the President shortly after he said he was going to send \nus a supplemental request. We said to use the money you have.\n  Finally, they did spend $589 million of that. Now we are adding to \nthat with some $622 million. So there is plenty of money there. There \nis plenty of money left in the till of the infectious disease account \nif it is needed for Ebola or anything else. There is upwards of $2 \nbillion laying there unused.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at \nthe desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I am opposed to the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Castor of Florida moves to recommit H.R. 5243 to the \n     Committee on Appropriations and Committee on the Budget with \n     instructions to report the same to the House forthwith with \n     the following amendment:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                      FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses'', \n     $10,000,000, to remain available until expended, to prevent, \n     prepare for, and respond to Zika virus, other vector-borne \n     diseases, or other infectious diseases and related health \n     outcomes, domestically and internationally, and to develop \n     necessary medical countermeasures and vaccines, including the \n     review, regulation, and post market surveillance of vaccines \n     and therapies, and administrative activities: Provided, That \n     such amount is designated by the Congress as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, \n     except that such amounts shall be available only if the \n     President subsequently so designates such amounts and \n     transmits such designation to the Congress.\n\n               CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION\n\n                CDC-WIDE ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAM SUPPORT\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For an additional amount for ``CDC-Wide Activities and \n     Program Support'', $743,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended, to prevent, prepare for, and respond to Zika virus, \n     other vector-borne diseases, or other infectious diseases and \n     related health outcomes, domestically and internationally;

Mr. Speaker, I ask \nunanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order on \nthe gentlewoman's motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized \nfor 5 minutes in support of her motion.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker and Members, this is the final \namendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to \ncommittee. We don't have time for that. If it is adopted, the bill will \nimmediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, America has a public health emergency at its doorstep, \nand it requires a robust and urgent response. Yet the Republican bill \nutterly fails to deal with the emergency posed by the rapidly spreading \nZika virus, and it leaves our neighbors and our communities at risk.\n  So the amendment I am offering today provides the resources requested \nby our public health experts and researchers to combat Zika, the $1.9 \nbillion to help prevent, detect, and respond to Zika in contrast to the \npaltry $622 million in the Republican bill.\n  I would like to thank Mrs. Lowey, Ms. DeLauro, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, \nMs. Graham, Mr. Ruiz, and everyone. I would like to thank the March of \nDimes, which is advocating for full funding, the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of \nPediatrics. Why? Microcephaly. Microcephaly is a severe brain \nabnormality that is now linked to the Zika virus, as are other \nanomalies where brain and skull development are affected.\n  We are talking about a lifetime of seizures and developmental delays, \nsuch as problems sitting, standing, walking, seeing, hearing, and \nfeeding problems. Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment for the \nZika infection.\n  Brazil has reported the highest incidence of microcephaly, with over \n4,000 suspected cases tied to Zika.\n  Microcephaly has also been detected among women who contracted Zika \nin Colombia, Panama, and U.S. territories. In fact, in the U.S. and \nU.S. territories alone, we have 1,200 cases. Thirty-two of these are \npregnant women, two cases of microcephaly. The Florida Department of \nHealth says we have 120 Floridians diagnosed with Zika, including \npregnant women.\n  Because there is no cure for the Zika virus, Congress must act to do \neverything we can to prevent it. We need the diagnostic tests, we need \nthe vaccines, we need research, and we need tools for our communities \nback home. We have got to educate our neighbors.\n  This Republican bill is woefully inadequate. It puts our neighbors \nback home at risk and could subject us to huge economic risks as well.\n  Let's get specific. The GOP's Zika bill provides less than one-third \nof the funds requested by public health experts. I heard the Republican \nappropriators say they intend to do more next year. The mosquitos don't \nknow that, do they? The mosquitos are not going to wait until next \nyear.\n  That is unconscionable. It is unconscionable that such underfunding \ndoes\n\n[[Page H2803]]\n\nnot allow the development of vaccines, the diagnostics, and the \nresearch in birth defects. The most immediate needs are woefully \nunderfunded in the Republican bill.\n  The CDC requested $740 million for public health activities like \nmosquito control. The House bill provides $120 million, 84 percent \nbelow the request. That means the CDC is not going to have adequate \nfunding to assist our local communities. The House bill cuts the \nrequest by the National Institutes of Health for research and \ndevelopment of vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics by $132 million, \nor 28 percent.\n  The House bill completely neglects immediate needs of American \ncitizens in Puerto Rico. The administration asked for $256 million. \nWhat does the Republican bill provide? Zero. Furthermore, the State \nDepartment and USAID will only get $119 million.\n  Now, if we learned anything from Ebola, it is that addressing the \nhealth threat overseas can be extremely effective, but you give it \nshort shrift here.\n  Colleagues, this is a public health emergency, but it is not the only \none. It is not the first one, and it will not be the last. It requires \na serious, thoughtful response, one with adequate funding, not a feeble \nattempt to demonstrate you are trying to do something.\n  Now, not only will the GOP obstruction likely prove dire to the \nhealth of our neighbors, but there is going to be a huge economic \nimpact as well. Currently, pregnant women and men who hope to have a \nbaby are advised by CDC to avoid traveling to Brazil and other areas. \nWhat if there is a similar traveling advisory for the State of Florida, \nthe Texas coast, New Orleans, Charleston, and Mobile, Alabama, all \ncommunities that rely on the tourism dollar, from small businesses to \nlarge? So you are asking not only for a public health emergency, but \nfor an economic emergency as well.\n  Members, this call to action requires actual action. This call to \naction was made months ago. Your answer needs to be equal to our \nchallenge. Please pass my amendment so that we can fully fund the Zika \nresponse. Don't give the short shrift Republican bill a hearing. Vote \n``no'' on the bill vote and ``yes'' on the MTR.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I insist on my point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I raise a point of order against \nthe motion because the proposed amendment contains an emergency \ndesignation which constitutes a change to existing law within the \nmeaning of clause 2 of rule XXI. Accordingly, it violates the \nlongstanding prohibition on legislating on a general appropriations \nmeasure, and I must insist upon my point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on \nthe point of order?\n  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky makes a point of order that the \ninstructions in the motion to recommit contain legislation in violation \nof clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The instructions, in pertinent part, designate certain appropriated \nfunds as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n  The Chair has ruled on numerous occasions, as recorded in section \n1052 of the House Rules and Manual, that a proposal to designate an \nappropriation as an ``emergency requirement'' within the meaning of the \nbudget-enforcement laws is fundamentally legislative in character.\n  On these premises, the Chair holds that the instructions contained in \nthe motion to recommit offered by the gentlewoman from Florida, by \nincluding a proposal to designate an appropriation as an ``emergency \nrequirement'' within the meaning of the budget-enforcement laws, \nconstitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained. The motion is not in order.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is: Shall the decision of the \nChair stand as the judgment of the House?\n\n\n                            Motion to Table\n\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I move to table the appeal of \nthe ruling of the Chair.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on the motion to table will be followed by a 5-minute vote \non passage of the bill, if arising without further proceedings in \nrecommittal.\n

There is 1 minute remaining.\n\n                              {time}  2139\n\n  So the amendment was rejected.\n  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.\n  The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule \nthe Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Acting \nChair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, \nreported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill \n(H.R. 4909) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense and for military \nconstruction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal \nyear, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 735, he \nreported the bill, as amended by House Resolution 732, back to the \nHouse with sundry further amendments adopted in the Committee of the \nWhole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from \nthe Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. CLYBURN. I am opposed in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Clyburn moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4909 to the \n     Committee on Armed Services with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith, with the following \n     amendments:\n        In section 567 (relating to a prohibition on the \n     establishment, maintenance, or support of Senior Reserve \n     Officers' Training Corps units at educational institutions \n     that display the Confederate battle flag), strike subsection \n     (c) (which provides an exception to such prohibition).\n       Strike section 1094.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  This amendment would fight discrimination in the military, which\n\n[[Page H2810]]\n\nerodes obedience, unity, commitment, and esprit de corps. The Supreme \nCourt highlighted these four essential attributes in explaining the \nmilitary deference doctrine, under which this amendment is \nconstitutionally sound.\n  The first section of the amendment would prohibit senior ROTC \nprograms in any institution that displays the Confederate battle flag. \nThis objectionable banner, which has never been the official flag of \nthe Confederacy, is a symbol of hate, racial oppression, resistance to \nthe rule of law, and White supremacy.\n  Any doubt as to this flag's meaning was erased by the perpetrator of \nlast summer's horrific shootings at Emanuel AME Church. Regrettably, \nthe Confederate battle flag still flies at the Citadel, just 2 miles \naway from Mother Emanuel. I happen to disagree with the Citadel's board \nmembers' belief that they are barred from removing the flag until the \nSouth Carolina State Legislature acts to revise or repeal the so-called \nHeritage Act. But it is clear that this hateful symbol will not be \nremoved until pressure is brought to bear on those with the authority \nto remove it.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  In recent days, Citadel alumni have reached out to me to express \ntheir support for this effort. One of these alumni, Dr. Larry Ferguson, \nwas a member of The Citadel class of 1973, the first class with more \nthan one African American. Dr. Ferguson desegregated the band, but was \nsubsequently kicked out of the band for refusing to wave the \nConfederate battle flag and play the song ``Dixie'' at sporting events.\n  I received another letter from a group of 17 alumni. They write that \nthe Confederate battle flag ``is representative of an ideology of hate \nand privilege, and is an abuse of power that still persists in the life \nof the school and in the State's halls of power and influence.\n  ``The fact that, in 2016, the Confederate Naval Jack flag hangs in a \npublic place of worship, on the campus of a public college, and is \nprotected by an unjust law is clear evidence of this reality.''\n  These letters make abundantly clear how the glorification of such an \nodious symbol at a military college undermines obedience, unity, \ncommitment, and esprit de corps in our future military officers.\n  I will include in the Record both letters, and I urge my colleagues \nto heed the voice of these Citadel alumni so that no more cadets will \nhave to struggle in the shadow of this oppressive banner.\n\n                                                     May 16, 2016.\n       Dear Congressman James Clyburn, I am writing to inform you \n     of my support of your efforts to limit ROTC funding to The \n     Citadel because of the displaying of the Confederate flag in \n     the Summerall Chapel.\n       I am Dr. Larry J Ferguson a 1973 African-American graduate \n     of The Citadel. When I entered The Citadel in the summer of \n     1969 our class was the fourth year of desegregation at The \n     Citadel. But the class of 1973 is the first class that had \n     more than one African-American in it. Nine of us entered The \n     Citadel in 1969 and six of us graduated in 1973. I was the \n     first African-American to desegregate The Citadel's \n     Regimental Band Company. In 1970 as a young 18 year old \n     sophomore I informed the administration that I would not play \n     the song ``Dixie'' or participate in the celebratory waving \n     of the Confederate flag at our sporting events. I was \n     subsequently removed from the band and the administration \n     threatened to take away my academic scholarship despite my \n     having good grades. Thanks to my parents and attorney Daniel \n     Martin, Sr. they successfully argued for me to keep my \n     scholarship. Thanks also to Maj Clarence Richardson U.S. Army \n     (Ret), I was able to transfer to C Co. where he was the \n     tactical officer. I had a bitter/sweet 4 years at The \n     Citadel. There were a few of my white class mates who went \n     against the grain and let me know that I could count on them \n     to be my friend. But the overwhelming tension always present \n     around me was that I was only tolerated at The Citadel \n     because of my race and because I stood up for racial justice.\n       One of the beginning ways to establish racial justice is to \n     repudiate all symbols of racial oppression. The majority of \n     African-Americans and many other people of various \n     ethnicities find the Confederate flag and the song ``Dixie'' \n     offensive because the flag and the song have long been \n     associated with hate groups. These hate groups used the \n     Confederate flag and the song ``Dixie'' as symbols directly \n     connected to their culture of terrorism and hatred for \n     African-Americans and for anyone who supported racial \n     integration.\n       These Confederate symbols cannot de divorced from the hate \n     groups that created a system of racial oppression and bigotry \n     in these United States of America and as such they should \n     only remain in places of historical reference--not public \n     platforms of adulation. Let us teach our future generations \n     that bigotry and racism are vigorously opposed in our society \n     and that symbols that are directly connected to bigotry and \n     racism are not to be celebrated in any form or fashion.\n       As a lifetime member of The Citadel Alumni Association and \n     as a past member of The Citadel Board of Visitors I want to \n     thank you Congressman Clyburn for addressing this issue. \n     Recent history teaches us that 50 years ago it took external \n     pressure to make The Citadel desegregate its Corps of Cadets. \n     This legislation will exert appropriate pressure on state \n     authorities so that the Confederate flag will be removed from \n     Summerall Chapel thus allowing everyone who enters to be able \n     to worship in dignity and solemnity.\n           Yours Truly,\n                                                 Larry J Ferguson,\n     DMD.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 16, 2016.\n     Congressman Jim Clyburn,\n     Assistant Democratic Leader, 6th Congressional District of \n         South Carolina, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Clyburn: Since 1939, the Confederate Flag, \n     a historic emblem of racial intolerance flown by pro-slavery \n     rebels both before and after the Civil War, is still \n     currently being displayed in The Citadel's Summerall Chapel. \n     The flag's presence in the most hallowed place on the entire \n     campus, where cadets gather to worship, is an assault on the \n     sensibilities of those who understand The Citadel's history, \n     but do not share the values the flag has come to represent.\n       As black alumni of The Citadel, we acknowledge the school's \n     efforts to remove this divisive symbol from our house of \n     worship. We agree that a museum is a more appropriate place \n     for the flag. Its current location in the school's chapel \n     stands as an affront to those of us whose ancestors suffered \n     racial violence, hatred, and bigotry under the shadow of that \n     flag and its ideology.\n       As you know, the school's administration continues to \n     suggest that it is constrained from removing the flag as a \n     consequence of the Heritage Act. As we have stated in \n     previous correspondence to the school, the Heritage Act is an \n     unjust piece of legislation. We further contend that the \n     Citadel's decision to ``follow the law'' (the Heritage Act) \n     is a tactic to delay the flag's removal from the Chapel; it \n     is an attempt to redirect responsibility for this matter to \n     the South Carolina House of Representatives, whose Speaker, \n     James Lucas, vowed to deny a vote on the issue. As a \n     consequence, we hold both the school and the legislature \n     equally responsible for the fact that the Confederate Flag \n     still flies in the Chapel on campus. Also, it is not lost on \n     us that the school's decision to ``follow the law'' (Heritage \n     Act) in this moment is a bit disingenuous, particularly since \n     the school, as a public institution, for years defied anti-\n     discrimination laws related to the admission of Black people \n     and women to the school. The Citadel cannot in one moment of \n     history defy the law in order to preserve white and male \n     privilege, while now representing itself as an abider of the \n     law (the Heritage Act) while the flag still hangs in \n     Summerall Chapel.\n       From the beginning of our fight to have the flag removed, \n     we suspected that the school and the state would fail to \n     muster the political will and moral courage to have the flag \n     immediately removed from the chapel. For this reason, we are \n     grateful and in solidarity with you and your colleagues in \n     the U.S. House of Representatives as you introduce measures \n     to withhold federal funding for Reserve Officer's Training \n     Corps programs from all colleges and universities displaying \n     the Confederate flag.\n       In closing, our position reaches far beyond the issue of \n     the Confederate flag. We believe that the school's ability to \n     fulfill its obligation to develop principled leaders and to \n     model the virtues of duty, honor, and respect are undermined \n     by the continued veneration of a relic from a tragic chapter \n     of America's history. For many of us, the flag is more than a \n     symbol; it is representative of an ideology of hate, \n     privilege and an abuse of power that still persists in the \n     life of the school and in the state's halls of power and \n     influence. The fact that in 2016 the Confederate Naval Jack \n     Flag hangs in a public space of worship, on the campus of a \n     public college, and is protected by an unjust law is clear \n     evidence of this reality. While we continue to work \n     energetically to have the flag removed immediately from the \n     chapel premises, we remain in support of your efforts to \n     address this at the federal level of government.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this matter. As graduates \n     of the school and allies in this fight, we stand firmly in \n     solidarity with you.\n           Sincerely,\n         Hillery Douglas '82; Fr. W. Reginald Simmons '87; James \n           Stevens '89; Garrick Benson '89; Johnny Orr '89; Ken \n           Williams '89; Anthony Terrell '89 C.

Make no mistake about it: a vote against this motion is \na vote to continue flying the Confederate battle flag and allow \ndiscrimination at a military college.\n\n[[Page H2811]]\n\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney), my \ngood friend.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have never voted against the defense bill, and I never \nthought I would.\n  My dad was a veteran who was nearly killed serving his country. He \ntaught me to respect those who serve and to speak plainly about right \nand wrong. So let me speak plainly now.\n  This bill writes antigay bias into Federal law. It strips LGBT \nAmericans of basic workplace protections by reversing the President's \nanti-discrimination orders, saying it is once again legal for your LGBT \nneighbors and family members to be fired because of who they are. This \nis wrong.\n  This is not about supporting our troops. It is not about fighting \nISIS. It is not about religious protections. We can do all that, and we \nshould. This is about bigotry, plain and simple.\n  But we can fix it by embracing the bipartisan effort, denied by the \nRules Committee, to remove this hateful language and keep everything \nelse.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not some procedural vote to be waived away; this \nis about whether we will reaffirm equal rights or rationalize \ndiscrimination.\n  When my husband and I got married, after waiting 22 years, so many of \nyou expressed your support. Will you now look me in the eye and say \nthat it would be okay for me to lose my job over it?\n  Just today, a Member of this House, refusing to help strike this \nantigay language, said to me: But you know where I am on your issues.\n  I said: No. This is where you are on my issues. Your vote is where \nyou are on my issues. And this is where your children and where history \nwill remember you are standing on our issues.\n  You have the opportunity here and now to strike this antigay language \nand, in doing so, strike a blow for equality.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are told that we are to make America great again. \nWell, you cannot make America great by making America hate.\n  Vote against discrimination. Vote for this motion to recommit.\n  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking the 63 \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee not only for all of their work \nin putting this bill together, but for the seriousness with which they \ntake our duties under the Constitution to help provide for the common \ndefense.\n  Our members don't always agree, but we are able to work our way \nthrough our differences most of the time and think about the larger \ncause. You might say we sacrifice some of our individual differences or \npreferences in order to support the men and women who sacrifice so much \nfor us.\n  I want to thank all the Members of the House. We have had a lot of \nMembers over the last 2 days who have come down to the floor and talked \nabout their amendments, and all of those amendments have helped make \nthis bill a better bill.\n  That is the way that, for 54 straight years, Congresses with \nmajorities of both parties and Presidents of both parties have signed \ninto law a defense authorization bill. Last year, it was a little iffy, \nbut that is the way it has happened.\n  I just want to suggest to our colleagues that it is especially \nimportant we do that this year. There is a lot of uncertainty out \nthere. Some of that uncertainty is because of President Obama. Part of \nthat uncertainty is because of us. Part of the uncertainty is because \nof the political campaign. Part of the uncertainty is because of the \nturmoil in the world.\n  My suggestion to you is that, with all this uncertainty going on out \nthere, it is particularly important this year that we send a message to \nfriends and adversaries that the United States is willing to stand up \nand defend ourselves. And it is even more important, I would suggest, \nthat we send a message to our troops that, whatever uncertainty is out \nthere, we are going to support them.\n  Mr. Speaker, to support our troops, we have to vote ``yes'' and pass \nthis bill.\n  Now, I realize that if one wants to oppose this bill, there are lots \nof reasons to do that. The bill takes the same budget approach as \nSpeaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Harry Reid used in 2008, the last \ntime we had a change of administration.\n  The bill includes a provision that reaffirms the protections of the \n1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. I \nreally hope if anybody has a question about that, come read the \namendment. I have got it here. Please read this provision so you can \njudge for yourself.\n  But before any Member votes ``no,'' I hope they ask themselves \nwhether they really want to send a message to our troops that, yes, \nthat Member would be supportive of the troops, if only; or, I would \nreally support the troops, but for; or, I would really support the \ntroops maybe when. I don't think that is the right way to go.\n  Let me just finish with a fact and a story. One fact is that today, \nof the 271 strike aircraft across the Marine Corps, 46 are available \nfor flight operations. That is 46 out of 271 are available today.\n  But let me make it personal for just a second. Over the past week, I \nhave encountered two marines. On Sunday, I was privileged to attend the \ncommissioning of a young man who is just entering the Marine Corps. He \nhopes to be a Marine aviator. He is full of promise and enthusiasm.\n  Earlier in the week, I learned that an experienced Marine aviator has \ndecided to leave the Marine Corps because he doesn't think the aircraft \nhe is flying are safe, and he has got two young kids at home.\n  Now, earlier in the debate, the ranking member said my philosophy in \nthis bill was to help the troops now and worry about other problems \nlater. Well, there is some truth in that. I want to help the troops \nnow. I worry about aviators who don't think their aircraft are safe \nnow.\n  I can't solve budget problems in the future. I don't know who is \ngoing to be elected President. I don't know what problems the world is \ngoing to face. I can do something now, and that is to vote for this \nbill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. CLYBURN.

Pursuant to House Resolution 736 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 4974.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  2209\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with Mr. \nCollins of Georgia in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent) and the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Bishop) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n                              {time}  2210\n\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Today, it is my honor and privilege to bring H.R. 4974, the fiscal \nyear 2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act to the House for consideration.\n  I present this bill alongside my very good friend and ranking member \nof the subcommittee, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), who has \nbeen an essential partner all along the way. I greatly appreciate the \nparticipation and support of our committee members on both sides of the \naisle as we considered priorities and funding levels for the important \nprograms in our bill.\n  We analyzed the budget request, developed questions, and held \noversight hearings to get direct feedback from members of all the \nservices, the Department of Defense leadership, the Secretary of the \nVA, and the VA inspector general. We received over 1,000 requests from \nMembers, again, from both sides of the aisle, and we gave them full and \nfair consideration.\n  The bill is also the product of actively listening to the concerns of \nour veterans and veteran advocates, servicemembers, spouses, \ncaregivers, military family members, and healthcare providers both \nwithin and outside the VA over the past year.\n  As we consider this bill, I can't proceed further without noting that \nthis subcommittee has a formidable level of support from the chair and \nranking member of the full committee. So I thank Chairman Rogers and \nthe ranking member, Mrs. Lowey. Their attention, oversight, and genuine \ncare for the military and veterans has been inspiring.\n  To round out the team, we have some great support from our \nprofessional staff: Maureen Holohan, Sue Quantius, Sarah Young, Tracey \nRussell, and Matt Washington on the committee staff; and Sean Snyder, \nDrew Kent, and Heather Smith on my personal staff. I would also like to \nnote Michael Reed and Michael Calcagni with Mr. Bishop of Georgia's \noffice. We couldn't do it without them.\n  I would also like to note the retirement of the senior member of our \nsubcommittee, Sam Farr. He has been on this subcommittee since 1999. In \nour full committee meeting, we went into detail about Sam's \naccomplishments on this subcommittee, including being the architect of \nthe Monterey model, which is now the benchmark for successful public-\nprivate partnership in a community with a base closure. Sam, wherever \nyou may be, your commitment, passion, and good humor will be missed. \nAll the best to you in your pending retirement.\n  H.R. 4974 demonstrates our firm commitment to fully supporting our \nNation's veterans and servicemembers. Our investment of $81.6 billion \nfor military construction, VA, and related agencies, $1.2 billion over \nlast year's level, is unprecedented. The bill addresses issues to help \nveterans in every part of the country--every congressional district--\nand our troops around the world.\n  This bill provides comprehensive support for servicemembers, military \nfamilies, and veterans. It supports our troops with the facilities and \nservices necessary to maintain readiness and morale at bases here in \nthe States and overseas. It provides for Defense Department schools and \nhealth clinics that take care of our military families.\n  The bill funds our veteran healthcare systems to ensure that our \npromise to care for those who sacrificed in defense of this great \nNation continues as those men and women return home. We owe this to our \nveterans and are committed to sustained oversight so that programs \ndeliver what they promise and taxpayers are well served by the \ninvestments we make.\n  On the military construction side, the bill provides a total of $7.9 \nbillion for military construction projects and family housing, \nincluding base and overseas contingency operations funding, OCO \nfunding--an increase of $250 million over the President's request.\n  This funding meets DOD's most critical needs, including priority \nprojects for combatant commanders and funding new mission requirements.\n  It provides $304 million for military medical facilities. It provides \n$246 million for Department of Defense educational facilities, for \nconstruction or renovation of four schools. It supports our Guard and \nReserve through $673 million for facilities in 21 States.\n  It includes $514 million for projects from the Department of \nDefense's unfunded priority list, benefiting the most critical \nprojects--as identified by the services--that were not included in the \nbudget request.\n\n[[Page H2814]]\n\n  It fully funds military family housing at $1.3 million. It provides \n$178 million for the NATO Security Investment Program, which is $43 \nmillion over last year's level, to deal with increasing threats and \nnecessary investments overseas.\n  On Veterans Affairs, this legislation includes a total of $176 \nbillion in combined discretionary and mandatory funding for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  Discretionary funding alone for Veterans programs in the bill is \n$73.5 billion. Total fiscal year 2017 discretionary funding is $2 \nbillion above fiscal year 2016, which is a 3 percent increase, and $1.5 \nbillion below the budget request. Within that total, VA medical care is \nprovided with $64 billion, a 5 percent increase over last year--again, \na 5 percent increase over last year for VA medical care.\n  Again, on VA medical services, the bill funds VA medical services at \n$52.5 billion. That includes $850 million that VA came back and asked \nfor this year, on top of the advanced funding provided last year.\n  Many Members expressed concerns about medical services, and we were \nable to fully fund the budget request for hepatitis C at $1.5 billion. \nWe are paying for treatments for so many of our veterans who are being \ncured from this horrible disease of hepatitis C. The drugs are very \nexpensive. They have come down in price a bit, and that has helped us \nserve more veterans.\n  Veterans homelessness is at $1.6 billion, long-term care at $8.6 \nbillion, caregiver stipends at $725 million, and Office of Inspector \nGeneral is at $160 million.\n  For disability claims, we provide the full request for the Veterans \nBenefits Administration, which is a $118 million increase over fiscal \nyear 2016, and the full budget request for the Board of Veterans \nAppeals, which is a $46 million increase.\n  The bill will enhance transparency and accountability at the VA \nthrough further oversight and an increase for the VA Office of \nInspector General's independent audits and investigations.\n  The legislation also contains $260 million for the modernization of \nthe VA electronic health record and includes restricting all of the \nfunding until the VA meets milestones and certifies interoperability to \nmeet statutory requirements.\n  Major construction, we continue to focus on major construction \noversight. The bill includes language that will hold back 100 percent \nof the funding for the largest construction projects until VA contracts \nfor outside Federal management, and we maintain strict restrictions on \ntransfers, use of bid savings, and scope changes.\n  The bill provides $528 million for major construction projects in \nReno, Nevada; Long Beach, California; as well as cemeteries in Florida, \nNew York, and Colorado.\n  We include bill language regarding improved standards for the suicide \nhotline and certification of mental health therapists to expand access \nfor veterans who need their care. I don't need to explain to anybody in \nthis body this great need here to help with the mental health needs of \nso many of our veterans.\n\n                              {time}  2220\n\n  VA performance awards. The bill prohibits all performance awards for \nVA senior executives. This was in response to multiple Member requests \nto restrict bonuses of various types at the VA. I understand this is \ncontroversial. But given the horrendous mismanagement that we have seen \nat many of the VA facilities across the country, we were compelled to \nsend a strong message about accountability. The prohibition we included \nhas passed as a floor amendment several years in a row, so that is why \nit is included in the base bill this year.\n  I will tell you that we have, obviously, many great and wonderful \nemployees at the VA who are doing their best every day to provide for \nour veterans, whether it is through benefits or through the health \nsystem or on their educational needs, so I wanted to make sure that we \nmake that point. But there is a need for some accountability, and that \nis why we had to insert this particular provision.\n  We have received some unfounded criticism from the administration for \nthe actions that we have taken. The administration may not be happy \nwith any change to its budget proposal. But this bill provides very \ngenerous funding that adheres to the law and our responsibility to \npractice fiscal responsibility.\n  Overall, with this bill and the funds that were provided in advance \nlast year, for fiscal year 2017, the VA will have available 98 percent \nof what it asked for--98 percent of what they asked for is provided. I \nwould wager that there won't be another Department in that enviable \nposition. This shows the level of commitment we have to our veterans \nand their families. I think that should be noted. So despite any \ncriticism, we should all be proud of this bill and what we have done in \nit.\n  Let me tell you, I can say with absolute certainty, the VA's problems \nstem from poor management and not too little money. We continue to push \nfor better management, and the Secretary has replaced most of the \nsenior managers at headquarters and in the field.\n  So many VA employees, as I mentioned earlier, are deeply committed--\noverwhelmingly, they are committed--to the veteran. They are talented, \nand they work very hard. I have met these folks, and I appreciate them \nvery much. I visit with them in eastern Pennsylvania on a regular basis \nand in south central Pennsylvania.\n  But the ``corrosive culture'' that has been cited at the VA remains \nthe root of VA's problem.\n  I want to briefly discuss the Choice Act or, as we call it, the \nVACAA, a little bit. I, and probably all of you, fully support the \nChoice Act, and want veterans to have access to quality health care at \na convenient location for them. Veterans want to be served. They want \nto be taken care of in the communities where they live. It is better \nfor the veteran. It is better for the family. And we want to make sure \nour veterans have access to some of the finest health care institutions \nin the world that may not be part of the VA system. We need to do that.\n  The Choice Act was so popular that it brought a lot of demand to the \nVA, and the VA has been spending both Choice Act funds and \ndiscretionary funds to meet the increased demand.\n  The Choice Act expires at the end of fiscal year 2017, and its \nfunding is being depleted sooner than that. Some of the Choice programs \nare already out of money, and others will be out of money halfway \nthrough the year.\n  For example, the Choice Act hires of medical professionals to cut the \nbacklog of appointments runs out of funds to pay those people halfway \nthrough the year. We--and when I say we, that is discretionary \nappropriations--are picking up a $600 million tab to pay them through \nthe end of fiscal year 2017. It is the right thing to do, but it is not \nsomething that we had planned for.\n  There will be unprecedented and massive demands on the discretionary \nside to continue programs started with a $15 billion surge of emergency \nfunding a few years ago through the VACAA. That is a huge issue for \nfiscal year 2018. Right now, it is incumbent on Congress to reform VA \nhealth care with a responsible plan that meets the needs of veterans in \na sustainable manner, and I hope that we can take that matter very \nseriously. It will be a huge issue next year, and it is an issue \nalready this year.\n  With respect to the related agencies, we fund the American Battle \nMonuments Commission, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, Arlington \nNational Cemetery, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans at the \nrequested funding levels, which total $241 million.\n  In closing, this is a very solid, bipartisan bill that is focused on \nthe needs of servicemembers, veterans, and, most especially, all their \nfamilies. We are $1.8 billion over the fiscal year 2016 level. That is \nmore than a 2 percent increase. We have provided for our military and \nveterans to the very best level we can in a manner that is fiscally \nresponsible and consistent with the budget agreement we enacted into \nlaw last year.\n  Did we fund every last dime requested? No. But not every idea has \nmerit, and not every project is mission critical. We did not fund some \nprojects, we cut some requested increases, and we rescinded funds. \nThese were fair decisions and part of our responsibility, as \nappropriators.\n  We will do a lot of good with this bill. It is fair. It is balanced. \nIt is generous.\n\n[[Page H2815]]\n\nAnd on behalf of our servicemembers, military families, and veterans, I \nurge support for this legislation. Let's take care of those who have \nsacrificed for our country.\n  Again, I would like to thank everybody for their help and support \nalong the way with this bill, both all of the Members and staff.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H2816]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH180516.003\n\n\n\n[[Page H2817]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH180516.004\n\n\n\n[[Page H2818]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH180516.005\n\n\n\n[[Page H2819]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH180516.006\n\n\n\n[[Page H2820]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH180516.007\n\n\n\n[[Page H2821]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would like to begin by thanking Mrs. Lowey and Mr. Rogers, who \nserve as the distinguished ranking member and chairman of the full \ncommittee, and, of course, Chairman Dent, my colleague, on the Military \nConstruction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. I \ncouldn't have a better, more collaborative partner in support of our \nmilitary and our veterans, and I really appreciate the collegiality.\n  And certainly I want to thank our staff. From the minority staff, I \nwould like to thank Matt Washington, as well as Mike Reed and Mike \nCalcagni from my personal office. From the majority committee staff, I \nwould like to thank Maureen Holohan, Sue Quantius, Sarah Young, Tracey \nRussell, and Sean Snyder from Chairman Dent's office.\n  As you all know, this bill has a strong history.\n  Before I begin, I really also want to share the comments and the \naccolades and salutations for our colleague from California, Sam Farr, \nwho is retiring from the committee; and this, of course, will be his \nlast MILCON/VA bill. He has been a longstanding member of this \ncommittee, very insightful, compassionate, and pragmatic. We are \ncertainly going to miss Sam with his valuable, valuable contributions.\n  I would like to point out that this bill has a strong history of \nfinding common ground and bipartisan support across the aisle to \nprovide resources for our men and women in uniform who have chosen to \nserve and to protect our great Nation's way of life and our individual \nfreedoms.\n  With this bill, we fund military construction projects in the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to the benefit of our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines, both past and present.\n  For those who have given so much of themselves, we owe a great deal. \nSo let me start our consideration of the Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill by recognizing those in our \nmilitary who cannot be with us here tonight as they serve across the \nglobe. Thank you for your service.\n  The account taking care of the construction of military facilities is \nprovided $7.7 billion, an increase of $250 million above the fiscal \nyear 2017 budget request. Overall, the Department of Veterans Affairs \nis funded at $73.5 billion, which is $2.5 billion above the FY16-\nenacted level, and $1.4 billion below the FY17 request.\n  I am pleased with several aspects of the bill. As we saw throughout \nthe markup process, the bill provides robust funding for our military \nconstruction and provides adequate funding for both active and reserve \nmilitary forces.\n  I was pleased that the bill provides $25 million above the FY17 \nbudget request to help speed up the cleanup of former Department of \nDefense sites.\n  For too long, we have been waiting for an end to the tunnel for the \nelectronic health records integration between the Department of Defense \nand the VA. To strengthen oversight on the issue, I am pleased to see \nthe bill maintains tough, but fair, reporting requirements for the \nelectronic health records endeavor. To better serve those veterans \nshortchanged for too long, the bill continues to prioritize the \nelimination of the VA's claims backlog and includes healthy funding for \nthe Board of Veterans' Appeals, though I am concerned with the proposed \nreforms to the BVA.\n\n                              {time}  2230\n\n  Nonetheless, I believe these are positive steps that are necessary to \nensure that the VA continues to improve its service for our veterans.\n  Mr. Chair, while the MILCON-VA bill has many positive attributes, one \nitem I am not particularly pleased about is the inclusion of bill \nlanguage that limits performance awards. As I have stated for the past \n3 years, this language will not provide a short-term solution and, in \nfact, may have long-term consequences, compounding the very problem \nthat it attempts to address. All this language will do is make the VA a \nless attractive option than other agencies when it comes to recruiting \nand retaining quality executive leaders, resulting in the Department's \nnot having the very talent that it needs to solve the problems it faces \ntoday. This is an issue that must be addressed as we move through this \nprocess.\n  Turning away from the bill for a second, our committee was off to a \nvery fast start. However, because of the budget resolution impasse, we \nhave had to wait a month for the MILCON-VA bill to be able to come to \nthe floor. As a result, we will not be able to get back to regular \norder this year, and with roughly 45 days left in the legislative \ncalendar, it will be nearly impossible to fulfill our obligation to the \nAmerican people and pass all 12 bills through the House. We are in this \nsituation because an upset, small minority of the House wants to \nrevisit issues that were already decided and acted upon by a bipartisan \nmajority of both Houses and signed into law by the President.\n  That being said, I applaud Chairman Rogers for honoring the \nallocation the bipartisan budget agreement set for fiscal year 2017. \nThe BBA will have to suffice until we can get past these unrealistic \nbeliefs that we can cut our way to prosperity.\n  As we are all aware of our level of discretionary resources this \nyear, it will be tough, especially tough for this subcommittee, because \nour bill advances funds to the medical services account. While we start \nout in the hole every year, the VA's annual second bite of the apple \nmakes balancing the needs of nonmedical VA services with other Federal \nagencies that much more difficult. As I have said numerous times, we \nmust be more strategic about how we handle our Federal budget.\n  Mr. Chair, would I have done some things differently? Of course, but \nhere we are.\n  Nevertheless, with reservations, I urge my colleagues to defeat any \npoison pill amendments and move to support this bill to fund the \nconstruction of military facilities and strive to improve the quality \nof life and the care afforded to current servicemembers, to our \nveterans, and to our military families.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the distinguished chairman of the \nfull committee.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I thank the chairman for yielding the time.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise tonight to support this first bill of the 2017 \nappropriations cycle. Shepherding through appropriations legislation is \nthe constitutional duty of the Congress, and so here we go.\n  The passage of these bills in a timely fashion is in the best \ninterest of the Nation. It will help provide for our national security, \nthe stability of our economy, and give certainty to all Americans who \ncount on the Federal Government's programs and services. I believe this \nbill, in particular, starts off this process on the right foot.\n  H.R. 4974 is a balanced, bipartisan piece of legislation that \nprovides critical funding for our troops, their families, and our \nveterans. We have made a commitment to our servicemen and -women that \nwe will care for them during and after their service, and this bill \nhelps fulfill that promise.\n  In total, as you have heard, the bill provides $81.6 billion in \ndiscretionary funding for the Department of Defense infrastructure and \nquality-of-life programs as well as for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. This represents a $1.8 billion increase above current levels. \nThis increase is directed to Veterans Affairs programs, which receive a \n3 percent bump above fiscal year 2016 levels.\n  Of the total $73.5 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n$52.5 billion will support the VA's medical services, which is funding \nthat will treat some 7 million patients this year. In particular, I \nwant to highlight funding increases that will address mental health \ncare, suicide prevention, hepatitis C treatment, and homelessness. The \nincrease will also help the VA tackle some of its greatest challenges--\nreducing the disability claims backlog and continuing the modernization \nof the electronic health records system to ensure no gaps in care occur \nas our current troops become veterans.\n  This bill also provides funding to support our Active Duty military \nand their families whether they are at home or abroad. Funding for \nhospitals, educational facilities, and housing tells our servicemembers \nthat they have the full backing of their government as they lay their \nlives on the lines for this\n\n[[Page H2822]]\n\nNation. Beyond these quality-of-life programs, military construction \nfunding is prioritized to respond to threats around the globe, \nincluding Russia, the Middle East, and North Africa.\n  While overall funding is increased in the bill, the committee took \nmany steps to ensure that every cent of taxpayers' money is spent \nresponsibly and with good purpose. We made difficult decisions to find \nsavings wherever possible. The bill also includes good-government \nprovisions that increase oversight for the VA, helping to stop waste \nand improve service for our veterans.\n  Mr. Chair, this is a very good bill, one I am proud to support. I \nwant to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Congressman Dent, for \nhis leadership. I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Bishop, and the \nrest of the subcommittee for their teamwork and their effort in \nbringing the bill to the floor today.\n  Lastly, I join the chair and ranking member in thanking the staff for \nthe many hours they put in helping to usher this bill to the floor \ntoday. Caring for our troops and veterans is a great responsibility, \nand the subcommittee and our staff have not taken that responsibility \nlightly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is balanced; it is \nresponsible; and it needs to be passed.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. I thank the distinguished ranking member of this \ncommittee, Mr. Sanford Bishop, for that very generous introduction.\n  I would like to thank my good friend on the other side of the aisle, \nChairman Dent from the neighboring State of Pennsylvania, for his good \nwork and the partnership that he has made to make this an excellent \nbill. I also want to thank Chairman Rogers for his leadership and, of \ncourse, for the hard work of the committee members on both sides of the \naisle who are so critical to this process.\n  Mr. Chair, the fiscal year 2017 Military Construction-Veterans \nAffairs bill would allocate $81.6 billion in discretionary funding--\n$1.2 billion less than the fiscal year 2017 budget request and a $1.8 \nbillion increase above the fiscal year 2016 enacted level--and allow \nfor several critical improvements, including: the further reduction of \nthe veterans' claims backlog, which has dropped from 600,000 to 74,000 \nin the past 2 years; $7.8 billion to support outreach, prevention, and \nawareness to reduce unacceptably high levels of suicide and other \nmental health challenges among our veterans; a greater focus on the \ngender-specific needs of female veterans, including prosthetics \ndesigned for women and enhancing access to both medical health \nservices; a $32 million increase for medical and prosthetic research; \n$1.3 billion for family housing construction; and strong oversight of \nthe electronic health records system, requiring that the VA meet key \nbenchmarks throughout the fiscal year and improve interoperability with \nthe Department of Defense.\n\n                              {time}  2240\n\n  Mr. Speaker, as I close, I want to again congratulate Chairman Dent \nand Ranking Member Bishop for you are truly outstanding in making this \na good, bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas \n(Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill. Over the past \nfew years, we have seen mismanagement, cost overruns, and project \ndelays at our Veterans Affairs facilities and hospitals across this \ncountry.\n  While the biggest construction failures are the ones that have \ngathered the headlines, such as the billion-dollar cost overrun in \nColorado, the VA has a knack for dropping the ball on simple and \nsmaller projects as well. One of these is an $8 million ongoing solar \npanel project at the VA Medical Center in Little Rock. It has been 3 \nyears since the planned activation of the system. However, engineering \nchanges and the relocation of the panels to make way for a new parking \ngarage, which was even known in advance of the award, has cost valuable \ntaxpayer resources.\n  Last year, I sent a letter, along with Senator John Boozman, to the \nVA Office of the Inspector General calling for an investigation into \nthis solar panel project, which resulted in the VA Inspector General \nconducting a national review of all the solar panel projects across the \nVA.\n  While this review is being finalized, many questions remain \nunanswered about these solar projects. Currently, the VA lists 34 key \nrenewable energy projects dating back to 2010 that remain \nnonoperational.\n  Today's bill contains an important provision in the report language \nthat will protect the taxpayer dollars by prohibiting funding for solar \nprojects at the VA due to these concerns about the mismanagement in \nthese projects.\n  I am pleased that the committee has included this essential language \nas we await the results from the VA Inspector General's investigation \ninto these costly projects.\n  This small piece is an important part of the overall reevaluation of \nthe VA's construction oversight and implementation that Congress has \ndeveloped and that taxpayers deserve.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  With reservations, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I think \nit is a bipartisan bill. It is a good bill. I think it is a good \nproduct for what we had to work with.\n  I would like to urge my colleagues to support it, to fund the \nconstruction of newer facilities, to strive to improve the quality of \nlife and the care that we give to our military, to our veterans, and to \nour military families.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to conclude by saying that I want to thank everyone \nagain for their full cooperation on both sides of the aisle: Mr. \nBishop, Mrs. Lowey, and the entire team on their side, and Mr. Rogers \non our side, and all the members of the subcommittee on both sides.\n  This bill does provide for our veterans, our military, our \nservicemembers, and their families. It is a very good bill. I urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  During consideration of the bill for amendment, each amendment shall \nbe debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the \nproponent and an opponent. No pro forma amendment shall be in order \nexcept that the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \nAppropriations or their respective designees may offer up to 10 pro \nforma amendments each at any point for the purpose of debate. The chair \nof the Committee of the Whole may accord priority in recognition on the \nbasis of whether the Member offering an amendment has caused it to be \nprinted in the portion of the Congressional Record designated for that \npurpose. Amendments so printed shall be considered read.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of

Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n       Page 4, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $801,000) (increased by $801,000)''.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentlewoman from \nMissouri and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Dent for letting me offer \nthis very important amendment. I thank my colleagues from the entire \nMissouri delegation--Mr. Clay, Mr. Cleaver, Mr. Graves, Ms. Hartzler, \nMr. Long, Mr. Luetkemeyer, and Mr. Smith--for their steadfast support \nand bipartisan cosponsorship.\n  This amendment is critical to meeting the current and future mission \nrequirements of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and its \nreplacement West headquarters in north St. Louis.\n  This amendment allocates $801,000 for land and transfer acquisition \nactivities associated with acquiring the land for the headquarters, \nconforming with the Senate's MILCON-VA bill.\n  After an exhaustive process, the NGA identified the north St. Louis \ncity site as a superior location because of its ability to provide the \nmost technological, academic, and professional environment for the \nagency to develop the capabilities and solutions necessary to solve the \ncountry's most vital intelligence and national security challenges.\n  Mr. Chair, the City of St. Louis is providing the land for this \nproject at no cost to the Federal Government. Its selection ensures \nthat NGA West's 70-year history in St. Louis continues and that the \n2,000 NGA West employees who live in Missouri remain in close proximity \nto the headquarters.\n  The St. Louis region has a proven track record in national defense \nand technology capabilities that make it an ideal choice for NGA's new \nhome.\n  I ask that my colleagues vote in favor of this amendment to ensure \nNGA West can continue to perform its critical role in our national \nsecurity within a community that understands its needs and strongly \nsupports its mission.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri's First \nDistrict (Mr. Clay).\n\n                              {time}  2250\n\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Missouri \n(Mrs. Wagner) for yielding. I rise today in strong support of this \namendment as offered by Mrs. Wagner.\n  The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's decision to locate \ntheir new western headquarters in north St. Louis was the right choice \nto support their vital national security mission, the best decision for \nthe over 3,000 exceptional Federal employees who work there, and it \nwill transform a great Federal failure into a transformational Federal \nsuccess.\n  The misguided and shortsighted attempt to withhold funding from this \nproject not only is petty and parochial, it is completely irresponsible \nbecause delaying this project would put our national security at risk. \nNGA Director Robert Cardillo said it best in his message to his \nemployees on April 1.\n  Director Cardillo said: ``The future of our agency and our profession \nrests on our present talent and that of the next generations we can \nrecruit onto our team. We face tough competition, and offering an \nenvironment that appeals to these future generations is critical to our \nsuccess. Studies point to a desire by today's millennials to be in \nurban environments, and this trend is expected to continue.''\n  He went on to say: ``Our partnership with industry and academia will \ncontinue to grow and expand as we transform some of our work to a more \nopen, connected and transparent environment. Our ability to engage with \nlocal universities and innovative, technology-based companies is \nenhanced by remaining in St. Louis city. I am confident that we will \nbuild a facility in St. Louis that will be a remarkable home for us to \nmaster our craft and engage with our partners in a flexible, \ntechnologically advanced environment that is enticing to current and \nfuture generations.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support the gentlewoman's amendment.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. Does any Member claim time in opposition?\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chair, in closing, I just want to say that NGA chose \nSt. Louis because the location best supports the agency's mission.\n  The superiority of the urban setting is ideal for recruiting and \nretaining a highly skilled workforce. When focusing on the most \ntechnological, academic, and professional environment to ensure our \nNation's security, the NGA chose St. Louis. The decision has been made, \nand my amendment supports the NGA's decision.\n  Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and my colleague from the First \nDistrict of Missouri.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n

Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 29, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $4,000,000)''.\n       Page 33, line 12, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $5,500,000)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nArizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment which seeks to \nredirect scarce resources to important\n\n[[Page H2827]]\n\nmental health programs for our Nation's veterans.\n  At a hearing just last week entitled ``Combating the Crisis: \nEvaluating Efforts to Prevent Veteran Suicide,'' Chairman Jeff Miller \nstated that the latest data available from the VA reports that 22 \nveterans per day are committing suicide.\n  Last fiscal year, the VA General Administration account got a $15.68 \nmillion increase for more bureaucracy within the VA. This year, the \nObama administration has requested another $81 million increase for \nthat account.\n  The committee wisely chose not to provide funding for the majority of \nthe request in that bill, stating:\n  ``It has doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large new office \nwith regional staffing at this late date in the administration.''\n  My amendment simply transfers a portion of the fiscal year 2016 \nincrease for government bureaucrats to important mental health services \nfor our Nation's heroes returning from combat.\n  Traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder have been \nconsistently contributing to behavioral issues amongst our veterans; \nand all too often, these ongoing mental health issues result in \nsuicide. With an average of 22 veteran suicides per day, more resources \nare desperately needed.\n  While redirecting funds to where they are needed most, the \nCongressional Budget Office also states that this amendment would save \nmoney and reduce outlays. My amendment also helps bring the level of \nfunding in the bill for mental health closer to the administration's \nrequests for the fiscal year.\n  The VA doesn't need more money to hire more paper pushers. Instead, \nlet's appropriate that money to where and whom the VA was created for: \nto serve and help improve the mental health of our Nation's heroes.\n  I applaud the committee for including my language that ensures the \nVeterans Crisis Line will provide an immediate response from a trained \nprofessional and for the resources already directed in this bill \ntowards mental health.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment and help \nensure our veterans that are in need get the care they so earned.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I don't \noppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I am certainly sympathetic to the intent of \nthe gentleman's amendment to increase funding for suicide prevention \noutreach programs. Obviously, we all know this is a very serious \nproblem. These programs already received an 11 percent increase in our \nbill, for a total of $164 million. So I do not oppose the amendment, \nand I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n     Amendment Offered by Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico\n\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I have an \namendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 29, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $10,000,000) (increased by $10,000,000)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentlewoman from New \nMexico and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, we have a \nprovider shortage in this country, and it is only projected to get \nworse. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that the \nUnited States could face a shortage of 90,000 physicians by 2025.\n  One of the most common complaints I hear from veterans in Albuquerque \nis that even with the flexibility they have to see outside providers \nthrough the Veterans Choice Act, there just aren't enough providers--\nespecially behavioral health providers--to treat everyone who needs \ncare.\n  If trends continue, we will be without the workforce needed to treat \nan aging population that will increasingly live with chronic health \ncare issues. The provider shortages hit rural, poor, and underserved \ncommunities and states like New Mexico particularly hard.\n  According to the New Mexico Health Care Workforce Committee, every \nsingle healthcare profession in New Mexico has a shortage of providers. \nIn fact, Los Alamos, New Mexico, is the only county in the entire State \nwithout a shortage of primary health care providers. And primary care \nphysicians are four more times available in urban areas than in rural \nNew Mexico.\n  The result: longer waits, longer travel, patients not receiving the \ncare they need, and worse health outcomes.\n  We have to educate and recruit more providers, but that will not be \nenough to keep up with growing demand. We have to do a better job at \nleveraging the resources we have to put VA providers in the best \nsituation we can to provide quality and timely care to their patients.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest healthcare system in \nthe United States, should be leading in using telehealth technology to \nprovide care and promote patient wellness.\n  The VHA's Home Telehealth Program is growing and provided 2.1 million \nconsultations to more than 677,000 veterans in 2015. But we can do much \nmore.\n  In a report last year, the VA Inspector General's office found that \nthe VA missed opportunities to serve additional patients with the Home \nTelehealth Program, which could have ``potentially delayed the need for \nlong-term institutional care for approximately 59,000 additional \nveterans.''\n  The VA Inspector General also found that ``telehealth patients showed \nthe best outcomes in terms of patient admissions and bed days of \ncare.''\n  It also saves money. Using telehealth instead of placing a veterans \nin a contract nursing home facility saves approximately $92,000 a year, \nand the veteran gets to stay independently at home.\n  The VA should follow models such as the University of New Mexico's \nProject ECHO and think creatively about sharing expertise among \nspecialists, primary care physicians, and medical centers to ensure \npatients in underserved communities get the care they need.\n\n                              {time}  2310\n\n  Mr. Chairman, the VA should increase its focus on programs that are \nproven to improve clinical outcomes and expand access to care while \nreducing treatment costs.\n  I urge Members to support my amendment to prioritize funding for the \nVA Home Telehealth Program.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I do not \noppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I share the gentlewoman's concern about the \nimportance of telehealth as a way to provide healthcare services \nremotely to patients. It is especially useful in the treatment of \nmental health and behavioral health issues.\n  The VA is a leader in telehealth activities, providing 2.1 million \nconsultations to more than 677,000 veterans in 2015, many of whom were \nin rural areas. VA funding for telehealth will total almost $1.2 \nbillion in fiscal year 2017.\n  I do not oppose the amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. DENT. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I come from a very rural district as well, and I \nunderstand the importance of access to quality care.\n  I agree that we need to train and recruit more health professionals. \nIn the meantime, I agree that telemedicine is a great tool to help deal \nwith the shortage of health professionals.\n\n[[Page H2828]]\n\n  So I support this amendment, and I urge all of the Members to do so. \nIt will do a great deal toward helping to bring access to care to our \nveterans in rural communities.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 12, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,500,000) (increased by $1,500,000)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Dent and Ranking Member \nBishop for their work on this appropriations bill, and for their \ncooperation with this amendment.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment that will support a requirement of \nVA prescribers to complement a continuing medication course in pain \nmanagement.\n  Nationally, about 30 percent of Americans have some form of chronic \npain. However, the percentage of veterans who report chronic pain is \nsignificantly higher. Over 50 percent of elderly veterans report \nchronic pain as do almost 60 percent of veterans returning from the \nconflict in the Middle East.\n  In fact, chronic pain is the most common medical problem experienced \nby returning combat veterans in the last decade.\n  Of course, pain is not a stand-alone problem. Pain is something we \nsee as a consequence of physical injury, and sometimes that physical \ninjury leads to co-occurring mental health ailments.\n  We are increasingly more aware of the mental health consequences \nstemming from time in combat. Veterans with brain trauma are more \nlikely to report physical pain and, in turn, are more likely to receive \nprescriptions for opioids.\n  Recent VA data shows us that roughly 523,000 veterans are receiving \nprescriptions for opioids, and the number of veterans with opioid use \ndisorders has grown 55 percent over the past 5 years. Veterans are \ntwice as likely to overdose on prescription opioids as the general \npopulation.\n  We are very fortunate to live in a time where quality care can be \noffered to our military personnel, and it is unparalleled. Now we need \nto do our part to help these heroes manage their chronic pain in the \nsafest manner possible.\n  Last month I introduced the Safe Prescribing for Veterans Act, which \nwill help those who provide healthcare services to veterans learn the \nlatest pain management techniques, understand safe prescribing \npractices, and spot the signs of potential substance use disorders. \nThis act works by directing healthcare providers from the VA to take \ncontinuing education courses specific to pain management, opioids, and \nsubstance abuse.\n  VA healthcare providers already need continuing education to maintain \ntheir State-issued professional licenses, and my bill makes sure they \nspend some of the already-required time learning about safe opioid \nprescribing practices.\n  The bill does not add to the total number of credits that prescribers \nalready have to take, it just insists that they spend their time on \nthis important issue.\n  Only 14 States require their physicians to take pain management \neducation credits. My constituents are fortunate in Massachusetts \nbecause we are 1 of the 14 States that ask its doctors to complete pain \nmanagement training.\n  However, even our neighboring States do not have the mandatory pain \nmanagement requirements. Veterans in my district, especially those in \nthe South Coast, often find it easy to receive their health care at VA \nhospitals in Rhode Island. As of now, there is no guarantee that the \ndoctors they see in Providence have taken the same pain management \neducation courses.\n  I rise before you today in an effort to give our veterans that \nguarantee.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment to \nensure our veterans receive the care they deserve.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not \nopposed to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is addressing a problem that \nmany Members have contacted us about, the long delays that community \npractitioners are experiencing in being paid by VA for their care for \nveterans.\n  Our report requires VA to provide comprehensive information detailing\n\n[[Page H2829]]\n\nthe reimbursements owed to providers in each State and the amounts of \ninvoices that are more than 6 months overdue.\n  GAO just released a report with alarming data about VA's significant \nproblems in managing prompt payment to outside providers. I am sure \nthat we will revisit this issue in conference, and we will welcome any \nsuggestions the gentleman has for us.\n  I have no objection to this amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Clawson of Florida\n\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 12, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 35, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 35, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nFlorida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Dent; full \nrespect for what he does and, more importantly, how he does it. Agree \nor disagree, the gentleman does it the right way, and I appreciate his \nleadership style.\n  Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to offer my amendment to \nthe Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill.\n  May 30 is Memorial Day, a day we set aside to recognize the \ntremendous debt of gratitude for those who have selflessly sacrificed \nfor our liberties.\n  From constituent discussions in my district, I am acutely aware that \ncustomer service for our vets often falls short of the mark. Far too \nmany of our vets, I am told, simply do not receive timely responses to \ntheir healthcare questions. We can do better.\n  My amendment, which I am proposing, is directed at improving customer \nservice problems by improving the information technology at VA \nfacilities.\n  My amendment would enhance veterans' customer service experiences by \nfunding improved, service-based, commoditized technology and \ntelecommunications.\n\n                              {time}  2320\n\n  For this, my amendment would add $5 million to the information \ntechnology systems account, specifically the funding directed at the \ndevelopment, modernization, and enhancement of the current IT \ninfrastructure.\n  In the proposed budget, this account is currently funded at $4.23 \nbillion, $50 million short of the President's budget request of $4.28 \nbillion in this area. My amendment would offset this $5 million by \nreducing the general administration account, currently funded at $336 \nmillion. The redirected $5 million would be used in acquiring new \ntechnologies to provide more acceptable customer satisfaction and \ndelivery measures.\n  I am the proud son of a veteran who served overseas. In my role in \nCongress, it is a great honor and privilege to serve over 100,000 \nveterans who call my district home. We all know vets--friends, \nneighbors, family, and, in my case, a nephew just returning from \nAfghanistan and a father who served a long time ago. Let's do right by \nthese brave folks by improving their customer service and response.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I do not \noppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I certainly know the gentleman from Florida \nis very committed to improving veterans' experiences when they deal \nwith the VA, and modernizing infrastructure is certainly an important \npart of that. I have no objection to the amendment, and I certainly \nappreciate the gentleman's deep commitment given his own father's \nexperience in our Armed Forces. We thank him for that service.\n  Again, I have no objection to this amendment, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Clawson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Keating\n\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 12, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, again I would like to thank Chairman Dent \nand Ranking Member Bishop for their work on this bill and their \ncooperation on this amendment.\n  I rise today to offer a straightforward amendment that will improve \nour understanding of the causes of delays within the Veterans Choice \nProgram. The Veterans Choice Program was implemented to address delays \nin patient care at the Veterans Administration. However, as of April of \nthis year, data from the VA showed that the number of veterans waiting \nmore than 30 days for an appointment was actually higher than when the \nVeterans Choice Program was initiated.\n  The well-intentioned and necessary program was initiated and \nacknowledged. The fact is the Veterans Choice Program was cobbled \ntogether very quickly given the time constraints. This led to excessive \nprivatization and contracting through third parties, which has \ncontributed to frequent delays, and we are seeing these delays even \ntoday.\n  In my district alone, I have spoken with numerous veterans who live a \ngreat distance from VA medical facilities, such as the islands of \nMartha's Vineyard and Nantucket. My constituents rely heavily on \naccessibility to non-VA doctors the Veterans Choice is intended to \nprovide.\n  Further, an oft cited problem with Veterans Choice is the lack of \nclear communications regarding the eligibility requirements of the \nprogram to both veterans and non-VA providers. Understanding the \nobstacles around efficient scheduling of appointments of veterans and \nswift reimbursement for providers would serve as a crucial first step \nin resolving some of the issues that the Choice Program faces. Without \nthis understanding, the program itself really isn't beneficial.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment, to advocate for redirected \nfunding toward finding a solution to the delays and the communication \nerrors plaguing implementation of Veterans Choice.\n  I have no doubt whatsoever that every Member of Congress here agrees \nthat our veterans deserve the very best possible care in a timely \nmanner. Ultimately, this amendment is meant to assist the VA in \nidentifying why these delays are occurring and to help recommend \nsolutions.\n  I want to thank the chairman again.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman from \nMassachusetts that we need to take a serious look at the Choice \nProgram. VA's most recent data show, compared to the last year, there \nare now 70,000 more appointments that kept a veteran waiting at least a \nmonth to get care. Furthermore, a March General Accounting Office \nreport showed that the Choice Program had little impact on getting \nveterans to see a primary care physician in 30 days.\n  Thousands of veterans referred to the program are returning to the VA \nfor care, sometimes because the program could not find a doctor for \nthem and because the private doctor they were told to see was too far \naway according\n\n[[Page H2830]]\n\nto VA data. In fact, VA's own inspector general found that in Colorado, \nveterans were waiting longer than 30 days for care because staff at the \nlocal VA hospital was not adding them to the list of patients eligible \nfor the Choice Program, let alone slow reimbursements.\n  Two years ago, Congress was hearing about the VA concealing wait \ntimes at VA hospitals and clinics and about the veterans who were \nsuffering as a result. We were forced to act quickly in this crisis. I \nbelieve that Congress will have to revamp the Choice Program to make \nsure that it is doing what Congress intended for it to do. We are going \nto need an honest assessment from the VA.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment, but I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. I will just say very briefly, Mr. Chairman, I know the \ngentleman is very interested, as we all are, in finding ways to ensure \nthat the VA healthcare providers receive up-to-date and comprehensive \ntraining in the proper use of pain management medications. So many of \nour veterans struggle with chronic pain, and we have seen the tragic \nconsequences of overprescription of opioids as a method of treatment.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's interest and his advocacy. I have no \nobjections to gentleman's amendment, and I urge adoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KEATING. Again, Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       board of veterans appeals\n\n       For necessary operating expenses of the Board of Veterans \n     Appeals, $156,096,000, of which not to exceed $15,610,000 \n     shall remain available until September 30, 2018.\n\n      general operating expenses, veterans benefits administration\n\n       For necessary operating expenses of the Veterans Benefits \n     Administration, not otherwise provided for, including hire of \n     passenger motor vehicles, reimbursement of the General \n     Services Administration for security guard services, and \n     reimbursement of the Department of Defense for the cost of \n     overseas employee mail, $2,826,160,000: Provided, That \n     expenses for services and assistance authorized under \n     paragraphs (1), (2), (5), and (11) of section 3104(a) of \n     title 38, United States Code, that the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs determines are necessary to enable entitled veterans: \n     (1) to the maximum extent feasible, to become employable and \n     to obtain and maintain suitable employment; or (2) to achieve \n     maximum independence in daily living, shall be charged to \n     this account: Provided further, That, of the funds made \n     available under this heading, not to exceed $141,000,000 \n     shall remain available until September 30, 2018.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Ruiz\n\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 34, line 5, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $5,000,000) (increased by $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nCalifornia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. \n4974, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act for 2017.\n  My amendment will help reduce the VA's claims backlog and help \nimprove the lives of our veterans. California is home to 2 million \nveterans, and I am proud to represent more than 54,000 veterans in my \ndistrict alone.\n  There are 40,000 veterans expected to return to California every year \nfor the next several years, including the fastest growing group of \nreturning veterans--women.\n  We must ensure that our veterans have timely access to the critical \nbenefits they have earned and deserve. Unconscionably, thousands of \nveterans who have sacrificed for our country are struggling to access \nbenefits they have already earned.\n  Due to the lingering claims backlog at the Veterans Affairs \nAdministration, veterans across our Nation are waiting for pensions, \nprescription drugs, and even lifesaving medical care.\n  Veterans are still waiting for the VA to process 351,676 benefit \nclaims, and 74,589 of those veterans have been waiting longer than 125 \ndays for a decision.\n\n                              {time}  2330\n\n  We owe it to our courageous men and women to clear this harmful \nbacklog as soon as possible. Reduced to a claim number in a seemingly \nendless line, our veterans experience pain, frustration, hopelessness, \nand despair. Although the backlog has shrunk since Congress last passed \na similar appropriations bill, we must not lose sight of the importance \nof getting veterans their hard-earned benefits as soon as possible.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment to advocate for an \nadditional $5 million to fund the digital scanning of health and \nbenefits files to reduce the backlog by redirecting funding within the \nGeneral Operating Expenses account of the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration. This amendment simply directs funds towards the digital \nscanning of health and benefits files that will reduce the claims \nbacklog without any new spending.\n  As an emergency medicine physician, I understand the importance of \nefficiency in health care, and I know how dangerous continued \nbureaucratic rejection can be for a person with PTSD or depression. By \ncommitting resources to digitizing health and benefits files, we will \nfurther increase VA's capacity to tackle the claims backlog, ultimately \nensuring veterans receive the benefits they have earned in a timely \nmanner. We must serve our veterans by making certain that Congress \nfocuses on eliminating the claims backlog for good.\n  I encourage my colleagues to stand up for veterans and support my \npragmatic amendment to reduce the veterans' claims processing time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do \nnot oppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, on the VA claims backlog, we have fully \nfunded the President's request.\n  I have no objection to the amendment, and I am prepared to support \nit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chair, that was the quickest 25 \npages I have heard in a long time.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Mulvaney\n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. Actually, I \nhave four consecutive amendments at the desk.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Is it possible, with the approval of the gentleman who \nis controlling the time for the majority, to combine amendment Nos. 1, \n2, 3, and 4 into a single amendment?\n  The CHAIR. The amendments could be considered together by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I respectfully object. We haven't seen any of \nthe amendments yet; so I think we should just proceed in the regular \norder.\n  The CHAIR. Objection is heard.\n  The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike page 65, lines 1-11.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Mulvaney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Do we have the text of the amendment?\n  The CHAIR. Copies will be made available. They are being distributed \nnow.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order until we get the \namendments.\n  The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. MULVANEY of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, I have four consecutive \namendments that are all very closely intertwined. There are actually \nfour simply for procedural matters that I offered originally as one. I \nam going to argue all of them together essentially at one time because \nthis is what they do: they get rid of the OCO budget. That is it. They \nget rid of the OCO budget. Title IV of this bill is the OCO budget, and \nmy amendments seek to simply be done with this thing.\n  Mr. Chair, it has turned into a slush fund. That is not me saying \nthat, by the way. That is folks from both Republican and Democrat \nadministrations, together, saying that is what this is. It may have \nstarted with the best of intentions. It may have started out of \nabsolute necessity. It may have been a good thing when it started, but \nwe all know what it is now, which is a place to hide money and a way to \nget around spending caps. That is it.\n  Mr. Chair, I hope I get a chance over the course of the next couple \nof appropriations bills to talk more about the OCO and more about \nspecific examples of how it is abused. We actually now admit that we \nabuse it. We admit that there is money in the OCO budget that has \nnothing to do with overseas contingency operations. We admit that there \nis money in the OCO budget right now that has nothing to do with waging \nwar overseas.\n  We admit that we abuse this particular account. Why? Because we can \nand because it is very difficult to vote against the troops. That is \nnot the right way to appropriate money.\n  John McCain, a man with whom I usually disagree on many, many things, \nhas actually said this is not the way to appropriate money for\n\n[[Page H2835]]\n\nMILCON-VA, for the DOD. For anything that has to do with defense, this \nis not the proper way to do it. Mr. Chair, in fact, as we look at the \nindividual sections, it gets even worse.\n  In this first section that deals with the Army, we are appropriating \n$18.9 million for no one knows what. There is no indication whatsoever \nas to what we are spending this money on. The language is very \nstraightforward. It reads that we are going to go and appropriate $18.9 \nmillion to remain available until September 30, 2021, for projects \noutside the United States. Period. That is it. $19 million with \nabsolutely no indication of where it is being spent. In fact, we don't \neven have to spend it next year. We can spend it anytime we want to \nover the next 5 years. As long as it is outside of the United States, \nwe are approving its expenditure.\n  By the way, you can go down to the next line where the same is true \nof the $59.8 million for the Marine Corps construction, of the $88.2 \nmillion for the Air Force construction, and then of the $5 million for \nmilitary construction defensewide.\n  There is no indication of how this money is being spent. There is no \nlimitation on when it is spent other than we have to spend it in 5 \nyears, and there is no indication on where it is going to be spent \nother than it has to be outside of the United States. That is it. It is \nhard for me to imagine an example of a less accountable, a less \ntransparent way for us to spend money in this country.\n  I have been spending some time on this for the last couple of years. \nI have always thought that this was a bad way for us to operate. I know \nthat, every single year, we gather a couple more in adherence to that \nbelief. We get a couple more votes every single year--folks who are \nfinally waking up to the fact that, listen, we need to spend money on \nthe military, that we need to spend money on the defense of this \nNation. It is one of the few things we are affirmatively charged with \nin our Constitution, but this is not the way to do it.\n  We can't lie to people back home about how much money we are \nspending. We can't lie to people back home about what the deficit is \ngoing to be. We certainly can't lie to them about where they are \nspending their money. Let's stop doing it this way and start doing it \nproperly.\n  Mr. Chair, for that reason, I encourage the support for this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment for a few reasons.\n  The OCO money in this bill totals $172 million. He is correct, it is \nabout $18.9 million for the Army.\n  Much of this money is going to support counterterrorism efforts and \nthe European Reassurance Initiative. We are going to be using this \nmoney for, obviously, infrastructure and for the prepositioning of \nassets. Given the real threats we are facing in Europe from Vladimir \nPutin, we need to make sure that we are reassuring our allies in \nEastern Europe.\n  This subcommittee recently visited Eastern Europe--Poland, Lithuania, \nGermany--where we heard from General Breedlove, the Supreme Allied \nCommander of NATO, talk about the need for this initiative. I think it \nis imperative that we reassure our allies in Eastern Europe, who are \nstaring down--who are facing a very real threat--from Vladimir Putin's \naggression in Ukraine, and we are deeply concerned that his \nexpansionist ambitions may move into the Baltic.\n  This is extremely important, this OCO funding. I urge my colleagues \nto reject any reduction in the OCO funding for the men and women of the \nAmerican Army.\n  I withdraw my reservation of a point of order, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  2350\n\n  The CHAIR. The reservation of the point of order is withdrawn.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, it is hard to argue with that. This money is \ngoing for counterterrorism. It is going for the preposition of assets. \nIt is going for reassuring our allies. It is going to combat Mr. Putin \nor constrain him in Ukraine. I am a little hard pressed as to how $178-\nodd-million is going to do all of those things.\n  Face it, we have to take the gentleman's word for it. And as much as \nI trust the gentleman, why isn't that in the document? Why doesn't it \nsay $18.9 million for this counterterrorism program or that \nrepositioning of assets? It doesn't say that. We have no idea what this \nmoney is for. None whatsoever.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and I \nappreciate the opportunity to have my say.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that where this \nmoney is going to be expended is in the report, and it is also online \nin many of the budget documents. So the information is available where \nthe money is actually going to be spent. I just wanted to share that.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina will be \npostponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n              Military Construction, Navy and Marine Corps\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Military Construction, Navy \n     and Marine Corps'', $59,809,000, to remain available until \n     September 30, 2021, for projects outside of the United \n     States: Provided, That such amount is designated by the \n     Congress for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on \n     Terrorism pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Mulvaney\n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. I indicated \nbefore, I have had my say. We are going to go through the motions on \nthe next three.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have had my say. I move approval.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, this money, I guess, would strike the OCO \nfunding for the Navy. The money for the Navy is going to be used in \nDjibouti, I believe, for a runway and also for a medical and dental \nfacility for our troops.\n  So I, again, respectfully oppose the gentleman's amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nBishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.

Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nWenstrup).\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I would like to raise some concerns I \nhave about VA's efforts to streamline the catalog of surgical tools \nthat are available to VA Medical Centers.\n  I share the VA's goals of increasing efficiency and purchasing power. \nHowever, I am concerned that there is a reliance on single-source \ncontracts, and here is why: I believe single-award contracts are too \nlimited and will reduce choice for surgeons.\n  As a surgeon myself, I know practitioners have specific preferences \nand a comfort for what tools work best in their hands. Surgical \nresidents learn when they have more options, more techniques in front \nof them and innovations.\n  Often, when surgeons are restricted, they practice elsewhere. I am \nconcerned that limiting surgeons' options will have an effect on the \nmorale and retention of surgeons in the VA, and I think the last thing \nthe VA needs right now is to lose more providers.\n  I also know that patients have different needs. Every surgery case is \nunique due to the individual patient anatomy, comorbidities, et cetera.\n  So I would just like to be assured that surgeons will have \nflexibility, which means more choice and better care for veterans and \nfor our patients. Unfortunately, in my efforts to get this assurance, I \nget conflicting information from various sources within the VA.\n  Multiyear, single-award contracts are irreparable if we get them \nwrong. I would like to work with the chairman and the authorizing \ncommittee to conduct oversight on this issue to ensure that we do get \nthis right because we can't lose more surgeons and we can't compromise \ncare for our veterans.\n\n                              {time}  0000\n\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, I certainly understand the \ngentleman's sincere desire to provide better care to our veterans. As \nit relates to the single-source issue, single-source contracts, \nobviously he has a great deal of expertise. I would like to work with \nthe gentleman to get more information about the issue and work with \nhim, but also, again, I also commend him to the authorizers, who will \nhave a great deal of say on this matter as well. I pledge to him my \ncommitment to work with him to try to get to a better place on this \nmatter.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Ratcliffe\n\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to propose, plan for, or execute a new or additional \n     Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Texas \nand a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Dent and \nRanking Member Bishop for their hard work on behalf of servicemembers \nand veterans all across the country.\n  The Ratcliffe-MacArthur-Bost amendment that I am offering today with \nmy colleagues, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur) and the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), will prohibit any funds made \navailable in this act from being used to propose, plan for, or execute \na new or additional round of base realignment and closure, or BRAC.\n  My congressional district in northeast Texas is home to the Red River \nArmy Depot, which has maintained a steadfast commitment to supporting \nAmerica's Armed Forces since 1941. While the depot has endured many \nchallenges over the years, it has remained dedicated to fulfilling its \nmotto: ``We build it as if our lives depend on it. Theirs do.''\n  Not only is the depot a vital job creator, employing more than 5,000 \npeople in northeast Texas and southern Arkansas, it is a critical \ncomponent of our national defense. The depot acts as an insurance \npolicy for America's security, one capable of bolstering production in \na manner that simply can't be duplicated by civilian industries. So the \nneed for this amendment is clear.\n  In a fiscal environment where every penny is carefully scrutinized, \nwe have to ensure that taxpayer dollars truly address our national \nsecurity needs, and another round of BRAC certainly won't help us \nachieve this important goal. In addition to jeopardizing our defense \nreadiness, BRAC has proven to be incredibly expensive. According to the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the last round of BRAC in 2005 cost \nthe American taxpayers a whopping $35.1 billion. At the same time, the \nexpected savings from the last round of BRAC haven't materialized, and \nthose promised savings have since been revised downward by 73 percent.\n  Mr. Chairman, at a time when the terror threat level hovers at an \nall-time high, it is especially important that we do everything \npossible to ensure that our military is prepared for the call of duty. \nThe amendment that I have introduced today does just that. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it on behalf of the safety of our Armed Forces \nand the American people.\n  I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say I have no objection to the \ngentleman's amendment, and I am prepared to accept it.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Blumenauer\n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement, administer, or enforce Veterans Health \n     Administration directive 2011-004 (or directive of the same \n     substance) with respect to the prohibition on ``VA providers \n     from completing forms seeking recommendations or opinions \n     regarding a Veteran's participation in a State marijuana \n     program''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nOregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, one of the great concerns we have is how the 2 million \nyoung Americans who were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan reintegrate back \ninto society. Many of them return with wounds visible and invisible. We \nfind that more than 20 percent of those 2.8 million American veterans \nsuffer from PTSD and depression. A recent survey revealed that suicide \nrates among veterans are roughly 50 percent higher than among \ncivilians. Another study found that the death rate for opioid overdoses \namong VA patients is nearly double the national average.\n  What I hear from veterans that I talk to is that an overwhelming \nnumber of them say that medical marijuana has helped them deal with \nPTSD, pain, and other conditions, particularly as an alternative to \nopioids, and I would argue that it is essential that veterans be \nallowed access to this as a treatment if it is legal in their State.\n  Twenty-four States, the District of Columbia, and Guam have passed \nlaws that provide for legal access to medical marijuana at the \nrecommendation of a physician to treat such conditions, ranging from \nseizures to glaucoma, anxiety, chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, \nand the symptoms associated with chemotherapy. Fourteen of these States \nspecifically allow physicians to recommend medical marijuana for the \nsymptoms of post-traumatic stress, PTSD.\n  As a result of these medical marijuana laws, more than 2 million \npatients across the country, including\n\n[[Page H2838]]\n\nmany of our veterans, now use medical marijuana. Unfortunately, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs specifically prohibits its medical \nproviders from completing forms brought by their patients seeking \nrecommendations regarding a veteran's participation in a State medical \nmarijuana program. What this means is that those patients who want to \npursue medical marijuana have to go ahead and hire a physician out of \ntheir own pocket, not dealing with the medical professional of their \nchoice, the medical professional, their VA doctor, who knows them the \nbest. I think that is unfortunate.\n  I have an amendment cosponsored by Dr. Joe Heck, Sam Farr, Dana \nRohrabacher, Dina Titus, Tom Reed, and others that would prohibit funds \nfrom being made available to the VA to implement this prohibition. I \nthink it is the right thing to do for our veterans, to be able to treat \nthem equitably, to enable them to have access to the doctor who knows \nthem the best, giving them better treatment, and saving them money. I \nwould respectfully request that we approve this amendment to eliminate \nthis unjustified prohibition.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise up somewhat reluctantly to my friend \nin opposition.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Blumenauer is a very genuine and sincere, very \nthoughtful Member of this body. I understand that the country is \nevolving on this issue, as many States, including my own, have moved \nforward on medical marijuana.\n  As a Member of this House, I am a bit uncomfortable, however, in \ntrying to dictate policy on marijuana without guidance from the Food \nand Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and other \nmedical professionals. That said, I reluctantly rise in opposition.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close. I am going to \nclose when you have exhausted your speakers.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment that is \noffered by Mr. Blumenauer. Last year in Georgia, the general assembly \npassed and Governor Deal signed legislation that immediately legalized \nthe use of medical marijuana to treat serious medical conditions. \nGeorgia became the 36th State plus Washington, D.C., to legalize \nmarijuana extracts to treat illnesses.\n  I believe that we should not limit the Veterans Health Administration \nfrom providing optimal pain care for our veterans. If medical marijuana \nis legal in a State, then the VA should be able to discuss that \ntreatment option and allow the veteran to make his or her own choice.\n  I believe that the VA's published policy guidance related to the use \nof medical marijuana by our veteran patients, VHA Directive 2010-035, \nMedical Marijuana, has become outdated. I believe that supporting a \nveteran's right to use alternative methods to deal with pain is the \nright thing to do.\n  Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0010\n\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, as I said, I reluctantly oppose the \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, there is nobody who I have more respect \nfor than my friend, the chairman of the subcommittee. But I take modest \nexception.\n  This amendment does not dictate treatment options. It is not \ninterfering, it is not superimposing anybody's judgment about the \nmerits of marijuana. It simply enables VA doctors and patients to \ninteract with State legal marijuana systems--systems that this Congress \nhas repeatedly supported through amendment votes, just like everybody \nelse.\n  We should not be limiting the treatment options available to our \nveterans. I fail to understand what the basis is to force veterans in \nthe State of Pennsylvania who feel that they need to avail themselves \nof medical marijuana, like any other citizen in Pennsylvania or in \nOregon has a right to do, but force them to not use the doctor that \nknows them best; instead, go to somebody else, hire them out of their \nown pocket, and be engaging with somebody who doesn't know their full \nrange of activity.\n  This doesn't engage the Veterans Administration. There is no \nmarijuana on premises. It simply allows the doctor to be able to deal \nwith the veteran, as a patient, to be able to counsel and potentially \nprescribe them, like any other person in any other State where it is \nlegal.\n  Bear in mind that these people are suffering from PTSD, chronic pain, \ndepression, conditions that medical marijuana is legally entitled to \ntreat and which veterans, who I have met with literally from coast-to-\ncoast, say has transformed their lives.\n  What we are doing now, they are dying at a higher rate than the \naverage member of the population. Their suicide rate is high. Their \nopioid addiction rate is almost twice as high as the average citizen. I \nthink that is unconscionable. We should have this amendment to try and \nhelp address it.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon will be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Fleming\n\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to modify a military installation in the United \n     States, including construction or modification of a facility \n     on a military installation, to provide temporary housing for \n     unaccompanied alien children.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nLouisiana and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would prohibit funds from \nbeing used to modify a military installation for the purpose of housing \nunaccompanied alien children.\n  Our military installations are for training and equipping soldiers to \nfight our Nation's wars. The use of DOD facilities to house \nunaccompanied alien children undermines the readiness of our Armed \nForces, which we know to be in extremis at this point.\n  This amendment follows on from a provision included in the National \nDefense Authorization Act, passed out of the House Armed Services \nCommittee, that prohibits unaccompanied alien children from being \nhosted on military installations. A similar standalone bill has also \nbeen introduced by Judge John Carter of Texas and has 61 cosponsors.\n  Under recent agreements made by the Department of Health and Human \nServices, the DOD has provided housing to unaccompanied alien children \nwith certain requirements and preferences being requested by HHS that \nfacilities be able to provide space for security fencing, service \ntrailers, and potential soft-sided outdoor housing.\n  It is inappropriate for scarce defense dollars, meant to go for the \nreadiness of our soldiers, to be used for nondefense purposes, \nespecially at this time in our Nation's history when our readiness is \nso low.\n  Take, for example, the Army Air Defense and Artillery training site \nat Fort Sill, where unaccompanied minors were housed in 2014. These \nbarracks were used by HHS, and resources had to be expended to ensure \nHHS contractors and the minors being hosted did not gain access to \nsensitive areas and live-fire training ranges.\n  Fort Hood was also on the short list for hosting unaccompanied minors \nin 2015. Because of this, the Texas National Guard was unable to stand \nup a training facility because the base was being considered to host \nthese unaccompanied minors.\n\n[[Page H2839]]\n\n  Our military infrastructure is in serious need of upgrading and \nconstruction dollars are scarce. Mr. Chairman, the slightest use of \nresources to modify an installation to meet nondefense missions \njeopardizes the readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  Following on the prohibition placed in this year's House NDAA, I ask \nmy colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, there are no projects in the FY 17 request \nfor this purpose in the United States. There is $33 million in funds to \nsupport the naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, at the request of \nSOCOM, Southern Command, to deal with various issues of people, \nobviously, who were interdicting on the seas or arriving in Cuba.\n  But the point is, I don't want to preclude the Department of Defense \nfrom dealing with an emergency situation, should one arise in the U.S. \nSo that is why I must oppose my friend's amendment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Bishop), my distinguished colleague and ranking member.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, we have an opportunity and an obligation to help migrant \nchildren who have come across the border to escape the problems with \ntheir homeland. The challenges of poverty and violence continue to \ngrow, and it is a moral obligation and one that I support.\n  To not allow the use of military installations for temporary housing \nfor migrants only exacerbates the problem. This is temporary. Why would \nwe prohibit the use of bases only until the adjudication of a migrant's \ncase, for example? Is my colleague suggesting that we immediately send \nmigrant children back to the countries they fled without due process? \nShould we send them back to violence?\n  That is not what the United States stands for. It is not what the \nUnited States should stand for. It is not consistent with our country's \nChristian values.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I agree with the \nchairman.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. \nThe gentleman from Pennsylvania has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chair, I thank my friends and colleagues for their \ncomments and statements, but I simply have to disagree. Again, this is \nabout military readiness, which we are at a low, low point.\n  We are getting all sorts of reports. We are having hearings from \ngenerals, commanders in the field, and generals at the Pentagon, \ntelling us that they are scratching for every little penny they can \nfind for readiness.\n  In fact, just the other night on FOX News, they talked about a Marine \nCorps F-18. They had to go to a museum just to find a part to put on \nthat in order for it to go into service.\n  Look, if it is important to provide facilities for unaccompanied \nalien children, then the Appropriations Committee should appropriate \nthose dollars. But they should not take them from the vital military \nfacilities. They shouldn't take scarce dollars away from our readiness. \nAs a result of that, again, I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chair, again, I just ask my colleagues to support \nthis. This is common sense. We need to protect our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, as well as marines. We need to make sure that they are safe out \nthere, that every dollar is put into readiness to protect them, and it \nshould not be diverted in this way. Again, I urge support of this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Fleming).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana will be \npostponed.\n\n                              {time}  0020\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement section 8(d)(2) of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration Directive \n     3220 of November 22, 2005.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nCalifornia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am pleased to offer this amendment to the 2017 MILCON-VA spending \nbill, and to stand today with my colleague, the gentleman from Arizona \n(Mr. Gallego), who has offered a stand-alone bill on this same subject, \nalong with our colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Last year, we all remember the tragic shooting at the Emanuel African \nMethodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and how it \nreopened a painful but necessary national conversation about symbols \nlike the Confederate battle flag that represent racism, slavery, and \ndivision.\n  Rightfully, leaders in South Carolina and other Southern States, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, joined together to call on their \nStates to end the display of the Confederate battle flag on government \nproperty.\n  The Confederate battle flag, a symbol of hate and opposition to the \nUnited States of America, has no place, no place on government \nproperty, especially not at VA cemeteries, a place where families and \nloved ones go to pay respect to our Nation's veterans.\n  Over 150 years ago, slavery was abolished. Why in the year 2016 are \nwe still condoning displays of this hateful symbol on our sacred \nnational cemeteries?\n  Symbols like the Confederate battle flag have meaning. They are not \njust neutral, historical symbols of pride. They represent slavery, \noppression, lynching, and hate.\n  To continue to allow national policy condoning the display of this \nsymbol on Federal property is wrong, and it is disrespectful to what \nour country stands for and what our veterans fight for.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is past time to end the public promotion of this \ncruel, racist legacy of the Confederacy. So let us move forward in a \ndirection of reconciliation, unity, and justice.\n  Symbols matter. Even General Robert E. Lee recognized that symbols of \nthe Confederacy are symbols of treason, which is why he asked that they \nnot appear at his funeral.\n  The United States House of Representatives, in 2016, should be at \nleast as forward-looking as Robert E. Lee was in 1869.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is under recognition.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I reserve a point of order.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized on his pending \namendment.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. On the point of order?\n  The CHAIR. On his amendment.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, my point is that the House of \nRepresentatives, in 2016, should be at least as forward-looking as \nGeneral Robert E. Lee was in 1869.\n  Let us do the right thing tonight in this House, and let's do it \ntogether, on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to the amendment.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The CHAIR. Will the gentleman send his amendment to the desk?\n\n[[Page H2840]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my amendment.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. Does any Member seek time in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from California?\n  The gentleman from California may proceed on his amendment.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I request an ``aye'' vote, and I \nrespectfully yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Huffman).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Fitzpatrick\n\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to procure the birth control known as Essure.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by recognizing my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent), the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, for his diligence and his hard work in bringing this \nimportant bill to the floor and, more importantly, for his work on the \nbill, and listening to ideas coming from both sides of the aisle, and \nhis fairness in considering all ideas as part of this bill. So I thank \nthe gentleman for that.\n\n                              {time}  0030\n\n  I rise this evening in support of an amendment that is common sense. \nIt is a no-brainer. What this amendment would do is say, if a medical \ndevice is under review by the FDA over concerns of its harmful impacts \non women, the Federal Government shouldn't be spending taxpayer dollars \nto offer it to our Nation's veterans.\n  The medical device I am referring to is the permanent sterilization \ndevice, Essure. Essure is a permanent sterilization device that was \napproved by the FDA in 2002. However, since it was first approved, this \ndevice has caused irreparable harm to tens of thousands of women and \ntheir families.\n  FDA data shows that Essure has caused the death of at least four \nwomen and nearly 300 fetal deaths. Additionally, tens of thousands of \nwomen have reported other symptoms which are debilitating.\n  Over 25,000 women have joined together on Facebook to share their \nstories of how the Essure device has ruined their lives. They call \nthemselves the Essure Sisters. They came together as a group because \nnobody believed them--for many, not even their doctors. They were told \nthat this device was safe and there was no way the device caused their \npain and other symptoms. But that proved to be wrong. We don't need \nanother study. Their pain is real. Their stories are real. They have \nbeen ignored by their doctors, by the device manufacturer, and by the \nFood and Drug Administration.\n  I rise today as a voice for these women, to tell this Chamber that \ntheir stories are real, that their pain is real, and that their fight \nis real. Working with them over the last year, we have been able to \nforce the FDA to call for yet another review of this flawed device, and \nthis request was made by Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber.\n  Yet the product remains available, sometimes aggressively pushed. \nAnd, as it relates to this appropriations bill, Essure remains on the \nlist of federally purchased devices. We know that this device has \nalready harmed female veterans.\n  I want to give a direct quote from an Essure Sister and Operation \nEnduring Freedom veteran: ``I still live in massive chronic pain, and \nI'm on pain meds every day of my life. I cannot do the things I used to \ndo with my children and my husband. Each day that I live with this \nnewfound pain and suffering, I grow more and more disgusted at the fact \nthat both he and I traveled to the war multiple times and made it home, \nonly to have a device forced upon us that would ruin our lives and my \nhealth.''\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not about women's reproductive \ndecisions or a debate about contraceptives. It is about protecting our \nfemale veterans from being harmed by a device that we know has ruined \nthe lives of thousands across this Nation. All I am saying is we should \nnot allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to purchase and implant \nthis dangerous device in our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition of this amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DENT. I do want to commend Mr. Fitzpatrick for his diligence and \nhis attentiveness to his constituency. I know he feels very sincerely \nabout this particular amendment. It is, of course, disturbing to hear \nadverse consequences of any drug or device, but we rely on the FDA to \nbe the safety arbiter in these cases.\n  The VA simply follows FDA's approval of drugs and devices. If anyone \nwants to go to the source on this, then that individual should work \nthrough the Agriculture Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the \nFood and Drug Administration. But I believe it is not the proper role \nfor Congress to act as doctors in this case, substituting what appears \nto be anecdotal evidence for the considered judgment of teams of \nindependent doctors and physicians. We also shouldn't influence the \nmarketing of birth control drugs and devices by targeting one \nparticular manufacturer.\n  Again, I do understand my very good friend and colleague's sincere \ndesire based on his conversations with constituents, but at the same \ntime, I do think that we should let the medical experts determine the \nefficacy or the safety of a particular device in this case. So, again, \nI have to rise in opposition.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  I join my chairman in opposing this amendment. Why has my colleague \nagain started the war on women's rights? Why is the gentleman getting \ninvolved in the contraception choices of women veterans?\n  Under VA Directive 1331, it is the policy of the VA to provide \nelective sterilization, for example, salpingectomy, tubal occlusion \nprocedures, vasectomy, and surgery to reverse elective sterilization to \neligible veterans as part of contraceptive and infertility services.\n  I don't see my colleague from Pennsylvania calling for a ban of \nfunding vasectomies or even a tubal ligation, getting tubes tied. Both \nof these are procedures currently allowed. If a woman has decided that \nshe is seeking permanent birth control, why is Congress going to \nmandate that she undergo a surgical procedure?\n  It is important to recognize that family planning is the most \neffective way to prevent abortion and unwanted pregnancies. Study after \nstudy show that when women have access to contraceptives, the incidence \nof abortion decreases. Family planning programs are an extremely \neffective way to support women in improving their own health and that \nof their families. Why would anyone insist on government interference \nin providing health care to women?\n  This amendment also demonstrates the deeply troubling and partisan \napproach on issues affecting women and families.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. In closing, Mr. Chairman, I would say, with all due \nrespect, this is about a dangerous medical device, and there are men \nand women on both sides of the aisle here in the House of \nRepresentatives that have called on the FDA to withdraw\n\n[[Page H2841]]\n\nthe device from the market. There are other options.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the time on the floor tonight.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, Grayson \nNo. 1.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enter into a contract with any offeror or any of \n     its principals if the offeror certifies, as required by \n     Federal Acquisition Regulation, that the offeror or any of \n     its principals:\n       (A) within a three-year period preceding this offer has \n     been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against it \n     for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection \n     with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public \n     (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation \n     of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the \n     submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, \n     forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, \n     making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal \n     criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; or\n       (B) are presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or \n     civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of \n     any of the offenses enumerated above in subsection (A); or\n       (C) within a three-year period preceding this offer, has \n     been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount \n     that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains \n     unsatisfied.\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading be waived.\n  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nFlorida?\n  There was no objection.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nFlorida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is identical to other \namendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every \nappropriations bill considered under an open rule during the 113th and \n114th Congresses.\n  My amendment expands the list of parties with whom the Federal \nGovernment is prohibited from contracting due to serious misconduct on \nthe part of the contractors. I hope that this amendment will remain \nnoncontroversial and be passed unanimously again by the House.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I have no \nobjection.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, again, I have no objection to the gentleman's \namendment. He offered the same amendment last year, and it passed by \nvoice vote. So I certainly urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Boustany\n\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. (a) None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used to pay any bonus or monetary award under chapter \n     45 or 53 of title 5, United States Code, to an employee of \n     the Chief Business Office of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs who is responsible for processing emergency medical \n     care claims until the percentage of emergency medical care \n     claims processed within 30 days reaches 90 percent.\n       (b) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit \n     quarterly data to Congress on the following:\n       (1) The total number of emergency medical claims and the \n     total number of billed charges for such claims.\n       (2) The total number of emergency medical claims and billed \n     charges for such claims pending for more than 30 days.\n       (3) The number of veterans with unpaid claims under \n     consideration in each Veterans Integrated Service Network.\n       (4) The percent of clean claims processed within 30 days.\n\n                              {time}  0040\n\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Louisiana and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, our veterans have put their lives on the \nline to protect this country. The very least we can do is keep our \npromise to take care of them when they return home.\n  But since the passage of the Veterans Access, Choice, and \nAccountability Act of 2014, the VA has demonstrated little progress in \naddressing the emergency medical claims processing backlog hurting our \nveterans.\n  When I pressured the VA for statistics on this issue last year, the \nVA was processing only 14 percent of the claims within 30 days in my \nhome region--14 percent. Since that time, the VA has conveniently \nloosened their timely processing goal from 30 days to 45 days, making \nit impossible to measure real progress.\n  Despite this change in internal procedure, not a single VISN has \nreached a satisfactory timely processing rate. When these claims are \nnot paid on time by the VA, the bill often gets passed onto the \nveteran--in many cases, threatening their personal credit rating. This \nis just unacceptable.\n  While the VA wants to claim it is making progress by changing \ninternal metrics to cook the numbers, it has taken constant pressure \nfrom my office, providers, and veterans groups just to get this agency \nto pay attention and try to do their job.\n  American veterans should never have to worry about calling an \nambulance or taking a trip to the emergency room and wondering whether \nthis will hurt their finances. They should be focused on their health \nand their recovery.\n  My amendment is very simple. It prevents the VA from granting bonuses \nto its emergency medical care claims processing staff until the \npercentage of claims processed within 30 days reaches 90 percent.\n  Mr. Chairman, no business in my home State of Louisiana, or anywhere \nin this country, would ever think about rewarding its employees for \nsuch a poor performance. It has to change. We must demand the highest \nstandard for America's veterans. I encourage my colleagues to hold the \nVA accountable and support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I make a point of order against the amendment \nbecause it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation \nin an appropriation bill and, accordingly, violates clause 2 of rule \nXXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general \nappropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''\n  The amendment gives affirmative direction in effect.\n  So I would ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The CHAIR. Does the gentleman from Louisiana wish to be heard on the \npoint of order?\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I respect the gentleman's call on this \nwith regard to the rules. I would just hope that the members of the \nsubcommittee, as well as my colleagues in the House, would work with us \nto solve this problem once and for all. This is unacceptable.\n  Veterans are getting hurt day in and day out. Their credit ratings \nare suffering. This is one more egregious example----\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman's remarks must be confined to the point of \norder.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. I am not going to defy the point of order. I understand \nthe rule.\n  The CHAIR. Does the gentleman wish to withdraw his amendment?\n\n[[Page H2842]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. No.\n  The CHAIR. Or would the gentleman like a ruling on the point of \norder?\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. I would like a ruling on the point of order.\n  The CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The Chair finds this amendment includes language imparting direction; \nnamely, by requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit \nquarterly data to Congress.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Right here it says ``waives all points of order against \nconsideration of the bill.''\n  Can I seek a clarification on this?\n  Clause 2(e) of rule XXI.\n  The CHAIR. The point of order was sustained under clause 2.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. The base bill, right?\n  The CHAIR. 2(c) of rule XXI.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Thank you.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Gohmert\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this act may \n     be used to establish, maintain, employ, or enter into any \n     contract or agreement with any organization, including a \n     political party, that endorsed, embraced, or encouraged any \n     form of slavery, nor to display the name of such organization \n     nor to have its name displayed in any facility in which or \n     for which funds made available in this act are used.\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on \nthe gentleman's amendment.\n  The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Texas and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, it should be pretty straightforward. My \nfriends on the other side of the aisle continue to push forward \namendments that seem to want to leave the appearance that the \nRepublican Party still wants to retain some fight that it has never \nhad. The Republican Party opposed slavery. The Republican Party and \neverybody that I know of in this Chamber on this side of the aisle has \nnever supported slavery, has never supported anything that wreaks of \nslavery.\n  Daniel Webster, John Quincy Adams, all of those early leaders in this \ncountry, had it very right--it is an abomination. It kept God from \nblessing this country.\n  I am surprised that anyone would wish to reserve a point of order to \ntry to prevent this amendment from going forward. Anything, as my \nfriends across the aisle have repeatedly pointed out, that reminds \npeople of slavery is repugnant and is abhorrent, and I would think that \nthat is something that we could all agree on.\n  If it is an organization that supported slavery, then why would we \nwant to give that organization any more credence and cause those who \nmay have lived through the vestiges of the civil rights problems that \nlasted after slavery?\n  It is time to put this to an end and let the dream of Dr. King \nfinally come to fruition.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I must insist on my point of \norder.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against \nthe amendment because it proposes to change existing law and \nconstitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, \nviolates clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general \nappropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''\n  The amendment requires a new determination.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to speak to the point of order?\n\n                              {time}  0050\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I would address the point of order in that it really \ndoesn't require any new act or law or activity. The thing should speak \nfor itself unless my friend across the aisle has some concerns that \nsome organization he wants to protect has supported slavery, and he is \nseeking to protect that. Otherwise, the law will speak for itself as \ndoes this amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new \ndetermination of whether an organization had ``embraced'' any form of \nslavery.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair, but given \nthe hour, the fact that there aren't that many of us here on the floor \nat this time, that it would require a quorum and would require under \nthe rules an immediate vote, what I will do is withdraw my amendment at \nthis time. I am assured that we will still be taking up limitation \namendments in the morning, and I can offer it at that time without \ndragging all of our friends out of their places of repose at this time.\n  The CHAIR. The amendment has been ruled out of order. The appeal is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nPerry) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4974) \nmaking appropriations for military construction, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2017, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution \nthereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2842-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Swalwell of California (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today \nand the balance of the week on account of a family health emergency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/18/house-section/article/H2842-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 2840.
