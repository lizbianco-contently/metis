The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, when a married couple killed 14 people \ncelebrating the holidays in San Bernardino last Thursday, President \nObama immediately used this terrible tragedy to renew his call for \ntougher gun restrictions.\n  Never mind the fact that the shooting took place in California, which \nhas some of the strictest gun laws in the Nation, or that authorities \nwould quickly determine this rampage was an act of terrorism that \nappears to have been inspired by the Islamic State.\n  This messaging blunder led to last night's televised address from the \nOval Office where President Obama sought to reassure the American \npeople that his administration is taking the threat of terrorism \nseriously. Sadly, the only thing he revealed was he has no \ncomprehensive strategy to confront and defeat ISIS. The President \ncontinues to cling to failing policy.\n  This week the House will vote on a bipartisan bill to update our visa \nwaiver program to reduce the risk of an extremist entering the country \nfrom abroad. However, only the Commander in Chief can provide the wide-\nranging plan that is necessary to eliminate the danger caused by \nradical Islamist terrorism.\n  We need more from President Obama about what can be done with our \nmilitary, our intelligence-gathering, and our international partners. \nWe are facing a new era of violence and terrorism where danger exists \nboth abroad and on American soil. We must do all that we can to \neliminate the extremist threat.\n  It is easy to see why the American people have no faith in the \nFederal Government. While the United States remains one step behind our \nenemy and Americans wonder if our country is safe, the Justice \nDepartment is undermining Congress' spending authority by funneling \nmoney to President Obama's political allies.\n  The Justice Department prosecutes cases against corporate bad actors, \nand those companies agree to settlements that often include financial \npenalties. However, the Department has begun to mandate that at least \nsome of that penalty money be paid in the form of donations to \nnonprofits that allegedly aid consumers and bolster neighborhoods.\n  The purpose of financial penalties is to punish the bad actors and \nprovide restitution to real victims. However, the list of government-\napproved nonprofit beneficiaries reads like a who's who of liberal \nactivist groups. An investigation by the House Judiciary and Financial \nServices Committees revealed that DOJ has used mandatory donations to \ndirect as much as half a billion dollars to these activist groups.\n  These payments also occur entirely outside of the congressional \nappropriations and oversight process. The Miscellaneous Receipts Act \nrequires money received by the government from any source to be \ndeposited in the Treasury. Directing banks to give money to third \nparties evades that statute.\n  Thank goodness the House passed an amendment by Chairman Goodlatte in \nJune that blocks funding for negotiating settlements that require a \ndefendant to donate to an organization or an individual not involved in \nthe litigation. This commonsense amendment passed by voice vote and \nshould absolutely be included in the omnibus spending bill we are \nexpected to vote on this week.\n  It is time for Republicans to confront this administration and \nrestore the people's faith in their government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/house-section/article/H9015-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

She also set \nup boxes at her school so her fellow classmates and teachers could \ncontribute to her efforts.\n  Since 2012, Kara has recycled more than 18,200 granola bar wrappers, \naround 3,500 cereal bags, and approximately 1,800 oral care products. \nMore importantly, proceeds from those items have gone to local \norganizations, including the Boalsburg Cemetery Association and the \nPenn State Figure Skating Club.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is so impressive to see charitable efforts such as \nthis one in the communities we represent.

Mr. Speaker, terrorists shouldn't be able \nto legally buy guns. However, right now, someone on the FBI's terrorist \nwatch list can go into a gun store and buy a firearm of their \nchoosing--legally. Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists \nhave legally purchased weapons in the United States.\n  Last week, House Republicans voted three times to protect the ability \nof suspected terrorists to continue buying guns. This made our country \nless safe.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why I just filed a discharge petition that would \nallow us to vote on a bipartisan bill to close the terror list \nloophole. The bill makes sure those on the FBI's terrorist watch list \ncan't walk into a gun store, pass a background check, and buy a gun.\n  If House Republicans are concerned about the accuracy of the list, \nlet's scrub the list.

That is why it is so \nencouraging to hear the reports from the climate summit in Paris. We \nneed to take action not just domestically, but around the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, in Washington State, we know firsthand how damaging \nclimate change can be. From longer and worsening fire seasons, \nincreased pests and invasive species, an acidifying ocean to more \nunpredictable natural disasters, a vast majority of the population \nrecognizes climate change as a growing problem in need of international \nsolutions.\n  We often hear talk about the debt we will be leaving the next \ngeneration but not enough about the environment we are leaving our \nchildren and our grandchildren.

The \nGreat Lakes are the source of fresh drinking water for literally \nmillions of Americans. Jobs, recreation, and tourism all depend on a \nhealthy and flourishing Great Lakes ecosystem, and we must do all that \nwe can to protect this vital natural resource.\n  Mr. Speaker, microbeads are microscopic pieces of plastic that are \nincluded in products like soaps and cosmetics. They are designed to \nhelp these products to be more effective.

Mr. Speaker, President Obama is misleading \nAmericans about climate change. At a news conference in Paris, the \nPresident claimed that fish are swimming through the streets of Miami \nas a result of climate change. There is indeed something fishy about \nthis story.\n  According to the National Weather Service, south Florida has been \nunder a coastal flood advisory as a result of ``high . . . tides due to \nthe lunar cycle.'' This is the cause of the high tides which \nsubsequently led to flooding in low-lying areas.\n  The alignment of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, along with strong easterly \nwinds, caused the abnormal tides, not climate change.

It is such a difference when you compare what the President \ndid last night--13 minutes is what he had to say about terrorism and \nthe war on terror.\n  I have been reading emails from some of my constituents. Their words \nare this: He is tone deaf, he is in denial, he is the fearful leader--\nthe fearful leader. They want to see leadership that will communicate \nthe message: we are going to find you, we are going to destroy you, and \nwe are going to destroy your networks. That is not what the President \nhas been saying.\n  My constituents see him as being very timid and very hesitant in this \nfight. They feel like that he just does not get it. They have a lot of \nquestions that they are asking me: Why is it that he is so timid in \nfighting terrorism? Could it be that he does not possess the courage to \ncall them out? That he thinks America is to blame for this? Or he \ndoesn't want to offend our enemies?\n  They have declared war on us. It is time for us to confront our \nenemy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/house-section/article/H9017-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9017-H9018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 4, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from South Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a Senate bill that we take up today, but there \nhas actually been a House bill that is almost exactly the same for the \nlast year or so.\n  The story behind how this bill comes to the floor is one of those \nstories that should make folks confident that the system can work. I \nwas on a Facebook townhall meeting about a year and a half ago and got \na question from one of the constituents about all the money that they \nhave heard the government wastes by paying the wrong people, paying \ndead people, or paying people way too much money.\n  I remember it specifically, Mr. Speaker, because shortly after that, \nmy uncle passed away. When my uncle passed away, I was named executor \nof his estate. It was the first time I have ever been the executor of \nan estate. One of the things I remember was that I got a notice 10 days \nafter he had died, very shortly--2 weeks--from the Social Security \nAdministration saying: You are going to get another check for your \nuncle. Don't cash it or else you can be in a lot of trouble.\n  I thought that was really neat. Here is a Federal agency that is \nactually doing its job in very short order and very efficiently. And I \nfiled that away.\n  A couple months later, Mr. Speaker, my good friend from North \nCarolina (Mr. Meadows), who is the subcommittee chairman of the \nGovernment Operations on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, \nwas having a hearing about all of these payments that we are not \nsupposed to be making. I had a chance to ask some questions, and I told \nthat story to the government witnesses from the executive branch who \nwere there. I said: Look, how is it that this works so well in the \nSocial Security Administration, but we have all these tales of all \nthese improper payments going to other people?\n  They said: Well, Mr. Congressman, that is because the Social Security \nAdministration has a really, really good database, and they process the \ninformation very well when folks die.\n  I asked what I thought was a relatively straightforward question: Why \ndon't they share the information with the other Federal agencies?\n  That was the genesis of this bill. What we set out to try and do is \ntry and take circumstances, take examples of where the Federal \nGovernment actually does its job well and use that as a model that can \nbe shared by other parts of the government.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill, by the way, that we are talking about is S. \n614. There was a House version of it that I worked off of, just because \nI am a little bit more familiar with it. It is H.R. 2320. The language \nis almost exactly the same.\n  I want to thank Mrs. Bustos, Mr. Connolly, and also Mr. Carter of \nGeorgia and Mr. Westmoreland of Georgia, who are the original \ncosponsors of this.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill does two very specific, large things and one \nsmall thing. It expands that Social Security database. So it takes \nthis, again, this example of something that actually works the way that \nit is supposed to, and lets other folks use the information.\n  What does that mean? States will now be able to use it. State \ncontractors will now be able to gain access to it. The judicial branch \nwill be able to gain access to it, and the legislative branch will as \nwell.\n  So the example is that this really good information is not being \nshared broadly throughout governments--local, State, and Federal--and \nwe are seeking to fix that in the bill.\n  The other thing the bill does is to expand what is called the Do Not \nPay portal. This is a database that is managed by the United States \nDepartment of the Treasury and contains, again,\n\n[[Page H9020]]\n\nreally good information about who has passed away, how much money \npeople should be receiving, who has moved, and who is entitled to \nbenefits and who is not.\n  By the way, there is a third thing that the bill does, Mr. Speaker. \nIt seems inevitable that we cannot pass a bill here without asking for \na report that goes along with it. But I think it is probably common \nsense to say that at some point in the future, we would like the \nTreasury to tell us if it is actually working.\n  It is not very often, Mr. Speaker, that I come up here and tell you \nthat there are examples of the Federal Government doing its job well; \nbut when we do find those examples, I am very happy to get up and admit \nit. As a small government, conservative Republican, ordinarily I am the \none that says government never does anything right; but here, actually, \nparts and parcels of the Federal Government are doing their job well. \nIf we can take that example, take that model and expand it to other \nparts of the government, we would actually have a chance to solve what \nis a real problem.\n  We spent about $125 billion last year on improper payments, payments \nto people who should not have received it, payments to people who have \npassed away, or payments to people in the wrong amount--$125 billion. \nWe just had a major fight on this floor 2 weeks ago over spending $80 \nbillion extra in the budget bill, yet we spend that much, half again, \non improper payments every single year. In fact, it is one of the \nfastest growing line items in our budget. That $125 billion represents \na 15 percent increase over the previous year. One of the fastest \ngrowing areas of our government is improper payments.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank Mrs. Bustos, Mr. Connolly, Mr. \nCarter of Georgia, and Mr. Westmoreland in the House for helping bring \nthis bill to the floor. Also, I want to thank Senator Carper from \nDelaware and Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin for shepherding it \nthrough the Senate.\n  This is their bill that we are taking. I guess that is another \ninevitability, that, if the Senate has the same bill as the House does, \nthe Senate gets all the credit. But sometimes it is interesting to see \nwhat you can actually accomplish around here, Mr. Speaker, if you don't \nworry about who gets the credit.\n  I do want to thank the folks who took the time and the effort to \nshepherd this very sound, well-considered, and bipartisan bill to the \nfloor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Federal Improper Payments \nCoordination Act before the House this afternoon. I am pleased to join \nmy friend from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) in sponsoring the House \ncompanion of this bipartisan legislation. He has already mentioned the \ncosponsors, Cheri Bustos, Buddy Carter, and Lynn Westmoreland among \nthem. I also want to thank our Senate partners for their work on this \nimportant initiative.\n\n  I want to assure my friend, Mr. Mulvaney, we are going to be marking \nup a companion bill to this tomorrow in our committee, and hopefully we \nwill send it over to the Senate with a House number on it. Fair is \nfair.\n  This is the latest in a series of commonsense, good-government laws \nwe have enacted over the last decade as we work to reduce, if not \noutright eliminate, billions of taxpayer dollars in improper payments \nmade by Federal agencies. The gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. \nMulvaney) pointed out just how large a number this is: $125 billion a \nyear.\n  Now, over a decade, that is $1.25 trillion. That exceeds all of \nsequestration. We wouldn't have to make any cuts to investments or \nraise any taxes to deal with sequestration if we just dealt with this. \nWith the GAO reporting nearly $125 billion of improper payments, it is \nclear that more can and must be done to deal with government waste and \nfraud.\n  Today's legislation would expand the use, as Mr. Mulvaney indicated, \nof the Do Not Pay Initiative to the legislative and judicial branches \nand to our State partners. That initiative was the result of the \nImproper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012, \nwhich was also a product of our committee, and I was pleased to \ncosponsor it at that time.\n  The Do Not Pay Initiative was launched by Treasury and leverages \nmultiple data sources--many of which were formerly siloed--to create a \ncentral, comprehensive list that Federal agencies can quickly reference \nto determine whether an individual or organization is, in fact, \neligible to receive a Federal grant, benefit, or contract; and it also \nallows them to verify such payments after the fact.\n  For example, this initiative has prompted agencies to better share \nthe reporting of death information to help reduce Federal payments to \nthose, obviously, we have lost or for those who have had their \nidentities stolen. Today's legislation would require the Departments of \nDefense and State to report information on deaths that occur overseas \nmore quickly so that the agencies can better detect fraudulent payments \nor recoup improper payments if necessary.\n  Just last week, Mr. Speaker, the Office of Management and Budget \ndelivered its first report to Congress on the Do Not Pay Initiative, \nwhich it says resulted in more than $2 billion in stopped payments--\nthat is to say, savings for the U.S. taxpayer. Obviously, we can, with \nthis bill, increase that number even more.\n  Based on that early success, it makes good sense for us to expand the \nuse of this valuable tool to the legislative and judicial branches, as \nwell as our State partners, so they have the ability to quickly verify \npayments or the eligibility of recipients to receive such payments.\n  This commonsense proposal was a welcomed suggestion from the GAO in \nits latest report on improper payments. I would also add that the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee will continue this work, as I \nindicated, with a markup tomorrow.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Mulvaney, for \nhis leadership on this matter, and I urge our colleagues to support \nthis important reform to our government in making it more efficient and \naccountable to the taxpayer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. \nBustos), my good friend and the cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Connolly and \nCongressman Mulvaney for their hard work on this.\n  Mr. Speaker, as one of the Democratic coleaders of this legislation, \nI am so proud to rise in support of the Federal Improper Payments \nCoordination Act of 2015. The goal of this bill is straightforward: \nsimply, to save taxpayer dollars that are currently going to waste and \nto make the Federal Government more effective and more efficient.\n  Each year, Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government spends billions of \ndollars in improper payments. This not only wastes taxpayer dollars, \nbut it also erodes the public trust in government. Just last year, as \nmy colleagues have pointed out, improper payments by the Federal \nGovernment rose to $125 billion. That is more than $1 trillion over a \ndecade. That is according to the Office of Management and Budget. It is \nalso an increase of 15 percent up from the year before, where it was \n$106 billion. So we are talking about real money here.\n  In tough times, working families have to figure out how to cut costs \nto get their budgets in line. We all know that. I think it is time that \nWashington do the same thing. That is why our bill takes reasonable--\nreasonable--steps to improve information sharing between Federal and \nState agencies to prevent these improper payments.\n  This also helps modernize Federal agencies by putting 21st century \ndata analytics to work in identifying and eliminating governmentwide \nwaste and fraud. The status quo is, plain and simple, not acceptable.\n  At a time when so many working families have to tighten their belts \nand cut costs, they expect Congress to act responsibly with their hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars. This bipartisan legislation represents a \ncommonsense approach to a problem that is costing the taxpayers \nbillions of dollars. This is undermining the effectiveness and the \ncredibility of the Federal Government.\n  I thank Congressman Mulvaney and Congressman Connolly. I think this \nis\n\n[[Page H9021]]\n\nan indication that we know how to work together. I want to applaud my \ncolleagues for joining our efforts to protect taxpayers.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Again, I want to thank my friend, Mrs. Bustos, for her \nleadership on this very important issue.\n  I, also, in closing, just want to say to my friend from South \nCarolina, part of improper payments is also fraud, and the biggest \nchunk of that is Medicare fraud. We need the help of U.S. Attorney's \nOffices to go after that. I am aware of one U.S. Attorney's Office last \nyear that identified and recovered $3 billion of Medicare fraud. Now, I \nbelieve there are 99 U.S. Attorney's Offices in the United States. If \nevery one of them made going after this fraud a priority, I assure you, \nwe could significantly reduce improper payments by a commensurate \namount. I would be glad to work with him and my friend, Mrs. Bustos, on \na bipartisan basis to address that aspect of it as well.\n  Again, I want to thank Mr. Mulvaney for his leadership and for the \nbipartisan approach we have approached this legislation.\n  We have no more speakers on our side, Mr. Speaker.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge \nadoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 614.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/07/house-section/article/H9021-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9021-H9022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MICROBEAD-FREE WATERS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. UPTON.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1321, the \nMicrobead-Free Waters Act of 2015.\n  I am pleased to have partnered with my friend, Energy and Commerce \nCommittee Ranking Member Frank Pallone from New Jersey, on this very \nimportant bill to begin the phaseout of plastic microbeads, which you \ncan see in this picture, literally the size of a pinhead sometimes on a \npenny, to begin the phaseout of plastic microbeads from personal care \nproducts on July 1, 2017.\n  Many folks might be wondering, what exactly is a microbead? Well, I \nam sure many of you here and at home are using products that contain \nmicrobeads without even realizing it. Microbeads are those tiny little \nscrubbers in cleansers, body scrubs, and even toothpaste. On their own, \nthey are nearly invisible, smaller than a pinhead, as I indicated.\n  But once they are flushed down the drain, that is when the problem \nreally begins. They are so small they easily flow through the water \nfiltration systems and end up in our bodies of water, obviously, \nincluding the Great Lakes, where I hail from. They are known to absorb \npollutants and often mistaken as food by fish and wildlife. Simply put, \nmicrobeads are causing megaproblems.\n  As someone who grew up on Lake Michigan and represents a large chunk \nof the Michigan coastline, I understand firsthand how important it is \nto maintain the beauty and integrity of our Great Lakes and all of our \nwater systems. The Great Lakes have survived many a foe--severe \npollution, oil spills, discharge from refineries, zebra mussels, and \nattempts to steal our water, just to name a few. We are going to fight \nany activity that puts our beloved Great Lakes in jeopardy.\n  Many State and local governments have created a patchwork of \ndiffering laws, which creates problems for interstate commerce. This \nbipartisan legislation will also preempt all State and local laws \nrelated to microbeads in cosmetics, which will ensure certainty for \nmanufacturers and other job creators across the country.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in ending this pesky problem of \nmicrobeads. They are tiny plastic, but big time pollution. As \nMichigan's Holland Sentinel editorialized this past spring, ``There's \nno reason keeping our faces feeling clean should require us to trash \nour lakes.''\n  I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1321, the Microbead-\nFree Waters Act of 2015.\n  This legislation sets up a strong Federal program to ban the use of \nplastic microbeads in personal care products. I would like to \npersonally thank Chairman Fred Upton for working with me to introduce \nand move this important legislation.\n  Plastic microbeads have been in use in cosmetic products, such as \nface washes and toothpaste, for many years. These tiny plastic beads \nare often used as exfoliants, removing dead skin cells from the surface \nof the skin. While these plastic particles are not harmful to the user \nof the product, in recent years, studies have shown that these tiny \nparticles that are often washed down the drain are making it through \nthe wastewater treatment process and ending up in our Nation's \nwaterways. We must put a stop to this unnecessary and avoidable \npollution.\n\n[[Page H9022]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, studies conducted in the Great Lakes, the world's \nlargest source of freshwater, have turned up alarmingly high levels of \nmicroplastic. In addition to contributing to the buildup of plastic \npollution in waterways, microbeads can often be mistaken by fish and \nother organisms as food. I have serious concerns about fish and other \naquatic life potentially ingesting these particles and the effect this \ncould have on humans who consume fish that have ingested the plastic.\n  Numerous natural, biodegradable alternatives to plastic microbeads \nalready exist in commerce and product supply chains, including apricot \nseeds, walnut shells, and pecan shell powder. Several personal care \nproduct companies have already announced plans to phase out the use of \nplastic microbeads in their products in favor of natural exfoliants.\n  Beginning with Illinois in 2014, nine States have enacted some form \nof a ban on plastic microbeads in personal care products. Yet, in my \nopinion, we need a national solution. Our Nation's waterways do not \nalways respect State boundaries. In order to put a stop to these \nplastic particles making their way into our oceans, lakes, and streams, \nwe need to ban plastic microbeads in every State.\n  The legislation before us today is the product of bipartisan input \nsince it has moved through the committee process. Chairman Upton and I \nhave worked to strengthen and clarify a number of provisions in the \nbill, most notably, by setting up an aggressive timetable for the \nphaseout of these products, which begins in 2017, earlier than any of \nthe currently enacted State laws.\n  The legislation exclusively bans the use of biodegradable plastic as \nan alternative ingredient, a loophole that has been discovered in a \nnumber of existing State laws. Many of the State laws contain a \nprovision allowing companies to transition to biodegradable plastic as \nan alternative ingredient, and little is known about the ability of \nthese biodegradable plastics to break down in a marine environment.\n  The language we used to define the scope of this bill was carefully \nchosen. Plastic microbead is defined as any solid plastic particle that \nis less than 5 millimeters in size and is used to exfoliate or cleanse \nthe human body. This definition limiting the scope to exfoliating \nproducts is also in all nine State-passed laws, and it focuses the \nprohibition on the products currently containing plastic microbeads \nthat are being washed down the drain.\n  The bill also includes preemption of State laws regulating plastic \nmicrobeads and cosmetics. While I am typically not a supporter of \npreempting State law, the strong Federal standard we have developed is \nmore protective and implementation will occur sooner than in any State \nlaw in place.\n  Mr. Speaker, limiting pollution in our Nation's waterways has always \nbeen one of my top priorities. It is an issue that helps further \ncreation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 after the \nCuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire. While much progress has been made, \nwe must continue our efforts to protect America's waterways. And by \nbanning plastic microbeads in personal care products, we are taking one \nmore step towards a cleaner and healthier environment in America.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Again, \nthank our Chairman Upton, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to take this time to thank my colleague, Mr. \nPallone. This was his legislation, which I cosponsored, as he \nindicated. We moved it through regular order, lots of hearings, a \nunanimous vote in subcommittee and full committee, and we want to get \nthis bill to the President for him to sign.\n  As I have talked to Members of the Great Lakes Coalition, our \ncolleagues in the Great Lakes States--Republican and Democrat--but also \nour Senators from the Great Lakes as well, there is huge interest in \ngetting this bill to the President. It will, indeed, make a difference. \nThe phaseout time was appropriate, so, in essence, we are telling the \nmanufacturers to stop making it, and a time then for them to see the \nproducts off the shelf, so that ultimately, they will not be in \ncosmetics or toothpaste and other personal care products.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this. I \nlook forward to passing it on a bipartisan vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me thank the chairman again. As he pointed out, this truly has \nbeen a bipartisan effort. There is also a Senate bill that is \nbipartisan that this matches, which I think was a strong indication \nthat we can get this bill not only passed here, but also in the Senate \nand get it to the President's desk.\n  I should also point out that this is one of those occasions, which \nhappens quite a bit, even though people don't realize it, where the \nindustry is actually in cooperation with us, and the cosmetic products \nindustry supports this initiative as well.\n  For all those reasons, let's get the bill passed, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
