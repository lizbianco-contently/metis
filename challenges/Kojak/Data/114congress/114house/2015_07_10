Mr. Speaker, they say that great things come in small \npackages, and that could not be more true of the Reagan sisters of \nRogers, Arkansas. I rise today in gratitude to them.\n  Agnes Lytton, Mary Sue, and Betty Lynn Reagan were born and raised in \nnorthwest Arkansas and attended the University of Arkansas-\nFayetteville.\n  While Agnes Lytton left Arkansas to pursue a career in library \nscience, Mary Sue and Betty Lynn, who stood about 5 feet tall, were \ngiants in the classroom, spending a combined 94 years teaching history \nand government to students in the Rogers School District.\n  Throughout their distinguished careers, both were decorated with \ncountless awards and accolades, and in 1989 the city of Rogers named \nits newest school Reagan Elementary as a token of our appreciation for \ntheir dedication to our students and their faithful support of the \ncommunity. As their former mayor, I can attest to both.\n  Although these most respected members of our community have passed \non, they won't soon be forgotten, and now their legacies will live on \nat the U of A, as it was announced on Monday that the sisters, in a \nfinal tribute to northwest Arkansas education, designated a $1.2 \nmillion estate gift to support the libraries of their alma mater.\n\n[[Page H5034]]\n\n  I can say without hesitation that the Reagan sisters made northwest \nArkansas a better place, and for that, we are eternally grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5034-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE CONFEDERATE FLAG\n\n  (Mr. NADLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, we must not display the Confederate battle \nflag in any Federal park or cemetery or building. The Confederate flag \nrepresents racism, slavery, and treason, waging war against the United \nStates, killing American soldiers.\n  We are told it represents the Southern heritage. It does represent \npart of the Southern, of the American heritage, a shameful part: the \ndefense of slavery, of owning people body and soul, of the doctrine of \nracial superiority, and the practice of racial oppression.\n  Other countries and peoples have shameful parts of their heritages. \nGermany, for example, has a Nazi heritage. The Germans are properly \nashamed of it. They prohibit, by law, the display of Nazi imagery. The \nFirst Amendment won't let us go that far, but we should not honor the \nshameful parts of our history.\n  As we continue the ongoing struggle to eradicate racism from American \nlife, we must no longer honor racism and treason by allowing the \nConfederate flag on any Federal property.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5034-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     21ST CENTURY CURES INITIATIVE\n\n  (Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, the 21st Century Cures \ninitiative has a lot of positive measures to help medical innovation \nreach its full potential. I would like to focus on just one of the many \nreasons to support this legislation.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting with the family of Garrett Coyne, \nstaunch advocates for cures for rare diseases. Garrett is a 5-year-old \nresident of Gilbertsville, who 10 months ago was diagnosed with a rare \nneurodegenerative disorder often called Batten disease. Garrett was \nborn and developed normally, but since September the disease has left \nhim legally blind and has greatly weakened his physical and mental \nabilities. Unfortunately, Batten disease presently has no treatment, no \ncure, and is not preventable.\n  While the road ahead for Garrett and his family is daunting, there is \nhope. It is because of provisions in the 21st Century bill that \nresearchers will have the tools to work toward developing medical \nadvancement for Batten disease.\n  By modernizing medical innovation and increasing NIH funding, a more \npromising future for patients, families, and innovators is in front of \nus. I am supporting the 21st Century Cures bill for many reasons, but \nthe main one is this effort to help children, like 5-year-old Garrett \nand other constituents in my district who are challenged daily with the \nstruggles of a rare disease. I encourage my colleagues to join me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5034-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE CONFEDERATE FLAG BELONGS IN THE ASHBIN OF HISTORY\n\n  (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn House \nRepublicans' secretive attempt in the dead of Wednesday night to permit \nthe display of the racist Confederate flag in national parks and \ncemeteries.\n  In the wake of the Charleston murders, our Nation is moving toward \nthe removal of the flag from public places. Later today, the State of \nSouth Carolina will remove the flag from its capitol grounds. And yet, \nwhile this is happening, the Republican majority has sought to \nassociate itself and this body with the racist legacy of the \nConfederate flag.\n  To add insult to injury, yesterday, when House Democrats tried to \nbring up a resolution removing any State flag displaying the \nConfederate battle flag from the Capitol except in very limited \ncircumstances, the majority turned their backs and ignored the cries of \nmillions of Americans who are calling for its permanent ban.\n  Republican leadership ought to be ashamed for associating themselves \nwith this symbol of racism, hatred, and intolerance. This body should \nmove swiftly to relegate the Confederate flag to museums and the ashbin \nof history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5034-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BASIN AND RANGE NATIONAL MONUMENT\n\n  (Mr. HARDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HARDY. Madam Speaker, what were you doing last night at midnight? \nIf you were like me and most Americans, you were probably asleep.\n  But last night, while America was sleeping, the White House was busy. \nThe White House was busy notifying the public, literally in the dark of \nthe night, about the President's intentions to designate more than \n700,000 acres of Lincoln and Nye Counties as the Basin and Range \nNational Monument.\n  Madam Speaker, at 2 p.m. this afternoon, you won't see a debate on \nthe floor of the House, the people's House, on the Basin and Range \nMonument. There will be no vote for Nevada's elected representatives, \nbut there will be a photo op to capture the exchange of political favor \nfor one Nevadan. It will be a scene demonstrating that having friends \nin high places is more important than popular will of the people.\n  But legacy building in the twilight of one's career shouldn't be the \ndriver for our Nation's public lands. According to press reports, it is \nsaid when asked about the heartfelt concerns of Nevadans who oppose the \nmonument, the President responded: ``I don't care. I want this done.''\n  Madam Speaker, I do care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5034-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LONG-TERM FUNDING WILL HELP THE NATION\n\n  (Mr. TED LIEU of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speaker, when it comes to the \nhighway trust fund, it feels like the movie ``Groundhog Day'' over and \nover again, where once again we are faced with the expiration of this \nimportant fund.\n  We know from a recent Department of Transportation report that 54 \npercent of our roads and highways are deemed to be poor, one in four \nbridges are structurally deficient, and we need to fund this highway \ntrust fund at its full capacity, and we need to do it on a long-term \nbasis. We can't continue to do it on a short-term basis. It is not \nhelpful to our State and local governments. We can't get projects off \nthe ground.\n  I request that the Republican majority put a bill on the floor that \nfunds the highway trust fund on a long-term basis. And we know that \nthis will help our Nation, because for every dollar we invest in \ninfrastructure, we get over $2 back in economic output.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5034-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5034-H5035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MILITARY REDUCTIONS SEND THE WORST POSSIBLE MESSAGE TO OUR ADVERSARIES\n\n  (Mr. CARTER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I have long opposed reductions in \nour military, and I continue to believe that our Nation should maintain \na robust land force. The announcement to reduce the Army by 40,000 \ntroops sends the worst possible message to our Nation's adversaries. \nCuts that extend into heavy armored combat units go even further to \nweaken our national defense and put us at risk.\n  I am especially disappointed about the Army's plan to cut so heavily \nfrom Fort Hood and the State of Texas. The Army's decision to implement \na roughly 9 percent reduction at the Great Place is outrageous. I have \nserious concerns about the logic and analysis that went into this \ndecision to reduce so many troops from Texas.\n  Perhaps the most sickening part of the whole matter, however, is the \ndamage these cuts will do to the soldiers and their families who will \nbe asked to leave the Army after decades of sacrifice in time of war. \nIn the coming days, I will be pressing the Army for clarification on \ntheir analysis and justification for their decisions.\n\n[[Page H5035]]\n\n  This Nation can do better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5035-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  (Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, here we are once again. I rise to ask my \ncolleagues to pass a long-term--a long-term--reauthorization to the \nhighway trust fund before it crashes into a dead end, to the very worst \nthat can happen to America.\n  This is about the dysfunction of Washington. It is what everybody \ndetests: the lack of predictability; we will just kick the can down the \nroad a little bit further. This is exactly what hurts our economy. \nNobody can plan for what is going to happen in the next few months, let \nalone the next few years.\n  This is our country. Don't shut it down. Don't put a sign that says, \n``Closed due to lack of construction.''\n  This is killing our economy. This is killing jobs in America, and I \nask for us to pass a long-term bill. I know in Washington long term \nmight seem a day or two. We are just asking for 6 years, to give \npredictability so our highways are the best that they can be, that we \ncan have our commerce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5035-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, yesterday, Committee on \nForeign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce, with Ranking Member Eliot Engel, \nconducted an informative hearing on the implications of the nuclear \nagreement with Iran.\n  The witnesses who provided enlightening testimony were the Honorable \nStephen Rademaker, Dr. Michael Doran, Dr. Michael Makovsky, and Dr. \nKenneth Pollack. Their varying opinions confirm my concerns, as \nexpressed in a July 6 editorial from The Washington Post:\n  ``If it is reached in the coming days, a nuclear deal with Iran will \nbe, at best, an unsatisfying and risky compromise. Iran's emergence as \na threshold nuclear power, with the ability to produce a weapon \nquickly, will not be prevented; it will be postponed by 10 to 15 years. \nIn exchange, Tehran will reap hundreds of billions of dollars in \nsanctions relief it can use to revive its economy and fund the wars it \nis waging around the Middle East.''\n  The President needs to change course and recognize that moral \nrelativism is dangerous with opponents who promote ``Death to America, \nDeath to Israel.'' The President can avoid a legacy of fanatics with \nnuclear warheads on ICBMs targeting American families.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and the President, by his \nactions, must never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5035-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0915\n                             INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in House Report 114-193.\n  Mr. BRAT. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 5, beginning on line 6, strike paragraph (1) and \n     insert the following:\n       (1) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the NIH and Cures Innovation Fund \n     $1,860,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2016 through 2020.\n       Page 13, beginning on line 3, strike subsection (f).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 350, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Brat) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BRAT. Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I rise to support my amendment against the creation of a new \nmandatory program.\n  Some on the other side have called my amendment a poison pill. I \nconsider that a compliment. A poison pill was reserved for the man who \nbrought human reason to Greece. I similarly would like to bring a bit \nof reason to bear on the budget process of the United States.\n  We are currently $127 trillion light on mandatory spending at \npresent. This means by 2027, all Federal revenues will be spent on only \nmandatory programs. This is a disaster.\n  My children right now are 13 and 16. By the time they are about 30, \nwe will have zero dollars for running the government because all \ndollars will be spent on these mandatory programs.\n  We all want cures, and I am for the underlying bill--make no \nmistake--but in economics, rationality requires that we rank our \npreferences in order and fund the best programs. This is one of them.\n  There is no issue finding $2 billion out of a $3.5 trillion budget, \nbut currently, there is no discipline up here in this city. We just \nfund everything and hand the bill to the next generation.\n  Every mandatory program starts off with high hopes, but go to the \ntrustee reports on the major mandatory programs today, and you will \nfind that they are all insolvent by around 2030 as well.\n  Today, you will hear all sorts of fancy terminology about pay-fors \nand oil reserves and deficits, but don't be fooled. Our annual deficit \nspending is about $500 billion right now and on its way to a trillion \nin a few more years.\n  We are off course on every front. We always talk about the children, \nbut at present, we are handing our children $18 trillion in debt and \nanother $127 trillion in mandatory programs.\n  You want the truth? The children are the only group up here on \nCapitol Hill without a lobbyist, and that is why they are getting \ntrashed.\n  If you want a cure, go to a doctor; but if you want to clean up the \nU.S. economy, please consult an economist or two. The numbers in the \nstory I have given are not in dispute. The only issue is whether we \nhave the resolve to balance our budgets and leave our children a \nbrighter day.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Madam Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment because making this \nfunding discretionary and subject to later appropriations is critically \nshortsighted for two reasons.\n  We thought that this might be a placebo amendment, but yes, it really \nis a poison pill that would undermine the victories the Republicans \nsecured in 21st Century Cures, including transformative regulatory \nreforms at FDA and permanent entitlement savings in both Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  Second, supporting the amendment means voting against the critical \nbalance that we found to pay for these investments using mandatory \nsavings in a way that reduces the deficit in working with the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  According to the CBO, this bill will reduce the deficit by some $500-\nplus million over the first 10 years, and we conservatively estimate \nthat it cuts $7 billion in the second decade.\n  Third, more than 100 organizations have joined together to oppose \nthis amendment. They represent a cross-section of organizations, \nincluding patient groups, universities, veterans, innovators, and \nmedical providers.\n  I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Brat amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRAT. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Chair, the greatest danger facing our country \nis a national debt that now exceeds our entire economy. This year, we \nspent $230 billion just to pay interest on that debt.\n  The CBO warns that, on our current trajectory, interest payments will \nexceed our entire defense budget just 8 years from now. Behold the \nchaos in Greece, and consider that our Nation is not far behind.\n  Congress has labored mightily to enact a budget that saves us from \nthis dismal future, but having set that course, we must stay that \ncourse. The underlying bill makes many worthy changes in law, but it \nevades the discipline the budget requires to save our country from the \nfate of Greece.\n  Mr. Brat's amendment places this bill back within the boundaries of \nthe\n\n[[Page H5070]]\n\nbudget without budget gimmickry and can be easily accommodated by \ncutting lower priority spending. The question before us is whether we \nwill fund our priorities responsibly or follow Greece to ruin.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pallone), my friend and the ranking member of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chairwoman, if we want to speed the pace of \ninnovation and development of new treatment and cures, we must increase \nfunding to NIH.\n  We all know the numbers. NIH has $8.2 billion less to spend in fiscal \nyear 2015 than it had in fiscal year 2003, when adjusted for inflation. \nThat funding erosion has reduced the application success rate, leaving \npromising research ideas to languish due to lack of funding. It has \nalso left many young and midcareer scientists wondering whether they \ncan support themselves through a career in biomedical research.\n  The NIH and Cures innovation fund aims to reverse that trajectory by \nproviding $8.7 in mandatory funding over a 5-year period. Providing \nmandatory funding through the innovation fund would ensure that NIH has \nincreased funding to make critical investments in research that will \nhelp us deliver on the promise of the 21st Century Cures Act, to \naccelerate the pace of scientific advancement that leads to life-\nimproving and lifesaving treatments and cures.\n\n  Madam Chairwoman, without this funding stream, H.R. 6, I think, will \nbe ineffective; and I urge Members to reject the Brat amendment.\n  I am in strong opposition to the Brat amendment.\n  Mr. BRAT. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry).\n  Mr. PERRY. Madam Chair, I support the 21st Century Cures Act \nunderlying text, and I thank the chairman. It has been masterful work.\n  And who wouldn't? Who doesn't want to do something in Congress about \nthese horrific, debilitating diseases that plague our families? We all \ndo, but targeting additional NIH funding for cures remains critical. We \nabsolutely all support it, but I don't support how we are paying for \nit--because we are not.\n  Many of us who preach about the problems associated with mandatory \nspending have used the same board I use in my townhall meetings. People \nhave seen this, and they know where we are headed. It is the biggest \ndriver of future debt.\n  We are creating more mandatory spending as we speak, and we are \nplacing the burden of paying for it on people that aren't even alive \nyet. It is incredible.\n  I have championed the need for providing a cure for rare diseases and \nthe things that plague members of our citizenry since I have been here. \nOne thing missing from this bill is the legalization of CBD. This act \nseems to forget about children with epilepsy and their desperate need \nfor a cure.\n  I ask for support of this amendment simply to shift the money from \nmandatory to discretionary and force us to make the tough decisions we \ncame here to make.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Gene Green), the ranking member on the Health Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I thank the chair of the \ncommittee for yielding.\n  If you like how we are doing research right now, then you need to \nsupport the Brat amendment because we are not funding research \nadequately. Everybody says that. That is why there are so many \nsupporters in the private sector and also 230 cosponsors of this bill.\n  The sponsor of the amendment called it a poison pill. I don't think \nthere is anything more appropriate than that for this amendment, \nbecause this bill is intended to save people's lives and to make people \nhave a better lifestyle. When you take a poison pill, you die. That is \nwhat will happen if we do not do mandatory spending in this bill.\n  This bill is paid for. You can rail against mandatory spending, but \nthere are cuts in other parts of the Federal budget that will pay for \nthis. Don't let anybody delude themselves into thinking that this is \nincreasing spending.\n  We are cutting spending while we are trying to redirect it to the NIH \nand FDA to have these new therapies and also get them through the \napproval process.\n  Mr. BRAT. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Issa).\n  Mr. ISSA. Madam Chair, in this short 1 minute, I will close by \nreminding people that Ronald Reagan so notably said: ``Nothing lasts \nlonger than a temporary government program.''\n  This is a permanent program that is only paid for in offsets at one-\nquarter what it costs, and that is an estimate. If the cost goes up, it \nwill spend even more.\n  Understand that we are selling the strategic petroleum reserves to \npay for the vast majority of this 5-year program, and then we are \ntaking 10 years to pay for the remainder.\n  This is a gimmick. It is not paid for. Do not be fooled. If you are a \nfiscal conservative, you must consider this not a permanent entitlement \nand vote for the Brat amendment because, if you don't, what you are \ndoing is unfairly adding to this debt.\n  I would vote for this if it was paid for. Madam Chair, it is not paid \nfor. It is a fraudulent pay-for by any possible means of this body.\n  Please, vote for the Brat amendment because this is not a pay-for \nentitlement.\n  Mr. BRAT. I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to refrain from trafficking \nthe well while another Member is under recognition.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Fattah) for a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. FATTAH asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I rise in favor of the underlying bill and \nin opposition to this poison-pill amendment.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chairman, let me just say to the gentleman from \nCalifornia, it is paid for. CBO has certified that all of it is paid \nfor.\n  Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Brooks), a member of the committee.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Chairman, I rise today to voice my \nunwavering support for 21st Century Cures and vehement opposition to \nthe amendment before us.\n  What the authors of this specific amendment fail to grasp is that \n21st Century Cures will actually advance real conservative reforms to \nthe entitlement system that will reduce the deficit and save our Nation \nbillions of dollars.\n  There are real cuts in this bill. CBO has scored it. And since when \nare we ignoring CBO?\n  These reforms didn't happen overnight. This legislation is the result \nof well over a year of thoughtful and purposeful negotiations.\n  Unfortunately, the backers of this amendment cannot see the forest \nfor the trees. Contrary to the misinformation that led them to craft \nit, the innovation fund is not forever on autopilot. It sunsets after 5 \nyears. Those are 5 solid years where we can recruit the top minds to \ninvestigate cures that will change and save lives, yes, the lives of \nour children and the next generation.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with me in opposition, in addition to \nthe over 100 groups who are opposed to the Brat amendment, groups of \npatient groups, universities, veterans, innovators, medical providers. \nEvery one of these groups urges Members to vote ``no'' on the Brat \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Brat).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BRAT. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \nwill be postponed.\n\n[[Page H5071]]\n\n            Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Young of Indiana\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-193.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 6, line 19, strike ``409K'' and insert ``409L''.\n       Page 15, after line 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1002.

Pursuant to House Resolution 350, the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Young) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Madam Chair, I want to thank Mr. Upton for his \nwork on the 21st Century Cures Act, finally making medical \nbreakthroughs a national priority. With this bill, we will extend the \nlongevity and improve the lives of millions of Americans now and in the \nfuture. And in the process, we will dramatically reduce the taxpayer \nmoney we spend to treat sick Americans.\n  With all that in mind, I want to highlight an amendment that my \nthoughtful and hard-working colleague, Dr. Harris of Maryland, and I \nhave worked on, and I urge my colleagues' support. This amendment would \ncreate within NIH a structure for a medical prize program.\n  The United States is currently spending $632 billion per year through \njust one program, Medicare, to cover health services of qualified \nbeneficiaries. To help lower taxpayer costs as well as\n\n[[Page H5072]]\n\nimprove patient outcomes, this amendment will offer modest monetary \nrewards to those outside of government who can develop significant \nmedical breakthroughs.\n  The medical prize program will encourage scientists and \nentrepreneurs, especially those that don't typically receive NIH \ngrants, to develop cost-saving, life-improving cures for some of the \nmost debilitating diseases that afflict our young and old.\n  With those thoughts in mind, I urge your support of the amendment, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, while I appreciate the efforts of the \namendment's sponsors, I cannot support the Young-Harris amendment.\n  As currently drafted, the amendment threatens to undermine the \nindependent peer review process that is the bedrock of NIH funding by \ninjecting politics into the development and implementation of the prize \ncompetition.\n  The amendment would create an innovation prize advisory board to \nassist the NIH Director in carrying out the prize competition that is \ncomposed of nine members, four of which are politically appointed. It \nwould also take away resources from existing research grant programs \nand other research efforts at NIH.\n  It would require NIH to put money on reserve for the prize \ncompetition, money that would go back into the Treasury instead of \nfunding research if the prize is not won in a given fiscal year.\n  While I am not opposed to the potential of setting up a prize-like \nsystem--in fact, NIH already has such authority--I would prefer to work \nwith the sponsors on the language to find a more appropriate way to \naccomplish their goals. Therefore, I would urge my colleagues to vote \n``no.''\n  Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. UPTON. I would just like to say as chairman of the committee that \nI look forward to working with the gentleman on the language. I think \nthis is an important amendment. I am going to speak in favor of it on \nMr. Young's time in a moment.\n  But I just want to pledge that we will work with you on language that \ncertainly we can all accept, knowing that the goal is a very good one.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I appreciate that. Thank you.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Madam Chair, I would just add that the purpose \nof this amendment, obviously, well received on both sides of the \naisle--perhaps there are particulars we can work on--is to catalyze \nmore innovation among the thousands, tens of thousands of entrepreneurs \nand innovators around this country, really around the world.\n  If we can get more minds collectively thinking about medical \nbreakthroughs, about actually curing diseases, as a preventative \nmeasure, we can save significant amounts of money in the long term. We \ncan dramatically improve lives in the shorter term.\n  This is a model that opens up Federal Government funding as a reward \nfor these innovations to our Nation's innovators, our entrepreneurs, \nour doers.\n  Right now, the NIH grant process is suboptimal for a lot of these \nindividuals. I can speak to one individual. He used to be my neighbor, \nFazni Aziz, of Bloomington, Indiana. He is a Thomas Edison-like figure, \nand he used to have a workshop right next to his house. He developed \nmedical devices on his own and sold them off to larger companies.\n  Fazni Aziz would not receive an NIH grant. He will never apply for \none. He doesn't have time to apply for one. Would he target a medical \ninnovation on account of a prize that is offered? Indeed. We have \nconsulted with him.\n  So for the people like Fazni Aziz around the world that can help \nAmericans, we have developed this prize program.\n  Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nUpton), the chairman.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I do rise in support of this important \namendment that, with Mr. Young and Dr. Harris, would authorize the NIH \nto conduct a prize program. The intent of the amendment is, in fact, to \nincentivize health innovation by offering competitors the chance to win \na prize for developing breakthroughs. We ought to be encouraging that.\n  Importantly, individuals who win the prize competition would keep all \nof the intellectual property rights. I think that is very important.\n  So I would ask my colleagues to support the amendment. I look forward \nto working with both sides of the aisle to make sure that we can, in \nfact, perfect it as we get to the end of the cycle and, ultimately, to \nthe President's desk.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Young).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-193.\n  Ms. LEE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 13, strike lines 8 through 13 (and make such \n     conforming changes as may be necessary).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 350, the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LEE. Madam Chair, I am very pleased to offer this amendment with \nmy colleagues, two great women, Representative Jan Schakowsky and \nRepresentative Yvette Clarke.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It would strike a provision in this \nbill that applies to any policy riders included in the annual Labor, \nHealth and Human Services and Agricultural appropriations bills to the \nnew National Institutes of Health funds and the Federal Drug \nAdministration funds included in H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act.\n  This provision reiterates the current law restrictions on \nappropriations bills, like the Hyde amendment, which is restrictive and \ndiscriminatory against low-income women to make their own reproductive \nhealthcare decisions. Now this would apply to this new fund created for \nthe NIH in this bill.\n  Let's be clear what this is really about. It is yet another attempt \nto insert abortion restrictions and other inappropriate riders into an \nunrelated bill.\n  This is a bill to increase biomedical innovative research. The 21st \nCentury Cures Act should have been a noncontroversial, bipartisan \neffort. But anti-choice leaders could not help but add this to the bill \nafter--mind you, after--it had passed out of committee on a bipartisan \nvote. It is really outrageous and part of a larger effort to force the \ninclusion of these harmful Hyde restrictions in multiple and unrelated \nbills.\n  We know that these dangerous policies disproportionately affect low-\nincome women and women of color. So our amendment is about removing \nthese inappropriate and consistent attacks on a woman's right to make \nher own healthcare decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to protecting a woman's right to \nchoose.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Pitts), the chairman of the Health Subcommittee.\n  Mr. PITTS. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the Lee amendment. If \npassed, this amendment would allow the National Institutes of Health to \nuse taxpayer dollars to conduct experiments involving abortion or to \nhone abortion techniques.\n  Let me be clear. The underlying bill simply applies current Federal \nhealth policies that have been approved by both Republican and Democrat \nmajorities for decades to new funds appropriated in the Cures bill. It \nis nothing\n\n[[Page H5073]]\n\nmore than the status quo applied to new funding.\n  There is a reason why these policies are the status quo. Americans do \nnot want their tax dollars used to destroy unborn lives. A poll \nconducted just this January showed 68 percent of Americans oppose \ntaxpayer funding for abortion.\n  H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act, is about finding cures and \nprotecting the health and well-being of Americans. It would be a \nterrible injustice if a bill designed to save lives were to become a \nconduit for the destruction of the most vulnerable, the voiceless \nunborn who are still too young to be heard crying out for help.\n  I urge all Members to oppose this amendment.\n  Ms. LEE. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Chair, I am proud to join Congresswoman Lee and \nCongresswoman Clarke in offering this amendment.\n  Our amendment would strike the policy riders that were added to the \n21st Century Cures Act after it passed unanimously the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, 51-0.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  Most notably, our amendment would remove the unnecessary addition of \nthe Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment is a discriminatory policy that \ndenies millions of women the full range of healthcare choices, and it \nhas no business being included in this legislation.\n  It is time for us to stop using these bills as a way to discriminate \nagainst women. Going forward, as far as I am concerned, I will not \nsupport any bill that adds such language.\n  It is time for us to stop taking away health services from low-income \nwomen, from women serving in the military, from Federal employees, and \nfrom every woman who relies on the Federal Government for her health \ninsurance. All women, regardless of their incomes and what insurance \nthey have, deserve to make their own health choices.\n  This harmful provision is unrelated to the goals of this otherwise \nbipartisan landmark legislation, and I ask that Members vote in favor \nof our amendment.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), the vice chair of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Chairman, I do rise in opposition to this \namendment. I think it is important to realize a couple of things.\n  The American people have spoken out on this issue. Sixty-eight \npercent of all Americans oppose taxpayer dollars being used for \nabortions. Seventy-one percent of all millennials oppose this.\n  What the Lee amendment would do is strip away bipartisan agreements \nthat we use in appropriations bills. This is not something that is new. \nIt is not language that is new.\n  The Hyde amendment and the Hyde language has been around for a very \nlong time. The Lee amendment would reverse important limitations to \nprotect these taxpayer dollars.\n  I have mentioned the opposition to abortion. There is also \nprohibition for the use of public funds to advocate for gun control, \nlimit Federal grants from being awarded to tax cheats. Do we really \nwant tax cheats being able to get Federal dollars?\n  It limits extravagant conference spending for public employees. Do we \nreally want them to be able to waste these dollars? Of course not. Of \ncourse not.\n  That is why this language is in the bill. I encourage my colleagues \nto vote against the Lee amendment.\n  Ms. LEE. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Ms. Clarke), another cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam Chair, today I rise in support of the \nLee-Schakowsky-Clarke amendment, and I thank them for their leadership \nin advancing this amendment.\n  H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act, which received unanimous support \nfrom members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, demonstrates that \nDemocrats and Republicans can work together in an effort to develop \nmedicines, treatments, and cures that will save lives.\n  Unfortunately, our bipartisan consensus has been undermined by a \nlast-minute inclusion of an antichoice provision in this bill. This new \nprovision, which is a cynical poison pill and lacks germaneness to the \nunderlying bill, would place restrictions on women's ability to access \nhealth services.\n  It fails to respect the personal dignity of women by limiting their \nhealthcare options. It interferes with the private relationship between \na woman and her doctor, and it denies women what I believe is their \nfundamental right to have control over their own bodies.\n  I am deeply concerned that this new provision will only serve as \nconfirmation for the skeptics, who believe that Members of Congress are \nsimply unable to work with each other in the public interest.\n  We have the opportunity to disprove the skeptic by voting for this \namendment and stripping out this provision.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, could I ask how much time is remaining on \neach side?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan has 2 minutes \nremaining, and the gentlewoman from California has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Chair, I do rise in opposition to the Lee amendment. The Lee \namendment would strip dozens of important limitations and restrictions \nthat routinely apply to funding appropriated by Congress with \nbipartisan support and through the normal appropriation process.\n  For example, this amendment would strike limitations that, as has \nbeen noted, would prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to destroy \nlife. And, frankly, they have been in place since the seventies, going \nback to the Henry Hyde days in the House.\n  The Lee amendment would also strike other commonsense protections \nthat normally apply to appropriated funds. This includes restrictions \nthat prevent Federal grants from being awarded to tax cheats.\n  The Lee amendment would be a vote, should it pass, to allow abuse of \ntaxpayer funds. So I would urge the House to reject this amendment.\n  We carefully wrote provisions that the riders that are in place would \napply to each of the years of the NIH funds. And I think that that is \nappropriate, that the Lee amendment would undermine that.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. LEE. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. \nDeGette), a leader of this bill and sponsor.\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of the Lee \namendment, which removes completely unnecessary and intrusive policy \nriders attached to the funding provisions of the underlying bill after \nits unanimous passage from our committee.\n  At best, these policy riders are immaterial provisions that have no \neffect on the policies and activities of the NIH or FDA. Many of them \ninterfere with researchers and the scientific understanding that can \nmake us all safer and healthier.\n  The inclusion of the Hyde amendment, among these riders, is \nespecially offensive. The last I heard, neither the NIH or the FDA ever \nperformed abortions. And so Hyde's restrictions remind us that even \nbipartisan efforts are not immune from political attacks.\n  Women consist of more than half the patients in America, and their \nhealthcare needs should not be insulted and restricted by this \nCongress.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Congresswomen Lee, Schakowsky, and \nClarke, for introducing this amendment. We should remove these policy \nriders and keep 21st Century Cures' focus on the great potential to do \nmore for patients.\n  Ms. LEE. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n\n[[Page H5074]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n             Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Castro of Texas\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in House Report 114-193.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 32, line 8, insert before the period the following: \n     ``, including underrepresented individuals in the sciences, \n     such as women and other minorities''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 350, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Castro) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Upton, Ranking \nMember Pallone, and also Congresswoman DeGette for their work on this \nbill.\n  My amendment seeks to ensure that, when the NIH reports on its \nretention of young scientists, it includes data specifically related to \nwomen and other underrepresented minority populations in the scientific \ncommunity.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition, although I do not \noppose this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Madam Chair, we support this amendment. I think that it is \nimportant. It would include underrepresented individuals in the \nsciences in the NIH report on efforts to attract, retain, and develop \nemerging scientists.\n  It is important to ensure that the NIH is indeed focused on including \nall qualified individuals dedicated to finding cures.\n  I know no one that is opposed to this amendment. We support it. I \nappreciate your hard work on this and look forward to having it be part \nof the process as it moves forward.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Chairwoman, this amendment would require the NIH \nto report on their specific efforts to attract more women and racial \nand ethnic minorities into the biomedical workforce.\n  It is clear that we must reverse the harmful trend of limited \nparticipation by women and racial and ethnic minorities in the \nbiomedical workforce.\n  To remain the world's leader in research, we must encourage the best \nand brightest from all populations to pursue biomedical research \ncareers.\n  Without robust participation by women and ethnic minorities, we risk \nlosing our position as having the best biomedical workforce in the \nworld.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, this gives me an opportunity to not only \nthank the gentleman for his very astute amendment, but to thank the \nsponsors of this bill, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Green, Ms. DeGette, Mr. Upton, \nfor all the work that has been done.\n  Having served a number of years on the House Science Committee, I \nwant to thank the gentleman from Texas because all we heard very often \nwas the value of investing in minorities and women as the new cutting \nedge of scientific research.\n  We know that this bill is expansive, but we are delighted with your \nemphasis on the recruiting of women and minorities, particularly for \nthe young emerging scientists, and primarily because they begin to fuel \nthe next generation of research and the next generation of the solving \nof problems, which is the American Cures Act.\n  So I rise to support the gentleman's amendment and say to you that \nthe documentation is long, that these individuals will then fill the \nlaboratories of America and begin to do cutting-edge research to be \nable to create a better life for all of us.\n  I thank the gentleman. I support his amendment.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Upton and the \nRepublicans for their cooperation on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hill). The question is on the amendment offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Slaughter\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in House Report 114-193.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 152, insert after line 9 the following new subsection:\n       (c) Study and Report on the Impact of Additional Medicare \n     Payment for DISARM Drugs on Usage Practices and Development \n     of Resistance.--\n       (1) Study.--The Director of the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention shall conduct a study to examine the effects \n     of the additional payment for DISARM drugs under the Medicare \n     program provided under subparagraph (M) of section 1886(d)(5) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)), as added \n     by subsection (a), on--\n       (A) the usage of DISARM drugs (as defined by clause (iii) \n     of such subparagraph) by subsection (d) hospitals (as defined \n     in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of such Act); and\n       (B) the development of resistance by individuals to such \n     DISARM drugs.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than three years after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, such Director shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the study conducted under paragraph (1).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 350, the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Ms. Slaughter) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment \nwhich directs the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, to study \nwhether incentivizing the use of new antibiotics, which the underlying \nbill does, will lead to antibiotic resistance and cause these \nlifesaving drugs to be less effective.\n  Section 2123 of the 21st Century Cures Act authorizes additional \npayments to hospitals for using newly developed antibiotics.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Of course, the reason we need new antibiotics is that we have \nfrittered away one of the greatest medical achievements of the 21st \ncentury by overusing the ones that we already have and hastening the \ndevelopment of bacterial resistance.\n  I fear that paying hospitals more to use a new generation of \nantibiotics will just repeat the cycle of overuse and develop more \ndrug-resistant superbugs. Quite simply, the taxpayers should not foot \nthe bill for practices that are making antibiotics less effective.\n  This amendment directs the CDC to study the effect the bill would \nhave on drugs that are part of the foundation of modern medicine. I \nurge my colleagues, many of whom have expressed their alarm at the rise \nof antibiotic resistance, to support the amendment.\n  I am certainly not alone in my concern about this section of the \nbill. I know there are several Members, myself included, who will feel \nsafer if section 2123 was removed entirely.\n  A recent report from the United Kingdom review on antimicrobial \nresistance, led by brilliant economist Jim O'Neill, noted that \nincreasing reimbursements for new antibiotics risks undermining ``good \ninfection control and antibiotic stewardship practices within \nhospitals.'' The study required by this amendment will provide valuable \ndata on the link between efforts to incentivize development of new \nantibiotics and the development of resistance to make sure we don't \nrepeat the cycle.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to be clear about what is at stake here. \nWorldwide, antibiotic-resistant infections already kill 700,000 people \nevery year. If we don't act now, by the year 2050, according to Mr. \nO'Neill's study, the annual death toll will rise to 10 million a year, \nand the costs will be $100 trillion.\n  The World Health Organization has told us that the very future of \nmedicine is at stake. Without antibiotics,\n\n[[Page H5075]]\n\nmodern medical advances such as joint replacements and organ \ntransplants would be impossible, and even the routine procedures such \nas dental work and caesarean sections would be too risky to perform.\n  We have to remember that our urgent need for new antibiotics is due \nto our widespread misuse and overuse of the current antibiotics that \nled to the crisis of antibiotic resistance. We have to cure that before \nwe use new antibiotics.\n  Mr. Chairman, 30 to 50 percent of the antibiotics prescribed to \nhumans are unnecessary, but 80 percent of the antibiotics produced in \nthe United States are used on industrial farms where they are routinely \nfed to healthy animals. It is an absolute recipe for creating \nantibiotic resistance. We can't afford to keep using such precious, \nlive-saving resources so thoughtlessly. The changes in how our current \nantibiotics are used are desperately needed.\n  Unfortunately, my amendment doesn't do what I would really like to \ndo, which would be to protect eight classes of antibiotics just for use \nin human health by not allowing their use on the farm except for sick \nanimals.\n  Remember, as I said before, these antibiotics, 80 percent, are fed to \nwell animals every single day. However, the amendment will ensure that \nwe can know whether incentives to develop new antibiotics continue the \nproblem of resistance. Having effective antibiotic for humans is too \nimportant not to get this right.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, although I am not in opposition to the \namendment, I claim the time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, we strongly support this amendment, and I \ncongratulate the gentlewoman for offering it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nBarton), the former chairman, ranking member, subcommittee chair, \nranking member, and now chairman emeritus and former deputy whip.\n  (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, if you look up here at the podium right behind me on \nthe Republican side, what do you see? Carved into the balustrade is the \nword ``liberty.'' If you look on the Democratic side, what do you see? \nYou see the word ``justice.'' If you look straight down the center \naisle right between them, what do you see? It is ``tolerance.''\n  Mr. Chairman, the bill that is before us today is a culmination of 4 \nyears of hard work between both political parties and both leaderships \nof the Energy and Commerce Committee on both sides of the aisle in \nwhich a lot of tolerance has been exhibited.\n  Conservatives on the Republican side haven't gotten everything that \nwe want in this bill, and liberals on the Democratic side haven't \ngotten everything they want on this bill, but the work product is a \nculmination of an open process that Chairman Upton and subcommittee \nChairman Pitts have put together.\n  Every member of the committee has been invited to numerous working \ngroups--probably 10, 15, I don't know--and have been given every \nopportunity to have input into what they want and what they don't want.\n  This bill would become law, and it will stay law. It will become law, \nand it will unite the medical research community. There are things in \nthis bill that I have worked on for 10 years that will help find cures \nsooner rather than later.\n  Mr. Chairman, I had a woman in my office in Texas 4 days ago. Her son \nhas autism, and he is 11 years old. He is her only child. They \nliterally don't know what to do. He speaks one word at a time. He \nbecomes violent.\n  She has almost given up hope, but we are doing amazing research in \nautism. This bill will facilitate and expedite that. I am tired of \ntelling parents of children: I don't know. I can't help you.\n  I want to say: Here is what we are doing.\n  This bill does that.\n  Now, Mr. Chairman, there is a $2 billion mandatory program for 5 \nyears called the innovation fund. Some of my conservative friends have \nsaid: Oh, we can't vote for the bill because of that program.\n  What was Medicare part D? It was a mandatory program--$40 billion \nthat was not offset. Every Republican in the House voted for that--I \nmight point out every Democrat voted against it--and that was \nvoluntary. The people could participate or not participate, but it was \nmandatory that the Federal Government had to spend the money.\n  Last year, we voted on a program for veterans, $10 billion. Every \nRepublican in the House voted for that. It wasn't offset.\n  Now, I would rather that we have everything discretionary. I wish the \nwhole Federal budget was discretionary except for Social Security, but \nit is not.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, let's come together. Let's vote for \nsomething that we can all be proud of so that we can tell the parents \nof children with autism that there is hope and there is a future.\n  Vote ``yes.'' Please vote ``yes.''\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Chairman, I very much want to thank Mr. Upton for \nhis graciousness in accepting this, and I look forward to working with \nhim further on this issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from \nTexas, Congressman Gene Green.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank our ranking \nmember on the Rules Committee for bringing up this amendment. I support \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill also includes some great provisions in there \nfor the next generation of research on antibiotics. Congressman John \nShimkus and I worked on it this session, and previously, over the last \ntwo sessions, Congressman Phil Gingrey and I worked on it.\n  What this amendment addresses is it is not just a new generation, but \nwe also need to not overuse what we have. That is a problem in our \ncountry. As I say, I have sinus infections, but those antibiotics won't \nhelp it. We need to make sure we don't overuse.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am glad our colleague has come up with the amendment, \nand I support her amendment.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), a member of the important Ways \nand Means Committee.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Thank you, Chairman Upton.\n  Mr. Chairman, my DISARM Act is part of this H.R. 6 Cures Act, and I \nthank Chairman Upton and his staff for including it. It is a focal \npoint of a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle as it relates \nto antibiotics.\n  Mr. Chairman, there is an incredible health threat that has \nmanifested itself interestingly and sadly in two important ways near my \nconstituency in the Chicago area.\n  Back in December of 2013, 44 patients at Lutheran General Hospital \ncultured positive for CRE, which is known as the nightmare bacteria. To \nput this in perspective, previously, only 96 cases had been reported to \nthe CDC before. Nearby, in Algonquin, Illinois, two cases of an \nostensibly drug-resistant tuberculosis were also diagnosed. Now, \naccording to the CDC, 23,000 patients die annually from this.\n  What the DISARM Act does--which is embedded in Cures, H.R. 6--is it \ngets researchers and scientists back in the business of antibiotic \nresearch and development by modernizing how Medicare views treatments \nfor infections that are considered to be unmet medical needs.\n  It reimburses target antibiotics at cost to ensure a functioning \nmarketplace where the right treatment is used at the right time for the \nright patient helping to reinvigorate the pipeline of drugs and \ndevelopment, and it is a critical piece of the drug resistance puzzle.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of Cures, H.R. 6, and I thank Chairman \nUpton.\n\n[[Page H5076]]\n\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Fitzpatrick\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in House Report 114-193.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 235, after line 2, insert the following:\n\n                      Subtitle R--Other Provisions\n\n     SEC. 2321. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that recording unique \n     device identifiers at the point-of-care in electronic health \n     record systems could significantly enhance the availability \n     of medical device data for postmarket surveillance purposes.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 350, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, first, I want to express my deep appreciation to \nChairman Upton and Ranking Member DeGette on this bill. The funding and \nthese innovative reforms will save lives, and that is something that \neveryone in this Chamber should be proud of. There are a lot of \nwonderful provisions in this bill, and we should see those provisions \nthrough.\n  I am a member, Mr. Chairman, of the Rare Disease Caucus. Like most of \nus here, I have met with constituents with incredible stories of \ncourage and stories of their battle with diseases without treatments. \nIt would be easy to fall victim to despair, but they don't.\n  They remain beacons of hope, hope for a treatment and hope for a \nworld where no one else has to go through what they did. They look to \nus to support them and to fight alongside them for these treatments in \nlifesaving research, and I am proud to stand with them and to fight for \nthem.\n  There is a part of this bill that I believe will do more harm than \ngood, and that is the part that deals with easing medical device safety \nregulations. While we bring our research and treatments into the 21st \ncentury, I think it is equally important we bring our medical device \nsafety regulations into the 21st century as well.\n  As part of a 21st century approach to medical devices, the FDA has \nestablished a unique device identification system to adequately \nidentify medical devices through their distribution and use. These \ncodes can significantly improve safety and help track down dangerous \nrecalled products.\n  Currently, these UDIs are not incorporated into all electronic health \nrecords, which make it difficult to fully achieve the benefits to \npatient safety. For example, a claim form might list a procedure like a \nroutine surgery to remove uterine fibroids, but not note the make or \nmodel of the device used, such as the laparoscopic power morcellator, a \ndevice that the FDA placed a black box warning on, some manufacturers \nhave recalled, and some insurance companies have stopped covering as a \nresult of its devastatingly adverse effects on women's health.\n  It is this tragedy surrounding the power morcellator that has driven \nme to action, and it is why I offered eight amendments to the Rules \nCommittee which would strengthen our safety laws.\n  This week, I have heard from dozens of these individuals affected by \ncomplications from power morcellation. One doctor from California sent \nme a note about how her sister died 9 months after a routine surgery \nwith a power morcellator. A woman from Massachusetts described her \nbattle with the cancer that was spread by the morcellator. These \nconstituents wrote their letters to Members of Congress and copied my \noffice.\n  Another constituent in New York lost her sister to cancer spread by \nthe morcellator and described her sister's tragedy as ``a routine \nsurgery ending with a death sentence.'' A constituent of mine, a doctor \nand a mother of six children, is courageously fighting an aggressive \ncancer that was spread by the blades of the device.\n  What happened, Mr. Chairman, with the power morcellator should never \nbe allowed to happen again, and I think that we missed an opportunity \nwith this bill to tackle this problem head-on.\n  In 2011, the Institute of Medicine found the current, four-decade-old \nmedical device safety process known as 510(k) inadequate, noting \n``510(k) process lacks the legal basis to be a reliable premarket \nscreen of the safety and effectiveness of moderate-risk devices.''\n  I wish the bill had addressed this gap that allowed the power \nmorcellator to slip through and cause unnecessary harm to way too many \nfamilies.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  It is time we take our medical device safety regulations into the \n21st century. I ask my colleagues to join me in this effort and to \nsupport this amendment of mine today, which is a small but important \nstep.\n  I am proud to stand for patient safety. I urge my colleagues to stand \nwith me and the thousands of others who have been injured or killed by \nunsafe medical devices.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Representative Fitzpatrick.\n  The Fitzpatrick amendment would put forward a sense of Congress that \nour healthcare system should find ways to incorporate information from \nmedical devices into the care of our Nation's patients.\n  I believe that such information can prove a valuable tool advancing \nquality health care in this country, but it must be done carefully to \nensure that the value to patients, healthcare providers, industry, and \nthe government is realized.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I do want \nto speak in favor of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from New Jersey is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the amendment offered today by Congressman Fitzpatrick \nexpresses a sense of Congress that recording unique device identifiers \nwithin electronic health records could significantly enhance the \navailability of medical device data for purposes of postmarket \nsurveillance.\n  I have long supported the use of UDIs. In the Food and Drug \nAdministration Amendment Act of 2007, we required FDA to establish a \nunique device identification system; and in the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, we required FDA to \npromulgate final implementing regulations on how UDIs should be used.\n  Better integrating the use of UDIs into our health system will lead \nto improved medical devices and care across our healthcare system that \nwill modernize how FDA monitors the safety of medical devices after \nthey have been approved or cleared, and it will enable FDA and \nproviders to identify medical devices with a history of safety issues. \nIt also will facilitate recalls and make it easier for patients to \nlearn when their medical device, such as a knee implant, is subject to \na recall.\n  The unique device identifier is one more tool that can help FDA and \nour healthcare system improve their monitoring of the safety of medical \ndevices. Incorporating UDIs into electronic health records will take \ntime, but it is a worthy goal, and one that I support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by Congressman \nFitzpatrick.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Ranking Member \nPallone and Chairman Pitts for their support of this amendment.\n  This amendment will, as I said, take a small step toward improving \nmedical device safety in the United States.\n  As I said earlier in my remarks, I have seven amendments that did not \nmake it out of Rules Committee, and I hope to be able to work with the \nchairman and the ranking member on those issues as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n\n[[Page H5077]]\n\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Fitzpatrick \nAmendment.\n  The unique device identifier (UDI) is an extremely important patient-\nsafety tool, and can help identify safety concerns with devices more \nquickly or disprove a suspected problem. I support the inclusion of UDI \nin electronic health records, as this amendment encourages. But I have \nalso been working in the Ways and Means Committee to include the UDI in \nMedicare claims.\n  As is the case with any new medical technology, not all adverse \nevents are detected in the product's market approval or clearance \nprocesses. However, we can mitigate the impact on patients with a \nrobust post-market surveillance program.\n  In 2013 and 2014 alone, the FDA recalled more than 120 medical \ndevices, but in many cases, the recall occurs only after the devices \nhave been implanted in or used by hundreds or thousands of patients. \nThis can result in extensive revision surgeries, severe pain or other \nmedical problems, and in some cases, even death. In a 2001 device \nrecall case, Sweden's post-market surveillance program successfully \nidentified the faulty device after it had been implanted in 30 \npatients. By contrast, the same device was implanted into 3,000 U.S. \npatients before the gravity of the problem was recognized.\n  The FDA's Sentinel Initiative, which has been very successful in \ntracking and evaluating adverse events linked to the use of \npharmaceuticals, relies primarily on data from health insurance claims. \nBecause claims currently lack information on the specific devices used \nin patients' care, Sentinel cannot be expanded to include medical \ndevices as Congress has directed FDA to do. This is a missed \nopportunity.\n  Patients deserve access to innovative new devices that improve their \nhealth and their lives. And a vote for this amendment tells patients \nthat we owe it to them and to be able to quickly identify problems with \ndevices when they arise.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in House Report 114-193.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 235, insert after line 2 the following new subtitle:\n\n                      Subtitle R--Other Provisions\n\n     SEC. 2321. STUDY ON TWO-TIERED APPROVAL PROCESS FOR DEVICES \n                   BY FDA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall submit to Congress a report assessing the \n     feasibility, benefits, and risks associated with establishing \n     an expedited, two-tiered approval process for devices (as \n     defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321)) that would enable devices to be \n     lawfully marketed as of the date on which the device has been \n     shown to be safe--\n       (1) regardless of whether the device has been shown to be \n     effective; and\n       (2) so long as the person submitting the application for \n     approval of the device has made no false claims with respect \n     to whether the device is safe or effective.\n       (b) Included Elements of Report.--The report described in \n     subsection (a) shall include--\n       (1) an analysis of the impact of such a process on survival \n     rates and quality of life measures for seniors and \n     individuals with disabilities;\n       (2) an analysis of the impact of such a process on survival \n     rates and quality of life measures of individuals suffering \n     from life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human \n     diseases or conditions;\n       (3) an estimation of the impact such a process would have \n     on national health care costs;\n       (4) an analysis of the extent to which such a process could \n     be designed so as to guarantee that patient safety is not \n     compromised;\n       (5) an analysis of the extent to which fraudulent or \n     ineffective devices could be marketed to patients under such \n     a process and how such risks could be successfully mitigated;\n       (6) proposals for providing device manufacturers with \n     incentives to show the effectiveness of devices after the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services has approved such \n     devices to be lawfully marketed under such a system, such \n     as--\n       (A) by permitting only limited marketing of a device, the \n     effectiveness of which has not yet been shown; or\n       (B) by revoking approval of any device, the effectiveness \n     of which has not been shown within a specified timeframe; and\n       (7) recommendations for whether such a process should be \n     applicable to all devices or to only devices that have been \n     granted specific designations by the Secretary or been \n     determined eligible to be approved under specific approval \n     programs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 350, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Polis) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to start by commending Chairman \nUpton, Ranking Member Pallone, Ms. DeGette, Mr. Green, and so many \nothers. I am proud to join as a cosponsor for the 21st Century Cures \nAct, which is really a first step to updating our approval process to \nhelp countless Americans gain access to lifesaving drugs and devices.\n  This bill will save lives. I am proud to support it and send a strong \nmessage that we need to move forward with reform.\n  But at the same time we are passing this bill, we should start \nthinking about what the next step is. Passage of this bill should not \nforeclose additional opportunities in the future to improve access to \nlifesaving medical device products and lifesaving drugs.\n  Most importantly, this body can move forward with the next generation \nand start the process to help people get access to medical technology \nthat can help keep people healthy, independent, save lives, and save \nmoney.\n  It is in that spirit that I put forward my amendment, which would \nlook at a two-tiered approval process for medical devices, that would \nallow devices to come to market once they have demonstrated safety \nwhile the FDA is still reviewing them for efficacy.\n  This solves a real problem in the world. In the U.S., the cost of \nbringing a medical device to market through the approval process is $30 \nmillion to $100 million. Those are costs that are then added to \nconsumers of the medical device. That makes it even more difficult for \nniche medical devices that may help rare and unusual conditions because \nthey are priced prohibitively.\n  In addition, there is the aspect of the timeline. In the European \nmarket, for instance, if somebody creates a new device to prevent blood \nclots, it reaches the market in 7 to 11 months. In the U.S. market, \nthey are looking at a timeline of 2\\1/2\\ to 4 years. Think of how many \nsufferers might die or have additional health problems simply because \nour own government is keeping that lifesaving product off the market, \neven though it has been demonstrated as safe.\n  An additional result is that some medical technology companies are \nbypassing the U.S. market altogether when they develop new devices, \nwhich can result in years-long delays for access to U.S. patients and, \nin some cases, companies who view the U.S. approval system as too \nexpensive market their devices exclusively in other nations.\n  I think it is important to talk about what comes next. I think that \nwith both devices and drugs, we need to look at the potential for a \ntwo-tiered process that allows a provisional approval and access to the \nU.S. market. That doesn't mean that insurance will cover it. That \ndoesn't mean, clearly, that they can make any health claims with regard \nto the efficacy of their product. That is in existing law. But with \nregard to the safety being demonstrated, the provisional marketing of \nthe product in America can save lives and will save lives.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise not necessarily in \nopposition to the amendment, but concerning the amendment offered by my \ncolleague, Congressman Polis.\n  I want to thank the Congressman for his efforts to advance medical \ndevice\n\n[[Page H5078]]\n\ndevelopment and would like to work with him on the legislation to \nenhance patient access to therapies.\n  However, I am concerned this amendment as drafted would lower the \napproval standard for medical devices and suggest that patients should \nbe exposed to products that are not proven effective.\n  The FDA approval is a global gold standard for safety and \neffectiveness. While I support efforts to modernize and improve the \nstandard, safety cannot be evaluated in a vacuum, and patients should \nnot be offered treatments that have not been studied or proven useful \nto their care.\n  I have great respect for my colleague, Congressman Polis, and \nappreciate his commitment to improving our healthcare system. I would \nlike to work with him forward on that because he was correct in his \nstatement, this doesn't mean it will be reimbursed. So we are proving a \ndevice is safe but it is not effective. I think there is a way, maybe, \nwe can still make sure that not only we want it to be safe, but we want \nalso to solve the problem or have a cure for whatever particular \nillness.\n  Mr. UPTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to give my commitment, too. I \nwould like to work with the gentleman from Colorado. This is an \nimportant issue. I believe it has got merit, but we have got to make \nsure that it is designed just the right way.\n  I want to say it is probably the lateness of the timing of the \namendment when it came forward. It is my understanding the gentleman \nmay withdraw the amendment--I would appreciate that--and allow us some \ntime to really get together and see if there might be another day.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I just want to join with my other \ncolleagues, Mr. Green and also the chairman, that we do understand the \npurpose of the Polis amendment, but we do have problems with it at the \nsame time. We would like to have a conversation with Mr. Polis about \nit. I understand he is going to withdraw it. Then we would follow up \nand have a conversation and perhaps a meeting with the FDA as well.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I thank both the chair and the ranking \nmember.\n  This is a very important discussion to have, both with regard to \ndevices and also with regard to drugs.\n  We know that there are treatments that are available overseas. I \nrepresent a district with, by the way, one of the largest veterinary \nhospitals in our country, Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching \nHospital, and I can tell you that there are actually treatments, \nadvance treatments available today for animals with cancer, like \nhorses, that are not yet approved for humans and are lifesaving.\n  If we can provide access in a shortened timeframe--I understand that \nwhile medical devices might cost $30 million to $100 million to bring \nto market, drugs often cost over $1 billion to bring to market.\n  There are additional opportunities, by the way, in making sure that, \nas part of this provisional process, at least with regard to drugs, the \ndata can be gathered, too. So it can serve a dual function and might, \nat the same time complying with some of the needs or an updating of the \nneeds of some of the phases of FDA efficacy trials, it can actually be \navailable through a market-oriented plan where people, consumers who \nare fully informed and, of course, to whom no health claims have been \nmade, can choose to purchase the product, just as they can today, by \nthe way, but they have to buy it overseas and import it for their own \npersonal use. I have constituents who do that. But I think we can \nfacilitate that process.\n  I deeply appreciate working with the chair and the ranking member of \nthe committee and the subcommittee with regard to helping to bring \naccess to lifesaving medical devices and pharmaceutical products to our \nshore.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I was actually going to rise in \nopposition to the amendment, although now it is being withdrawn I see \nan opportunity here for, perhaps, us to work together on the medical \ndevice safety issue.\n  I was going to object and vote against the amendment because it is my \nconcern that the amendment would actually loosen medical device safety \nregulations and permit safe but ineffective devices to get to the \nmarket. I know that this sort of came late in the process. I would have \nobjected because I had seven amendments before the committee to \nstrengthen medical device regulations. But since the amendment is being \nwithdrawn, I would see an opportunity for us perhaps to work together, \ntake a step back and look at all the FDA regulations on medical device \nsafety.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 8 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in House Report 114-193.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 352, after line 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4062. OUTREACH TO HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND \n                   UNIVERSITIES.\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall conduct \n     outreach to historically Black colleges and universities, \n     Hispanic-serving institutions, Native American colleges, and \n     rural colleges to ensure that health professionals from \n     underrepresented populations are aware of research \n     opportunities under this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 350, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me add my appreciation to Mr. \nUpton, Ms. DeGette, Mr. Pitts, Mr. Pallone, and Mr. Green, and I ask \nthe simple question: When have we had a historic opportunity on the \nfloor of the House to have such a major investment--major investment--\nin the lives and health of Americans, quality investment involving a \nmandatory fund that will open America's labs and put more people in \nlabs and be able to give people relief on some of the issues that we \nhave heard discussed today?\n  I thank Mr. Barton for raising the sadness that comes of parents that \ncannot find answers. Many of them are my constituency who have children \nwith sickle cell, as we have been attempting to research this disease \nfor many, many years; or the lupus that took advantage of a very active \ncivic leader and caused the hospitalization for months; or this issue \nof triple negative breast cancer that many people are not aware of.\n  The amendment I have today is to emphasize the importance of outreach \nto our Historically Black Colleges, Hispanic-Serving, Indian, Native \nAmerican, and rural colleges.\n  Let me explain for a brief moment the importance of this particular \nmessage.\n  Physicians are a gateway to the patient. In short, the Jackson Lee \namendment seeks to open up the physician gateway for patients and to \nresearchers. It is to emphasize STEM education. It is to talk about the \ndifferent medical illnesses and how important it is to reach out to \nthese particular institutions to produce more medical professionals.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sickle \ncell trait is common among African Americans and occurs in about 1 in \n12. Additionally, race and ethnicity have also been shown to affect the \neffectiveness in response to certain drugs.\n  We need these students from these colleges to be in our labs, to be \nphysicians, and to welcome minorities into the clinical labs; because \nwe have evidence to show of the short numbers of individuals who \nvolunteer for clinicals, and minorities are at the low end.\n\n[[Page H5079]]\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Open \nthe doors of research and patient care through doctors, and open the \ndoors of solving some of these very difficult diseases.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nsupport the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I appreciate this amendment. It is a good amendment, and it builds on \nwhat a member of our committee, Bobby Rush, did in the full committee \nmarkup.\n  It directs the Secretary of HHS to perform outreach to Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities, to Hispanic-serving institutions, \nNative American colleges, and rural colleges to ensure health \nprofessionals from unrepresented areas are, in fact, aware of research \nopportunities under this act. It is a real complement to what was done \nbefore.\n  Mr. Rush, as I remember, grabbed me on the House floor literally \nduring our markup process and was very supportive of a number of \namendments through the night. In fact, we worked on those amendments \nand included them in the manager's amendment. I offered them the very \nnext morning, and they were accepted on a voice vote. This is clearly a \nbipartisan amendment. It is essential that we include everyone as we \nfind cures for all.\n  Ms. Jackson Lee and I have worked together on a number of health-\nrelated issues over the years, on date rape drugs and other issues that \nreally strike to the heart. So I appreciate her value in adding this \namendment, and I very strongly support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Fattah).\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, this is a special day. This is probably the \nfirst day that I would have preferred to have been a member of the \nchairman's committee rather than of the Appropriations Committee. The \ncommittee should be congratulated for its great work on this bill, and \nI am happy to be an original cosponsor.\n  I rise in support of the amendment. It is critically important that \nwe have serious outreach to all of our universities and medical \ncenters, including African American, Hispanic, Native American \nuniversities, and those in the most rural parts of our country.\n  I thank the gentleman and Diana DeGette and all of those who worked \non this great piece of legislation.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to yield 30 seconds to \nthe gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I just want to urge support for this \namendment.\n  We need to make sure that emerging scientists from all populations \nunderstand Congress' commitment to ensuring that the funding is there \nto support our biomedical workforce.\n  Requiring the Secretary to do outreach to colleges and universities \nthat educate large numbers of students from underrepresented groups \nwill ensure that all groups know of our commitment to making sure that \nfunding is not a barrier to a career in biomedical research.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Sheila Jackson Lee \namendment.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. In reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. \nUpton. I certainly thank Mr. Fattah, Mr. Pallone, and, again, my dear \nfriend from Texas (Mr. Green) for his great leadership.\n  Let me indicate that certain medical illnesses have been known to \nhave a higher prevalence amongst certain demographic groups, including \ntype 2 diabetes, lupus, sickle cell anemia, triple-negative breast \ncancer, and many other forms of diseases impacting our children, ones \nwith early birth.\n  So I ask my colleagues again to support this because increased \ndiversity in research trials could help researchers find better, more \nprecise ways to fight diseases that disproportionately impact certain \npopulations and may be important for the safe and effective use of \ntherapies.\n  Again, I think this is a historic day, and I join with Mr. Upton to \nsay that we have been friends. We started with the first bill together, \nand all of these Members have come together to put a historic mark on \nthis Nation to say that we will not take a back step to any nation on \nresearch and on improving the quality of life for all of our citizens.\n  I must say that this is a historic day as well for minorities. I \nthank Mr. Rush for his constant service, and I take note of the fact \nthat increased in this is the ability to raise the FDA loans that \npeople might get to $50,000, which will help many minorities. I hold \nthis chart to show that minorities don't volunteer for clinicals \nwithout the outreach.\n  Finally, I am delighted to have a letter from United Negro College \nFund President Michael Lomax, who indicates that 25 percent of African \nAmerican graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering, \nand math come from our Historically Black Colleges.\n  They are waiting in line to be a part of these clinicals, to be \ndoctors and researchers, and we must give them that opportunity. It is \na historic day.\n\n                              United Negro College Fund, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2015.\n     Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Jackson Lee: On behalf of UNCF (the \n     United Negro College Fund), our 37 member private \n     historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and the \n     students we serve, I write to express our strong support for \n     your amendment to H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act, which \n     would require the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n     Services to increase its outreach to underrepresented health \n     professionals and researchers regarding federal research \n     opportunities.\n       As you know, Historically Black Colleges and Universities \n     (HBCUs) are making strong contributions to the nation's \n     scientific, technological, and research workforce. HBCUs \n     enroll 10 percent of African American undergraduates, but \n     produce 25 percent of African American graduates with degrees \n     in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) \n     fields. According to the National Science Foundation (NSF), \n     ten of the top eleven baccalaureate institutions producing \n     African American STEM doctorate recipients are HBCUs. Four \n     HBCU medical institutions supply over 50 percent of African \n     Americans who receive doctoral degrees in medicine, \n     dentistry, and the biomedical sciences each year.\n       Despite these contributions, federal efforts to tap into \n     this talent pool in the dissemination of federal research \n     grants at the National Institutes of Health, the NSF, and \n     other federal science agencies continues to lag behind. Your \n     amendment will help draw greater attention to the \n     disproportionately low representation of minority researchers \n     in U.S. Department of Health and Human Services-supported \n     biomedical and behavioral research.\n       We are grateful for your recognition of the vital need to \n     diversify and strengthen the nation's scientific and research \n     workforce and thank you for your ongoing advocacy to drive \n     improvement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Michael L. Lomax, Ph.D.,\n                                          President and CEO, UNCF.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I cannot conclude my remarks without saying that \njust a few minutes ago, by video, I witnessed the flag of South \nCarolina--the rebel flag--being taken down.\n  I would only say that it is a unifying factor. This bill is a \nunifying factor, and it is going to help all of us. I ask my colleagues \nto support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. It is listed in the Rule \nas Jackson Lee #8.\n  I wish to thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Committee on \nRules for making the Jackson Lee Amendment in order.\n  I thank Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Upton and Ranking \nMember Pallone for their collaborative effort that resulted in this \nbipartisan legislation being reported favorably to the House by a vote \nof 51-0.\n  I thank them all for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee \nAmendment, which makes a good bill even better by ensuring that the \nnational goals of finding and bringing more cures and treatments to \npatients and strengthening the biomedical innovation ecosystem in the \nUnited States is aided by an expanding pool of diverse and talented \nmedical researchers.\n  Specifically, the Jackson Lee Amendment provides:\n\n[[Page H5080]]\n\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall conduct outreach to \nhistorically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving \ninstitutions, Native American colleges, and rural colleges to ensure \nthat health professionals from underrepresented populations are aware \nof research opportunities under this Act.\n  Many racial health disparities stem from lack of access to quality \nhealthcare and proper health awareness.\n  Unfortunately this means that incidence of disease does not always \nmatch trial populations.\n  For example, consider that:\n  1. African-Americans represent 12% of the U.S. population but only 5% \nof clinical trial participants.\n  2. Hispanics make up 16% of the population but only 1% of clinical \ntrial participants.\n  3. Sex distribution in cardiovascular device trials is 67% male.\n  Other significant barriers to diversified clinical trials, which are \nthe key to sound medical research and the foundation for medical cures \nand breakthroughs, as reported by investigators and coordinators are \ninsurance status, patient inconvenience costs, availability of \ntransportation, distance to the study site, and patient and family \nconcerns about risk.\n  But the most significant barriers limiting clinical participation are \nrace, age, and sex of participants:\n  1. Women and minority patients are more difficult to recruit.\n  2. Women and minority physicians have less experience and are \nrelatively more costly to engage.\n  3. Minority patients with limited English proficiency can require \ncostly translation services.\n  The first step in engaging women and minorities in clinical trials is \nfinding them.\n  Research has shown that minority patients seek physicians of their \nown race, so bringing these doctors into trials is critical.\n  ``Physicians are the gateway to the patient''.\n  There are disturbing statistics on the number of African Americans, \nHispanics and Native Americans pursuing academic qualification and \nparticipating in scientific research.\n  Many barriers exist that account for the low rate of participation \namong diverse communities, including patient fear of experimentation \nand lack of understanding or education with regard to the importance of \nclinical trials in creating new treatments and cures.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment is intended to aid in the necessary effort \nto diversify the pool of doctors and medical researchers conducting \nclinical trials, and thereby helping to diversify the participants in \nthe clinical trials.\n  In short, the Jackson Lee Amendment seeks to open the ``physician \ngateway'' to the patient.\n  The Journal on STEM Education reported in 2011 that only 8.34% of the \nSTEM doctorates awarded in 2006 were given to URMs, despite making up \napproximately 28% of the U.S. population.\n  Furthermore, GAO noted that while the percentage of underrepresented \nminorities nationwide increased from 13% to 19% from 1994 to 2003, the \ntotal number of STEM doctorates awarded to the same group dropped \nduring this period from 8,335 to 7,310.\n  In response, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences \n(NIGMS) created the Minority Opportunities in Research (MORE) Division \nand similar academic intervention programs.\n  The MORE programs are comprised of four primary components: research \nexperience, mentoring and advisement, supplemental instruction and \nworkshops, and financial support.\n  In 2007, NIGMS' annual budget was $1.9 billion, of which nearly $126 \nmillion was spent on its MORE programs.\n  This amount includes the Minority Biomedical Research Support-\nResearch Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (MBRS-RISE) program, the \nMinority Access to Research Careers (MARC), Post-baccalaureate Research \nEducation Program (PREP), and the Bridges to the Baccalaureate and \nBridges to the Ph.D. programs.\n  The amount of funds dedicated to these programs reflects the \ncommitment by the science and research community to the goals of the \nMORE Division in addressing this problem.\n  Certain medical illnesses have been known to have higher prevalence \nin certain demographic groups, including type II diabetes, lupus, \nsickle cell anemia, and Triple Negative Breast Cancer for which African \nAmericans are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed on average.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sickle \ncell trait is common among African Americans and occurs in about 1 in \n12, and sickle cell disease occurs in about 1 out of every 500 African-\nAmerican births, compared to about 1 out of every 36,000 Hispanic-\nAmerican births.\n  Race and ethnicity have also been shown to affect the effectiveness \nof and response to certain drugs, such as anti-hypertensive therapies \nin the treatment of hypertension in African Americans and anti-\ndepressants in Hispanics.\n  Increased diversity in research trials could help researchers find \nbetter, more precise ways to fight diseases that disproportionately \nimpact certain populations, and may be important for the safe and \neffective use of new therapies.\n  But before we can engage more women and minorities to participate in \nclinical trials, we must be able to find them.\n  And the key to finding minority patients is to find more physicians \nfrom their racial and ethnic groups because research has shown that \nphysicians are the gateway to the patient.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment opens that gateway.\n  I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-193 on \nwhich further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 1 by Mr. Brat of Virginia.\n  Amendment No. 3 by Ms. Lee of California.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Brat\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \n(Mr. Brat) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the \nnoes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Speaker, I regret that I was unable to vote on \nFriday, July 10 as I was attending the memorial services of a dear \nfriend in my congressional district.

Barbara \nLee (D-CA) (rollcall No. 432), and Final Passage of H.R. 6 (rollcall \nNo. 433). Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on the \namendment by Rep.

Barbara Lee (D-CA) (rollcall no. 432), and ``yea'' on \nthe Final Passage of H.R. 6 (rollcall No. 433).\n\n\n                          personal explanation\n\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent in the House \nchamber for votes on Friday, July 10, 2015.\n  Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall vote 431, \n``yea'' on rollcall vote 432, and ``yea'' on rollcall vote 433 in \nsupport of H.R. 6--21st Century Cures Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5082-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE JOURNAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, today is a proud day in the State of South \nCarolina and should be a proud day throughout the South in the United \nStates of America, for the South Carolina legislature, under the \ndirection of their Governor, took down the Confederate flag that flew \non their capitol.\n  It should be a proud day for all, for the South is much more than the \nflag, and the South has much to be proud of. But the flag symbolizes \nthings that are not something the South should not be proud of.\n  Patterson Hood, a member of a band called Drive-by Truckers, wrote a \nsong called The Southern Thing and has a commentary in The New York \nTimes Magazine this week, expressing why he hates hatred and sees the \nflag as divisive and why it should come down.\n  It was the right thing to do. And the Mississippi State flag should \ncome down, which has the rebel flag as part of its insignia and is in \nthe halls of the Congress. That flag, as has been asked by \nRepresentative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Leader Pelosi, should \nalso come down.\n  Signs of treason, signs of hate, signs of racism have no place in the \nUnited States of America's halls of Congress and should come down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5083-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         21ST CENTURY CURES ACT\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ALLEN.

Arturo was diagnosed on \nhis fourth birthday with autism. On that day, he had less than 50 words \nand was considered severely affected. The doctor didn't give his family \nmuch hope for the future.\n  Thanks to the dedication of his parents and innovation in our medical \ncommunity there, today Arturo doesn't even need speech therapy. \nHowever, he still needs medications which are currently caught up in \nbureaucratic red tape.\n  This bill, the 21st Century Cures Act, provides a modern healthcare \nsolution that gives hope to so many families like Arturo's and others \nacross this great country.\n  I thank my colleagues for passing this legislation today that will \nimprove the lives of future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5083-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TARRANT COUNTY BLACK HISTORICAL & GENEALOGICAL SOCIETY\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY.

Mr. Speaker, we have all heard the \nphrase ``if you have your health, you have everything.''\n  But for many who are suffering from debilitating diseases or caring \nfor a family member with one, their ability to pursue life, liberty, \nand happiness is interrupted.\n  Mr. Speaker, the reason entitlement spending is so vast in this \ncountry is because we have diseases and conditions requiring countless \ndollars.\n  We are America, the greatest country in the world. We have big ideas, \nand we want to provide the best future for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  The 21st Century Cures Act is just one of those big ideas that will \nproduce numerous benefits for everyone. And for fiscal conservatives \nlike myself, we should appreciate this bill and its passage with \noverwhelming support.\n  In our healthcare system, we diagnose disease, we treat symptoms, and \nwe have thousands of new seniors on Medicare every day that we must \ntake care of. The passage of this 21st Century Cures Act is a \ndefinitive way to take care of every American family.\n  Today we waged war on disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5083-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5083-H5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mr. NOLAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, I rise in support of \nthe urgent need to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.\n  I spent the better part of 20 years of my life in export trading, and \nI know what a great benefit it has been to the small business community \nand the banking community.\n  What happens is a small-town bank wants to provide financial support \nfor local business people to export their goods and their products, but \nthey don't know if a sales contract in Timbuktu or Abu Dhabi or Lagos \nor wherever is a legitimate contract. So they have to rely on some kind \nof expertise.\n  So that is why the local banks, that is why the local business \ncommunity, supports the Ex-Im Bank, because they do that. And they do \nit for a fee.\n  Ironically enough, the Ex-Im Bank has generated almost $7 billion in \nprofits over the last couple of decades, helping us with our deficit \nreduction and helping our small- and medium-sized companies to \nexport their goods and services.\n\n[[Page H5084]]\n\n  I ask all my colleagues to take a look at their district and see how \nmany small businesses benefit from that and join me in support.\n  There are only a couple of ways to generate wealth, and exporting \nyour goods is one of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5084-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATING WAYZATA HIGH SCHOOL GOLF TEAM\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Wayzata High \nSchool boys golf team on winning this year's Minnesota State \nchampionship.\n  After finishing in the runner-up position for the last two seasons, \nWayzata broke through and won the State title by three strokes this \nyear. It was a well-balanced performance by the entire team that \nallowed them to take the championship.\n  While many think of golf as an individual sport, it took strong \nperformances from each and every golfer to bring home the State title. \nThe game of golf, Mr. Speaker, can be very humbling, and it takes \nfocus, mental toughness, and skill to compete at a very high level.\n  I commend these student athletes on their commitment and dedication \nnot only to golf, but to their family obligations and their studies as \nwell. The time commitments required to be a top high school athlete are \nnot easy. And their friends, families, and communities are very proud.\n  Congratulations again to the Wayzata High School boys golf team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5084-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, as you can see by this chart, the Federal \ngas user fee, at only $97 a year, buys drivers $515 in costs per driver \nbecause of bad roads.\n  Just released data also shows that up to 73 percent of the bridges in \nsome States are deficient. Can you think of any other necessity, except \nthe $97 gas user fee, that has not increased in 22 years? We are \ngetting what we paid for in the hidden costs of bad roads and bridges.\n  The congressional response has been so disproportionate to the needs \nof the States that we are told that another short-term extension--that \nwould be the 34th--12 legislative days from now could yield a veto.\n  The States say that these short-term extensions are useless. Only the \nnext 2 weeks to get a long-term authorization is pushing it. Given the \nstate of our bridges and roads, we have no alternative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5084-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           END OF THE MANHUNT\n\n  (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, as Americans across the country know, my \ndistrict was the unfortunate home of a recent manhunt that captured the \nattention of our country.\n  For more than 3 weeks, two killers remained at large in our north \ncountry community after escaping from Clinton Correctional Facility. \nDuring this time period, hundreds and hundreds of brave law enforcement \nofficers worked diligently to find these escaped convicts and protect \nour community.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank these brave law enforcement \nofficers who risked their safety to protect the families in our \nneighborhoods, and I rise to thank our local communities for their \npatience and support during this difficult time.\n  Going forward, we must find answers as to how this prison break \noccurred and do what is needed to stop this from ever happening again. \nBut, for now, our north country community can sleep safer, knowing \nthese two killers are no longer at large.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5084-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHANGE IS NOT BAD\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to again note \nwhat a historic day this was, with the passage of the 21st Century \nCures Act, which opens the opportunity for billions of dollars to be \ninvested in the Nation's clinics and laboratories to make America \nhealthy and make America better.\n  This bill is from the Energy and Commerce Committee. I am very proud \nto be one of its cosponsors. And I would like to say back to my \nconstituents in Texas, the Texas Medical Center, and all of the \nresearch that is being done: Here is an opportunity to work on those \nunique and special diseases impacting children with lupus and other \ndiseases. That is why change is not bad.\n  Additionally, I join with the arguments in my district for changing \nthe names of high schools that are not reflective of the Nation today, \nthose named after confederate generals. The names of these high schools \nare not reflective of a unifying America.\n  Frankly, I believe that the school board should address this question \nand teach the children that that is the past history that was not a \npositive history and that we should reflect positively on unifying \nAmerica and carrying the American flag.\n  Lastly, again, I say on the floor what a very special day, the \nsolemnity in the way the rebel flag was finally put to rest, put to \nrest, and taken to a relic museum, where it belongs. And we can stand \nhere under this shining American flag saying that we, too, are \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5084-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1145\n                       KEEP PATENT SYSTEM STRONG\n\n  (Mr. MASSIE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, when patent trolls use U.S. patents to game \nthe system for illegitimate financial gain, it is much like \ncounterfeiting because these are official U.S. documents. What would we \ndo if we found a counterfeiter? Would we go after the counterfeiter, or \nwould we devalue our currency to discourage counterfeiters?\n  Well, that sounds ridiculous. That would wreck our economy just to go \nafter counterfeiters by devaluing the currency. But that is what the \nInnovation Act, H.R. 9, does to patents. It devalues all patents, and \nit is going to wreck our economy if we pass it.\n  Patents are the currency of invention. If you want invention to be \nstrong in this country, you need to keep the patent system strong.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 9.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5084-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         21ST CENTURY CURES ACT\n\n  (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KATKO.

That is not just something I \nheard from my colleagues. Those diseases have stricken those in my \nfamily as well.\n  We owe it to the people and their families to support medical \nresearch so that individuals in our communities can live longer, \nhealthier lives.\n  Today's legislation allows researchers and scientists to move forward \nin their efforts to produce lifesaving treatments, therapies, and cures \nfor our loved ones. It will reduce medical uncertainty in the \ndevelopment of new medicine and remove barriers to increase research \ncollaboration.\n  I dream of a time in a not too distant future when I can tell my \nchildren that what we did here on the floor of the House today saved \nlives and prevented them and their children from enduring some of the \ndiseases that we have had to endure in our lifetime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5084-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5084-H5085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         21ST CENTURY CURES ACT\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

This 21st Century Cures Act will help change that, and it is an \nimportant step toward helping save the lives of our love ones.\n  Having served for nearly 30 years in the healthcare field, I applaud \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle for passing this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5085-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRIP FOR FREEDOM\n\n  (Mr. CURBELO of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida.

What is wrong about that is that our troops were \nnot always appreciated for what they did for us. They did it without \ncomplaint, they did it with sacrifice, and they did it with honor. So \nfor us here in the Capitol to finally come around to that ideal and \nhonor them was a very good thing.\n  For our Vietnam troops, we do appreciate you. We will do all we can \nto help you as you work through VA, as you work through Agent Orange. \nWe know many of you are suffering these things, and you are not getting \nenough help from our Federal Government or that recognition.\n  So in recognition of what happened here this week on the 50th \nanniversary of the first deployment, we say to our Vietnam veterans: \nWelcome home, and God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5085-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5085-H5086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SANCTUARY CITIES MUST END\n\n  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BABIN.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of my \nconstituents, John David Crow, of College Station, Texas, who passed \naway on June 17.\n  To say that John David Crow is a Texas football legend is an \nunderstatement. He was a Heisman Trophy winner, a four-time NFL Pro \nBowl selection, a college football coach, and an administrator for the \nTexas A University Athletic Department.\n  John David was born on July 8, 1935, in Marion, Louisiana. When he \nwas born, the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck, causing nerve \ndamage and permanently paralyzing the left half of his face. John \nDavid, however, never let that hardship hold him back.\n  As a junior at Springhill High School, he led the football team to \nwin the Class 1A State championship in 1952. As a senior, he led the \nbasketball team to win the Class 1A State championship in 1954.\n  After graduating from high school, John David married his high school \nsweetheart, Carolyn Gilliam, on July 2, 1954. Earlier that year, John \nDavid had committed to play football at Texas A University for \nlegendary coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant; so, in the fall of 1954, John \nDavid and Carolyn moved to College Station.\n  During his time at Texas A, John David would play running back, \ndefensive positions, and special teams as a kick returner. He truly was \nthe complete collegiate football package.\n  In 1956, he led the Aggies to their first ever road victory against \narchrival, the University of Texas, at Memorial Stadium in Austin. He \nalso led the Aggies to a number one ranking during the 1957 season.\n  Some of the accolades that John David received as an Aggie included \nbeing named twice to the Southwest Conference all-conference team in \n1956 and 1957. He also received all of the following recognitions in \n1957: a consensus All-American, the Walter Camp Memorial Trophy, the \nSouthwesterner of the Year and Amateur Athlete of the Year, the Chick \nHarley Award, the United Press Player of the Year, the United Press \nBack of the Year, and the Heisman Trophy.\n  John David was Texas A University's first Heisman Trophy winner and \nthe only Heisman Trophy winner to\n\n[[Page H5087]]\n\never be coached by the legendary Bear Bryant. When Bear Bryant retired \nfrom coaching, he was quoted as saying: ``John David Crow was the \nfinest player I ever coached. Watching film on him was like watching a \ngrown man play with boys.''\n  John David would graduate from Texas A with a degree in business \nadministration and was named to the Scholastic All-American team. He \nwas also recognized as a Who's Who in American Colleges and \nUniversities.\n  John David would go on to play in the NFL after being drafted in the \nfirst round to play for the then Chicago Cardinals, in Chicago and St. \nLouis, and playing for the San Francisco 49ers. He was named to the Pro \nBowl four times and named to the NFL's 1960 All-Decade Team.\n  After retiring from the NFL, John David began his football coaching \ncareer, starting as an assistant for his former coach Bear Bryant at \nAlabama. He continued his career as an assistant coach in the NFL for \nthe Cleveland Browns and the San Diego Chargers. In 1976, he was named \nathletic director and head football coach of Northeast Louisiana \nUniversity.\n  In 1981, John David would leave Northeast Louisiana University to \nwork for a private business for a couple of years. In 1983, he returned \nto his alma mater, Texas A University, first as associate athletic \ndirector, later as athletic director, and finally, as director of \nathletic development.\n  During this time, he was at the forefront of collegiate athletic \ngender equity as he helped expand women's athletics at Texas A to the \npowerhouse that it is today. In 2001, John David would retire from A, \nbut he still maintained a presence on campus and in the Bryan/College \nStation community.\n  John David Crow was a great athlete, coach, and athletic \nadministrator. He was inducted into the Texas A University Hall of \nFame in 1968 and the Louisiana Hall of Fame in 1976. He was named to \nthe National Football Foundation Hall of Fame in 1976 and the Texas \nSports Hall of Fame in 1982. He was named a Distinguished Alumnus by \nTexas A University in 2004 and was honored during the Aggies' first \nyear in the Southeastern Conference as an SEC Legend at the 2012 SEC \nChampionship Game.\n  While John David was dedicated to his career, he was also very much \ndedicated to his wife, Carolyn, and to their family. He and Carolyn had \nthree children: John, Jr., Annalisa, and Jeannie. They were also \nblessed with seven grandchildren.\n  John David was forever thankful for everything Carolyn did for their \nfamily. He was once quoted as saying: ``Whatever credit I get for doing \nanything, she deserves a lot more than I do. She has been the \nstabilizer for our family and very, very good to me.''\n  Mr. Speaker, John David Crow was a humble, kind, generous, and an \nall-around great man. The greatness that he evoked reached far beyond \nthe football field. He truly embodied the core values of Texas A \nUniversity--respect, integrity, leadership, excellence, loyalty, and \nselfless service.\n  He will be greatly missed and will long be remembered as a great \nathlete, coach, and athletic administrator. More importantly, he will \nbe remembered as a loving husband, a father, a grandfather, and as a \nfriend.\n  My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to \nCarolyn and to the Crow family. We also lift up the family and friends \nof John David Crow in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n  Also, as I close this conversation about John David Crow, I ask that \nall Americans continue to pray for our country, for our military men \nand women who protect us from external threats, and for our first \nresponders who protect us here at home.\n\n\n                          Honoring Jack Gilley\n\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jack Calvin Gilley of \nStratford, Texas, who passed away on May 9, 2015.\n  As a teacher and principal for 34 years, Mr. Gilley touched the lives \nof hundreds of students and schools throughout Oklahoma and the Texas \nPanhandle. I was fortunate enough to have Mr. Gilley as a principal \nduring my time at Stratford Middle School.\n  Jack Gilley was born in Dawson County, Texas, in 1924. He proudly \nserved in the United States Navy during World War II as a torpedoman on \nthe USS Stockdale. He attended Panhandle A College on basketball and \nbaseball scholarships. Additionally, he received his master's in \neducation from West Texas State University in 1963.\n  In 1951, Jack married Donna Mal Oldaker. They were married for nearly \n59 years, until her passing in 2010. Donna and Jack had four daughters \nand were blessed with one granddaughter.\n  After retiring from teaching, Jack began his secondary profession of \npainting houses, refinishing furniture, and carpentry. He was a member \nof the First United Methodist Church of Stratford, as well as a member \nof the American Legion Post 262. He loved hunting pheasant and quail; \neating breakfast and drinking coffee with his friends at the local \ncafe; and all things rodeo and all things sports, especially Duke \nbasketball.\n  Mr. Speaker, Jack Gilley impacted many lives, including mine, as an \neducator and as a mentor. He will be greatly missed and long remembered \nas a loving husband, a father, a grandfather, and a friend.\n  My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to \nthe Gilley family, and we lift up the family and friends of Jack Gilley \nin our prayers.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I close, I ask that all Americans continue to pray \nfor our country, for our military men and women who protect us from \nexternal threats, and for our first responders who protect us here at \nhome.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/10/house-section/article/H5087-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. FLORES.
