Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, November 28, residents in Yadkin \nCounty gathered for the annual Small Town Christmas celebration at the \nEast Bend fire station.\n  Although East Bend is a small community, its citizens know how to \nstart the holiday season off right. The firefighters and Ladies \nAuxiliary group worked hard to get the station ready, and their efforts \nwere appreciated by everyone who attended.\n  The evening began with a devotional and the lighting of the Christmas \ntree. While the chicken stew and pinto beans that followed were \ncertainly delicious, the focus on faith was the real draw.\n  It is easy to get distracted during the days and weeks leading up to \nChristmas. So it was uplifting to see the community of East Bend once \nagain take time to reflect on this season of grace and let the Lord's \ninfinite joy fill their hearts.\n  It was a pleasure to be a part of their celebration, and I commend \nthem for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9274-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE LIFE OF KATE McCARTHY\n\n  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER.

Her family will regale with tales of challenges of \nmanaging four interesting children, shall we say.\n  The central narrative will be her knowledge, stewardship, and love of \nspecial places like the Columbia River Gorge, her advocacy and \nleadership for sound land use and above all, Mount Hood.\n  She challenged me to focus on the entire responsibility for \nprotecting that mountain, leading not just to 120,000 acres of \nwilderness, but enacting a comprehensive vision for its protection.\n  She was a passionate, committed visionary whose influence will be \nfelt and seen for generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9274-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDON'T FUND UNESCO BECAUSE IT HAS RECOGNIZED A NON-EXISTENT PALESTINIAN \n                                 STATE\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

No taxpayer dollars can be used to fund any \nagency at the U.N. that admits a nonexistent state of Palestine. UNESCO \ndid, so, therefore, no U.S. dollars.\n  I urge Congress not to relent, but to stand with me and defend our \njurisdiction and continue to uphold both the letter and the spirit of \nthe law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9274-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TERRORIST GUN LOOPHOLE\n\n  (Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, these are very anxious times here in \nAmerica with good reason. We have an urgent national security issue at \nhand that allows somebody who is on the terrorist watch list to legally \npurchase a firearm.\n  How can somebody who pledges allegiance to ISIS be allowed to \npurchase a gun here in America?\n  We would never give a set of keys to somebody who was drunk to get \nbehind the wheel. How is it that we allow someone a license to go and \npurchase a firearm?\n  We allow them to go and purchase a firearm in this country who are on \nthe terrorist watch list. Would the same fight be taking place if they \nwanted to get onto an airliner, saying: Hey, let's let he or she on. \nThey are on the terrorist watch list. I want them to fly with me.\n  That is the insanity we are dealing with. Over the course of the next \nfew weeks, we have the ability to make a commonsense, simple approach \nto reducing the chance of terrorism here in America; that is, to keep \nthose who are on the terrorist watch list from purchasing a firearm.\n  Let's come together, bipartisan, and pass this approach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9274-7", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9274-H9275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PRESIDENT OBAMA BROKE THE LAW WITH THE BERGDAHL DEAL\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, in May 2014, the President \nshocked the world by announcing that he had negotiated with terrorists \nto secure the disgraced Sergeant Bergdahl's release from the Taliban.\n  Yesterday the House Armed Services Committee, led by Chairman Mac \nThornberry, issued an in-depth report dealing with the President's \nsecret negotiations. The report verified that the transfer violated \nseveral laws.\n  The American public was misled about the efforts to arrange the \nterrorists' pardon before it took place. Senior officials within the \nDepartment of Defense that were best equipped to evaluate the national \nsecurity risk with this specific transfer were excluded from the \nprocess.\n  The President failed to take significant precautions to eliminate the \nrisks posed by the Taliban Five, putting all American families as \ntargets of more murderous attacks.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n  We should all appreciate the six American heroes from the 4th Brigade \nCombat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division, who were killed in \naction while searching for Bergdahl to leave no one behind.\n\n[[Page H9275]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9275-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   REAUTHORIZE THE JAMES ZADROGA ACT\n\n  (Mr. CROWLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CROWLEY.

Absolutely nothing. We keep waiting. We were told \nthat the 9/11 victims compensation bill, the Zadroga Act, would be on \nthe transportation bill. It was mysteriously withdrawn at the last \nmoment. We don't know when this bill will pass.\n  What has happened to this place? What has happened to the spirit of \nbipartisanship to get this bill passed?\n  How can you, on the Republican side, go so low as to use this bill as \ngrease to pass other legislation? That is what is being done right now.\n  The 9/11 Victims Act is being used as grease to pass other bills. It \nis outrageous. It is disrespectful to the men and women who gave all to \nserve this country, people who have stage 4 cancer today and are dying. \nIt gives them no more solace to know that their country is not standing \nby them.\n  We continue to say ``never forget,'' yet we continue to forget in \nthis Christmastime, in this holiday season, those who are suffering.\n  Give them peace of heart and mind, and pass this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9275-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A TRIBUTE TO MEG MECCARIELLO\n\n  (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of \nMeg Lawyer-Meccariello, who fought a hard battle against mesothelioma, \nan asbestos-related cancer.\n  Early in my term I met Meg in my office in Washington when she came \nto share the story of her sister, Mary Jo Lawyer Spano, who lost her \nlife in her courageous battle with mesothelioma.\n  Meg shared how mesothelioma had tragically impacted her family, \nclaiming the lives of Mary Jo and her father and leaving Meg and her \nsisters with unnerving diagnoses.\n  I vividly remember Meg's frustration and disparity by the information \nand lack of awareness about mesothelioma.\n  Despite all of this, Meg was a tremendous advocate for finding a cure \nfor this terrible disease. Meg was instrumental in the introduction of \nlegislation named in her sister's honor which would create the Nation's \nfirst mesothelioma patient registry.\n  I will continue to champion this legislation in Congress, now in \nmemory of both Mary Jo and Meg. Meg lived with hope, strength, and \ngrace, and she left this world a better place.\n  The Meccariello and Lawyer families are in our prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9275-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ENOUGH IS ENOUGH\n\n  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, Sandy Hook, Colorado Springs, San Bernardino. \nHow many mass shootings or terrorist attacks will it take for Congress \nto act to reduce gun violence?\n  We are not talking about infringing upon our important Second \nAmendment rights, no gun registries, or privacy evaluations. No. We are \ntalking about commonsense reforms to make it harder for terrorists and \ncriminals to get the weapons that allow them to kill people: universal \nbackground checks, closing the gun show loophole, making sure that \npeople on the terrorist watch list can't quietly assemble arsenals to \ndo the American people harm.\n  No congressional action can end gun violence, but we can reduce it. \nWe can save lives. We can prevent mass shootings. We can prevent \nterrorists from assembling the weapons they need to kill innocent \nAmericans.\n  Enough is enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9275-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NO-FLY LIST AND SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, well, they are at it again. Earlier this \nyear we saw the administration work to deny veterans because they may \nbe on an arbitrary list for having sought financial help services, be \nthreatened as incompetent to exercise gun ownership rights.\n  Now, with the left seeking any excuse to deny Second Amendment rights \nto Americans, there is much effort underway to use a no-fly list or \neven a selectee list to not only deny travel and flight rights to \nfalsely listed American citizens with little or no due process to \nremove one's name from that list, but to extend denial of gun ownership \nrights as well.\n  The no-fly list can and should be a good tool for protecting against \nterror strikes, but needs criteria revision for a due process for those \nthat have been wrongly listed to have an open chance to face their \naccusation.\n  As it is now, First, Fourth, and Fifth, let alone now the Second, \nAmendment constitutional protections are in danger of being denied for \nthose citizens that are falsely listed because their name sounds like \nthe name of someone actually who bears being watched or, in the hands \nof an aggressive gun control administration, the use of IRS-type \ntactics against people the powers that be don't like.\n  Such lists are dangerous to basic liberty. Let's first fix the \nprocess for how the no-fly list tool is used and revised before adding \nmore restrictions, ones that would not have even captured the San \nBernardino shooters, to this list being added, the Democrat gun control \nChristmas or holiday period list.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9275-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9275-H9286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0915\n  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 644, TRADE \n   FACILITATION AND TRADE ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2015, AND PROVIDING FOR \n  CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 2250, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016\n\n  Mr. COLE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported \na rule for consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n644,\n\n[[Page H9276]]\n\nthe Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, and the \nSenate amendments to H.R. 2250, a continuing resolution which runs \nthrough December 16, 2015.\n  The resolution provides a standard conference report rule for \nconsideration of H.R. 644, with 1 hour of debate divided pursuant to \nclause 8(d) of rule XXII.\n  In addition, the rule makes in order a motion from the chair of the \nCommittee on Appropriations to concur in the Senate amendments to H.R. \n2250, with 60 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the \nchair and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations on the \nmotion. In addition, the rule provides for one motion to recommit.\n  Mr. Speaker, first, this resolution allows for consideration of the \nconference report on the Customs bill. I think it is important to put \nthe work of this House in perspective. As Speaker Ryan noted yesterday, \nin the entirety of the last Congress, only three conference reports \nbecame law. However, with the passage of this conference report, this \nCongress will have passed three conference reports in 10 days. I am \npleased that Speaker Ryan's commitment to regular order is already \nbearing fruit.\n  This conference report is a good product. One provision especially \nimportant to me is the establishment of new tools for Customs and \nBorder Protection, the CBP, to effectively act against the evasion of \nantidumping and countervailing duties. I was first introduced to this \nissue in 2009, when the Chinese dumped literally tens of thousands of \ntires on the U.S. market, leading to devastating job losses at tire \nfactories across America. I helped to lead the charge at that time to \nensure that the Department of Commerce would impose antidumping and \ncountervailing duties. The ENFORCE Act language included in the \nconference report provides a mechanism and incentive for the CBP to \nproperly investigate and apply appropriate duties to ensure that U.S. \ncompanies can compete on a level playing field.\n  In addition, I am encouraged that the conference report includes \nlanguage which permanently bans States and localities from imposing a \ntax on Internet access. Initially enacted in 1998, this prohibition has \nenabled greater access to Internet services and information. It is \nestimated that if Congress fails to continue the ban on taxes on \nInternet access, consumers could end up paying more than $16.4 billion \nannually. This moratorium has been law since 1998 on a temporary basis, \nand I am pleased this conference report reflects our intention to make \nit permanent.\n  Mr. Speaker, in addition to the Customs measure, this legislation \ncontains a 5-day continuing resolution to allow the Appropriations \nCommittee to continue its work towards an omnibus appropriations \nmeasure. It is simple, straightforward, and extends funding for all \ngovernment agencies through December 16, 2015, at current funding \nlevels.\n  I urge all Members to support this short-term CR, which will allow \nthe Appropriations Committee the time to conclude negotiations on a \nfull-year funding measure with its Senate counterparts and the White \nHouse. I am encouraged by the hard work of Chairman Rogers and Ranking \nMember Lowey, whose leadership on this cannot be overstated.\n  One of the preeminent responsibilities we are tasked with, as Members \nof Congress, is to ensure that government continues to function. While \na CR is not the ideal vehicle, the alternative of a government shutdown \nis not what we have been sent to Washington to accomplish. Mr. Speaker, \nI urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition--I might add, reluctant \nopposition--to the rule on two important bills that really shouldn't be \ncontroversial: the Senate amendments to H.R. 2250--that is a short-term \ncontinuing resolution. It shouldn't be necessary. This body should have \nacted, but given that the body has not passed through regular order an \nappropriations process to keep government open, that bill is \nnecessary--and the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of \n2015.\n  H.R. 644, which is often called the Customs bill, is a bill that \nneeds to pass in some form. I want to see it pass. I have voted for it \nto go to conference. It has a lot of provisions that are extremely \nimportant to many Members, to our economy, and to even Americans \ntraveling casually overseas. It increases, finally, the amount of items \nthey can buy as gifts for their friends and then bring back without \nhaving to pay duties. But looking at the version that we are \nconsidering today under this rule, which does not allow amendments, I \nthink the body would be better taking individual votes on some of the \nprovisions.\n  There is a lot of good in this bill, but there is also a blatant \nattack on climate science, on environmental protection, and, really, \nitems that serve no purpose in a bill written to facilitate trade. They \neven put a separate item preventing Internet sales tax, which I support \nthe bill separately, and somehow this wound up in the Customs bill, a \ntotally unrelated measure from a different committee that wound up in \nthis bill at the last minute, this Christmas-tree bill. It wasn't in \nthe House or the Senate version before. I think we do need to give \nMembers a chance to be on the record to approve or not approve these \nitems individually, and I think that would be the open process that \nthis Speaker has committed to.\n  The second item under this rule, the Senate amendments to H.R. 2250, \nour short-term continuing resolution, is straightforward and is \nnecessary as we near the shutdown of government, which would otherwise \noccur December 11. Today would be the last day that we would fund \ngovernment, so, of course, we have to act. You don't hear objection \nabout that. The only objection I hear is: Why does this Congress always \nwait until the eleventh hour to pass these kinds of bills? It just \ndoesn't make any sense. You don't wait until the day before government \nshuts down to say: Okay. We will give ourselves a 5-day reprieve.\n  Are we even going to be able to complete the omnibus or continuing \nresolution in those 5 days? I don't know. Are we going to be back here \nnext Wednesday doing another 3-day or 5-day CR?\n  There is no particular reason that we are doing this, nothing new. No \nnew information about how to better construct funding bills comes to us \nnext week or the week after than we had last week or 2 weeks ago. I \ndon't understand why we didn't do these bills last month. We passed the \nbudget bills. We agreed on the overall dollar figures about a month \nago. That is one of the hardest things about figuring out the \nappropriations bills and spending is what levels are you going to \nspend. We agreed on that. The House, the Senate, and the President \nagreed. So that is not even being discussed. Why didn't we do it within \na week of that and just be done with it? It makes no sense.\n  So this bill would make December 16 the new deadline to finish \nCongress' appropriations work and keep government open, and I do think \nthat Members and the public are anxious for us to complete our work. It \nis also critical that we get a good product.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, the majority, the Republicans, have previously \nshown this country their willingness to go into a shutdown, so I hope \nthat we take this new 5-day period to avoid a shutdown permanently \nrather than just to do another 3 or 5 days again and again and again.\n  Why aren't we sending a bill on appropriations to the President \ntoday? From my point of view, it seems like it is nothing more than \npartisan politics that is keeping it from getting done. I think the \nvotes are here--they have been here, were here a month ago, and were \nhere a week ago--for a commonsense bill that meets the budget that we \nhave already agreed on, that doesn't have completely unrelated \nChristmas-tree policy riders that were put together in smoke-filled \nrooms rather than the open process that the new Speaker has committed \nto. And it is a real opportunity for this body to live up to that \npromise and put together an appropriations bill that passes \noverwhelmingly, which I think can absolutely be done.\n  Nearly every single member of the Democratic Caucus has said no \ndivisive\n\n[[Page H9277]]\n\nor controversial riders. The appropriations bills are not a place for \nthem. You don't bring government to the brink of a shutdown over policy \ndisagreements. You don't say: ``Look, unless we don't fund Planned \nParenthood, we are shutting down government. Look, unless you don't ban \nthe EPA from keeping our air clean, we are going to shut down \ngovernment.'' You can have those debates and you can have those \ndiscussions, but it is not appropriate to do that with a threat of \nshutting down government.\n  Didn't the Republicans recently sign some sort of pledge to have no \nextraneous or legislation or must-pass bills? Well, what about taking \non the President's attempt to protect clean air standards? If \nRepublicans want it, then debate it and pass it. If you want to defund \nPlanned Parenthood, then debate it and pass it, but not in a last-\nminute, closed package with a threat of closing government.\n  Compromise is what we did on the highway bill to pass a long-term \nauthorization. It worked great. It didn't have what every single Member \nwanted, and we had to make tough compromises, but we can live with it. \nIt passed overwhelmingly. Compromise is what we took yesterday when I \ngot to go to the White House to see the Every Student Succeeds Act \nsigned, the new Federal education law that replaces No Child Left \nBehind. It passed overwhelmingly in its final form in both the House \nand the Senate. Now, a compromise is not seeing how many partisan \nstocking stuffers you can jam into a must-pass bill before we head home \nfor the holidays.\n  Moving to the Customs enforcement bill, H.R. 644, it is, for the most \npart, a very positive bill. The Customs bill is about giving the \nadministration the tools they need to make sure we are fighting a fair \nfight when it comes to trade and to updating and eliminating unintended \nconsequences of other trade laws. I heard Ranking Member Levin testify \nin the Rules Committee yesterday that the key to enforcement on trade \nissues was the willingness of the administration to act, and the final \nstep of enforcing our existing and future trade agreements will always \nfall to the executive branch. But they can't fight those fights without \nthe right tools in the toolbox. That is what the Customs bill does, and \nthis bipartisan bill has a lot of very high-quality elements that we \nwill likely send to the administration before the holidays.\n  It has the full ENFORCE Act, which would require immediate action to \ninvestigate and address trade cheats and take measures to stop those \nwho continually attempt to circumvent the penalties already imposed on \nthem. It establishes and funds the Interagency Trade Enforcement \nCenter, which helps agencies find trade cheats and those who engage in \nillegal dumping that risk putting Americans out of work. It establishes \nthe Trade Enforcement Fund, which would provide critical and dedicated \nresources to enforce our trade agreements, and it would help with \ncapacity building, an important issue which would help our current and \nfuture trading partners implement labor and environmental standards \nthat we push them towards in a real way.\n  The bill also contains important language on ending the importation \nof goods made from child or forced labor, which is yet another step we \nare taking towards ending this abominable practice on a global scale. \nIt also includes bipartisan language which gives the executive branch \nnew tools in evaluating and consulting with partner countries who may \nbe manipulating their currency.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we want to be serious with enforcing our trade \nagreements, then the enforcement provisions in this bill are a major \nstep forward. We may still have to push this Executive when we feel \nthey aren't using these tools, but having these tools available is a \ncritical step.\n  The Customs bill also gives a leg up to American small business. The \nbill makes commerce at the border more efficient. It modernizes the \noperation of Customs and Border Patrol; and something that I fought for \nfor many years, it raises the de minimis threshold from $200 to $800, \nwhich, again, is important to all Americans who travel overseas. Being \nable to have smaller items cross our border duty-free is a major win \nfor small businesses and consumers, especially in the e-commerce space \non the commercial side, but also for casual tourists who travel \noverseas.\n  What that means is, when you are reentering this country, if you ever \nhave to fill out one of those forms if you are coming back from Mexico \nor Canada or Europe, the de minimis threshold was $200, and technically \nyou are responsible for a duty above that. This finally raises it. It \nhasn't been adjusted for inflation for decades. This raises it to $800, \nso you can truly bring back gifts for your friends and family. This is \nimportant for individuals, and it is important for businesses.\n  The bill makes important technical corrections that are important to \ncompanies in my district, like adjusting tariff lines for outdoor wear \nand footwear.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  I am also very excited to say, as the cochair of the Nepal Caucus, \nthat the bill includes the Nepal Trade Preferences Act, a very \nimportant provision that is a tangible benefit for Nepal's recovering \neconomic market. That is simply the right thing to do. As many here \nknow, Nepal suffered a devastating earthquake on April 25, 2015. Over \n9,000 people were killed; 23,000 were injured. The earthquake triggered \na series of avalanches on Mt. Everest where 19 people, including one of \nmy constituents, were killed in what was the deadliest day in Mt. \nEverest history.\n  The country has begun the urgent process of rebuilding. Despite the \ntrying circumstances, Nepal has remained resilient. On December 20, I \nam proud to say, the democratically elected constituent assembly \nannounced the passage of a new democratic constitution, a remarkable \nchapter for a country that, until recently, had been mired in civil war \nand strife.\n  I am honored to join Representative Crenshaw, my cochair on the U.S. \nNepal Caucus, in introducing the Nepal Trade Preferences Act, which \ngives preferential treatment to textile, leather, and apparel products \nmade in Nepal. And the bill facilitates capacity building to help \nexpand the Nepali export market.\n  I am very grateful for the hard work of my colleague from Florida \n(Mr. Crenshaw), and the simultaneous effort that has been taking place \nin the Senate under the leadership of Senator Feinstein.\n  Nepal is a very important and strategic ally between global powers, \nIndia and China. Cooperation with America to help build capacity and \nbuild the Nepali economy and stability is a critical foreign policy \npriority, in addition to being an economic benefit to the American \npeople.\n  I believe trade can be a mechanism for poverty reduction worldwide. I \nam heartened to see that this act, which attempts to do that, is \nincluded in the Customs bill.\n  With all these great things, why would anybody oppose this bill? \nUnfortunately, like anything, it is not that easy. I joined my \nDemocratic colleagues in voting against the Customs bill when it was on \nthe House floor last summer. Despite knowing that it needed to get \ndone, I was simply unable to vote for a bill that contained extraneous, \nunnecessary attacks on climate science, on environmental protections, \nand on immigrants.\n  These are some of the things that needed to be taken out in the \nconference committee. They should have been taken out in the conference \ncommittee. If they were, I would be proudly 100 percent supporting this \nbill. If I could, in an open process, I would be amending the bill \ntoday to take them out, so that this bill could enjoy broad Democratic \nsupport.\n  The only positive thing I can say is that, emerging from conference, \nthis bill is less bad than it was. Included in the underlying report is \na renegotiated provision on greenhouse gas emissions and the role in \ninternational trade agreements that certainly is not as bad as the \nversion that originally passed the House and, many argue, would not \nhave any significant legally constraining role on agreements negotiated \nby the chief executive.\n  The House negotiated an objective that would have prohibited the USTR \nfrom pursuing trade agreements that obligate United States law or \nregulation towards global warming and climate change was stripped. It \nwas replaced with an equally nontopical, but\n\n[[Page H9278]]\n\nsomewhat convoluted, provision that is a little difficult to \nunderstand.\n  We use new language to bar trade agreements from including \nobligations to alter U.S. law or regulations surrounding greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  To clarify, international trade policy will not be the stage on which \nthe United States establishes and implements strong and thoughtful \nclimate change policy. That is what Congress is for, that is what our \nStates are for, that is what our local governments are for. That must \nbe done. I think we all agree that won't be done through trade \nagreements.\n  In that sense, the language was only added to speak to a deeply held \nfear by my Republican Party colleagues to even acknowledge that climate \nchange exists. To my colleagues on the other side, I would say, this is \nsimply not the place for that kind of ideological statement.\n  Further, the language contradicts itself by explicitly allowing the \nUSTR to seek provisions, including those related to global warming and \nclimate change, if doing so would fulfill another negotiating \nobjective.\n  So, we bar negotiators from discussing environmental policy \nobjectives and then flip, allowing them to do so if it meets another \nobjective.\n  Not only is this language unnecessary, it is a messy, convoluted, \ncontradictory-type of compromise that nobody really even knows what it \nwould mean, and is really rife for lawyers on both sides to be debating \nit for years or decades.\n  The entire world is in Paris right now talking about specifics on \nfighting climate change. And here we are today, with the only political \nparty in the developed world that still questions the existence of \nclimate change in their very platform, attaching this ridiculous \nprovision to an unrelated Customs bill, embarrassing our own \nnegotiators while they are in Paris.\n  We get it: you don't agree with the rest of the world on this, you \ndon't agree with scientists on this, you don't agree with the majority \nof Americans on that. We get that. Next year, feel free to pass a \nresolution that says, we don't believe in climate change, if that is \nwhat you want to do. But put it on your letterhead; don't put it into \nan unrelated Customs bill that is actually important for our economy \nand for the American people. Stop trying to muddle good bipartisan \nbills with this sort of divisive, unscientific language that, frankly, \nnot only threatens the environment, but also embarrasses our country. \nThese kinds of provisions have no place in bills like the Customs bill \nand should have been taken out in the process.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, I want to begin by agreeing with my friend on the other side \non a number of areas. I, too, have concerns about the process by which \nwe operate, and would have preferred a number of these items to come, \nas my friend suggests, separately. But the reality is, of course, we \nare late in the year and late in the session, we have got significant \nwork to do, and this, I think, is the best way to proceed.\n  It is worth noting that the conference report itself is a compromise. \nThe Democrats and Republicans were involved in putting that together, \nand, indeed, this entire bill has considerable Democratic support, as \nwe work toward a larger compromise on the omnibus itself.\n  It is also worth noting why we ended up in this situation. Frankly, \nthe Appropriations Committee in this House accomplished its work--all \nof its work--for the first time in a long time early this year. All 12 \nlegislative bills passed through the Appropriations Committee, six of \nthem across this floor. To suggest that anything has been done in the \ndark or in the back room, frankly, ignores that fact.\n  What happened was the United States Senate chose not to allow any \nappropriations bills to come to the floor. They didn't do that as a \nbody. My friends on the other side of the aisle in the Senate--the \nDemocrats--chose not to allow any bills to come to the floor. To be \nfair to them, they also completed every appropriations bill through the \nfull committee. That is the first time that has happened in many, many \nyears in the United States Senate.\n\n  But, our friends, until we got this larger agreement, the budget \nagreement, which I was happy to vote for, and I know my friend on the \nother side also voted for, until we reached that point, the \nappropriations process in the other body didn't happen. At some point, \nthat affects what is going on over here. If they are not moving bills, \nwe stop moving bills because it is sort of a waste of time to do that. \nIf you have got complaints, you should talk to your colleagues in the \nother body on your side of the aisle, and tell them hopefully next year \nthey won't try to keep bills from moving to the floor in a normal way. \nAgain, I am proud that this body moved all 12 bills through the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I also want to make a couple of other points in terms of where we are \nnow in trying to reach an omnibus. This puts me a little bit, again, at \nodds with my friend. I don't think that is a closed process. Frankly, \nit is a pretty normal process. There are representatives involved in \nthese negotiations, both Democratic and Republican, and from the \nadministration. They are working very hard, in good faith, to try and \ndo something that is extremely difficult. Writing a $1.1 trillion \nomnibus bill takes a lot of time, and there are multiple items to be \nnegotiated. I think both sides are negotiating in good faith in this \nlegislative body, and I think the administration is participating in \ngood faith.\n  My friend and I will also disagree that riders on appropriations \nbills, as they are called, is somehow unusual. They certainly, when \nthey were in the majority, had lots of riders on appropriations bills. \nIt is just not an unusual thing. There is, obviously, give-and-take on \nthese things. But Congress, exercising the power of the purse, is a \nperfectly appropriate constitutional tool to use.\n  In this case, where we end up will, indeed, be a compromise. The \nomnibus bill cannot pass either Chamber, and certainly has to be signed \nby the President of the United States. A Republican Congress, our \nfriends with the appropriate tools and votes that they have, the \nPresident of the United States, who has the ultimate veto pen, all of \nthese parties will have to be placated. Again, that negotiation is long \nand complex. We are making good progress. All parties are represented \nthere.\n  Eventually, a bill will be presented to this body, hopefully, in the \nnext few days. I share my friend's concern. I would prefer not to be \nhere. But if we have to be here next week and have two or three more \ndays to have the process work out, so be it.\n  The lessons I think we ought to draw from this, and that we have a \nchance to implement next year, are let's do a normal process. We \nalready have an agreement now for next year's spending numbers. That is \na step in the right direction, and, actually, says a lot of good things \nabout all parties and all concerned that they were able to come to this \nlarger agreement earlier this year.\n  We have no excuse, in my view, not to move all 12 bills across the \nfloor in regular order under an open rule so every Member can come down \nhere and participate. I know that that is certainly the goal of \nChairman Rogers, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I know \nthat is the goal of his ranking member, the distinguished gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Mrs. Lowey).\n  I think the hard work this year has set us up both for a fruitful \ncompromise here in the waning days of the calendar year in the \nlegislative session, and has actually laid the foundation for something \nwe have not seen around here in a long time: regular order, next year. \nIn the course of that regular order, all of us will be forced to \ncompromise.\n  We still live in a divided government: a Republican Congress and a \nDemocratic President. We still operate in a system of checks and \nbalances that our Constitutional forebearers set up over 230 years ago. \nThat system has served us pretty well over the course of our history. I \nthink it will continue to. And it will continue to demand compromise. \nWe have seen a little bit more of that lately. I know my friend has his \nconcerns, some of which, again, I share.\n  I am pretty proud of a Congress that has: number one, produced the \nfirst unitary budget since 2001, where the Senate and the House agree \nthat, for\n\n[[Page H9279]]\n\nthe first time since 2006, has moved all appropriations bills through \nthe Appropriations Committee of both Chambers; that, actually, in \nrecent days and weeks, passed landmark legislation, as my friend \nreferred to, the Reauthorization of Higher Education Act, where I know \nhe played a role in that; the highway bill that was recently passed; \nthis conference report, which I know my friend has some concerns with, \nbut, in fairness, speaks well of him, and pointed out a lot of things \nthat he liked in this conference report.\n  If we sit here and wait to pass things where we all get 100 percent \nof what we want, nothing will ever pass the United States Congress. \nCertainly, in a bill this large, when we reach the omnibus, that is \ngoing to call for many compromises. This bill before us has called for \nmany compromises. But people have found a way to work in good faith.\n  My friend is perfectly in order to oppose the rule. That is a pretty \nnormal position for each side to take, minority and majority. I never \nhave any problem with that. I think we will pass the rule. I hope he \nlooks at the entire bill: the funding of the government and the Customs \nAct, where he had some concerns, but also had many things to point to \nthat he thought were appropriate and good; and the Internet tax \nprevention that we now make permanent, where I know my friend has \nworked very hard for many years to do that.\n  And, yes, there will be some things in this bill that he doesn't \nlike. There are some things in this bill that I don't like. But I think \nif you look at the merits of it, the permanent end of taxes on the \nInternet, the Customs legislation that my friend very ably pointed out \nhas many good provisions; finally, the essential operation of \ngovernment for the next few days, so people negotiating in good faith \nfor both my friend's party and my party and from the administration can \nactually arrive at a deal. I think there is a lot of merit in the \nunderlying legislation.\n  I would just ask that we be realistic. Again, my friend is perfectly \nwithin his rights to oppose both these measures, the rule and the final \nbill. I certainly understand his concern about the rule. If the roles \nwere reversed, my concerns would probably be similar. I hope he looks \nto the underlying legislation when that vote comes and says, there are \na lot of good things here.\n  There is a lot of give-and-take by both sides. There is real \ncompromise. We have done a lot of that in the last few weeks under \nSpeaker Ryan. I think we have the opportunity to do more next year. \nLet's pass the rule, pass the underlying legislation; get to finishing \nour business in the next few days; hopefully give the American people \nwhat they deserve: some peace, quiet, and certainty in the Christmas \nseason; and then come back here next year with an opportunity to build \non this and do some tremendous things in a bipartisan way. That is what \nI intend to work for. I know that is what my friend will be working \nfor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a senior member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.\n  I am here to speak in support of the Customs bill that we will be \nfacing later today. It represents significant progress over the version \nfrom earlier this summer that I opposed. Part of this progress is due \nto strong bipartisan support from the Senate and bipartisan give-and-\ntake with some of my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee.\n  I appreciate having worked with then-Chair Ryan and Chairman Brady to \nsee some of these elements improve. I think it is important to \nrecognize that the bill before us is substantially better. I know there \nare concerns by some of my friends about currency manipulation, which I \nshare, and we have been pushing for and secured stronger provisions.\n  In the Customs bill, we have elements that represent the give-and-\ntake of a legislative process, working with the administration; and the \nprovisions, while no one would suggest they are perfect, are \nsubstantially better than the situation we have right now. We will be \nbetter off with the currency provisions in the Customs bill.\n  It contains many provisions that I fought for that are important to \nmy constituents--businesses in the Pacific Northwest--dealing with \nunfair and outmoded tariff provisions, dealing with things like \nperformance outerwear, that I know I share with my friend from \nColorado. These are important both in terms of businesses that we \nrepresent and constituents that we represent who value that equipment--\nthe shoes, the outdoor apparel--and making it more affordable.\n  Beyond the elements of making sure that the Customs system works more \nappropriately, there are important things that I think all of us can \npoint to and be enthusiastic about. Both speakers have mentioned the \nend of the importation of products that are made by child and forced \nlabor. There are strong provisions here to help us keep that out of the \nstream of commerce.\n  My friend from Oklahoma referenced the ENFORCE Act, and there have \nbeen problems--tires, solar panels--up in my area. We have had people \ncheat and do so with impunity. Incorporating the provisions of the \nENFORCE Act gives us the tools to go after the cheaters, to make them \npay, and to protect American companies and their employees.\n  It permanently establishes the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center \nto centralize and enforce trade enforcement. This is an area that I \nhave been working on throughout this process. In the Ways and Means \nCommittee, I introduced the STRONGER Act with my friend and former \nfellow Northwesterner, Senator Maria Cantwell from Washington, to deal \nwith ways to better enforce our agreements.\n  Today trade agreements are complex and trade enforcement takes a long \nperiod of time. They are expensive. Frankly, we are not equipped as \nwell as we should be to do the job of protecting Americans by enforcing \nand implementing these agreements.\n  This legislation includes the trust fund for enforcement and in-\ncountry capacity building. It provides for up to $30 million a year. It \nmay not seem like much when we are talking about hundreds of billions \nof dollars in the Federal Government, but when you consider that the \nbudget of the United States Trade Representative is less than $60 \nmillion to do all of the things with which they are charged, being able \nto have a $30 million a year enforcement fund is a very significant \nadvancement.\n  Now, I am mindful of the extraneous climate provisions. I think they \nare unfortunate and should have been left out. I think my Republican \nfriends in the future are going to be embarrassed by doing things like \nthis, particularly when the rest of the world is in Paris, working to \ntry and help deal with the crisis that is carbon pollution and climate \nchange.\n  As a practical matter, again, the result of working with the \nadministration and people in the Senate, the provision that is stuck in \nthe bill, yes, is confusing, but it is much better than it was in June, \nand I am convinced it doesn't change the status quo at all, nor \nprohibit other efforts in different forums, such as Paris.\n  The optics are bad for my Republican friends, I think, and I do \nbelieve that they will rue the day for doing things like this. But, as \na practical matter, we are not going to solve our climate problems \nthrough international trade. This doesn't change that.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Because of the composition of the Senate and \nRepublican opposition, we couldn't pass those things when we were in \ncharge. So we are going to do it through other mechanisms. This Customs \nbill does not prevent that. I strongly urge my colleagues' favorable \nconsideration.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First of all, I want to thank my good friend from Oregon for coming \nto the floor and for, frankly, more ably explaining the Customs portion \nof this legislation than I could.\n  I want to commend him and his colleagues for working in a bipartisan \nfashion to improve a bill that had passed earlier this year in ways \nthat I think broadly make it more acceptable\n\n[[Page H9280]]\n\nto a larger percentage in this body. He is to be commended for that. So \nare his colleagues on that committee on both sides of the aisle. So is \nthe administration, which I know has been heavily involved in these \ndeliberations.\n  I think my friend makes an excellent argument for the passage of the \nunderlying legislation. When you combine that with a permanent \nprohibition on Internet taxation--something I assume my friend also \nsupports--and the necessary continuing resolution to give us a few more \ndays to negotiate a bipartisan omnibus spending bill that, frankly, \nboth parties will need to contribute votes toward and that the \nadministration ultimately will have the prerogative of signing, I take \nthese to be hopeful signs.\n  With some of the things that have happened in the last few weeks on a \nbipartisan transportation bill and on a bipartisan education bill and \nwith what I am convinced is essentially a bipartisan conference report \nhere today and with what will be a bipartisan omnibus bill, it sounds \nto me like significant progress.\n  It is something that leaders on both sides of the aisle can take some \npride in as long as we get it done, hopefully, in a timely way next \nweek and then come back here and build on this progress for all of next \nyear, when we can move under regular order.\n  Again, I thank my friend for his hard work on the Customs portion of \nthis. I also thank him for giving what I thought was a very thoughtful, \nconstitutional lesson in give-and-take.\n  There are some things that we might all like to achieve, but that are \njust simply not possible, given the distribution of political power, \nthe checks and balances in our system, and the fact that people do \nhave, indeed, differing opinions and perspectives.\n  But the fact that we have gotten to this point I think demonstrates \nwe can produce a good product even within a complex constitutional \nsystem, with a rather polarized political environment, and given the \nhard realities of divided government. I am pleased we have made the \nprogress that we have made, and I thank my friend for his participation \nin that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentleman from Colorado and let me \nthank the gentleman from Oklahoma for the thoughtful discussion and for \nthe tone in which it is offered.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think all of us certainly are interested in coming to \na place next week that embraces, really, the values of America and all \nof our concerns, and, obviously, riders that are toxic are obstacles we \nneed to continue to discuss.\n  In my district, I have senior citizens with blue tarps on the tops of \ntheir homes, blue tarps that have been there since the terrible \nHurricane Ike. Obviously, we need the Housing and Urban Development to \nhave funding that not only addresses affordable housing, but senior \nhousing repair.\n  It comes down through community development. In the manner in which \nwe are going through this, we are looking for that kind funding to make \nsure that the plus-up of $80 billion that came about through the budget \nagreement gets evenly distributed, if you will. What happens is that, \nwith the extenders of tax provisions that are unpaid for, the blue \ntarps in my district continue to exist. Seniors have roofs that are \nfalling in.\n  I think that is an important issue at which many of us will be \nlooking this weekend, and we will be looking to the appropriators to do \nwhat is right by the American people.\n  We wrote a letter regarding the Minority HIV/AIDS Program, which was \ngutted out. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you that HIV/AIDS is resurging \namong young people and among minorities. This is no time to zero out \nthat funding.\n  As we go through this process, we are asking the question whether you \nare putting in toxic riders, but are not focusing on funding that is \nneeded. The Thomas Street Clinic in my district needs the minority HIV \nfunding.\n  I know that my good friends Mr. Polis and Mr. Cole are certainly \ninterested in making sure that transportation funding matches the \nfunding that came about through the bill. Then, certainly, I hope that, \nas I listen to the calm discussion by Mr. Polis, we can find a way to \neliminate the prohibition from the Centers for Disease Control to not \ndo their work.\n  Why are we preventing them from discerning the impact of gun violence \non suicide? of the impact of gun violence on young people who are \ncommitting suicide? We have done research on drunk driving. We have \ndone research on cancer. We have done research on diabetes. We have \ndone research to move the country forward in a healthy manner. Why are \nwe blocking the CDC from assessing what the impact is from gun \nviolence?\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I now understand that the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act is in this legislation and it is in this \nlegislation permanently. There was no hearing. I remember this bill on \nthe floor of the House in June.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I have a number of letters to include \nfor the Record. One is from Tom McGee, the President and CEO of the \nInternational Council of Shopping Centers. One is from the NRF. One is \nfrom the AFL-CIO.\n\n                                                December 10, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 70,000 members of the \n     International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), I am \n     writing to urge you to oppose the conference report on H.R. \n     644, Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, which \n     contains a non-germane provision permanently extending the \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act (PITFA). This is considered a key \n     vote for ICSC.\n       Because PITFA was included without being paired with long \n     awaited remote sales tax collection legislation, the added \n     fiscal pressure being put on states and local governments \n     will result in less funds for first responders and \n     infrastructure and additional pressure to increase other \n     state and local taxes such as sales or property taxes. This \n     will truly add insult to injury for thousands of local \n     businesses across the country.\n       As an organization, ICSC supports PITFA but strongly \n     believes that a permanent restriction on states' ability to \n     tax telecommunications services should absolutely be linked \n     with the restoration of states' rights to collect sales taxes \n     that are already owed in 45 states today. It is not only a \n     missed opportunity to pursue good policy, but the manner in \n     which this provision is being advanced certainly represents a \n     departure from regular order.\n       After more than 20 years, close to 40 hearings and a \n     successful bipartisan vote in the Senate, it is time for \n     Congress to do the right thing and update sales tax \n     collection policy to reflect the 21st century marketplace. \n     The shopping center industry has sales that represent 15% of \n     U.S. GDP, employs 1 out of every 11 Americans and generates \n     $141 billion in sales tax revenue. Our industry touches \n     people's lives every day and is essential to the economic, \n     civic and social vibrancy of every community. We urge you to \n     send an important message on state tax policy and oppose H.R. \n     644. Please vote NO when the Trade Facilitation and Trade \n     Enforcement Act Conference report is voted on later this \n     week.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Tom McGee,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: On behalf \n     of the National Retail Federation (NRF), I would like to take \n     this opportunity to share our views on the Conference Report \n     to the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 \n     (HR 644). NRF is concerned with the last-minute inclusion of \n     the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act (PITFA) as part of the \n     Conference Report, without also including legislation to \n     provide parity in sales tax treatment of internet sales with \n     sales in brick and mortar stores, like H.R. 2775, The Remote \n     Transactions Parity Act.\n       NRF has long supported the efforts to pass a Customs \n     Reauthorization bill, especially those provisions focused on \n     trade facilitation. We believe the Conference Report includes \n     provisions to help facilitate and streamline the Customs \n     process. While we strongly support enforcement of U.S. trade \n     laws, we remain concerned with the final enforcement language \n     and the impact it will have on retailers and other downstream \n     consumers.\n       Unfortunately we are extremely concerned about the \n     inclusion of the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act (PITFA) \n     in the final conference report. Retailers have long believed \n     that it is appropriate to eliminate the\n\n[[Page H9281]]\n\n     sales tax discrimination for brick and mortar stores as part \n     of Congressional consideration of PITFA. This past \n     Thanksgiving week-end was the first time that electronic \n     sales surpassed brick and mortar sales in that key metric for \n     retail sales. As more and more Main Street retailers close \n     their doors because they cannot compete, it is time for \n     Congress to remove the sales tax advantage for internet \n     sellers that is harming our communities. We need a level \n     playing field so retailers can compete without the government \n     advantaging one sector of the industry over another.\n       NRF is the world's largest retail trade association, \n     representing discount and department stores, home goods and \n     specialty stores, Main Street merchants, grocers, \n     wholesalers, chain restaurants and Internet retailers from \n     the United States and more than 45 countries. Retail is the \n     nation's largest private sector employer, supporting one in \n     four U.S. jobs--42 million working Americans. Contributing \n     $2.6 trillion to annual GDP, retail is a daily barometer for \n     the nation's economy.\n       We urge you to remove language on PITFA from the final \n     conference report, unless it is accompanied by sales tax \n     fairness.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                David French, \n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                                December 10, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I write to \n     urge you to oppose the conference report on H.R. 644, the \n     Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Customs \n     Bill).\n       The Customs Bill, which when it emerged from the Senate had \n     bipartisan support and included provisions supported by both \n     labor and industry, was loaded up in the House with numerous \n     controversial and partisan provisions that weakened or \n     unacceptably altered it and would make it more difficult to \n     negotiate trade agreements that are good for workers and the \n     environment. Unfortunately, numerous of these unacceptable \n     provisions remain in the bill that will be voted upon.\n       Stripped from the final bill is a critical bipartisan \n     currency provision that would have made clear the U.S. can \n     treat currency manipulation as a countervailable subsidy. The \n     remaining currency provisions are a poor substitute, simply \n     calling for ``engagement'' and with so-called \n     ``consequences'' that simply won't work--including the \n     possible exclusion from OPIC funding, something the worst \n     currency manipulators (including China and Japan) don't \n     receive anyway.\n       The conferenced Customs Bill also contains language that \n     U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) must not include \n     obligations regarding greenhouse gas emissions. This will \n     prevent the United States from making meaningful commitments \n     on climate policy. It is incomprehensible how a 21st century \n     trade agenda would ignore the reality of important climate \n     issues.\n       Also included in the bill is language weakening the \n     Menendez trafficking amendment, which barred Tier 3 \n     trafficking nations from joining U.S. FTAs. Weakening this \n     provision by allowing a nation to be included should they \n     merely implement ``principal'' recommendations for changes, \n     undermines the U.S. commitment to lead on human trafficking \n     and raises doubt regarding the ability of the FTAs to protect \n     workers and ensure compliance by trading partners with \n     internationally recognized ILO labor rights, including the \n     right to be free from forced labor. This move is particularly \n     troubling given the recent interest expressed by Thailand in \n     joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Thailand is a \n     Tier 3 trafficking nation and should not be allowed to \n     participate in the TPP until such time as it is no longer \n     justifiably designated as a worst-trafficking nation. On a \n     related note, language is included in the bill that could be \n     used to prevent trade deals from ensuring that migrant \n     workers have effective protections and remedies against \n     fraud, trafficking, forced labor, and other forms of labor \n     exploitation and abuse.\n       This package also contains a harmful bill unrelated to \n     trade. We strenuously oppose the inclusion of the Permanent \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act (PITFA), which bans the authority of \n     state and local governments to impose taxes on internet \n     access. By restricting state and local government taxing \n     authority, this bill reduces the ability of state and local \n     governments to raise funds to invest in needed \n     infrastructure, education, health care, job training and \n     other vital public services. This unrelated harmful measure \n     was unfortunately added at the last minute.\n       While the bill does contain Rep. Sanchez's ENFORCE Act, \n     which would address the circumvention of antidumping and \n     countervailing duties and assist with addressing unfair \n     trade, other provisions in this bill remain unacceptable.\n       The Customs Conference Report unfortunately too closely \n     resembles the flawed House version of the bill and the AFL-\n     CIO urges you to oppose it.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               William Samuel,\n\n                          Director, Government Affairs Department.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the point I want to make is, with what \nyou are doing, even though there is a 4-year lapse, you are \ngrandfathering this. My own State of Texas will lose $358 million, \nWisconsin $120 million, Ohio $65 million, and South Dakota will lose \nabout $13 million.\n  Are we going to replace those moneys from the Federal Government? \nWhat are we going to do to the retail industry that has bricks and \nmortar?\n  My friends, I am going to support a CR, but I do believe we should \nwork together to do things that impact us positively and not \nnegatively. Get rid of the riders and help our States, which have a \nneed to have this Internet tax provision lifted.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior Member of the House Judiciary Committee; as \nthe Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland \nSecurity, and Investigations; and as the representative from Houston, I \nrise in opposition to the ``Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act'' being \nin this bill.\n   When originally enacted in 1998, the Internet Tax Freedom Act \nestablished a temporary moratorium on multiple and discriminatory \ntaxation of the Internet as well as new taxes on Internet access.\n  This moratorium, however, is due to expire on October 1st of this \nyear.\n  Since 1998, Congress has extended the moratorium on a temporary \nbasis. The bill before us will make that moratorium permanent.\n  Unfortunately, in doing so, the bill also ends the Act's grandfather \nprotections for states that imposed such taxes prior to the Act's \nenactment date.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill is problematic for several reasons.\n  First, Congress, instead of supporting this seriously flawed \nlegislation, should be focusing on meaningful ways to help state and \nlocal governments, taxpayers, and local retailers. The House can do \nthat by addressing the remote sales tax issue.\n  In addition to extending the expiring moratorium on a temporary \nbasis, the House should take up and send to the Senate legislation that \nwould give states the authority to collect sales taxes from remote \nsellers.\n  Such a proposal would incentivize remote sellers to collect and remit \nsales taxes as well as require states to simplify several procedures \nthat would benefit retailers.\n  Such legislation would enable states and local governments to collect \nmore than $23 billion in estimated uncollected sales taxes each year.\n  The measure would also help level the playing field for local \nretailers--who must collect sales taxes--when they compete with out-of-\nstate businesses that do not collect these taxes.\n  Retail competitors should be able to compete fairly with their \ninternet counterparts at least with respect to sales tax policy.\n  The House should do its part and address the remote sales tax \ndisparity before the end of this Congress.\n  Second, this legislation will severely impact the immediate revenues \nfor the grandfather-protected states and all states progressively in \nthe long term.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, for example, estimates that this \nbill will cost certain states ``several hundred million dollars \nannually'' in lost revenues.\n  Indeed, the Federation of Tax Administrators has estimated that the \nbill will cause the grandfather-protected states to lose at least $500 \nmillion in lost revenue annually.\n  For my home state of Texas, enactment of this bill will result in a \nrevenue loss of $358 million per year. Texas will not be alone in these \nlosses, annually: Wisconsin will lose about $127 million, Ohio will \nlose about $65 million, and South Dakota will lose about $13 million.\n\n  Should this bill become law, state and local governments will have to \nchoose whether they will cut essential government services--such as \neducating our children, maintaining needed transportation \ninfrastructure, and providing essential public health and safety \nservices--or shift the tax burden onto other taxpayers through \nincreased property, income, and sales taxes.\n  Meanwhile, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated \nthat the permanent moratorium will deny the non-grandfathered states of \nalmost $6.5 billion in potential state and local sales tax revenues \neach year in perpetuity.\n  This bill will burden taxpayers, while excluding an entire industry \nfrom paying their fair share of taxes.\n  Finally, this bill ignores the fundamental nature of the Internet.\n  The original moratorium was intentionally made temporary to ensure \nthat Congress, industry, and state and local governments would be able \nto monitor the issue and make adjustments where necessary to \naccommodate new technologies and market realities.\n  The Act was intended as a temporary measure to assist and nurture the \nfledgling Internet that--back in 1998--was still in its commercial\n\n[[Page H9282]]\n\ninfancy. Yet, this bill ignores the significantly changed environment \nof today's internet.\n  The bill's supporters continue to believe that the internet still is \nin need of extraordinary protection in the form of exemption from all \nstate taxation.\n  But, the internet of 2015 is drastically different from its 1998 \npredecessor. And, surely the internet and its attendant technology will \ncontinue to evolve.\n  Permanently extending the tax moratorium severely limits Congress's \nability to revisit and make any necessary adjustments.\n  Simply put, a permanent moratorium is unwise.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 235 and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  The bill is misguided legislation that will devastate state revenues, \nespecially for those states currently protected by the grandfather \nclause, and could force state governments to eliminate essential \ngovernmental programs and services, while increasing the burden on \ntaxpayers.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject this flawed \nlegislation; that makes the internet tax moratorium permanent, in part.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, I want to thank my friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from \nTexas, for coming down and raising important issues.\n  I am not involved in the negotiations where HUD is concerned, but it \nwould be my hope that her concerns would be addressed, quite frankly. I \nthink, with the additional funds that are a product of the bipartisan \nnegotiations of the Budget Act, which I know my friend supported, there \nis certainly a prospect that that will occur.\n  The negotiations that are going on now are indeed bipartisan. I have \nno doubt my friend's point of view is ably represented by her \nDemocratic colleagues in those negotiations and by the administration. \nSo, hopefully, we will arrive at a product in the next few days that \nwill address some of those concerns.\n  I want to reinforce my friend's remarks about moving in a cooperative \nway. Again, we are not going to agree on every part of every piece of \nlegislation, but I think the underlying legislation that we present \ntoday is a product of bipartisan cooperation and of compromise and of \ngive-and-take. It is my hope that many people on both sides of the \naisle will be able to support that.\n  There are three important elements of the Customs proposals. My \nfriend from Oregon earlier laid out the many virtues with them, and, \nfrankly, my friend from Colorado has extolled many parts of them.\n  The prohibition of taxation on the Internet I think is something we \nhave routinely passed through this body since 1998. It has usually not \nbeen a particularly contentious issue. It is something we agree on on \nboth sides of the aisle. Making it permanent makes a lot of sense, and \nI am hopeful that many of my colleagues who have worked so hard on that \nwill see that as an advantage.\n  Finally, I don't think we disagree on a short-term continuing \nresolution because we know that our Representatives on the \nAppropriations Committee--certainly Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member \nLowey--are working really hard to find a bipartisan compromise.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Now, I will remind my friends, we are not going to agree on every \npart of this bill. There will be elements, so-called riders, that are \nin them that probably some of my friends don't like. There will be \nDemocratic riders in this bill, not just Republican riders. That is \njust the process of normal legislation.\n  Congress has every right to use the power of the purse. I don't know \nany executive branch, be it Republican or Democrat, that ever likes \nCongress getting down to the details of this. They just expect us to \nwrite a check for whatever they ask for. Well, that is not the way our \nConstitution is set up.\n  While the executive branch has a range of powers and authorities that \nare unique to itself, at the end of the day, we do fund every single \nactivity that they engage in. At the end of the day, we have the right \nto say: Well, we agree with you here, here, and here, but we disagree \nhere, and we are not funding that activity.\n  Now, in this case, I would always point out that wherever we end up \nat the end of the day is, by necessity, going to be a matter of \ncompromise. My friends, frankly, don't have the congressional strength \nin either the House or the Senate to dictate to us, but we don't have \nit to dictate to them either.\n  Obviously, the President of the United States is of my friend's \npolitical party, and he has got to sign this legislation. So anything \nthat gets done is going to involve a lot of compromises. Anything that \ncomes to this floor, whether you like or dislike it, will have been \napproved at some level or, at least, accepted at some level by Members \nof both parties, as this is what we had to agree to.\n  So I am optimistic about that, and I am very pleased, frankly, that \nthis process is largely driven by the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Mr. Rogers, and by Mrs. Lowey from New York. I know them to \nbe exceptional legislators. I know that all parties concerned here and \ntheir Senate counterparts and their administration counterparts are \ninvolved in a good faith effort to give us a good funding bill for next \nyear and to set the stage for what we hope is a normal appropriations \nprocess.\n  If we have that process next year, my friends on both sides of the \naisle will have the opportunity to see every bill on the floor, the \nopportunity to offer any amendment they want, the opportunity to \nliterally educate the committee about some concern that may be unique \nto their district or something that they understand, frankly, better \nthan the members of the Appropriations Committee. That is the process \nthat we are trying to get back to. I know it will serve the country \nwell if we can actually reach that.\n  What we have done in the last few months of this year has actually \nset that up: the budget agreement, which was proceeded by a temporary \nCR and the budget agreement that came out of that, the omnibus we are \nworking on now, and the legislation that has passed in the last few \nweeks in a very bipartisan fashion on education and highways. All of \nthose things create a foundation for what can be an exceptionally \nproductive year next year and one where we move through regular order.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Texas for bringing her concerns to the \nfloor. I look forward to working with her on the underlying \nlegislation, which I hope has enough items in it to attract significant \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Kind), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for yielding \nme this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Ways and Means Committee and as \nsomeone who has been involved in negotiations in regards to the Customs \nbill before us today, I rise in strong support of that bill. I \nencourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  The Customs bill before us today is not the Customs bill that was \nreported out of the House in June of this year, a bill, quite frankly, \nthat I couldn't support because of extraneous provisions--controversial \nprovisions--that got included in it.\n  Through the product of the give-and-take in the negotiations, I think \nwe reached a good bipartisan compromise. This is what bipartisanship \nlooks like: the cooperation, the give-and-take. It is not a perfect \nbill. I know there are still some objections to it.\n  At its crux, however, this bill provides us important tools and \nresources to enhance enforcement mechanisms so we can enforce trade \nagreements and the standards that we are trying to elevate in these \ntrade agreements. For instance, this bill, with the language that I \nworked on very hard with my colleagues Mr. Levin and Mr. Lewis on the \nWays and Means Committee will finally end the importation of goods and \nproducts based on the exploitation of child and forced and slave labor. \nThat is in this bill.\n  This bill also includes the full ENFORCE Act on the Senate side, the \nPROMISE Act on the House side that again gives us additional tools to \nenforce elevated standards in the trade agreements that we lacked \npreviously.\n\n[[Page H9283]]\n\n  It also establishes for the first time an interagency trade \nenforcement center to require greater coordination from our agencies \nwhen it comes to the implementation and the enforcement of trade \nprovisions that matter, leveling the playing field for our businesses, \nour workers, and our farmers.\n  With the help of my friend from Oregon, we were able to get included \na trade enforcement trust fund so that resources are dedicated for the \nenforcement of trade agreements. I hear that a lot from our colleagues \nthat they are not so much concerned with what goes into the trade \nagreements; they are more concerned about the lack of follow-up and the \nenforcement of the trade agreements. Again, because of the progress we \nhave made and the creation of this trust fund, there will be resources \nin the future that will enable us to better enforce the trade \nagreements that are in front of us.\n  This also, again, to the credit of the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. \nBlumenauer), establishes a Super 301 section, enhanced trade \nenforcement on key priorities, such as labor, environmental, and human \nrights standards that are now being negotiated in the body of these \ntrade agreements. They are fully enforceable like any other provision. \nThis Super 301 gives us tools now to be able to follow that up and \nenforce it.\n  This also establishes a State trade and export promotion program to \nhelp our smaller businesses, our manufacturers in our respective States \nto get in the game and be able to offer more export opportunities to \nthem. We know that with exporting companies their workers are paid \nroughly 18 to 19 percent more than other workers in our economy, so \nthis is a good thing to help promote exports in our own country.\n  This also provides our Treasury-enhanced tools when it comes to \nfighting against the manipulation of currency in the foreign markets. \nThe Bennett language that was agreed to in this language is a step in \nthe right direction when it comes to the enforcement of currency \nmanipulation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, again, that is a source of concern that many \nof our colleagues have expressed concern about and, I think, \nlegitimately so. Again, progress was made in this Customs bill when it \ncomes to currency manipulation.\n  For all these reasons, I think it is important that we move forward \non this Customs bill and give this administration and future \nadministrations the tools they need in order to enforce trade \nagreements so we can elevate standards and begin to level the playing \nfield for our workers, our businesses, and our farmers so that they can \nbe as successful as they can be in the 21st century global economy. I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to quickly respond to my friend's point and, number one, \nthank him for his hard work in getting us to this position on this very \nimportant Customs legislation. I appreciate the bipartisan manner in \nwhich the work product was clearly achieved. I take a lot of hope from \nthe fact that our current Speaker was actually the chairman of the \ncommittee in much of that process, and obviously Mr. Brady from Texas \ncontinues in that tradition. So I am pretty hopeful that we are seeing \na good, open process that is producing products that Members on both \nsides of this Chamber are happy to support and participate in. So this \nis a good and hopeful thing. Again, I thank my friend for coming back \nand educating us about an area he knows a great deal more about than I \ndo.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nChabot).\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Cole \nhas been a leader in this area for many years now, and I appreciate \nthat leadership.\n  I rise today, as chairman of the House Small Business Committee, in \nstrong support of H.R. 644, the Trade Facilitation and Trade \nEnforcement Act of 2015.\n  The importance of robust international trade for America's small \nbusinesses cannot be overstated. Small businesses represent 98 percent \nof all goods-exporting firms in the United States--98 percent are small \nbusinesses--establishing our Nation's role as the world's leader in \ninternational trade. Seven out of every 10 new jobs in this country are \ncreated by small businesses. So if we want to improve the economy and \ntrade, small businesses are an integral part of doing that. In my home \nState of Ohio alone, more than 1.5 million jobs are tied to \ninternational trade, many of them with these small firms.\n  The bipartisan Customs reauthorization bill before us today will give \nsmall businesses the confidence and security they need to compete in a \nglobal marketplace. Specifically, it accomplishes this important goal \nby making sure international trade agreements are working to benefit \nAmerica's small businesses and the employees of those small businesses. \nThat is why I am pleased that the finished bill incorporates language \nthat our committee helped to craft to ensure we are doing everything we \ncan to keep the doors of trade open to small businesses. We have done \nthis in that committee, in general, in a bipartisan fashion.\n  By modernizing the procedures and systems used by Customs and Border \nProtection, this bill also improves trade facilitation and makes sure \ntheir safeguards are working as intended.\n  By giving the Treasury new tools to crack down on currency \nmanipulation, this bill ensures that foreign competitors like China \naren't taking advantage of our workers and small businesses. That has \nbeen a top issue for those of us that have dealt with trade, and that \nis the concept, that the Chinese have been manipulating their currency \nto give them an unfair advantage over America's businesses, that this \nbill helps to deal with.\n  By empowering the CPB and the Department of Commerce, this bill will \nmake it easier to hold bad actors accountable when they engage in \nunfair trade or evasive trade practices. Mr. Speaker, this is truly \ncommonsense legislation that will help America's small businesses at a \ntime when they need our help to compete in the era of globalization.\n  I also thank my friend and colleague from Texas (Mr. Brady), the \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee, for his leadership on this \nissue. He has worked on this since he introduced a Customs \nreauthorization bill back in 2011, and I know that is the basis for \ntoday's legislation. I again thank Chairman Cole for his hard work in \nthis area because trade is important to jobs. Yes, it is important to \nlarge corporations, but it is especially important to those small \nbusinesses all across America who engage in international trade. In the \nSmall Business Committee, we are encouraging them more and more to do \nthat. That means more jobs for more families all over this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, even after we pass this continuing resolution today, we \nwill still be just 5 days away from a government shutdown. That is no \nway to run the greatest, freest, most prosperous country on the face of \nthe Earth. We agree on so many of the issues. I urge my colleagues to \nstop the partisan games.\n  We have shown in recent weeks we can produce good, bipartisan \nlegislation when we just put the controversial, divisive poison pills \non the side. Look at what we accomplished in transportation and in \neducation. Let's continue that trend. Let's drop the ideological wish \nlist for another time and pass the spending bill without the last-\nminute hysterics and partisan riders.\n  In recent weeks, Americans have witnessed two senseless, horrific \nmass shootings: one very near to my district in Colorado that took \nthree lives, and another in San Bernardino, California, that took 14 \nlives. These slayings are heartbreaking and tragic. Sadly, no one can \nany longer use the adjective to describe them as ``shocking.'' There \nhave been 355 mass shootings in 2015, which, themselves, are just a \nsmall portion of the 48,000 incidents of gun violence so far this year.\n  While I strongly support the rights given to Americans in our Second \nAmendment, I believe there are commonplace measures that we must take\n\n[[Page H9284]]\n\nto curtail gun violence. A commonsense improvement we can make is \npassing legislation to keep individuals who are suspected of terrorist \nactivity from purchasing firearms.\n  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the \nrule that would allow the House to consider H.R. 1076, the Denying \nFirearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015. H.R. 1076 \nwould amend the criminal code to stop the issuance of firearm licenses \nto people on the terrorism watch list.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. It is time to act. Let's \nmake it harder for criminals and terrorists to quietly assemble \narsenals designed to kill innocent Americans. We can do that. We can \nprotect the Second Amendment. We can implement commonsense reforms that \nkeep America safe.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  There is nothing Congress can do to end gun violence, but we can and \nwe must take action to reduce gun violence. If we defeat the previous \nquestion, we will do that. It will pass, and it will become law, and \nthe American people will be safer. Stop standing in the way, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' to defeat the previous question.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  First, before I close, I want to thank my friend for the debate and \nfor his thoughtful remarks.\n  Not surprisingly, there will be a couple of areas in my close where I \ndisagree with my good friend. One of them is the process itself. I \nshare, actually, his frustration and the need for us to move under \nregular order. I share the frustration I think both sides share in this \nthat we are doing an omnibus, but I remind my friends, we moved six \nbills across the floor here. Every bill has moved through the full \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n  Frankly, our friends on the other side of the rotunda need to take a \nconsiderable responsibility for the delay in the appropriations, since \nthey prevented the Senate from actually picking up and acting on \nindividual bills. I think, frankly, had they done so, we would have had \na more orderly process and been out of here in an easier way. My hope \nis next year they will do that, because I think in the bipartisan \nbudget compromise, we set a framework up by deciding early on what the \ntop line numbers are for next year, where that process can, indeed, \noccur. I certainly promise to work with my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle to see that we restore regular order, bring each \nappropriations bill down here.\n  I am going to disagree with my friend, too, on this terrorist watch \nlist idea. This is a very interesting point. I think Members on both \nsides are equally committed to making sure all of our citizens are \nsafe, but the terrorist watch list that my friend has talked about is \none of the more mysterious lists in the United States.\n  As I read the press, I find one article that tells me there are \n47,000 people on it; another one that tells me, no, there is 470,000 \npeople; yet another that tells me there are 1 million people on it or \nmore. I do know that the American Civil Liberties Union has called the \nterrorist watch list a ``massive, virtually standardless, government \nwatch list scheme that ensnares innocent people and encourages racial \nand religious profiling.'' Now, that is not from a conservative group. \nThat is the American Civil Liberties Union.\n  I also know in this Chamber, one of our distinguished colleagues, the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), who, when he was a State \nsenator, found out accidentally going to the airport he was on the \nterrorist watch list. He found out another Democratic colleague, \nanother State senator, was also on the terrorist watch list. They \ninquired as to why, and they were told: Well, we can't tell you.\n  Eventually, working with the Sergeant at Arms of the California \nSenate, they were able to determine Mr. McClintock had been confused \nwith an IRA--Irish Republican Army--terrorist, and the other gentleman \nhad been confused with somebody else. We know that the late Senator \nKennedy was, at one time, on the terrorist watch list. So I think this \nis a very imperfect tool that will ensnare lots of innocent Americans \nin it.\n  It is also worth noting--and this was a fact that was made acquainted \nto me by our good friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) \nwho, along with his distinguished record of service for over 21 years \nin the United States Army, is an arms manufacturer and an arms seller--\nhe pointed out actually the terrorist watch list is one of the lists \nthat is used by the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms group to decide \nwhether or not to issue a permit. So it is a factor in now. It is not \nexclusive. You wouldn't exclude somebody simply because they were \nthere, but it is a factor taken into consideration.\n  I say this just to suggest that perhaps we shouldn't seize on this as \na be-all and a political talking point. This is worth a real serious \nlook as to whether or not this particular list, how it is compiled, who \nis on it, what is the appropriate way to use it?\n  I think the last thing we should do is attach it to legislation \nwithout the appropriate hearing and discussion of it, which actually I \nthink my friend on the other side would generally be in favor of.\n  There are plenty of reasons, anecdotal and serious studies, when, \nagain, groups like the American Civil Liberties Union look at this as a \nvery imperfect tool that will violate the civil liberties of the \naverage American. Again, I caution my friends on the other side. It is \na great political talking point, but I think it is a pretty imperfect \ntool, and I think they would find themselves embarrassed, frankly, were \nit used in the manner that they suggest here.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me move to my close. Passage of the continuing \nresolution, as we both agree, is critical to prevent a government \nshutdown and, frankly, to allow both sides and the administration to \ncontinue to negotiate. A CR passed the Senate yesterday by voice vote. \nWe should pass this rule, and we should support the underlying \nlegislation.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An amendment to H. Res. 560 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney \n     General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of \n     firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected \n     dangerous terrorist. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1076.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To\n\n[[Page H9285]]\n\n     defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a \n     chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites \n     the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that \n     ``the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the \n     previous question passes the control of the resolution to the \n     opposition'' in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, \n     1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule \n     resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a \n     member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, \n     asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. \n     Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ``The previous question having been \n     refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had \n     asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is \n     entitled to the first recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of adoption of the resolution.\n  The vote was taken by electronic

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H9287]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to be here today to talk about the \nconference report on the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act \nof 2015. This process marks a return to regular order and ensures that \nMembers and constituent voices are heard. As chairman of the House Ways \nand Means Committee, I share the Speaker's commitment to an open and \ntransparent process.\n  The conference report builds on the good work of my fellow conferees, \nRepresentatives Reichert and Tiberi, as well as support from a number \nof our Ways and Means members in the conference as a whole and dozens \nof other Members. It delivers on the promises we made to those Members \nwhen we considered trade legislation earlier this year.\n  Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill is a vital part of our \nprogrowth agenda. It will level the playing field for Americans and \nalso make it easier for them to compete in a global marketplace. It \nsignificantly improves trade facilitation. Here is how: it ensures that \nCustoms and Border Protection focuses on its trade-related mission and \nstreamlines processing of legitimate trade which will increase U.S. \ncompetitiveness and create U.S. jobs; it modernizes the agency's \nautomated system and reduces paperwork burden. Basically, this bill \nreplaces inefficiency with innovation and eliminates outdated systems.\n  In addition, Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe that free trade is \nenforceable trade, and I am glad that this bill significantly \nstrengthens enforcement of America's trade law. It creates new tools to \ncombat currency manipulation based on ideas from Representative Miller \nand her colleagues in the Michigan delegation. It gives Customs and \nBorder Protection new tools and holds it accountable to effectively act \nagainst evasion of antidumping and countervailing duties, including by \ntargeting risky imports and establishing a new investigation process \nwith strict deadlines and judicial review. Representatives Boustany and \nJason Smith deserve credit for working together to make sure these \nprovisions were included.\n  The conference report strengthens trade promotion authority by \nreaffirming that trade agreements should not include provisions on \nimmigration or greenhouse gas emissions, for which Representatives King \nand Sessions deserve great recognition.\n  It ensures greater oversight of administration trade nominees and at \ntrade negotiating rounds.\n  This bill also includes important provisions to help fight human \ntrafficking, which is a scourge that we must take seriously.\n  Thanks to Representative Roskam's leadership, the conference report \ncombats politically motivated acts against our good friend and ally \nIsrael.\n  With respect to the miscellaneous tariff bill, it reaffirms Congress' \ncommitment to advancing a legislative process with robust consultation \nand consistent with House rules. I fully intend to work with my \ncolleagues to develop this process early next year.\n  Finally, it contains the Internet Tax Freedom Act to permanently ban \nStates and localities from taxing Internet access or Internet commerce.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important \nlegislation. While I celebrate this bill, this is only the beginning. \nAs chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, I want to make sure my \nconstituents in Texas and constituents all across America understand \nthat we are going to continue to move progrowth bills that help grow \nour economy and make it easier for all Americans to find good jobs and \nhave more opportunities.\n  We have got an ambitious agenda, and we are just getting started. You \ncan expect to see more action soon at our committee and on this floor \non trade, on jobs, and on all the economic issues that matter to the \nAmerican people. We are going to lead, and we are going to deliver.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this conference report. I am \ndisappointed that we have passed up an opportunity for a truly \nbipartisan action on Customs and trade legislation. The Senate took \nthat opportunity over the summer. It passed a Customs bill by a vote of \n78-20 that was truly about Customs and trade enforcement. It included a \nstrong provision to address currency manipulation, the most significant \ntrade enforcement failure over the past decade, and the Senate bill \nvery importantly avoided including wrongful positions and provisions \nthat had nothing to do whatsoever with Customs or trade enforcement.\n  The House bill did just the opposite. It passed a bill that seeks to \nprevent our trade agreements from addressing climate change and weakens \ncurrent law on human trafficking. It failed to include anything \nmeaningful on currency manipulation, even though just a few years ago \nthis House passed a currency bill very similar to what was in the \nSenate Customs bill by a vote of 348-79. Because of the partisan and \nflawed nature of the House Customs bill, just 12 Democrats voted for \nit.\n  This conference report is far more like the fundamentally flawed \nHouse bill than the Senate bill. The conference committee rejected the \nSenate currency provision, as I said, one that had the support of 348 \nHouse Members just a few years ago.\n  There is much talk about how this bill will create jobs and about \neconomic growth. But make no mistake; over the past decade or so, \ncurrency manipulation has cost the U.S., our workers, and our industry \nbetween 2 and 5 million jobs. Instead, this conference bill includes a \nmeaningless provision that simply calls for more talk, more deference \nto the Treasury Department, and no real action.\n  The climate change language in the conference report sends just the \nwrong message as our diplomats are working in Paris with over 150 \nnations to find an agreement on this threat to our environment. The \nlanguage in this conference report on climate change is far more than \nconfusing, as some people like to say. It would prevent us, for \nexample, from negotiating provisions like common fuel efficiency \nstandards, a very real possibility in our negotiations with Europe. As \nreported today from Paris, the Republican Party of the United States \nmay be the only political party anywhere in denial about climate \nchange. That denial is why this provision on climate in this conference \nreport is before us.\n  Now, as to human trafficking, this provision weakens current law by \nallowing for a trade agreement with a tier 3 country to be fast-tracked \nso long as that country ``has taken concrete actions'' to implement \nrecommended changes, no matter how egregious the conditions are still \nin place. Countries on tier 3 are the worst actors, countries that the \nState Department has concluded ``do not fully comply with the minimum \nstandards under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.'' We need to \nget these countries to meet minimum standards on trafficking, certainly \nwell before we enter into a trade investment relationship with them. \nUnfortunately, this conference report does not get us there.\n  These and other fundamental flaws outweigh the enforcement provisions \nthat were included in the conference report. Most of the enforcement \nprovisions are weak, and I think they are being oversold. For example, \nthe bill establishes an interagency enforcement center, but that has \nalready existed for several years.\n  It renews the Super 301, which requires the USTR to report regularly \non its trade enforcement priorities, but this is something an \nadministration can already do on its own, just as the Clinton \nadministration did.\n  The bill establishes, also, a new trade enforcement trust fund, but \nthose funds still need to be appropriated and paid for, just as they \ndid in the past.\n  It requires the ITC to make information related to imports available \non its Web site, information that already exists in other forms in the \nsame Web site.\n  All this is very disappointing because there are positive aspects of \nthis bill, such as the ENFORCE Act that my colleague Linda Sanchez has \nspearheaded, which will help to address the circumvention of \nantidumping and countervailing duties to address unfair trade. All of \nthe deep flaws in this conference report far overshadow this provision \nand the real Customs provisions that have long had bipartisan support.\n  Going further, the bill includes an Internet tax provision added by \nthe\n\n[[Page H9288]]\n\nconferees that has absolutely no place in this Customs bill. It was \nneither in the House nor the Senate Customs bill. Not only is it not a \nCustoms measure, it is not even a trade measure. Dropping this \nprovision into a conference report at the last minute and with no \nwarning is no way to legislate. It is the opposite of regular order.\n  Indeed, this conference report does not tell it straight. As I said, \nit deletes the only provision that reflects meaningful legislation on \ncurrency, which has devastated U.S. jobs and economic growth, \nlegislation that overwhelmingly passed the House previously.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  It keeps provisions inserted by the House to encourage Republicans \nwho oppose action on climate change, as I said, at the same time the \nworld is meeting in Paris, thwarting further possible action on climate \nchange in trade negotiations, including with Europe.\n  It tones down a provision which had teeth on human sex and labor \ntrafficking.\n  It sneaks in another provision totally unrelated to Customs, as I \nsaid, never being discussed at the only meeting of the conference \ncommittee, relating to taxation of Internet access. It leaves in the \ndust the issue of trying to even out the taxation of sales on the \nInternet with sales at hardworking brick-and-mortar stores.\n  For all of these reasons, all of them, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Reichert), who is the chairman of the Trade \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I thank \nhim for his hard work, and Mr. Boustany, Mr. Tiberi, and other members \nof the committee, who have worked hard on this legislation, and, also, \nMembers across the aisle who have come together to build this piece of \nlegislation presented here today.\n  I rise in strong support, Mr. Speaker, of this important legislation.\n  In my home State of Washington, 40 percent of jobs are tied directly \nto trade. We are the most trade-dependent State in the country. This \nbill supports that trade and those jobs through the elimination of \nunnecessary roadblocks U.S. companies face when exporting and importing \ngoods and the enhanced enforcement of our laws. And it lays the \ngroundwork for the miscellaneous tariff bill, often called the MTB, \nwhich reduces costs on American manufacturers and supports jobs across \nthis country.\n  I am proud that this bill includes several provisions that I have \nchampioned with colleagues across the aisle from the Pacific Northwest, \nincluding outdoor recreation apparel provisions with my colleague from \nthe State of Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), and the renewal of the State \ntrade expansion program with my colleague from the State of Washington \n(Mr. Larsen). We have fought hard for those two provisions, and they \nare included in this legislation.\n  That program helps small businesses grow by making it easier for them \nto sell their products across this world, which, of course, helps \ncreate jobs here in the United States. The more products we sell, the \nmore jobs we create here at home. It has supported over 430 small \nbusinesses in Washington and 2,200 jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with me today in supporting \nAmerican farmers, American workers, and businesses through stronger \nenforcement of our laws and streamlined trade.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Linda T. Sanchez), another member of our \ncommittee.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nspeak about the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. I \nam extremely frustrated that, after the long path to get us to the \nconference report before us today, I won't be able to support the bill.\n  As I said during our conference committee meeting earlier this week: \nif Customs were truly all that this bill was about, it would pass \noverwhelmingly on the floor.\n  I strongly support the bulk of what is in the final bill. Trade \nenforcement should always move in lockstep with our trade policy. It is \nonly when countries live up to agreed-upon laws and regulations that we \ncan truly have robust trade, but robust trade also requires strong \nenforcement.\n  Particularly for me, I am pleased that the bulk of the ENFORCE Act is \nfinally at the finish line after many years of work. One of my biggest \npriorities for several years has been finding a way to combat the \nblatant abuse and duty evasion by some foreign producers that undercut \nAmerican industry. Foreign companies use schemes to avoid paying the \nduties they owe on goods that they bring into the United States.\n  We will finally give some real teeth to our enforcement procedures \nand send the right message to domestic manufacturers, employers, and \nworkers that this Congress cares about Customs enforcement. This idea \ndoesn't hinder free trade. Instead, it promotes fair trade and sends a \nstrong signal to foreign producers that the U.S. will not tolerate \nabuses of internationally agreed upon trade rules. By increasing our \nCustoms security measures, we ensure that American companies that play \nby the rules are not disadvantaged as a result of evasion by foreign \ncompetitors.\n  Unfortunately, unrelated TPA language included in the final bill will \nkeep me from being able to support something that I have worked on for \nmany, many years.\n  In this bill, we fail to address currency manipulation in a \nmeaningful way. The conference report also falls short in the areas of \nclimate change and human trafficking. Specifically, we should not tie \nour hands when it comes to combating climate change, nor should we be \nrushing to increase our trade with countries that persist in allowing \nhuman trafficking. To me, these are not the values of this country. \nThey are no-brainers, and they shouldn't be in this bill. But today, we \nfell short.\n  For those reasons, I cannot support the final Customs package that we \nhave before us today.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Tiberi), the former chairman of the Trade Subcommittee \nwho played a key role in bringing forth this legislation.\n  Mr. TIBERI. I thank the chairman for all his leadership on this going \nback years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I introduced the Trade Facilitation and Trade \nEnforcement Act in April of this year, and it is great to see that this \nissue is finally getting done.\n  I would really like to thank Speaker Ryan and, again, Chairman Brady; \nChairman Reichert; a special thanks to Representative Boustany for his \nleadership going way back as well; and Jason Smith, the Congressman \nfrom Missouri, for his incredible work to get this bill in a better \nplace. I would also like to thank my colleagues in the Senate who \nhelped make this a successful conference committee.\n  This bill presents a long, long overdue opportunity. I would ask my \ncolleagues to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n  In my home State of Ohio, one in five workers' jobs, Mr. Speaker, \ndepends on trade. Trade drives our economy. In fact, exports from Ohio \nlast year hit an all-time high. This bill will make it even easier for \nOhio companies to trade and will increase exports, and that means \nincreasing jobs in my State of Ohio.\n  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Act plays a pivotal role in \nhelping ensure that our trade agreements, our preference programs, and \nour U.S. trade laws are enforced and that legitimate trade is done. \nOver the years, the volume and the complexity of trade and the \nchallenges, such as combating evasion of duties and protecting U.S. \nintellectual property rights, have grown, and grow more complex.\n  Meanwhile, we are facing increased competition around the world, and \nit is critical to keep the flow of trade moving efficiently.\n  Customs issues are vital to our competitiveness, security, and \nsafety.\n  Streamlining legitimate trade and providing benefits to trusted \ntraders will increase U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace.\n  This bill would reduce barriers and burdens to our small and medium \nbusinesses that drive our economy, saving them time and money, and, \nagain, create jobs.\n\n[[Page H9289]]\n\n  Another major pillar of this bill is strengthening enforcement of our \ntrade remedy laws.\n  Enforcing U.S. intellectual property rights, anti-dumping, and \ncountervailing duty laws prevents our competitors from gaining an edge \nby cheating. When our competitors around the world don't play by the \nrules, we get hurt; our American businesses get hurt; and our American \nworkers pay.\n\n  When our American companies and American workers compete on a level \nplaying field, they win; we win.\n  This bill makes our trade remedies more effective by allowing our \nCustoms agencies to take quick action against these bad actors, giving \nour businesses a fair opportunity to compete and win.\n  This bill also contains a commitment to advancing a Miscellaneous \nTariff Bill process. I strongly support that commitment, and will \ncontinue to work to find a path forward, Mr. Speaker. MTBs provide \nimportant relief to our manufacturers who import materials that have no \ndomestic content or supply. The tariffs they pay--or the taxes, they \nare taxes--on these products make the entire manufacturing supply chain \nand the process more expensive to my constituents. The MTB process must \nbe resolved in a way that is not only consistent with our House rules, \nbut also our constitutional responsibilities.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. TIBERI. I am confident we can resolve these issues, Mr. Speaker. \nThis has been a long overdue bill that provides much modernization to \nour Customs process to make it easier for our manufacturers and our \nbusinesses and, ultimately, our workers, to export their products \naround the world. In the end, we win.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Trade \nFacilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, or the Customs bill. This \nlegislation has historically been a bipartisan bill, but the majority \nhas politicized the Customs legislation by adding several riders that \nwould be harmful to our trade policy.\n  The bill undermines our ability to address several of the most \ncritical global issues that we face: climate change, human trafficking, \nand immigration. And it includes no meaningful method for dealing with \none of the biggest causes of job loss and wage suppression in the \nUnited States: currency manipulation, which has cost our Nation over 5 \nmillion jobs.\n  Ironically, world leaders are concluding negotiations today in Paris \nat the largest climate summit in history. They are working hard to hash \nout an agreement that, as the Sierra Club has pointed out, will be \nundermined by the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. With the bill \nbefore us today, the United States will not be allowed to address \ngreenhouse gas emissions in future trade negotiations. Imagine.\n  The bill also contains no funding to support the enforcement and \nmonitoring of our trade agreements, and it lacks any automatic \nmechanism for ensuring compliance with our trade rules. This \nadministration has never self-initiated a trade complaint against any \nof our free trade partners. It takes years for the administration to \nbring a case against countries that subsidize or dump their product in \nour markets.\n  Lack of enforcement of our trade agreements has plagued our country \nfor decades. Despite environmental rules in the U.S.-Peru free trade \nagreement, the overwhelming majority of timber from Peru is illegally \nlogged. Despite the labor rules in the Colombia free trade agreement, \nover 100 Colombian trade unionists have been murdered, 19 this year \nalone.\n  This bill does not adequately address enforcement. It lacks the \nmechanisms for ensuring compliance with trade rules. As I said, no \nadministration has ever self-initiated a labor or environmental trade \ncomplaint against any of our free trade partners. Why would we think \nthat this would begin now?\n  While this bill authorizes funding for enforcement, there is no \nguarantee that this funding will ever be provided. We already lack the \ncritical funding to enforce our existing trade agreements. American \nworkers cannot afford to suffer through additional losses as their jobs \nare shipped to countries that do not play by the rules.\n  Worst of all, one day after International Human Rights Day, which was \nyesterday, this legislation contains a provision that will weaken U.S. \nefforts to curb human trafficking forced labor. The bill would allow \nfor expedited consideration of a trade agreement with nations \nclassified as the worst offenders of human trafficking.\n  We have already seen the administration's willingness to do whatever \nit takes to secure a trade deal when it upgraded the human trafficking \nranking of Malaysia to conclude the TPP negotiations. Malaysia was in \nthe same category as Iran just 5 months ago. Where are our values with \nregard to human life?\n  The biggest problem with our economy today is that too many Americans \nare in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. They are \nstruggling. One of the main reasons for this is several decades of bad \ntrade policy that has shipped millions of jobs overseas, like the \npolicies in this Customs bill and the TPP.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  People in this body like to say that all of the job losses and the \nwage depression are because of technology and globalization. It is. It \nis because of the policy choices we have made over the years. It is \ntime for us to rewrite the rules.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, millions of jobs are at stake as is the \nfate of our country's economy. Working class families in this Nation \nare struggling just to get by. Men and women are scraping together \nmeager earnings to put food on their tables, to warm their homes, and \nto take care of their kids. They can't think about sending their kids \nto college. They can't think about vacations or retirement security.\n  We need to decide if we are going to rebuild a land of access and \nopportunity, where anyone who is willing to work hard and to play by \nthe rules can find a good job that can support a family. There is no \nreason to make bad trade policy even worse. This legislation, with \nenforcement gaps and harmful negotiating objectives is unacceptable. We \ncan and should do better for working people. I urge my colleagues to \nvote ``no.''\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), who has played a key role in \nstrengthening trade enforcement in this bill.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank Chairman Brady, Chairman Tiberi, Chairman \nReichert, Congressman Jason Smith, and others on the committee, as well \nas staff, for helping make this legislation--finally, this conference \nreport--a reality that will become law.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, Louisiana's seafood industry is being severely \ninjured by illegal foreign imports. Right now, the fundamental issue is \neconomic growth. How do we empower our seafood producers, our farmers, \nand our manufacturers to grow their businesses? to create opportunity? \nto grow this economy? The legislation before us today is important \nbecause, as we seek to expand market access for all of our businesses \nand our farmers, we need seamless trade facilitation and strong \nenforcement if we are going to achieve that economic growth.\n  This bill contains language from my PROTECT Act, providing new tools \nfor the relevant Federal agencies, for legitimate importers and \ndistributors, and for trade-affected domestic industries to prevent and \ncombat fraud at our border, not after the fact. That is a key \ndistinction and a key piece of this legislation. It will allow our \nseafood producers, our farmers, and our manufacturers to compete on a \nfair playing field here in our American domestic market as we seek open \nmarket access abroad for them as well.\n  Additionally, crawfish processors in my State of Louisiana have \nsuffered for 15 years because of the unfair dumping of crawfish from \nChina and other illegal sources. In effect, the administration punished \ndomestic crawfish producers by forcing them to pay for the delays \ncaused by Chinese dumpers, by the U.S. insurance companies that posted \nbond for the duties, and, in\n\n[[Page H9290]]\n\nsome cases, by the Customs and Border Patrol, itself. This bill \ncontains an important fix that will make sure that our crawfish \nproducers are paid what they are owed.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation, this Customs reauthorization \nconference report, will make necessary improvements, not only to ensure \nfraud is prevented at our border, but so that our American industries \nare treated fairly. I urge its support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Kind), a distinguished member of our committee.\n  Mr. KIND. I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the committee and as someone who has been \ninvolved in the negotiations of the legislation before us, I rise in \nstrong support of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act.\n  The bill that we have before us today is not the bill that came out \nof the House in June. There are much-needed improvements. As we debate \ntrade policy and where we are going in the 21st century global economy, \nwe need strong enforcement mechanisms so that, when we get standards in \nthese trade agreements that elevate it as being up to us to level the \nplaying field for our workers, for our businesses, and for our farmers, \nwe have the tools to ensure that those standards are enforced on an \nappropriate basis, so we are able to counter unfair trade practices as \nthey are applied against us. That is exactly what is in this bill right \nnow. This bill will end any importation of products that are made from \nthe exploitation of child and forced labor, for instance.\n  This bill also includes the ENFORCE Act, additional tools to enforce \nthe provisions that we do negotiate in future trade agreements.\n  This bill establishes the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center for \ngreater coordination between our agencies in order to enforce \nprovisions that we negotiate in trade agreements.\n  It establishes an enforcement trust fund, which is due to the hard \nwork my friend and colleague from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) put in, so \nthat there are dedicated resources in order to enforce the provisions \nthat we fought to achieve.\n  It establishes a Super 301 section--again, enhancing the enforcement \non those standards that many of us have been fighting for: core labor, \nenvironmental, human rights protections--in the body of these trade \nagreements, which are fully enforceable like any other provision. That \nSuper 301 will give us tools that will enable us to move forward on \nthat.\n  It also establishes a State Trade and Export Promotion Program--\nreauthorizing it and funding it--to make it easier for our small \nbusinesses and our manufacturers back home to be able to export more \neasily. We know that those exporting companies typically pay their \nworkers, roughly, 18 to 19 percent above other workers within that \nsector; so it is a win for our small businesses back home.\n  It is not a perfect bill. It is the product of compromise and \nbipartisanship. I think it advances the ball when it comes to key \nenforcement. I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Roskam), who played a key role in the language \ndefending our friend and ally Israel.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. I thank Chairman Brady.\n  Mr. Speaker, a couple of years ago, Israel's Ambassador Michael Oren \nwrote an opinion piece that got my attention, and he described the \nwaves of attempts to wipe Israel off the map.\n  He said the first wave was military, and we know how that worked: \nIsrael's enemies worked together, and they were not successful in \ndefeating Israel back in 1948. The second wave was a wave of terror. \nThat is still ongoing, but that wave has not been successful. Yet there \nis a third wave, and the third wave is, actually, more insidious. The \nthird wave is a movement called the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions \nMovement. It is an attempt to take away Israel's legitimacy, to hold \nIsrael to a standard to which no other country in the world is held.\n  So let's not kid ourselves that this is an attempt to drive Israel to \nthe negotiating table--this movement, that is. It is an attempt to wipe \nIsrael off the map. It is the smart, long move for the haters of \nIsrael.\n  But, today, in this bill, the House is saying we stand with Israel. \nWe stand with Israel, and we are pushing back. We are making it the \nofficial policy of the United States, along with the Trade Promotion \nAuthority Act, which says we are going to push back against state-\nsponsored BDS activities. There is good work here.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are many times when people ask: Can't people get \nalong in Congress? The answer is, yes, we can. This is strongly \nsupported on a bipartisan basis, and it does two things in particular \nthat I want to bring your attention to:\n  Number one, it works to protect American companies from foreign \nlawsuits, which is incredibly important because of our strong \ncommercial relationship with the Israelis. Secondly, it has a reporting \nrequirement, so it makes the administration more mindful, and we are \ngoing to have more information.\n  I thank Congressman Vargas, who was a coauthor with me in some of the \nunderlying legislation that was adopted by Chairman Brady and others. I \nthank all of the conferees.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 13 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Texas has 16\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), who has played a key role in advancing \nour entire progrowth trade agenda.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. I thank the chairman for moving this bill forward and \ngetting it one step closer to law after his long-term engagement in \ntrade facilitation.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, trade facilitation and trade is key to \ngrowing our economy. This bill makes needed reforms to our Customs \nprocedures; it strengthens enforcement measures behind our trade \nagreements; and it removes unnecessary barriers to trade.\n  The bill couldn't come at a more important time. Think about it. We \nare in the midst of the opportunity to complete two of the most \nambitious trade agreements in our Nation's history: one with countries \nin the Pacific Rim and the other with our allies in the European Union. \nThe United States used to be at the top. We were at the top for our \nefficiency and trade and logistics and moving goods across the border, \nbut our Customs procedures have become outdated, and we have slipped. \nNow we have too much paperwork and too much inefficiency. This \nbipartisan bill streamlines and modernizes our Customs system to get us \nback on track.\n  Why is trade important? Of course, the answer is very simple: It is \nabout jobs.\n  Trade supports one in five American jobs. In my State of Minnesota, \nmore than 774,000 jobs are connected to trade; so trade is driving our \neconomy. Many of these jobs are held by people who do work at small- \nand medium-sized businesses, which are the backbone of our economy. In \nfact, 98 percent of all American exporters are small- or medium-sized \nemployers. These are jobs that pay more. They pay higher than average \nwages, and they pay better salaries for American workers.\n  In addition to supporting American jobs, the Customs bill also \nincludes stronger enforcement tools that are essential to the trade \nagreements that we have with other countries so that they don't cheat. \nIt provides fair and strong rules to hold other countries accountable \nfor their unfair trade practices, and it will help tear down barriers \nthat unfairly block our goods from foreign markets.\n  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I am excited to see the Customs bill \nmove forward on a bipartisan basis. It will improve trade facilitation \nso as to move goods and services more efficiently.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Smith), a key member of the Ways and Means Committee \nwho is focused on American agriculture and American outerwear.\n\n[[Page H9291]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of the \nTrade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015.\n  This legislation will update and streamline our country's Customs and \nBorder policies to facilitate trade and enhance U.S. competitiveness. \nIncluded in the bill are a number of additional, commonsense \nprovisions.\n  For example, the bill fixes a technical error which inadvertently \nincreased the tariff rates on outerwear. Not only is this fix important \nto producers, retailers, and consumers, but it also brings the U.S. \nback into compliance with our commitments under the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade.\n  While I am disappointed we couldn't find a path forward on the \nMiscellaneous Tariff Bill process, I am pleased the bill contains \nlanguage in support of continued work on this issue.\n  The conference report also takes important steps to strengthen Trade \nPromotion Authority. TPA is necessary to ensure that the U.S. gets the \nbest possible deal in trade negotiations as we move forward, and these \nagreements should leverage our country's comparative advantages in all \nindustries, certainly including energy.\n  For this reason, I was happy to see the inclusion of language to \nprevent the administration from using trade agreements to negotiate \nvery costly greenhouse gas emission rules in the United States. I also \nwant to make sure Nebraska producers can make the most of the \nopportunities provided by a level playing field in order to increase \nexports.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Doggett), another distinguished member of our committee.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this Customs bill fails totally to address \na custom that is the custom of the USTR: saying one thing and doing \nanother.\n  Were it possible to legislate trust, to legislate candor, to \nlegislate fidelity to public duty, I would be the most enthusiastic \nsupporter this bill could have. Unfortunately, this proposal represents \nonly a very thin, see-through window dressing for a runaway bureaucracy \nthat is pursuing its own multinational corporate agenda and ignoring \nthe public interest.\n  The USTR, in its history, has never successfully challenged an \nenvironmental abuse. Though the USTR has been charged since February \n2009 with preventing trade in illegal logging and in the destruction of \nPeruvian rain forests, the Environmental Investigation Agency recently \nreported: ``Illegal logging in Peru and the associated trade remains a \nserious and unabated problem.'' There has been a ``complete failure to \nenforce these obligations . . .'' One such obligation is a very simple \naudit to demonstrate whether logs are being harvested legally or \nillegally. I have specifically asked the USTR repeatedly to just \nproduce the audit so we can see, and they have refused to provide that \ndocumentation or to admit that their enforcement has totally failed to \ndo that simple matter. Meanwhile, coffins with the names of brave \nPeruvian inspectors are being dragged through the streets.\n  The USTR trumpets its environmental successes; yet the Peruvian \nGovernment is being rewarded for going backward, not forward, on the \nenvironment.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  USTR has never successfully challenged worker abuses. Almost 8 years \nafter the Administration received a complaint about serious abuses in \nGuatemala, such as the right to work and join with other workers \nwithout being murdered, USTR has not remedied the complaint.\n  In Honduras, USTR announced with great fanfare just by coincidence \nyesterday that, after 3 long years of delay on child labor and other \nabuses, it had a new plan. Well, it is the same type of plan that \nfailed in Guatemala. We don't need new public relation plans. We need \nto enforce the law effectively.\n  What reason is there conceivably to believe that Vietnam, a country \nwith one union that is only a branch of the Communist Party, will \nsomehow fulfill its trade obligations under the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership for a complete overhaul of its system when it takes the \nAdministration almost 8 years to address Guatemala labor concerns? More \nlikely, we will simply be joining another race to the bottom with a 60-\ncent-per-hour Vietnamese wage.\n  Just as it lacked the will to enforce environmental and working \nconditions, USTR prioritized trade even when that meant excusing \nmodern-day slave trade in corrupt Malaysia. The bureaucratic \nmanipulation and indifference to human trafficking in Asia is \ndisgraceful.\n  The only thing that is transparent about USTR is the ease of seeing \nthrough its propaganda. Certainly, I am very concerned about climate \nchange, but the real climate that needs changing when it comes to our \ntrade policy is the climate of indifference and secrecy at USTR.\n  I ask that you vote against this bill in order to develop a true pro-\ntrade, 21st-century American policy that reflects our basic American \nvalues and protects our jobs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the chairman does not mind, I would like to yield to \nthe distinguished leader. Is that okay, Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield 1 minute to \nthe gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our distinguished leader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for \nhis leadership on behalf of America's working families. I thank the \nchairman of the committee for his courtesy in enabling me to speak at \nthis time.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress has a responsibility to stand with American \nmanufacturing and to help create good-paying jobs for the hardworking \nfamilies who are the backbone of our country. The middle class is the \nbackbone of our democracy. In order to have fair trade, we must have \nrobust tools to enforce the obligations of our trading partners.\n  This legislation began as a strong, bipartisan trade enforcement \nbill. It has degenerated into a vehicle for all of the toxic, special \ninterest promises that have been made to secure passage of the TPA. \nThey have poisoned a strong trade enforcement bill with their denial of \nthe climate crisis, with their turning a blind eye on human \ntrafficking, and with their refusal to address the foreign currency \nmanipulation that destroys millions of American jobs.\n  In terms of the climate crisis, congressional Republicans refuse to \nacknowledge the truth of the climate crisis. Pope Francis, on his visit \nhere and even before he came and since, has made this climate crisis a \npriority. It was the subject of his encyclical. He has said that he is \npraying for the success of the historic Paris Climate Summit.\n  Faith leaders from the evangelical community and across the board are \nurging us to answer our moral responsibility to preserve God's \ncreation. It is our responsibility. As God's creation, we have a \nresponsibility to be good stewards of it and to do so in a way that \ndoes not hurt the poor and their presentations.\n  Just look at what is happening in Paris as opposed to what is \nhappening here. In Paris, 195 nations have convened to address the \nclimate crisis that threatens the health of our communities and the \nfuture that we leave our children. It is about air pollution. 186 \nnations have submitted plans to address the climate crisis and the air \npollution. 146 world leaders personally attended the conference.\n  Yet, with this Customs bill, Republicans would bar our trade \nnegotiators from even discussing climate in the context of a trade \nagreement. You cannot separate climate and commerce. We cannot accept \nRepublicans' willful blindness to this connection and to the reality of \nthe climate crisis.\n  Our trade negotiations must honor our values as a Nation. America \nmust stand as a bulwark against the atrocity of human trafficking \nwherever it is found.\n  In the week that we mark the 150th anniversary of the 13th Amendment \nabolishing slavery in the United States or anyplace subject to our \njurisdiction, this legislation allows countries with documented forced \nlabor practices and brutal human trafficking to enjoy the benefits of \nfree trade and full access to our markets.\n  In the Trade Promotion Authority legislation, we prohibited fast-\ntrack\n\n[[Page H9292]]\n\nprocedures for trade agreements with countries ranked tier 3 in the \nState Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, which are nations \nwith the worst human rights records. That is in the TPA. Yet, in this \nbill, we weaken that standard, say, for example, for Malaysia and for \nother nations failing to address human trafficking.\n  In terms of currency, Republicans continue to allow foreign currency \nmanipulation to devastate the competitiveness of goods made in America, \nstealing jobs from American workers. The American Policy Institute \nestimates that foreign currency manipulation has already cost millions \nof American jobs and threatens hundreds of thousands more in the coming \nyears.\n  We need strong, enforceable currency standards in our Customs laws. \nYet, Republicans have stripped out this tough, bipartisan provision, \ncracking down on currency manipulation in the Senate bill. It is time \nto crack down on countries who have manipulated their currencies for \nyears to protect their industries and undercut American jobs. In any \ntrade legislation, our top responsibility must be to strengthen the \npaychecks of America's workers.\n  Since I have lost my voice, let us reject this deeply flawed bill.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Smith), a member of the Ways and Means Committee who \nis fighting for American agriculture, furniture, and other local \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the \nconference report.\n  Right now there are over 120 antidumping and countervailing duty \ncases against China. When China violates the rules of international \ntrade, small- and medium-sized manufacturers in Missouri and across \nAmerica are harmed. The ENFORCE Act included in this report would \nstrengthen America's ability to identify and go after those who break \ninternational law.\n  One company in Missouri found itself unfairly competing against an \nillegal product originating from China, but using a fake address. The \nENFORCE Act allows this company to now take real and meaningful action \nagainst foreign perpetrators.\n  This spring, as the Ways and Means Committee worked on TPA, there \nwere many constructive conversations about what our trade enforcement \nbill was going to look like. I am grateful to Speaker Ryan, Chairman \nBrady, Mr. Tiberi, and Mr. Boustany for their willingness to work with \nme to get the ENFORCE Act included in this bill. It was a team effort, \nand the bill we have before us reflects that.\n  American workers and American products can compete with anybody in \nthe world. When countries cheat, our manufacturers are significantly \nharmed. This bill helps end those unfair practices.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, could the Chair tell us the time remaining on \nboth sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 8 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 11\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, by the way, I thank Chairman Brady for \nallowing the leader to go out of turn.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for \nhis and other members of the Ways and Means Committee's outstanding \nwork on this legislation. I am here to talk about another aspect of it.\n  Time is short. A temporary ban on State taxation of Internet access \nis expiring. Section 922 of the conference report aids taxpayers by \nmaking this ban permanent.\n  If the ban on Internet access taxes is not renewed, the potential tax \nburden on Americans would be substantial. It is estimated that Internet \naccess tax rates could be more than twice the average rate of all other \ngoods and services. Low-income households could pay 10 times as much as \nhigh-income households as a share of income.\n\n  Congress has passed numerous temporary bans with enormous bipartisan \nsupport. Earlier this year a permanent ban passed the House by voice \nvote.\n  Section 922 merely prevents Internet access taxes and unfair multiple \nor discriminatory taxes on e-commerce. It does not tackle the issue of \nInternet sales taxes. My committee is working assiduously on that issue \nand making progress.\n  Studies show that taxes affect Internet adoption rates. As price \nrises, demand falls. The Internet has become an indispensable gateway \nto scientific, educational, and economic opportunities. Section 922 \npreserves unfettered access to one of the most unique gateways to \nknowledge and engines of self-improvement in all of human history.\n  I thank the conferees for including this protaxpayer collision. I \nurge my colleagues' support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a distinguished member of our committee.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill today, \nwhich is in a much better form than the bill I opposed this summer. \nYes, there are still terrible, extraneous provisions.\n  Climate is the worst example, but that is actually going to be more \nof an embarrassment to my Republican friends in the future, that they \ntrotted this out at a time that the rest of the world is working in \nParis to try and deal with it. As a practical matter, it is not going \nto make that much difference.\n  I disagree with my learned friend, the ranking member. There will not \nbe a reason that we can't harmonize, for example, fuel standards. There \nare lots of reasons to do that. The Trans-Pacific Partnership's \ndeforestation provisions will probably have as much impact on fighting \nclimate change as anything that is going on in Paris.\n  Peru is still troubling. I fought hard for those provisions. As \nrecently as this week, I have been pushing on the administration to do \nmore. It is certainly better than if we hadn't enacted those provisions \nbefore. As a matter of fact, that is why we have worked so hard to \nestablish the trust fund.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of my friend, the chairman, who has \nworked hard to make sure there is guaranteed funding for the next 10 \nyears, $30 million a year, when the whole USTR budget is less than $60 \nmillion.\n  These trade enforcement provisions are complex, they are expensive, \nthey are tedious, and they are hard. It takes money to do it. This \nprovision includes--the legislation that I worked on with Senator \nCantwell--being able to make sure we can do a better job of enforcing \nit.\n  The bill is not perfect, but it is much better than what we had this \nsummer. It represents movement in directions that we can all take pride \nin. There are a number of provisions that make a huge difference for \nthe people I represent in the Pacific Northwest as well as modernizing \nthe Customs provisions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully suggest that this is a step forward. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to make sure that it is, in \nfact, enforced in the future so that we can get the benefits people are \ntalking about.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  I do want to thank the gentleman from Oregon for his very thoughtful, \nconstructive efforts to help us craft the right trade enforcement \nremedies. Going forward, I look forward to working with you on other \ntrade remedy issues.\n  I appreciate the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller) whose hard \nwork, along with that of the Michigan delegation, enhanced our hand on \ncurrency manipulation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan \n(Mrs. Miller).\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I come from southeast Michigan, \nwhich is home of America's domestic auto industry where we build \nabsolutely the finest quality cars and trucks on Earth. We know our \nproducts can compete against anyone anywhere in the world. All we ask \nfor is a level playing field.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Unfortunately, American car companies have suffered decades of \neconomic devastation due to unfair currency manipulation practices from \noverseas competitors, like Japan, China, and South Korea.\n  That is why I support this bill, Mr. Speaker. After decades of doing \nnothing--decades of doing nothing--this bill\n\n[[Page H9293]]\n\ncontains very strong measures to protect American products from nations \nthat manipulate their currency.\n  Now, there will be a three-part test that will identify countries \nthat manipulate their currency and, once identified, they must be \nreported to Congress, and action must be taken.\n  I certainly appreciate the help of the House leadership as well as \nthe Committee on Ways and Means, because these provisions will level \nthe playing field, Mr. Speaker.\n  All of us want free trade, but it must be fair trade.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Dingell).\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise with nothing but the utmost respect \nfor my colleague from Michigan and agree with her on the need to \naddress currency manipulation.\n  Mr. Speaker, when the Committee on Ways and Means first began \nconsidering this bill, it represented a real opportunity to improve our \nsystem of trade and eliminate loopholes that allow foreign nations and \nbad actors to avoid our trade laws. Currency manipulation is the number \none trade abuse that must be addressed.\n  Unfortunately, this bill has become the Christmas tree of the holiday \nseason, and it is being used to put lipstick on the pig that is our \ncurrent trade negotiations. It ties our negotiators' hands on even \nnegotiating common emissions standards by restricting any consideration \nof climate issues, and it prevents them from negotiating immigration-\nrelated language as well. Further, it weakens existing trade laws \ndesigned to prevent human trafficking.\n  The ribbon on this Christmas surprise is a totally new provision on \nInternet taxation that isn't even in the jurisdiction of the Committee \non Ways and Means and could have unintended consequences that could \nbankrupt local governments.\n  There are good provisions at the core of this bill to help improve \nour Customs system, but they are outweighed by the political \ngamesmanship that has made this legislation impossible to support. We \nhave seen far too many other examples of last-minute political \nprovisions inserted in bills over the years, and we risk unintended \nconsequences of these political provisions as well.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Iowa (Mr. King), who worked hard to ensure that trade agreements \nare for expanding trade, not expanding immigration.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Committee \non Ways and Means--and I am delighted he is the chairman of the \nCommittee on Ways and Means--for yielding.\n  I rise in support of the conference report of the Customs bill. It \nhas got many provisions within it which I am happy about and happy to \nsupport. The currency manipulation provision is one of them.\n  I am pleased to be here to be able to say that there were those that \nhad significant heartburn over trade promotion authority. I am one of \nthem. There were two provisions that I so badly wanted to be included \nwithin the TPA legislation, because I have a bit of a history of \nworking to keep the immigration components out of trade deals. Congress \nneeds to be passing immigration law, not trade negotiators.\n  Well, that language is an amendment that is in here in the conference \nreport, along with language that prohibits the negotiations under trade \npromotion authority on climate change. So we are protected from \nexecutive decisions imposed upon this Congress and a usurpation of \narticle I authority by two pieces of language in here: No negotiations \nunder TPA can include climate change under this language; and no \nnegotiations under TPA can include immigration.\n  Congress can speak to that, but they cannot negotiate that under TPA. \nThat is very important to me. It is important to a lot of people across \nthis country. I am standing here saying thank you to now-Speaker Ryan, \nwho negotiated this with me and others. He regrets that he wasn't able \nto shake my hand as chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. That \nis fine with me, Mr. Speaker.\n  I am happy to shake the hand of Kevin Brady as chairman of the \nCommittee on Ways and Means, and say to a number of people who had \nsignificant apprehension about whether this would come together on all \nof the language necessary to get support for trade promotion authority, \nto say to them upon the passage of this conference report here today \nand the anticipated signature, merry Christmas to all of you who wanted \nto step down the line to preserve article I authority for the United \nStates Congress.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Poe), my friend and colleague and neighbor.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support free and fair trade. Where I \ncome from in Houston, Texas, we are an export city. We make a lot of \nthings, and we sell them all over the world, so I support trade.\n  Let's go back to the year 1898, Mr. Speaker. The Spanish-American War \nexisted then. To help finance the war, Congress taxed a newfangled \ncontraption called the telephone. The war was over. Teddy Roosevelt and \nthe Rough Riders had stormed San Juan Hill before the tax was actually \ncompletely collected, but World War I came around, and the tax \nreemerged.\n  Mr. Speaker, that war tax over 100 years ago is still on your \ntelephone bill. You pick up your phone bill, and if you have a \nlandline, you are still paying that war tax.\n  The point being, Mr. Speaker, once Congress imposes a tax, it seems \nlike it never goes away. But, shock, in this legislation, it prohibits \na tax that is already being collected in some States. Some States tax \nInternet access.\n  This bill does away with that tax. But it fairly allows States like \nTexas to phase it out until 2020. Good compromise. So let's eliminate a \ntax on Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, don't get too excited. We may be eliminating one tax, \nbut that war tax over 100 years ago that was implemented-still exists. \nMaybe we will get around to eliminating that eventually.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, free trade is enforceable trade.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), who \nhas fought for enforceable trade laws.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the \nconference report before us. Manufacturing is critical to the Hoosier \neconomy and my district. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found \nthat manufacturing jobs account for almost 17 percent of all jobs in \nIndiana. That is the highest rate in the Nation. Manufacturing jobs \naccount for 23.1 percent of the jobs in my district, second highest in \nthe Nation.\n  This legislation will make our manufacturers so much more competitive \nby eliminating the red tape and removing supply chain bottlenecks. It \nprovides new tools to tackle evasion of U.S. trade remedies and \nintellectual property theft.\n  To be sure, I would like to have seen a new miscellaneous tariff bill \nprocess, and I thank the new chairman for his commitment to finding a \npath forward on that. But, Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation that will help manufacturers in \nmy district and across the country.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan for his \ngraciousness. I rise in support of the Trade Facilitation and Trade \nEnforcement Act of 2015. It is a significant improvement over the \noriginal Customs bill, which I opposed.\n  There are human trafficking reporting requirements that have been \nadded. There is currency language that expands U.S. action on currency \nmanipulation. It codifies the ENFORCE Act, some of the most strict \nenforcement provisions ever on trade by U.S. legislation. It creates an \ninteragency trade enforcement center. It creates a trade enforcement \ntrust fund. It provides protections for small businesses and bans child \nand forced labor.\n  I would prefer to see stronger proenvironmental provisions, but this \nenforcement bill, trade enforcement\n\n[[Page H9294]]\n\nbill is a significant move forward. I am pleased to support the \nunderlying legislation and the conference report. I thank all who \ncontributed to it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 4 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas also has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself the remaining time.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me first address climate change. It is interesting \nthat some of the people who speak in favor say how regrettable it is \nthat this provision is even here. The gentleman from Iowa made clear \nwhy this provision is here. It was an effort to get votes for TPA.\n  My feeling is, no matter how people voted on TPA, they should oppose \nthis conference report. One of the reasons relates to global warming. \nIt is really disgraceful this provision is here at the same time \nvirtually everybody in the world is trying to address climate change.\n  I just want to read the exact language. It says: to ensure that trade \nagreements do not establish obligations for the U.S. regarding \ngreenhouse gas emission measures.\n  That is the exact language. There is no way to fuzz it over. There is \nno way to fuzz it over.\n  Let me just, then, say a word about currency. This conference report \ndeletes a meaningful, very, very concrete way to address currency \nmanipulation. The language here in this conference bill just \nessentially, in the end, says nothing that is meaningful.\n  It says: If the President determines there is a problem with a \ncountry's currency--it won't even mention the words ``currency \nmanipulation''--then the President shall do such-and-such--things he \ncan already do--and there is a waiver for the President if he doesn't \nwant to take any of the steps.\n  The currency provision essentially takes away what was in the Senate \nbill, and we passed the same or a similar measure a number of years \nago. So that is as to currency. This is very much in the wrong \ndirection.\n  The same is true in terms of human trafficking. Essentially what it \nsays is: If a country is in tier 3--the worst in terms of human \ntrafficking--and takes some concrete steps, they can still receive all \nthe benefits of a trade negotiation, even if they still have the most \negregious conditions in their country on human trafficking, both sex \nand labor human trafficking. That is really also, I think, worse than \nunwarranted.\n  Let me just finish by saying a few words about enforcement. I guess \nno one has worked, if I might say, more than I have in terms of \nenforceability. The provisions that we have put in place--for example, \nthose regarding worker rights, environment, and medicines--need to be \nenforced. The problem with this legislation is, in most of the cases, \nit really doesn't change anything much, if at all.\n  As I said earlier, it establishes an enforcement center that is \nalready existing. It renews Super 301. There is no need to do that. The \nadministration has the ability to do that already. It does set up an \nenforcement trust fund, but there is no appropriation of the money. \nEnforcement is already underappropriated. So now we are setting up a \nnew trust fund without any indication that it is going to be \nappropriated.\n  This bill is very close in spirit and in language to the bill that \nalmost all of us on the Democratic side voted against. I urge strong \nopposition to this conference report.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Expanding trade and giving our American workers and companies more \nopportunities around the world creates jobs here in America: better \npaychecks, better opportunities, and a stronger economy for our \ncountry. Critical to that is to make sure our trade agreements and \ntrade rules are enforced. That is what this bill is all about.\n  This bill establishes the strongest enforcement and revenue laws ever \nput on the books in the United States of America. It incorporates \nissues against currency manipulation; protections and remedies on a \nnumber of other areas within our economy that never before have been \nplaced into effect; and it creates a working trust fund, a source of \nexisting revenue, to focus on enforcing those rules.\n  It also streamlines the way we do trade in America. That is important \nas well, because it is important for consumers to lower prices. It is \nimportant for our local businesses as they manufacture products to sell \nand compete both here in America and around the world. In fact, it has \nbeen more than a decade since we have reauthorized Customs and those \nprocesses.\n  This is about modernizing it, making it more efficient, more \neffective, more accountable, all of which helps grow our economy and \nhelps working class families.\n  As important from our side of the aisle, this fulfills the commitment \nof then-chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Paul Ryan, and our \nleadership to the Members in the House to make this an even better law. \nAnd we have succeeded, working with Representatives King and Sessions \non immigration language, to make sure this is a trade-only agreement; \nworking with members of the Steel Caucus--Representatives Barletta, \nMurphy, Davis, Bost, and many others--to ensure that we have strong \nremedies in those areas; working with Representative Miller and the \nMichigan delegation against currency manipulation; working successfully \nwith Representative Zinke of Montana to make sure there is strong \noversight of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and we have \nmore access to negotiating rounds; working with Chairman Royce of \nCalifornia on human trafficking; working with Chairman Chabot of Ohio \non small business provisions; working with Mr. Crenshaw of Florida to \nensure that there are trade preferences for Nepal as they struggle in \nthis bill; and working with Mr. Walden, Mr. Reichert, Mr. Reed, and Mr. \nBoustany on key provisions.\n  I say all that to make the case this is a bipartisan measure. It is \nthoughtful, it is effective, it is long overdue, and it is important to \nexpanding trade and making that effective here in America. I urge its \nsupport.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, today, we are making critical changes to \nour domestic trade laws to ensure that U.S. companies compete on a \nlevel playing field. Manufacturers in my district have suffered a \ncompetitive disadvantage from trade cheaters in China and other foreign \ncountries that don't follow the trade rules we already have on the \nbooks.\n  Unfortunately, there are companies in China who cheat. American \ncompanies cannot compete with products that are subsidized by foreign \ngovernments and therefore priced below market value. American companies \nwaste valuable time and legal fees bringing cases against unfairly \nsubsidized products that are dumped into the United States. When \nAmerican companies win these dumping cases, they deserve to have the \npenalties enforced.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, American companies have not been \ncompeting on a level playing field. Those same trade cheaters that \ndumped their goods into our U.S. markets are adding insult to injury by \nevading the duty or penalty. When they ship the product from a country \nthat doesn't have a penalty for dumping, they are skipping out on \npaying the penalty for cheating in the first place.\n  We need a better referee to level the playing field. We need the \npenalties to be enforced. That's why I negotiated for the inclusion of \nthe ENFORCE Act in the final Customs Bill and defended their importance \nthroughout this Conference process.\n  This bill will ensure that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) must \ninvestigate cases of duty evasion within 300 days. If for some reason \nCBP begins rubberstamping these decisions, the company can go to a U.S. \ncourt to have the case reviewed. These are critical reforms that are \nnecessary to ensure that American companies are on a level playing \nfield. I thank my colleagues and friends Mr. McHenry, Mr. Tiberi, \nChairman Brady, Speaker Ryan, Dr. Boustany, Mr. Smith, and the Steel \nCaucus for working with me on this important reform.\n  Every foreign company wants to sell their goods on American store \nshelves to American consumers. We must make sure we have the tools we \nneed at the border to prevent foreign trade cheaters from sneaking \ntheir goods onto our shelves without paying the appropriate duties. We \nmust protect American manufacturers and American jobs from trade \ncheaters.\n  Additionally, I urge support for this bill because of critical \nprotections against misguided attempts to use trade agreements to \nrewrite\n\n[[Page H9295]]\n\nour domestic immigration laws and environmental regulations. While this \nbill is not perfect, the permanent improvements to our trade laws and \nthe bans on misuse of trade agreements make it worthy of our support.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 560, the previous question is ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the conference \nreport?\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Yes, Mr. Speaker. Given all the injustices promoted by \nthis conference report, I am strongly opposed to it.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Doggett moves to recommit the conference report on the \n     bill H.R. 644 to the committee on conference with \n     instructions to the managers on the part of the House to--\n       (1) disagree to subsections (b) and (e) of section 914 of \n     the conference substitute recommended by the committee of \n     conference; and\n       (2) insist on sections 701 through 706 of the Senate \n     amendment to the bill as passed the House.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The motion is not debatable.\n  Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to \nrecommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Clerk will designate the Senate \namendments.\n  Senate amendments:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     That the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 114-\n     53) is amended by striking the date specified in section \n     106(3) and inserting ``December 16, 2015''.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Further Continuing \n     Appropriations Act, 2016''.\n         Amend the title so as to read: ``Further Continuing \n     Appropriations Act, 2016''.\n\n\n                Motion Offered by Mr. Rogers of Kentucky\n\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion.\n  The text of the motion is as follows:\n\n       Mr. Rogers of Kentucky moves that the House concur in the \n     Senate amendments to H.R. 2250.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 560, the motion \nshall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the \nchair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) and the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on the further consideration of \nH.R. 2250.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H.R. 2250, a short-term \ncontinuing resolution that will fund the government through December \n16.\n  As you know, our current funding mechanism expires today, at \nmidnight. At this point, it is, unfortunately, necessary for us to have \na little more time to complete our negotiations.\n  This continuing resolution extends current levels of funding for \ncritical government programs for 5 additional days, ensuring our \ngovernment stays open until midnight next Wednesday. The Senate passed \nthis same bill yesterday. So, with approval in the House, this bill \nwill go to the President today.\n  I believe we are making good progress, Mr. Speaker, on a final, full-\nyear appropriations package. While I had hoped that we would be done by \nthis point, there are still many moving pieces. It is my hope and \nexpectation that the final omnibus legislation will be completed by \nthis new deadline.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am not the biggest fan of continuing resolutions. They \ntend to be wasteful and inefficient. However, at this point, I see this \nprocedure today as the best way forward. This continuing resolution is \nvery short and limited in scope, simply buying us enough time to wrap \nup our negotiations and bring a full-year bill to the floor without a \nlapse in important government services. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  Before closing, Mr. Speaker, I have a sad announcement to make. On \nWednesday morning, the committee lost one of its longstanding staff, \nwho has been associated with the legislative branch for 25 years: Chuck \nTurner. We mourn his loss. As soon as we have further details on \nservices, we will provide that information to the House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in half-hearted support of the continuing \nresolution before us. While it saves hardworking Americans and our \neconomy from a disastrous government shutdown, it reflects a failure of \nCongress to carry out one of our most basic constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  It has been 2\\1/2\\ months since the beginning of fiscal year 2016 and \n6 weeks since we passed a bipartisan, 2-year budget agreement to set \nthe guidelines for appropriations. There is no good reason we should \nnot have passed spending bills by now to keep the government operating \nfor the 2016 fiscal year.\n  The bill before us today should be bipartisan legislation that makes \ncrucial investments in biomedical research, job training, and national \nsecurity. The bill before us today should provide relief from harmful \nsequester caps that are hurting economic growth and families' \npocketbooks. Instead, Republicans' insistence on including dangerous, \nharmful policies in the spending bills has halted progress.\n  Since the budget agreement, terrorist attacks in Paris and San \nBernardino have brought to bear the need for improved security and \nclosure in lax gun safety laws. Yet the majority wants to continue to \ndeny even basic research on causes of gun violence at the Centers for \nDisease Control, not to mention we should be acting immediately to stop \nthe legal purchase of guns by those on terrorist watch lists, an \namendment I have introduced four times in 5 years that has been \ndefeated every time in committee.\n  The process has stalled because Republicans insist on demonizing \nlegal, women's reproductive health decisions, even putting women's jobs \nat risk if their employers do not agree with their health choices.\n  And finally, 2015 is on track to be the hottest year on record, with \ndroughts leading to hunger and wildfires, and rising sea levels \nthreatening to wipe away island nations. Yet Republicans demand \nmeasures that harm the environment, put the health and safety of \nAmericans, their children, and the entire planet at risk.\n  I hope my colleagues will work together in the coming 5 days to agree \non appropriations bills that invest in biomedical research, education, \ninfrastructure, job training, and a strong national defense. Together, \nwe can provide opportunities for hardworking families and build a 21st \ncentury workforce and a secure America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H9296]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy) for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the \nschedule for the week to come.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, before we get started, I would like to discuss a matter \nof deep importance to the gentleman and myself, of a dear friend, John \nStipicevic. He is a trusted aide for many years on this floor, and he \nwill be departing us. He wants to spend more time with his wife, \nKristin, and their new baby, Lucy Grace. I would like to thank him for \nhis service to this country and his service to this conference. I know \nhe is a good friend, also, to the gentleman across the aisle.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, as we all know, the public's perception--\nbecause that is what is covered most--is the confrontation that occurs \nbetween the parties, the differences that we have. But one thing that \nis a reality that the public ought to feel good about is they have \nextraordinarily good staffers, staffers who are committed to their \ncountry, to the House, and to the American people, who do wonderful \nwork.\n  Stip is a wonderful, wonderful positive participant, who made this \nHouse a better place in which to work, who made the substance of what \nwe did more understandable for Members. He facilitated cooperation. He \ndid not create confrontation. And we will miss it.\n  We wish him the best, of course, as he leaves the House of \nRepresentatives, like so many of our staffers do, who go on to do \nbetter than most of us are doing, at least from a certain perspective. \nI want to wish him the very, very best. I want to thank him on behalf \nof not only myself, because he is a good friend, but also on behalf of \nmy staff with whom he has worked very closely over the years. I know \nall of them appreciated the relationship they had, and have, with him. \nSo I want to congratulate him and wish him good luck and great success.\n  I yield, again, to my friend, the majority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his kind \nwords about Stip.\n  Let me get to the schedule.\n  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, no votes are expected in the House on \nMonday.\n  On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. \nfor legislative business. Members are advised that first votes of the \nweek are expected at 6:30 p.m.\n  On Wednesday, Thursday, and the remainder of the week, the House will \nmeet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House may also consider a bill to extend certain \nprovisions of the Tax Code.\n  Additionally, I expect the House to consider an omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. HOYER. Just to repeat--of course, the majority leader announced \nit yesterday, and again today--we will not be having votes on Monday.\n  Has the gentleman decided whether there will be a pro forma session \nyet on Monday?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  We are still looking at that, and I will let the gentleman know as \nsoon as possible.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the leader for that information.\n  In any event, Mr. Speaker, the Members, as the majority leader has \nindicated, will not be having votes until, at the earliest, 6:30 on \nTuesday.\n  I believe that the balance of the week--or such time as may be \nnecessary in order to complete the work of this session of the \nCongress--will dictate the length of time that we go on the schedule. \nIs that accurate?\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Yes. It is my intention that we will stay until we get \nour work done, but when we get our work done, we will depart for the \nholiday season.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  To further clarify, I know there has been some talk about a CR that \nmay be sufficient to get us into next year. As I understand what the \nmajority leader is saying, it is our intention not to do that, but to, \nin fact, complete the appropriations process and the funding of \ngovernment for the balance of the year until September 30 of next year. \nIs that accurate, sir?\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding again.\n  Yes. As the gentleman knows, we just passed a CR moving into next \nWednesday. It is our intention to have our work done and to not need to \npass any further CRs.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that information.\n  I would say to him that--and I think he knows and I know--although I \ndon't think either of us is directly involved in the hour-to-hour \nnegotiations that are going on--but, nevertheless, negotiations still \ngo on, Mr. Speaker--I am hopeful that, on both sides, we can see that \nwhich is unacceptable to the other side and put that aside for a later \nday.\n  The appropriations process, of course, is about funding government. \nThe appropriations process is about keeping government open. The \nappropriations process is about how do we best serve the American \npeople.\n  I am hopeful that that will not get mired down or prevent our success \nin coming to an agreement on the omnibus because of issues on which, \nclearly, there are significant policy differences and which can be \nargued on another day and in another bill, but will not undermine the \ncompletion of the appropriations process.\n  I presume the majority leader hopes that as well. Hopefully, over the \nnext few hours and, really, over the next couple of days, we will work \non that because, if we don't, we are going to be here on the 17th, the \n18th, the 19th, or the 20th, according to what the majority leader \nsaid, in order to get our work done.\n  Is that accurate, Mr. Leader?\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding again.\n  It is our intention to get an omnibus done in a bipartisan manner. \nThose are the negotiations that are going on now. I'm hopeful that we \ncan get that done and finished by next week.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that comment.\n  The only thing I would add, Mr. Speaker, is there is also a tax \nextender bill that is being discussed. The tax extenders are some of \nthe items that Members on both sides of the aisle believe are \nappropriate and necessary to help grow our economy and create jobs, \nwhich has support on both sides of the aisle.\n  But it is clear that the extender bill, as I understand it, is a bill \nthat can be very, very large--as large as $800 billion in unpaid tax \ncuts--which, from our perspective on our side in the House of \nRepresentatives, will substantially exacerbate our deficit, and that \nwill undermine the viability of getting tax reform done in the next \nsession or in the years to come.\n  We think, therefore, that it would be far preferable to have pending \ngetting tax reform done--hopefully, next year if we can do so in a \nbipartisan fashion--and to have a shorter term. The Senate passed a 2-\nyear bill, which is really a 1-year lookback to 2015 and a year forward \nto 2016. We need to certainly do that. I think we could get a \nbipartisan vote for that. I don't know where the negotiations are on \nthat bill.\n\n[[Page H9299]]\n\n  I would like to inform the majority leader, as he probably knows \nprivately, that we have great concerns on this side of the aisle about \na bill of the magnitude that is being discussed and the impact it will \nhave on our deficit, on discretionary spending, and on our opportunity \nto pass major needed--and a bipartisan expectation of doing--tax reform \nso our tax system is simpler, fairer, is producing the revenue that we \nneed, but it is also making sure the American people understand and can \nbe provided a much simpler system for them to have to respond to.\n  If the majority leader wants to make any remarks on that, I yield to \nthe gentleman. Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9299-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11, 2015, TO TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15, \n                                  2015\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

But instead of trying to fix his failed policies, which \ncontributed to the very rise of ISIS in the first place, the President \nis instead attempting to divert and distract the American people by \nleveraging this tragedy to announce his plans to issue an executive \norder on gun control.\n  Just yesterday the White House called the San Bernardino attack an \nincident of gun violence. Mr. Speaker, it was terrorism, and I refuse \nto let this President use acts of terrorism as a means to try another \nend run around this Congress.\n  Earlier this year I stood up against the administration's attempted \nammunition ban and I was successful in getting that unconstitutional \npolicy rescinded.\n  So today I am again standing up against this latest attack on our \nconstitutional gun rights in this country because, if this \nadministration refuses to take terrorism seriously, then the American \npeople will need their Second Amendment rights more than ever before.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9299-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CLIMATE DAMAGE WIPES OUT LIVELIHOODS\n\n  (Ms. SPEIER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, while many around the world are watching the \nclimate talks in Paris, some of my constituents along the San Francisco \nPeninsula are watching the Pacific Ocean. That is because an unusually \nwarm climate and water has led to a record toxic algae bloom that \ncontaminates the crabs. Our critical Dungeness crab fishery is closed, \nand our fishermen are suffering.\n  One Half Moon Bay fisherman said: ``If you had asked me 6 months ago \nabout crab, I would've told you we're going to feed our families, we're \ngoing to send our kids to college. And I'm not talking just the junior \ncollege. If they want to go to Princeton, crab can make this happen \nwith my work ethic. This situation is a new one. This was like getting \nthe legs pulled out from under you.''\n  So if my Republican colleagues are wondering if climate damage is \nreal or if it is affecting real people, I encourage them to see the \ndocked fishing boats and the landlocked crab pots in my district. \nClimate damage is wiping out people's livelihoods.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to detail a report \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office that was released this month, \nwhich says the Affordable Care Act will lead to a reduction in work \nhours equivalent to 2 million jobs over the next decade.\n  The key reason for the work reduction, according to the CBO, is \nhealthcare subsidies which are tied to income, which will raise \neffective tax rates for Americans and will create a disincentive for \npeople who are seeking promotions or new, higher paying jobs.\n  The report also points to tax increases and penalties as a reason for \nthe work reduction, including the employer mandate, which imposes \npenalties on those companies with more than 50 employees that do not \nprovide insurance.\n  The House and the Senate recently passed legislation that would \nrepeal key parts of the Affordable Care Act, including the employer \nmandate.

Mr. Speaker, we need more mining engineers. Approximately \n70 percent of the mining industry's technical leaders will reach \nretirement age over the next 10 to 15 years.\n  In our mining engineering programs, almost all current faculty \nmembers will need to be replaced by the coming decade.\n  At our Federal agencies, there is already a dangerous lack of \nemployees with the necessary technical expertise to carry out their \nessential duties, such as permitting and inspections.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is irresponsible, and it can have catastrophic \nconsequences like we saw with the Gold King Mine disaster.\n  In order to sustain our Nation's mining schools, we need to ensure \nthat vital Federal funding is made available for faculty to conduct \nmore research and to better educate the next generation of mineral \nscientists and engineers.\n  It can be done by using the existing funding streams under SMCRA.

Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a great deal this week about \nwhat is proposed as a commonsense fix to our Second Amendment, and that \nis, okay, surely you can agree that anyone on the no-fly list should \nnot be able to walk in and buy a gun.\n  We have had friends across the aisle that pointed out, like the Times \nSquare bomber, he could have gone in and bought a gun. I am told now \nthat that is not actually the case, that he specifically could not \nhave. The guy made a bomb. He was going to blow up New York Times \nSquare. He didn't need a gun. He was going to blow people up.\n  A lot of us, when we first hear, ``well, shouldn't that be a no-\nbrainer?'' if you are on the no-fly list, you shouldn't be able to buy \na gun. Then when you find out that the no-fly list is composed of \nnames--and we can't even get a number, even a ballpark number. Is it \n47,000? Is it 470,000? Is it 700,000? Is it over a million? When you \nfind out you can't actually find any specific criteria for getting on \nthe no-fly list, then you realize the no-fly list is basically anybody \nthis administration says needs to be harassed or looked at further.\n  As I was leaving London a year ago after speaking to some groups in \nLondon, a man that was head of that little area of whatever their TSA \nis there in the London airport came up and said: Congressman, I know \nwho you are and I am really, really sorry, but apparently your \nDepartment of Homeland Security indicates you need to be thoroughly \nsearched personally and your bags. Really sorry.\n  Anyway, for those people that say no administration would ever be \ninto political revenge, you can look at some of the groups that the IRS \nwent after. In fact, a huge majority of rank-and-file Federal workers \nin Homeland Security and in the IRS, they would never dream of doing \nthe kind of things that Lois Lerner and her hacks did. They used the \npower of government to go after political enemies.\n  Nobody will ever be able to say specifically how much it helped \nPresident Obama in 2012 to prevent conservative groups from getting \ntheir tax status cleared through the IRS. They did prevent a lot of \ngroups from being able to form. If you don't have the clearance from \nthe IRS, then you can't bring contributions in together to organize and \ndo like many of the unions do that get Federal money. These groups were \nnot going to get Federal money. They were going to get contributions.\n  The more we see the abuses within this administration, the clearer it \nis. Whether it was a Democrat or Republican administration, the last \nthing you would ever want to do is tell a President and administration \nthat you just list anybody on a list; there is no requirement as to the \nspecifics as why. You just put anybody on a list that you have concerns \nabout, and they will never be able to buy a gun. You could keep them \nfrom flying if you want to. You just list them on the list. You don't \nhave to tell Congress. You don't have to tell anybody else. Just put \npeople you are not happy with on a list and say you have concerns about \nthem, and they will never be able to buy a gun.\n  Before we go ripping away people's constitutional Second Amendment \nright or any other right, which should be a right to get on a plane and \nfly unless you are a threat, we do not need to have an obscure process \nwhere nobody can identify the specifics that gets you on the no-fly \nlist or, in this case, as people are proposing, the no-gun list. Just \nlet an administration list them. We have got to do a lot more soul-\nsearching in America.\n  As we have seen, there are so many groups and individuals that were \nlisted as unindicted, but coconspirators in the biggest terror \nfinancing trial in American history, the Holy Land Foundation trial. We \nfound out that a group that called itself charitable and got clearance \nfrom the IRS and they don't really say where their money comes from, \nwhen the FBI drilled down and found out, saw where it was going, they \nwere able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the five principals \nin the Holy Land Foundation trial were guilty of financing terrorism. \nThere were many people, many groups listed as coconspirators.\n  Some, like this Islamic Society of North America of which Imam Magid \nis past president, ISNA was trying--one of those groups, CAIR, they \nwanted their names off the unindicted list. If there were no evidence \nof any ties to the Holy Land Foundation's terrorist funding, then they \nshould have gotten a judge. The judge would have signed the order.\n  Both the district judge and the Fifth Circuit Federal Court of \nAppeals looked at the evidence and said there is plenty of evidence \nhere to show that these groups, like the Islamic Society of North \nAmerica, principals in these groups, they are affiliated with--there is \nevidence to show they are coconspirators with these terrorist financing \npeople. So they would not allow their names to be removed from the \npleadings. They remained in the pleadings.\n  Unfortunately, for those of us who want justice in America, for those \nwho would destroy our government, Eric Holder became Attorney General \nimmediately after the conviction by the Bush administration in very \nlate 2008. Under his guidance, they never pursued those people that the \nFederal district court and the Court of Appeals said there is plenty of \nevidence to support that these people are part of the terror financing \nnetwork. They never pursued them.\n  In fact, Imam Magid out at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society--ADAMS, \nthey called themselves. The Secretary of Homeland Security was just out \nthere last week and applauding their efforts and thanking Imam Magid as\n\n[[Page H9301]]\n\nthe White House has thanked Imam Magid. He has helped the President, we \nknow, with at least one speech. That was the one the President \ndelivered while Netanyahu was on the way over here and wrongly said \nthat everybody involved, including Israel, had agreed to the pre-'67 \nborders.\n  Since that was so factually wrong when the President stated it \npublicly, you can't help but feel like, since Imam Magid advised him on \nthe speech, was there in the inner sanctum of the State Department, in \nthat extremely secure setting when the President delivered his speech--\nhe was even asked for an interview about the speech immediately \nafterwards--you know that there were people with ties to people this \nadministration shouldn't use as their advisers that this administration \nis using as advisers.\n  Anyway, there is a reason that America has become extremely skeptical \nabout what they are told. When this administration and my friends \nacross the aisle start saying, ``Hey, we can trust this administration. \nJust let them list anybody they want to as they currently can on the \nno-fly list and they will never be able to buy a gun and that will stop \nterrorism,'' well, it wouldn't have stopped the pipe bombs that Farook \nand his fiancee--wife, whatever she was, terrorist, female companion--\nhad built and put together.\n  Also, the President keeps pushing for better background checks. There \nwas a great article from Dr. John R. Lott, Jr., December 3. Dr. Lott \nhas had positions with the University of Chicago, Yale University, \nStanford, UCLA, Wharton, and Rice. He was the chief economist at the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission during '88 and '89. This guy is an \nexpert when it comes to guns and gun laws.\n  Dr. Lott had an article that made clear--it is dated December 3; \nthere is a national review online--that there is nothing at all that \nPresident Obama or Loretta Lynch had proposed that would have stopped \nthe 14 people being killed and 21 injured out in San Bernardino. In \nfact, there is nothing that this President proposed in the light of \nviolence in Colorado that would have changed the shooting in Colorado.\n  In fact, if you go back to the prior shooting in Colorado, we know \nthat the gunman went by at least a couple of theaters that were closer \nto him because those were not gun-free zones and there were likely \npeople in the theater who had guns who would have stopped the shooter \nbefore he killed and shot as many people as he did.\n  When it comes to Oregon, they have very strict gun control laws. \nThere is nothing the President or the Justice Department proposed that \nwould have prevented the shooting at the community college in Oregon. \nThose are places where the gun laws are already as strict or stricter \nthan what the President is asking be applied everywhere else.\n  So it just seems disingenuous for anyone to say we need gun control \nlaws like in California so that we can stop the violence when it didn't \nstop the very violence they are using as an excuse to take away \npeople's Second Amendment rights. I would commend that great article by \nJohn Lott.\n  When it comes to the Syrian refugees, most people in America have \nfigured out this has to be stopped because we don't know who is coming \nin. I have mentioned it here on the floor before, Mr. Speaker, last \nweek and previously, that we had information--I had information that \nISIS had probably taken over areas where there were printing facilities \nso they could probably print passports that we would not be able to \nknow were they legitimate or not.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  As this administration keeps saying, we need to bomb Assad out of \nexistence, or at least try to take him out. Well, Assad is not very \nfavorable toward giving this administration all of his criminal records \nand passport records about the people of Syria. We have no idea who \nthese people are. God bless the Director of the FBI, Comey. He comes in \nmore than once and says: Yes, we will vet them, but you have to \nunderstand, even though we will do the best vetting we possibly can, we \nhave nothing to go on.\n  With Iraqis, as he explained, we had fingerprints. We had \nfingerprints from IEDs. We had all kinds of information. We had the \nofficial records of the Iraqi Government that could help tell us \nwhether somebody coming from Iraq was the person they said they were, \nor whether they were not. Were they a threat? Were they a danger?\n  Even with all of that, we find out a couple of guys get to Kentucky \nand have been there a couple of years. One of them was certainly a \nterrorist whose fingerprints were on an IED that had been exploded in \nIraq, and they didn't catch his fingerprints, even though they had \nthem. If you can't catch a terrorist that you let into Kentucky, and \nyou had his fingerprints and compared them, and it didn't show up \ninitially, then how much worse will it be? How many more terrorists \nwill you let into America from within the Syrian refugees?\n  Then it has also been disclosed this week what many of us in America \nknew already. It was only common sense that people who have sworn they \nwant to destroy our country, kill as many Americans and Jews and \nIsraelis as possible, that they would use this refugee crisis not to \nget into Israel--because they are very protective, thank God--but to \nget into Western Europe and to get into the United States. Now we know \nthose are the facts.\n  Most Americans that I have talked to--I think in my telephone \ntownhall, there was about 90 percent of the people in east Texas, of \nthe thousands on the call, they indicated about 90 percent were \nconcerned that we couldn't properly vet the Syrian refugees good \nenough, and that we needed to pause and hold up and wait until we had \nmore information. That is just common sense.\n  Then we also, there was an article from Mark Krikorian November 16. \nHe pointed out, and I will quote from his article:\n  ``The 5-year cost to American taxpayers of resettling a single Middle \nEastern refugee in the United States is conservatively estimated to be \nmore than $64,000 compared with U.N. figures that indicate it costs \nabout $5,300 to provide for that same refugee for 5 years'' if he or \nshe is in their native region.\n  So for every person we arrogantly think, gee, we should bring that \nperson into America, as Mark Krikorian points out, actually that is a \nbit immoral, because if we weren't so arrogant to think we need to get \nthem into America, we could save 12 of them in their native region.\n  They say, 3 to 4 million people coming out of Syria, out of that \narea, gee, they need to come to the United States, and yet Saudi Arabia \nhas accommodations for 3 million. So many people have seen a photograph \nof the massive tent area there for 5 days out of 365. That is during \nthe Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, kitchen facilities, bathroom \nfacilities. It just seems like if they would help take care of the 3 \nmillion, make those available, we could work something out to take care \nof the people that come in for 5 days in the Hajj, that that would be a \nbetter solution than this administration forcing Syrian refugees that \ncould not be properly vetted into this country.\n  Then I was told last night that actually the female terrorist in San \nBernardino was using a name that certainly would not have been given to \nher at birth, and that if we had people that were allowed to study \nradical Islam, the tenets of its belief, as this one person said, she \nhad a name that is actually a guy's name, and for anyone who has spent \ntheir adult life studying radical Islam, like this administration for 7 \nyears, has not allowed the FBI, the intelligence agency, State \nDepartment, Justice Department. They purged their records of anything \nthat offended terror and unindicted coconspirator to finance terrorism. \nSo when this unindicted co-conspirator CAIR complained about anything, \nit was purged from this administration's training records.\n  As this individual, this friend pointed out, when you spend so many \nof your years of your adulthood studying this, for her to have proper \nscreening by somebody that had studied radical Islam, you would ask the \nquestion: When did you get this name? This clearly was not given to you \nat birth. He said it would be like an American going into Europe and \nsomeone there saying: Now, come on, your name is not George Washington. \nIt wasn't given to you at birth. Where did you get it?\n\n[[Page H9302]]\n\n  When you start inquiring, then you find out the madrassas she had \nbeen to, the places she had been to, but you have to get to secondary \nscreening, further questioning, which there should be red flags all \nover somebody's record like that. We have the information available \nthat this administration didn't prevent it from being used to properly \nscreen radical Islamists. But before you can properly screen radical \nIslamists, you have to admit that there is a thing called radical \nIslam.\n  Carolyn Glick writes for the Jerusalem Post. She is a brilliant lady. \nShe pointed out one of the problems with my friend, President George W. \nBush's position that we are not at war with Islam, and then this \nadministration's taking that and running with it to extremes, they fail \nto acknowledge that there is pluralism within Islam. Saying that ``If \nit is bad, it could not possibly be part of Islam,'' is ridiculous. \nWhat that does to moderate Muslims, who don't want radical Islamists \ngoverning them and cutting their hands off, horsewhipping them, \nwhatever, stoning them to death, they would like to live in peace \nwithout worrying about a tyrannical, radical Islamist leader.\n  We do them a disservice by not pointing out that radical Islam is an \nelement of Islam, and it is a fact. Therefore, moderates are left to \nsay nothing because if they say this is an element of Islam we have got \nto stand up against, then they come against the wrongheaded positions \nof the Obama administration.\n  We actually can help moderate Muslims stand up, as some are starting \nto do, a few have been doing for a long time, stand up against radical \nIslam, and say--God blessing President al-Sisi in Egypt, as he stood \nand talked to a group of imams, said we have got to get control of our \nreligious beliefs, our Islam back from the radicals. We have got to \nstand up against them. We help them. The al-Sisi regime administration \nover in Egypt, I have talked to some of them. I don't know if I am \nstill the only Member of Congress that has met with their director of \nintelligence. We had a very informative meeting for a couple of hours.\n  They don't understand why this administration appears to be helping \nradical Islam and standing against the moderates, like President al-\nSisi, like the 30 million of the 90 million Egyptian people that went \nto the street a couple years ago. Wow, that was such a huge deal.\n  There has never been a group that big, in the history of the world, \ngo to the streets of their country and demand a peaceful regime change. \nBut because the constitution that we helped Egypt with when Morsi \nwas elected did not contain an impeachment provision, they had no other \nway to go. There was no other way to peaceably remove a president who \nwas violating their own constitution over and over than to go to the \nstreets, as they did.\n\n  The Coptic Christian Pope there in Cairo has told me more than once \nhow deeply moving it was to see moderate Muslims, Christians, Jews, \nsecularists go to the street as a part of that 30 million, and so many \ncoming up to the Pope and saying: We are so sorry for the way you have \nbeen treated.\n  Has this administration given any accolades whatsoever to the \nEgyptian people for passing a constitution with over 90 percent vote \nthat in that constitution, a majority of the ones approving were \nMuslim, it says in the constitution that when the Muslim Brotherhood, \nradical Islam, they put Muslim Brotherhood on their terrorist watch \nlist. This administration gets their advice. That administration in \nEgypt puts them on the terrorist watch list.\n  They say when the Muslim Brotherhood or any other like-minded radical \nIslamist group burns down a church, we will rebuild it with government \nfunds. It is incredible. The people of Egypt deserve at least an ``atta \nboy.''\n  What was this administration's response? We are going to hold up \nsending you any helicopters. We sent jets and helicopters and tanks to \nthe Muslim Brotherhood when they were in control under Morsi, but now \nthat the Muslim Brotherhood, this terrorist organization is not in \ncontrol, we are not going to send you things.\n  As President al-Sisi once asked me, does your President not \nunderstand? We use the Apache helicopters to keep the Suez Canal open. \nSo it was quite a slap in the face to our friends in Egypt that are \nagainst radical Islam, our Muslim friends there, when this President \ndidn't go, as I think 47 other leaders or so went. He didn't send the \nVice President, didn't send the Ambassador, didn't send anybody from \nWashington to say: Congratulations, Egypt.\n  Since moderate Muslims have been in control in Egypt, they have done \nsomething earthshaking: They dug another lane, a second lane to the \nSuez Canal. Countries all over the world went, wow, Egypt, that is \nenormous.\n  It was embarrassing to me last year in Egypt as people were asking: \nWas your country really excited when we got this second lane dug to the \nSuez Canal? The mainstream media hardly reported anything about it. It \nwas a big deal. It was a free people standing up and doing something \nmonumental. Since it wasn't done by radical Islamists, this \nadministration chose not to give it any credibility.\n  Then we get the report now. Just hours ago, there was an article from \nVictoria Taft:\n  ``After the latest Paris terror attack, French President Hollande \nswore he'd go after radical Muslims who pulled off the mass slayings.\n  ``Now we're learning what he meant by that.\n  ``As HotAir reports:\n  `The French have kicked in the doors on 2,235 homes and taken 232 \npeople into custody or placed them on house arrest.'\n  In the sleepy French town of Lagny-sur-Marne just 18 miles from Paris \n. . . French police went to the local mosque where they found:\n  The Salafist mosque . . . about 30 kilometers east of the French \ncapital was closed down by police on the 2nd of December. In subsequent \nraids, the prefect for the Seine-and-Marne department said `7.62 \nmillimeter ammunition for a Kalashnikov rifle and propaganda videos' \nhad been seized, AFP reported. The locations of the raids were not \ngiven.\n  Both ISIS and al Qaeda adhere to the radical Sunni Salafist Muslim \nteachings. Radicals used some mosques and other home-based un-permitted \nmosques to stockpile weapons.''\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  It was reported that, just in the last 15 days, the French have \nuncovered about a third of the illegal weapons they normally recover in \nan entire year just from these mosque areas and the homes that they \nhave raided.\n  Now, I have serious concerns when I see homes being raided in these \nnumbers. The French do not have our protections under our Bill of \nRights. They don't have nearly the protections we do. I don't want this \nmany homes busted into. I don't want mosques raided unless there is \nprobable cause to believe there is a problem or that they have \ncommitted a crime. You get warrants for those things. The same with the \nhome, the same with somebody's Internet, and the same with their bank \nrecords.\n  Yet this administration is using the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau to do what nobody in American history--any administration--has \ndone before, and that is to get people's bank records, whether or not \nyou want them to or not. They claim: We want to be able to watch so if \nsomebody gets messed around by a bank, we can go after them.\n  Well, when I was a judge, if you wanted to get bank records, you had \nto have probable cause that a crime was committed and probable cause \nthat the person whose records you wanted had committed it; otherwise, I \ndidn't sign a warrant because the Constitution didn't allow it. If I \ndid sign a warrant, it had to be specific to place and time and what \nwas being seized.\n  But this administration gets your bank records--all they want--\nthrough the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They get all your \nmedical records through ObamaCare requirements. They get all kinds of \ninformation about individuals. They get your phone logs, as they have \nbeen doing. Now, there is some question whether they still are or not.\n  I have this article from Michele McPhee and Brian Ross. ABC News \nreports: ``ISIS May Have Passport Printing Machine, Blank Passports.'' \nI am glad they finally caught up with the news on that.\n  I want to revisit an issue.\n\n[[Page H9303]]\n\n  Senator Grassley sent a letter to Secretary Jeh Johnson, February 3, \n2014, so it will be going on 2 years in February. He included an email. \nSenator Grassley included a redacted copy of the email exchange. I have \nseen the unredacted email exchange. And even from the redacted email \nexchange, it is indicated that Secretary Napolitano had a hands-off \nlist.\n  Apparently, when there were indications Muslim leaders should be \nsecondarily screened, pulled aside from their first stop, asked further \nquestions, the indication is this guy is in a group, they say: Well, he \nis on the Secretary's hands-off list.\n  Well, not only can we not get specifics of exactly why somebody is on \nthe no-fly list or the terrorist watch list--just that this \nadministration has a bad feeling about them--we can't find out just how \nyou get on the hands-off list. That is another matter that requires \nsome looking into.\n  Then we find out this week that an ex-Guantanamo detainee now is an \nal Qaeda leader back in Yemen. And it talks about al Qaeda in the \nArabian Peninsula, or AQAP, released a new video featuring former \nGuantanamo detainee Ibrahim al Qosi, whose name is also Sheikh Khubayb \nal Sudani.\n  In 2010, he pled guilty to charges of conspiracy and material support \nfor terrorism before a military commission. It ended up that this \nadministration transferred him to his home country of Sudan. Now he is \nback where he wanted to be, helping al Qaeda. We already knew he was a \nterrorist--he pled guilty--and this administration sent him back.\n  The question still out there and remains: How many Americans will be \nkilled because this administration decided closing Guantanamo is more \nimportant than saving American lives? They traded five murderous \nterrorists, coconspirators, for a guy who, all the indications are, \ndeserted his American military post. I wonder how many American lives \nwill be lost because of that.\n  I have an article from KY3 saying that on Saturday, around 3:50 a.m., \ntwo men buying a large number of cell phones at Walmart in Lebanon set \noff a concern. `` `Somebody went in and bought 60 cell phones from \nWalmart. That's not normal for this area,' explained Laclede County \nSheriff Wayne Merritt.\n  ``After talking with the men, officers didn't have a legal reason to \ndetain them so the men were allowed to leave, according to the Lebanon \nPolice Department incident report.'' That is in Missouri. ``Sheriff \nMerritt said calling law enforcement officers was the right move.''\n  But, unfortunately, because of the statement of our Attorney General \nin recent days in the aftermath of the San Bernardino killings, she has \nmade clear that, in the aftermath of all of those Americans being \nkilled, specifically targeting Christians and Jews--apparently, there \nwas a Muslim shot, but the targets were Jews and Christians, them \ntelling one Jewish man before he was shot: Now you will never get to \nsee Israel--targeting the Christians specifically, instead of going off \non how clearly this was a hate crime, the Attorney General says her big \nconcern is that people are not prejudiced against Muslims.\n  It made it clear to people like the terrorists' neighbors that, if \nyou see radical Islamists gathering and you are suspicious of--maybe \nthey are making pipe bombs in the garage--and you call that in, there \nis a good chance that Attorney General Loretta Lynch is going to come \nafter you for being biased and bigoted.\n  What a ridiculous thing to say. Basically, she is saying, if you see \nsomething and say something and that something involves Muslims, then I \nam coming after you. What a ridiculous, terrible thing for the chief \nlaw enforcement officer of our country to say.\n  Then, this article today from Liam Deacon, Breitbart News, ``Homeland \nSecurity Shut Down Investigation Into Farook And Malik Linked Islamist \nGroup To Protect `Civil Liberties' of Potential Terrorists'':\n  ``The Department of Homeland Security has been accused of deleting \nintelligence records relating to dangerous Islamists linked to \nterrorists Sayed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, because they wanted to \nprotect the `civil liberties' of members of the caliphate-supporting \nnetwork.\n  ``Phil Haney, a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol analyst''--now \nretired--``says he was ordered to stop investigating Deobandi Islamist \ngroups and his work on them was erased. He even says he was subjected \nto discipline when he attempted to blow the whistle.\n  ``If he'd been allowed to continue his investigation, he claims \nMalik's visa application would have been flagged for greater scrutiny.\n  ``He explained: `The administration was more concerned about the \ncivil rights and liberties of foreign Islamic groups with terrorist \nties than the safety and security of Americans.'\n  ``Analyst Phil Haney told Fox News that he once worked as a \nresearcher looking into potential terrorists in the Passenger Analysis \nUnits at the Department of Homeland Security in Atlanta, as well as at \nthe U.S. Customs and Border Protection's National Targeting Center.\n  ``Mr. Haney says that he had been identifying and tracking members of \nthe al-Huda and Tablighi Jamaat groups, offshoots of the radical \nDeobandi school of Islam, which was founded in British colonial India \nspecifically to oppose western culture.\n\n  ``Tablighi Jamaat is a Deobandi revivalist movement whose mandate is, \naccording to its leading advocate Ebrahim Rangooni, to save the Muslim \nworld `from the culture and civilization of the Jews and the \nChristians' . . . To this end, he has suggested cultivating `such \nhatred for their ways as human beings have to urine and excrement.'\n  ``Tablighi Jamaat have been linked to 80 percent of all recent \nterrorist related crimes in France.\n  ``Mr. Haney's work tracking the radical movement was considered so \nimportant that he says he was given an agency award for identifying \npotential terrorists, and he was asked to become part of the National \nTargeting Center, which works to connect the dots and build a bigger \npicture of terrorist activity.\n  ``However, after more than six months of tracking the Deobandis, \nHomeland Security unexpectedly halted his investigation on the request \nof the State Department's Office of Civil Rights.''\n  Anyway, that is what happens. Phil Haney is one of the most \npatriotic, finest people ever known. He cares so deeply about this \ncountry.\n  By the way, Mr. Speaker, his appearance decries his intellect and \nknowledge about radical Islam. So, he has done no telling how many \nsecondary screenings in his time in the Middle East, his knowledge of \nthe language, the culture, the moderate Islamic culture, the radical \nIslamic culture. He knows the teachings of the radicals and who they \nare. He has been able to get massive amounts of information that I \nwould never have dreamed people would admit to him.\n  I have been working with him for a number of years to try to get \ninformation to people in the administration who would protect the \ninformation, and instead, when they realized how much information he \nhad of what others in Homeland Security had deleted, they thought was \ngone--Janet Napolitano talked about connecting the dots. She forgot to \nmention that they had been deleting dots like crazy. I knew that Phil's \ninformation was so damaging to this administration that, if it were not \nhandled properly, they would destroy the man.\n  So what happens after he gets an award for identifying so much \ninformation? He used the tech system. All he did was enter data. He \nwould look even at social media, and if he found that somebody under \nconsideration was in a photograph with somebody we knew to be a radical \nIslamist, he would enter that information. There is a massive amount of \ninformation out there in social media that this administration has not \neven availed themselves of.\n  Previously, when our Embassy in Yemen was surrounded by Houthis, \nradical Islamist rebels, I got a call from a constituent whose son is \nover there and is isolated in a hotel and can't get to the Embassy. In \ntalking to a friend who had a friend, it ends up some guy is going \nthrough a training or practice session. They set aside their \nhypothetical practice scenario and took on the real-life scenario of \ngetting four Americans from a hotel in the capital of Yemen to the \nEmbassy and trying to get more in the Embassy\n\n[[Page H9304]]\n\nout. They used social media. They were able to find pictures being \ntaken by Houthi radical Islamists at different places where they \nobviously were. So they knew which places to avoid.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  They were able, using people in place in Yemen, American assets, and \nusing social media, were able to get those people from the hotel, get \nthem to the Embassy and get them out, even though this administration \nwould only pay for a commercial airline flight where they sat with some \npeople who may have been part of the rebels that wanted to kill them. \nNot the best way to get people out of an Embassy, but they got out.\n  I have heard again recently from my former constituent, and he is \ndoing well. He is a good man. He is a patriot. He wants to help the \ncountry.\n  So it should also be noted that although, in our country, the \nAttorney General is more concerned about prejudice against Muslims, the \nEuro Parliament president--this article by Dr. Thomas D. Williams, the \n3rd of December, points out that the Euro Parliament president says \nChristians are not safe on our continent.\n  In a high-level meeting on religious persecution in Brussels, the \npresident of the European Parliament said that Europe cannot afford to \ncontinue ignoring the faith of Christians, who are ``clearly the most \npersecuted group'' in the world.\n  In Wednesday's meeting, EP President Martin Schulz said that the \npersecution of Christians is undervalued and does not receive enough \nattention, which also has meant that ``it hasn't been properly \naddressed.''\n  I applaud the efforts of Glenn Beck trying to save Christians over in \nareas of radical Islam, because, as the European Parliament President \nsays, radical Islamists' number 1 goal is not other Muslims; it's \nChristians and Jews. Yet, this administration's big focus is helping \nMuslims.\n  Then we find out from the U.N. that actually they locate their \nrefugee centers in urban areas where you rarely find many Christians. \nAnd we find out the reports, hear from people that say we are afraid to \ngo into the U.N. refugee camps, because they are virtually all Muslim, \nand we are targeted, and we can't go there. We can't allow our families \nto go there.\n  Yet, it is the U.N. refugee camps that this administration brings the \nrefugees, and wants to bring refugees from.\n  Glenn Beck, realizing that Christian refugees were being under-\nappreciated, undervalued by the Obama administration, has gone over and \ntried to do something about it. I applaud his efforts.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, as we close out this week, the bill we just passed \nwith regard to the Customs conference report, I just want to go back to \nJanuary 29, 1961. In about over a month, it will be the 55-year \nanniversary of President John F. Kennedy's speech. It was a message to \ncommemorate Roosevelt Day for Franklin Roosevelt.\n  So, in his speech, he points out that 28 years ago, Franklin \nRoosevelt assumed the leadership of a stricken and demoralized Nation. \nPoverty, distress, economic stagnation, blanketed the land.\n  He goes on in the speech, recognizing Franklin Roosevelt. And I would \njust like to read John F. Kennedy's words, because they are such a \ncontrast to the current President's words, as he wants to take away \npeople's Second Amendment rights.\n  He wants to have the ability, since he controls, completely controls \nthe no-fly list, nobody in Congress gets to know who he is putting on, \nwhy they are putting on, what criteria he is using to put them on. He \ngets exclusive control of who he wants to put on the no-fly list, he or \nhis assignees. President Obama wants to restrict those rights.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I conclude today, and this week in the House, with \nthe words of John F. Kennedy. President John F. Kennedy, January 29, \n1961, part of his speech that day said:\n  ``To meet these problems will require the efforts, not only of our \nleaders or of the Democratic Party, but the combined efforts of all of \nour people. No one has a right to feel that, having entrusted the task \nof government to new leaders in Washington, he can continue to pursue \nhis private comforts unconcerned with America's challenges and dangers. \nFor, if freedom is to survive and prosper, it will require the \nsacrifice, the effort, and the thoughtful attention of every citizen.\n  ``In my own native State of Massachusetts, the battle for American \nfreedom was begun by the thousands of farmers and tradesmen who made up \nthe Minute Men, citizens who were ready to defend their liberty at a \nmoment's notice.''\n  President Kennedy goes on with these words:\n  ``Today, we need a Nation of Minute Men, citizens who are not only \nprepared to take up arms, but citizens who regard preservation of \nfreedom as a basic purpose of their daily life and who are willing to \nconsciously work and sacrifice for that freedom. The cause of liberty, \nthe cause of America, cannot succeed with any lesser effort.''\n  The words of John F. Kennedy, January 29, 1961.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9304-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Westmoreland (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on \naccount of personal reasons.\n  Mr. DeFazio (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nmedical leave.\n  Mr. Gene Green of Texas (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on \naccount of family engagement in my district in Houston.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/11/house-section/article/H9304-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9304-H9305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL\n\n\n  revisions to the aggregates and allocations of the fiscal year 2016 \n                           budget resolution\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2015.\n     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I hereby submit for printing in the \n     Congressional Record revisions to the budget allocations and \n     aggregates of the Fiscal Year 2016 Concurrent Resolution on \n     the Budget, S. Con. Res. 11. These revisions are designated \n     for the conference report accompanying H.R. 22, the Fixing \n     America's Surface Transportation Act (Public Law 114-94), \n     which passed the House on December 3, 2015, and the \n     conference report accompanying H.R. 644, the Trade \n     Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. Corresponding \n     tables are attached.\n       The adjustment for H.R. 22 is made pursuant to section 4509 \n     of S. Con. Res. 11, a deficit-neutral reserve fund for \n     transportation. For purposes of budget enforcement, this \n     adjustment is consistent with section 3302 of such concurrent \n     resolution. Section 3302 requires transfers from the general \n     fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund be counted as \n     new budget authority and outlays equal to the amount of the \n     transfer in the fiscal year in which the transfer occurs. \n     Pursuant to section 3403 of S. Con. Res. 11, these revisions \n     to the allocations and aggregates shall take effect upon the \n     enactment of the conference report accompanying H.R. 22.\n       The adjustment for H.R. 644 is made pursuant to section \n     4506 of S. Con. Res. 11, a deficit-neutral reserve fund for \n     trade agreements. Pursuant to section 3403 of S. Con. Res. \n     11, these revisions to the allocations and aggregates shall \n     apply only while the conference report accompanying H.R. 644 \n     is under consideration or upon its enactment.\n       These revisions represent an adjustment for purposes of \n     budgetary enforcement. These revised allocations and \n     aggregates are to be considered as the aggregates and \n     allocations included in the budget resolution, pursuant to S. \n     Con. Res. 11, as adjusted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Tom Price, M.D.\n                                Chairman, Committee on the Budget.\n\n[[Page
