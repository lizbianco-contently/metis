This bill prohibits the EPA from using \nits Waters of the U.S. rule to expand its authority beyond, way beyond, \ncongressional intent.\n  Waters of the U.S. is yet another executive overreach by this \nadministration. The Clean Water Act intentionally limited the EPA's \njurisdiction to navigable waters, yet Waters of the U.S. would expand \nFederal jurisdiction to include virtually all water flows--from ditches \nto prairie potholes--even on private land.\n  Nebraskans are concerned Waters of the U.S. could severely harm our \nag economy by increasing costs and uncertainty for producers.\n  America's farmers and ranchers are already great stewards of the land \nand take numerous steps to protect our natural resources. By blocking \nthe Waters of the U.S. rule, H.R. 1732 stops the administration's \nlatest power grab and supports ag producers across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3257-10", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3257-H3258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING THE HOUSTON ROCKETS AND HOUSTON ASTROS\n\n  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.

In fact, a couple blocks from\n\n[[Page H3258]]\n\nwhere the Rockets play, the Houston Astros are playing. A few years \nago, we had the worst team in baseball, but they have been leading \ntheir division and just swept another home stand.\n  So I want to congratulate the Houston Rockets for moving forward in \nthe playoffs and also the Houston Astros because it is a long season. \nWe need to keep it up.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the sixth anniversary \nof the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka. In a brutal war that lasted \n37 years, we saw nearly 100,000 people killed--many of them civilians--\nas a result of the tensions between the country's Buddhist majority and \nHindu minority.\n  Since the war ended, however, corruption and ongoing human rights \nabuses have prevented Sri Lanka from reaching a national \nreconciliation.\n  Then in January of this year, we saw President Sirisena \ndemocratically elected with significant support from the Sinhalese, \nTamil, and Muslim communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, on this fortuitous occasion, I call on the new \ngovernment to release the 200 detained political prisoners, account for \nthe nearly 20,000 missing civilians from the war, and end oppressive \nrestrictions on the Tamil provinces.\n  This sixth anniversary serves as a reminder of Sri Lanka's war-torn \npast and a chance to move it toward a future of democracy, justice, and \nequality for all its people because only then can Sri Lanka finally \nachieve the stability, peace, and prosperity that it deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3258-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PROTECTING NORTH CAROLINA FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS\n\n  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, in 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a rule that would \nsignificantly broaden the Federal Government's power to regulate waters \nand adjacent lands under the Clean Water Act.\n  The Waters of the United States rule would give the Federal \nGovernment jurisdiction over puddles, roadside ditches, irrigation \nditches, and storm and wastewater systems. Federal agencies frequently \nplace burdensome regulations on the American public, and this rule is \nno exception.\n  Fortunately, last week, the House passed H.R. 1732, the Regulatory \nIntegrity Protection Act, which would require the agencies to start \nover and develop a new rule in consultation with State and local \ngovernments and other stakeholders. This commonsense legislation \nprevents an out-of-touch administration from threatening the livelihood \nof North Carolina's farmers and saddling local governments with \nexorbitant compliance costs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3258-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2015.\n     Hon.

DOC. NO. 114-39)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was read and, together \nwith the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs and ordered to be printed:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to Burma that was \ndeclared on May 20, 1997, is to continue in effect beyond May 20, 2015. \nThe Government of Burma has made significant progress across a number \nof important areas, including the release of over 1,300 political \nprisoners, continued progress toward a nationwide cease-fire, the \ndischarge of hundreds of child soldiers from the military, steps to \nimprove labor standards, and expanding political space for civil \nsociety to have a greater voice in shaping issues critical to Burma's \nfuture. In addition, Burma has become a signatory of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency's Additional Protocol and ratified the Biological \nWeapons Convention, significant steps towards supporting global \nnonproliferation. Despite these strides, the situation in the country \ncontinues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States.\n  Concerns persist regarding the ongoing conflict and human rights \nabuses in the country, particularly in ethnic minority areas and \nRakhine State. In addition, Burma's military operates with little \noversight from the civilian government and often acts with impunity. \nFor these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue \nthe national emergency with respect to Burma.\n  Despite this action, the United States remains committed to \nsupporting and strengthening Burma's reform efforts and to continue \nworking both with the Burmese government and people to ensure that the \ndemocratic transition is sustained and irreversible.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 15, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3258-5", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

FIVE-YEAR EXTENSION OF HOMELESS VETERANS \n                   REINTEGRATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       Section 2021(e)(F) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``2015'' and inserting ``2020''.\n\n     SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICES UNDER \n                   HOMELESS VETERANS REINTEGRATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       Subsection (a) of section 2021 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking ``reintegration of homeless \n     veterans into the labor force.'' and inserting the following: \n     ``reintegration into the labor force of--''\n       ``(1) homeless veterans;\n       ``(2) veterans participating in the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs supported housing program for which rental assistance \n     provided pursuant to section 8(o)(19) of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(19)); and\n       ``(3) veterans who are transitioning from being \n     incarcerated.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nadd extraneous material on H.R. 474.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 474, the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs \nReauthorization Act of 2015 would extend this very good job training \nand placement program for homeless veterans.\n  This bill would also make some commonsense changes to the program's \neligibility rules by making veterans housed under the HUD-VA supported \nhousing program and formerly incarcerated veterans eligible for HVRP.\n  Mr. Speaker, by making those eligibility changes, we will be offering \ntraining and placement services to groups of veterans who are largely \nunemployed and have significant barriers to employment. The program's \nhistory of a job placement rate of 70 percent has been recognized by \nmany as among the best in the Federal Government and I believe warrants \nits continuation.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 474, the Homeless \nVeterans' Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2015. This \nbipartisan bill reauthorizes the highly successful Homeless Veterans' \nReintegration Program, HVRP, which provides grants to train and \nreintegrate homeless veterans into meaningful employment.\n  H.R. 474 also clarifies that in addition to homeless veterans, those \nparticipating in the HUD-VASH voucher program and those transitioning \nfrom being incarcerated are also eligible to participate in HVRP. HVRP \nis unique among Federal programs, as it is dedicated to providing \nemployment assistance to homeless veterans. Other programs that we hear \nmuch about focus on needs such as emergency shelter, food, and abuse \ntreatment.\n  Homeless veterans often face a variety of problems that can bar them \nfrom traditional employment pathways, including severe PTSD, histories \nof substance abuse, and encounters with the criminal justice system. \nHVRP service providers give our homeless veterans specialized intensive \ncounseling and services to help them find a positive pathway forward, \nresulting in gainful employment.\n  This bill will not incur any direct spending costs, nor will \ndiscretionary costs be beyond the minimal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Wenstrup for his hard work on \nthis bill, as well as Ranking Member Takano for his efforts to advance \nthis legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Wenstrup) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nadd extraneous material on H.R. 1038.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, currently, if a VA employee is either reprimanded or \nadmonished for their performance, all records of those administrative \npunishments are removed from the employee's personnel file within 3 \nyears and 2 years, respectively. Subsequent to the removal of these \npersonnel actions, there is no record of their poor performance or acts \nregardless of how many different jobs they hold within the VA or how \nlong they remain a VA employee.\n  Mr. Speaker, personnel policies and rules such as we are addressing \ntoday are part of the culture of no accountability at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs that have contributed significantly to the recent \npublic scandals. The list of scandals now includes the abuse of the \npurchase card program where some VA employees were spending $5 billion \nannually on goods and services without contracts, which was exposed at \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee hearings last Thursday.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time to ensure that only the most ethical and most \nqualified employees who benefit from the tax dollars that support them \nmove up through the ranks at VA. One way to assist that is to retain an \nemployee's entire history in their personnel file. Now, no one is \nsaying that employees can't improve their performance after being \nreprimanded or admonished, but managers should know the complete \nhistory of their staff or potential staff members.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3260]]\n\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 1038, the Ensuring VA \nEmployee Accountability Act of 2015.\n  Currently, when a VA employee is reprimanded for misconduct, the \npaperwork describing the incident is removed from that employee's file \nafter 3 years. Paperwork describing an incident leading to an \nadmonishment is taken out after just 2 years. H.R. 1038 requires the \nSecretary to maintain all written reprimands and admonishments of any \nVA employee in that employee's file for the entire duration of his or \nher employment at VA.\n  As members of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee work to ensure \neffective oversight of VA actions, it is important to maintain a record \nof VA employees' past misconduct. At the same time we are working \ntoward greater accountability, we must also ensure that increased \ntransparency does not come at the expense of fairness and the equitable \ntreatment of VA employees.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues and all \ninterested parties to clarify the intent of this legislation to ensure \nthat we are not inadvertently affecting the use of negotiated \nsettlement agreements when appropriate and that admonishments and \nreprimands are not wrongly used to silence whistleblowers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello), the author of this bill.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to come \nbefore you today to speak on behalf of this commonsense effort to \nensure greater employee accountability within the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  We all agree that our veterans deserve the best service and care \npossible, and it is our responsibility to ensure that that care is \nprovided by responsible employees.\n  My legislation, H.R. 1038, Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act, \nis a further step in this direction. As you know, the VA carries out \ntheir disciplinary actions in a tiered system, and the two most \ncommonly used are the lower-tiered actions, admonishments and \nreprimands.\n  As the VA continues to review the findings of the recent inspector \ngeneral's investigations related to data manipulation, backlogs, and \nexcessive wait times, it is apparent that a greater number of \nadmonishments and reprimands are being issued to at-fault employees.\n  However, in the current policy, these disciplinary actions remain in \nan employee's file for only 3 years and are then deleted. This prevents \nthe keeping of complete employee files and doesn't allow the poor \nperformers within the VA to be tracked or held accountable.\n  Veterans expect the correct disciplinary action to be administered--\nindeed, all taxpayers do--and not simply the issuance of a temporary \nwritten warning. Therefore, as the VA continues to issue these lower-\ntier disciplinary actions more heavily than others, it is important \nthat the personnel actions remain in the employee's record while \nemployed at the VA.\n  My bill requires all reprimands and admonishments remain in a VA \nemployee's file as long as they are employed at the VA, ensuring that \nthe VA maintains good, complete employee records and holds those who \ncare for our veterans accountable.\n  There are some concerns that this legislation could negatively impact \nflexibility in resolving routine personnel disputes, but there is \nnothing in this bill that imposes new employee penalties or would \naffect the existing process for a VA employee to appeal a disciplinary \naction.\n  We are open to working with our Senate counterparts to ensure that \nnothing in this legislation prevents a VA employee's ability to dispute \na disciplinary action before a reprimand or admonishment is placed in \ntheir record. It is simply another tool for the Secretary to hold \nemployees accountable during their tenure at the VA.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support my legislation to \npromote transparency and accountability where it is needed.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Costello for his work on this \nbill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1038 and to work with all of us \nto make sure going forward that the intent of the bill is accurately \nrealized.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to \nsupport H.R. 1038, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1313 would amend title 38 to allow certain \nsurviving spouses of service-disabled small-business owners to continue \nto be classified as a service-disabled veteran-owned small business for \na 3-year period following the death of the veteran owner.\n  Current law limits the continuation to just the surviving spouses of \ndisabled veterans rated at 100 percent by VA. By changing the law, we \nwill enable surviving spouses of the vast majority of small businesses \nowned by service-disabled veterans to make the transition from a \npreferred VA contractor to the private sector market. This small change \nwill also provide a large measure of financial stability to surviving \nspouses.\n  I see this as another commonsense bill, and I thank Mr. McNerney for \nbringing it to us.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1313, the Service Disabled \nVeteran Owned Small Business Relief Act of\n\n[[Page H3261]]\n\n2015. Veterans who are rated as 100 percent disabled by the Department \nof Veterans Affairs and who own at least 51 percent of their small \nbusiness receive preferred status in the Federal contracting process.\n  If the veteran small-business owner passes away, the surviving family \nmembers and business partners are not allowed any time to transition \naway from this preferred status, thereby putting their businesses in \njeopardy of losing any Federal contracts they may have. Last year, \nthere were an estimated 500,000 of these businesses nationwide.\n  This bill provides a 3-year transition period during which the \nbusiness would keep its preferential status and any Federal contracts \nassociated with that status should the veteran owner pass away.\n  Current law does, however, allow the surviving spouse to maintain \npreferred status for up to 3 years following the death of a veteran \nowner, but only if that veteran had a 100 percent service-connected \ndisability rating and died due to the disability.\n  H.R. 1313 further expands the transition period from 3 to 10 years \nafter the veteran owner's death if the veteran were either 100 percent \ndisabled or died from a service-connected disability.\n  H.R. 1313 is a fair policy that will ensure we protect the hard work \nand investment of our service-connected disabled veterans who own small \nbusinesses.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Wenstrup and Ranking Member Takano of \nthe Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee for their support of this bill and Mr. McNerney for bringing \nit to us.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I, again, reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairman Wenstrup \nand Ranking Member Takano for their continued work on behalf of our \nNation's veterans and for bringing these commonsense bills to the floor \ntoday.\n  Small businesses are the economic drivers in our communities, and we \nmust give them opportunities they need to grow and prosper. Veteran \nentrepreneurs, in particular, are some of the most apt at starting, \nmanaging, and growing small businesses.\n  In the United States, there are about 5 million veteran-owned \nbusinesses and an estimated 500,000 service-disabled veteran-owned \nsmall businesses. A service-disabled veteran-owned small business is \none that must be at least 51 percent directly owned and controlled by \none or more service-disabled veterans.\n  The Federal Government established procurement contracting goals for \nsmall businesses in 1978 and set aside 3 percent of the total value of \nall Federal contracts for veteran-owned small businesses. Although some \nFederal agencies meet these goals, there are no penalties for not \nmeeting the 3 percent small business procurement goal. The VA is \ndiligent, on the other hand, in meeting this goal.\n  Under current law, if a veteran who was rated 100 percent disabled \nand owned a service-disabled veteran-owned small business passes away, \nthe surviving spouse has 10 years to transition the business away from \nservice-disabled veteran-owned small business status for contracts that \nthe company has with the VA.\n  However, if the veteran businessowner was rated at less than 100 \npercent disabled or dies of a nonservice-connected injury, the \nsurviving spouse has only 1 year to transition the business for \ncontracts with the VA.\n  Unfortunately, this is not enough transition time for service-\ndisabled veteran-owned small businesses whose owner passes away and was \nrated at less than 100 percent disabled to reposition the business, \nputting many service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses at a \ndisadvantage. We need to correct this deficiency in the law.\n  That is why I introduced H.R. 1313, the Service Disabled Veteran \nOwned Small Business Relief Act. My bill allows the service-disabled \nveteran-owned small business, whose principal owner passes away and was \nrated at less than 100 percent disabled at the time of death, with a \nreasonable 3-year transition period from service-disabled veteran-owned \nsmall business status with the VA.\n\n  It is only right that we provide our heroes and their families and \nthe employees with flexibility and certainty to ensure their businesses \ncontinue to thrive. The loss of a veteran businessowner is already \ntragic enough for their families and can put service-disabled veteran-\nowned small businesses at severe risk of closing or downsizing because \nof the loss of Federal contracts.\n  H.R. 1313 is supported by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, The American Legion, and \nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. In addition, the VA said, at \na subcommittee hearing on March 24 of this year, that the bill is a \nreasonable approach.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in passing this commonsense \nbill and support veteran-owned small businesses across the country.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I have no further speakers, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1313, to ensure that our \nservice-connected disabled-veteran small-business owners are able to \nleave a legacy for their families and coworkers when they pass away.\n  At this point, I don't have any other speakers, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Once again, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to \nsupport H.R. 1313, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1313.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Preference for offerors employing veterans\n\n       ``(a) Preference.--In awarding a contract (or task order) \n     for the procurement of goods or services, the Secretary may \n     give a preference to offerors that employ veterans on a full-\n     time basis.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to add extraneous material on H.R. 1382, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, to improve employment opportunities for veterans and \nbusiness opportunities for the companies that employ them, H.R. 1382, \nas amended, would require the Secretary to consider the number of \nveterans working for an offerer in the decision to award a contract.\n  Under the bill, the Secretary may give a preference to such employers \nbased on the percentage of the workforce made up by veterans. The bill \nwould also provide the Secretary with debarment authority for any \nofferer who willfully and intentionally misrepresents the number of \nveterans they employ.\n  Mr. Speaker, the unemployment rate among certain age groups of \nveterans still exceeds their nonveteran peers, and this is one \ncommonsense step to increase job opportunities for veterans of all \nages.\n  I thank Miss Rice for her hard work on this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1382, as amended, the Boosting Rates of \nAmerican Veteran Employment Act, or BRAVE Act, of 2015.\n  According to the April 2015 Bureau of Labor Statistics report, almost \n7 percent of post-9/11 veterans are unemployed, which is higher than \nthe national average.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  These men and women have dutifully served their country. Now it is \nour job as Members of Congress to craft policies that will improve and \nincrease employment opportunities for them. This includes improving the \nFederal contracting process to incentivize private sector companies to \nhire more veterans when they come home.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs establishes long-term contracts \nwith private sector businesses to provide veterans medical equipment, \nsupplies, services, and other things. Currently, the VA gives \npreference for these contracts to veteran-owned small businesses, but \nit does not give preference to businesses that actively employ \nveterans. This bipartisan BRAVE Act allows the VA to consider the \nproportion of veterans employed by a prospective contractor when \nawarding those Federal contracts. It also encourages and incentivizes \ncurrent VA contractors to employ more veterans.\n  H.R. 1382 deters companies from exaggerating the number of veterans \nthey employ in order to become more competitive for procurement, \nrequiring debarment for any company that knowingly misrepresents its \nproportion of veteran employees.\n  H.R. 1382 does not require offsets nor does it add any burdens on \ntaxpayers. This bipartisan legislation will reward companies who hire \nveterans, thus incentivizing the private sector recruitment of veteran \nemployees. It is, indeed, a win-win-win policy for the private sector, \nfor the Federal Government, and, most importantly, for the veterans, \nthemselves.\n  I want to thank Miss Rice, who is the sponsor of this bill, Chairman \nMiller for bringing it to the floor, and Dr. Wenstrup and Mr. Takano--\nthe chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Economic \nOpportunity--for their work on the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New \nYork (Miss Rice), who is the sponsor of this important legislation.\n  Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my \nlegislation, H.R. 1382, the Boosting Rates of American Veteran \nEmployment Act.\n  I doubt there is a single Member of this body who would disagree that \nAmerican veterans--men and women who have stepped up to protect our \ncountry and preserve the freedom that we cherish--deserve our full \nsupport when they have completed their service. They deserve the \nopportunity to find a good job, to support themselves and their \nfamilies. They deserve the opportunity to succeed in civilian life, to \nadapt their extraordinary skills, training, and experience in order to \nthrive in a civilian workforce, and to continue making a meaningful \ncontribution to our economy.\n  We have seen real progress in adding veterans to the workforce, but \nwe cannot be satisfied with that progress while so many men and women \nstill struggle to find the good jobs they deserve. We cannot be \nsatisfied when the unemployment rate among post-9/11 veterans remains \nhigher than the national average. We cannot be satisfied if even a \nsingle American veteran who wants to work is not given the opportunity \nto do so--is left jobless, homeless, forgotten, and abandoned by the \ncountry he or she served.\n  Unemployment among veterans is not only a stain on the character of \nour country, it is not only a dereliction of the promise we make to the \npeople who risk their lives to protect us; it is a missed opportunity.\n  Veterans have received the most advanced and sophisticated training \nthe world has to offer. They have unique skills and experience. They \nknow how to work as members of a team. They know how to succeed in the \nmost difficult conditions. They know how to get the job done, whatever \nthat job may be. They received that training, they developed those \nskills, and gained that experience because we invested in them as \nservicemembers, and we would be foolish not to double down on that \ninvestment. We would be foolish not to invest in them as veterans--\ninvest in their potential to adapt their training and skills and \nexperience so they may use it to thrive in a civilian workforce and \ncontribute to our economy.\n  We need businesses in the private sector to recognize the benefit of \nhaving veterans in their workforces. We need businesses to recognize \nthat it is in their self-interest to actively seek out and employ \nveterans, not as an act of charity, but because they are excellent \nworkers who know how to get the job done and how to bring out the best \nin their fellow employees. That is why it is so important that we pass \nH.R. 1382.\n  This legislation will make the kind of investment that Members of \nboth parties can be pleased to support--the kind that costs no money. \nThe Department of Veterans Affairs is already authorized for $19 \nbillion in total procurement and contracting spending. This legislation \nwill simply ensure that, when the Secretary of the VA is awarding those \ncontracts, he has the authority to give preference to businesses with \nhigh concentrations of full-time veteran employees, businesses that \nmake it a priority to actively seek out veterans and provide them with \nmeaningful full-time employment.\n  As has been noted, the VA can already give such preference to \nveteran-owned businesses, as it should. We should give that same \nadvantage to contractors who actively invest in veterans, who recognize \ntheir value and their potential to thrive in the civilian workforce.\n  Such companies do exist, and this legislation will reward them for \ntheir commitment to giving veterans the opportunities they have earned. \nBut in doing so, in creating such an advantage, this legislation will \nalso create an incentive for other contractors to do the same, to be \nproactive, to make it a priority to seek out veterans who are looking \nfor employment. In time, I have no doubt that they will recognize the \nvalue of investing in veterans as they will find themselves with a more \nproductive, efficient, and effective workforce.\n\n[[Page H3263]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to give a special thanks to my colead sponsor on \nthe other side of the aisle, Congressman Paul Cook, a combat veteran \nwho served 26 years and retired as a colonel from the United \nStates Marine Corps.\n\n  I also think it is important to note that this bill has the support \nof several major veteran service organizations, including the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars, the American Legion, and the Iraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my support for another \nbill that I am proud to cosponsor, Dr. Wenstrup's legislation--H.R. \n474, the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act.\n  The HVRP provides critical support to help reintegrate homeless \nveterans into the workforce and to address the underlying issues that \nso often lead to life on the streets--services ranging from job \ntraining, job placement, and career counseling to clothing, housing, \ntransportation, and treatment for mental health and substance abuse \ndisorders. This program has been successful, and passing a 5-year \nreauthorization will secure its future and allow State and local \nagencies to plan long-term programming.\n  I thank Dr. Wenstrup for his leadership on this issue, and I urge my \ncolleagues to give H.R. 474 their full support.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1382, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I don't have any additional speakers, so I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to \nsupport H.R. 1382, as amended, and I thank Miss Rice for presenting \nthis legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1382, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP.

CARD ACT\n\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 91) to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to issue, upon request, veteran \nidentification cards to certain veterans, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 91\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran's I.D. Card Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. VETERANS IDENTIFICATION CARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Currently, veteran identification cards are issued to \n     veterans who have either completed the statutory time-in-\n     service requirement for retirement from the Armed Forces or \n     who have received a medical-related discharge from the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (2) A veteran who has served a minimum obligated time in \n     service, but who does not meet the criteria described in \n     paragraph (1), does not receive a means of identifying the \n     veteran's status as a veteran other than using the official \n     DD-214 discharge papers of the veteran.\n       (3) Goods, services, and promotional activities are often \n     offered by public and private institutions to veterans who \n     demonstrate proof of service in the military but it is \n     impractical for a veteran to always carry official DD-214 \n     discharge papers to demonstrate such proof.\n       (4) A general purpose veteran identification card made \n     available to a veteran who does not meet the criteria \n     described in paragraph (1) would be useful to such veteran in \n     order to demonstrate the status of the veteran without having \n     to carry and use official DD-214 discharge papers.\n       (5) The Department of Veterans Affairs has the \n     infrastructure in place across the United States to produce \n     photographic identification cards and accept a small payment \n     to cover the cost of these cards.\n       (b) Provision of Veteran Identification Cards.--Chapter 57 \n     of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding after \n     section 5705 the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 5706. Veterans identification card\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     issue an identification card described in subsection (b) to \n     any covered veteran who--\n       ``(1) requests such card;\n       ``(2) was discharged from the Armed Forces under honorable \n     conditions;\n       ``(3) presents a copy of the DD-214 form or other official \n     document from the official military personnel file of the \n     veteran that describes the service of the veteran; and\n       ``(4) pays the fee under subsection (c)(1).\n       ``(b) Identification Card.--An identification card \n     described in this subsection is a card that--\n       ``(1) displays a photograph of the covered veteran;\n       ``(2) displays the name of the covered veteran;\n       ``(3) explains that such card is not proof of any benefits \n     to which the veteran is entitled to;\n       ``(4) contains an identification number that is not a \n     social security number; and\n       ``(5) serves as proof that such veteran--\n       ``(A) honorably served in the Armed Forces; and\n       ``(B) has a DD-214 form or other official document in the \n     official military personnel file of the veteran that \n     describes the service of the veteran.\n       ``(c) Costs of Card.--(1) The Secretary shall charge a fee \n     to each veteran who receives an identification card issued \n     under this section, including a replacement identification \n     card.\n       ``(2)(A) The fee charged under paragraph (1) shall equal an \n     amount that the Secretary determines is necessary to issue an \n     identification card under this section.\n       ``(B) In determining the amount of the fee under \n     subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall ensure that the total \n     amount of fees collected under paragraph (1) equals an amount \n     necessary to carry out this section, including costs related \n     to any additional equipment or personnel required to carry \n     out this section.\n       ``(C) The Secretary shall review and reassess the \n     determination under subparagraph (A) during each five-year \n     period in which the Secretary issues an identification card \n     under this section.\n       ``(3) Amounts collected under this subsection shall be \n     deposited in an account of the Department available to carry \n     out this section.

Veterans identification card.''.\n\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall \n     take effect on the date that is 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Wenstrup) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto add extraneous material on H.R. 91, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n\n[[Page H3264]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Thankfully, many of the Nation's businesses offer discounts to our \nservicemembers and veterans. Unfortunately, unless a servicemember is a \nqualified military retiree, the DOD does not issue an ID card as proof \nof service. That means millions of veterans cannot take advantage of \nthose discounts or proudly share evidence of their honorable service. \nThis bill would change that by directing the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to issue a veteran's ID card to any veteran who requests such \ncard and who is not entitled to military retired pay nor is enrolled in \nthe VA health care system.\n  The bill would require the card to display the veteran's name and \nphotograph, and it would serve as proof that the veteran honorably \nserved in the Armed Forces. This bill would also require the Secretary \nto determine a fee to be charged that would cover all costs of \nproducing the cards and of managing the program. The bill also \nspecifies that the card does not entitle the holder to any VA benefits.\n  I thank my colleague Mr. Buchanan for his efforts on this commonsense \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 91, the Veteran's I.D. Card Act, as \namended.\n  This bill directs the Secretary to issue, upon a veteran's request, a \nveteran's identification card. In most instances, a veteran must be \nenrolled with the VA to receive a VA ID card or to utilize his or her \nDD-214 to prove military service. Many veterans are hesitant to carry \naround their DD-214s, which may contain personal health information. A \nveteran's ID card would provide those veterans with the ability to \nprove their service without the need to constantly have to produce \nofficial documents like their DD-214 forms.\n  Issuing an optional veteran's ID card is a simple way to provide a \nreliable and convenient method for our Nation's heroes to prove their \nhonorable service and veteran status.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Buchanan).\n  Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Veteran's \nI.D. Card Act.\n  This is bipartisan legislation I have introduced which will allow all \nveterans to receive an ID card through the VA.\n  Over the years, I have heard from countless veterans from Florida and \nacross the country who have expressed frustration about their ability \nto document their service. This will allow them to document their \nservice by getting ID cards. The ID card won't quite replace the DD-\n214, but they won't have to carry around the paperwork with them if \nthey are looking to use it in the future. It will also help to cut down \non identity theft.\n  One of the biggest things for veterans in our area is it will help \nwith jobs and opportunities in terms of their not having to carry the \npaperwork. They will have proof of their service for their employers. \nIt will also provide discounts from a lot of our businesses in the \narea. A lot of businesses offer veterans discounts, but veterans don't \nhave the documentation. As a result, many times, they don't get the \nbenefits. One of the biggest benefits is that there is no cost to the \ntaxpayers, which is a big thing for a lot of people.\n  One other thing I just wanted to mention is that many of our veterans \nhave served our country proudly, and this will help validate their \nservice from that standpoint.\n  On behalf of the 70,000 veterans in my district, of the almost 2 \nmillion veterans in Florida and of the 22 million veterans in the \ncountry, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation to \nhelp our American heroes.\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 91, as amended, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to \nsupport this legislation, H.R. 91, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 91, the \nVeteran's I.D. Card Act.\n  This legislation is a commonsense proposal to permit veterans to show \ntheir service without hassle and inconvenience. Upon enactment, the \nbill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to issue a photo \nidentification card to veterans who request it. The identification card \nserves as proof of honorable military service.\n  In the First District of Iowa, many of my constituents--including \nveterans of World War II, the Korean war, and Vietnam war--would \nbenefit from the existence of such a card. The card would increase \nveterans' access to available military service discounts at commercial \nestablishments. The Veterans I.D. Card Act, an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan bill and supported by AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of America, \nand Veterans for Common Sense, makes proving veteran status easy, \nexpedient, and credible.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to enact \nthis commonsense legislation that assists veterans in receiving all the \nrecognition and benefits they deserve.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 91, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n             VULNERABLE VETERANS HOUSING REFORM ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 1816) to exclude from consideration as income under the \nUnited States Housing Act of 1937 payments of pension made under \nsection 1521 of title 38, United States Code, to veterans who are in \nneed of regular aid and attendance.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1816\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Vulnerable Veterans Housing \n     Reform Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXCLUSION FROM INCOME.\n\n       Paragraph (4) of section 3(b) of the United States Housing \n     Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(4)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and any amounts'' and inserting ``, any \n     amounts'';\n       (2) by striking ``or any deferred'' and inserting ``, any \n     deferred''; and\n       (3) by inserting after ``prospective monthly amounts'' the \n     following: ``, and any expenses related to aid and attendance \n     as detailed under section 1521 of title 38, United States \n     Code''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. \nCarolyn B. Maloney) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 \nlegislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and add \nextraneous materials on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 1816, the Vulnerable \nVeterans Housing Reform Act of 2015. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport its passage.\n  H.R. 1816, legislation that has been long championed by the gentleman \nfrom Nevada (Mr. Heck), is designed to help some of our Nation's \ngreatest heroes, our disabled veterans, better afford the housing and \nmedical care they desperately need.\n\n[[Page H3265]]\n\n  To do so, H.R. 1816 would change how the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development calculates a disabled veteran's income for its \nSection 8 and public housing programs by exempting their service-\nrelated disability benefits and expenses related to in-home care. In \nother words, right now HUD is counting the aid and attendance \ndisability payments of those heroes as income that could pay for \nhousing, when it really should only be used to pay for their medical \ncare.\n  CBO has estimated there are about 2,000 veterans that would be \nimpacted by this change. This legislation will ensure that we don't \npunish low-income disabled veterans who are seeking or receiving \nhousing assistance simply because of the disability benefits.\n  Fixing the income calculation of disabled veterans is not only a \nmatter of fairness, it is also a matter of common sense. Many of these \ndisabled veterans require extensive care and assistance to perform \nbasic daily functions such as bathing, eating, and dressing. These aid \nand attendance payments are designed only to cover the costs of the in-\nhome care they require to meet those needs, and it is wrong to ask \nthese veterans to use that money for any other purpose.\n  The housing challenges faced by disabled veterans are great, and I \ncommend Mr. Heck for his hard work to bring this issue and an \nappropriate fix for it to our attention.\n  I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Heck for his leadership on this bill. As a \nformer veteran, he has a deep understanding of these issues. I also \nthank Mr. Luetkemeyer, who is the chair of our Subcommittee on Housing \nand Insurance and one of our most active members on the committee, \nhaving served not only as a community banker, but as a community \nregulator.\n  I am very pleased to rise in strong bipartisan support of H.R. 1816, \nthe Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act of 2015. This bill will \nbring a measure of fairness to our government's treatment of severely \ndisabled veterans. The bill excludes the payments that disabled \nveterans receive for in-home aid and attendance from being considered \nas income when determining their eligibility for HUD housing \nassistance.\n  Under current law, these in-home aid and attendance payments are \nwrongly counted as disposable income, which makes it harder for \ndisabled veterans who receive these payments to qualify for the Federal \nhousing assistance which they deserve. These payments are absolutely \nnot disposable income; rather, they are payments that are medically \nnecessary to enable disabled veterans to perform everyday functions, \nfunctions that, if not for their extraordinary sacrifice, would not \nrequire in-home aid payments in the first place.\n  Thousands of veterans across our country are unable to qualify for \nFederal housing assistance, such as Section 8 rental assistance, \nbecause these payments are improperly counted as income. Let's be \nclear. These are veterans who have suffered life-changing injuries and \nwho are now severely disabled as a result of their service to our \ncountry. It is their service and their sacrifice made in the name of \npeace and freedom that have made this the great Nation that it is \ntoday.\n  For our great Nation to turn around and make it harder for these \nveterans because of their service-related disabilities to qualify for \nhousing assistance is grossly unfair and something that should be \nswiftly rectified. That is what this bill does. It rights a wrong in \nour Federal housing policy and gives the veterans the respect and \nsupport that they deserve.\n  I applaud my colleague, Mr. Heck, who has served this country as a \nveteran. For three times, he has brought this bill to this floor. It \nhas passed on suspension three times. I really applaud his persistence \nin pursuing this commonsense fix that will help thousands of veterans \nthat deserve the aid and the assistance from HUD to rightfully get it. \nI urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I now yield such time as he may consume \nto the distinguished gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heck), the sponsor of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. HECK of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from \nMissouri and the gentlewoman from New York for their support.\n  I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support the bipartisan \nH.R. 1816, the Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act of 2015. This \nbill would remove an unnecessary barrier that prevents our disabled \nwartime veterans from receiving the housing assistance they so \ncritically need.\n  This body recognized the importance of this issue when it unanimously \npassed substantially similar bills, H.R. 6361 and H.R. 1742, during the \n112th and 113th Congresses. Unfortunately, these bills were not \nconsidered by the Senate. I am hoping the third time is the charm.\n\n  Quite simply, H.R. 1816 prevents the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment from considering a veteran's aid and attendance benefits as \nincome when calculating their eligibility for housing assistance. The \naid and attendance benefit is an enhanced pension provided by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to our Nation's wartime veterans who are \nseverely disabled and have little or no income.\n  Veterans eligible for this benefit are those requiring the aid of \nanother person in order to perform their activities of daily living, \nsuch as bathing, eating, adjusting prosthetic devices, or protecting \nthemselves from the hazards of their daily environment.\n  In order to receive this benefit, our severely disabled veterans must \nfirst establish their eligibility for a low-income pension, which \nrequires an annual adjusted gross income of less than $12,868 for a \nsingle veteran with no dependents. Once eligibility is determined, low-\nincome disabled vets can receive roughly an additional $8,600 in aid \nand attendance benefits annually to help defray the cost of their \nmedical care. This is an important point. This aid and attendance \nbenefit is for medical care. It is not discretionary income; it is not \nfor groceries; it is not for transportation, utilities, or anything \nelse.\n  As you can imagine, these low-income veterans struggle daily to keep \nthe lights on, put food on the table, and keep a roof over their heads. \nAdd to that the exorbitant cost of paying for a personal care \nattendant, and it becomes increasingly difficult for them to stay in \ntheir homes.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development operates a number of \nprograms that can assist these veterans. However, current regulations \nrequire that the aid and attendance benefit be counted as income when \ndetermining eligibility for housing assistance. Mr. Speaker, this makes \nno sense.\n  The VA provides this benefit to ensure that our low-income disabled \nwartime vets have the necessary resources to receive the medical care \nthey need and have earned. Now, while $8600 per year may seem like a \nsubstantial amount of money, it doesn't fully cover the cost of a full-\ntime aide but is much more cost effective than a nursing home or \nassisted living facility. The median annual cost for a licensed home \nhealth aide in 2014 was about $19,000. The cost of an assisted living \nfacility was $42,000, and the median cost of a room in a nursing home \nis about $80,000 annually. So continuing to count the aid and \nattendance benefit as income does nothing more than to reduce the \nhousing assistance available to our low-income disabled vets and \njeopardizes their ability to live independently.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is the stated goal of both this House and this \nadministration to reduce homelessness in our veterans population. The \nneed for this legislative fix is just as strong today as it was last \nCongress and the Congress before that. Most recent statistics from the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development indicate that approximately \n50,000 veterans are homeless, and we certainly don't want to add to \nthat number.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1816 will go a long way towards preventing \nadditional homelessness for our Nation's veterans. I urge my colleagues \nto support this critical legislation.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no further \nrequests for time, and I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I want to underscore a point that Congressman Heck made that so many\n\n[[Page H3266]]\n\nof our veterans become homeless, and it is a huge problem across this \ncountry. By passing this bill, we will enable more veterans to stay in \ntheir homes and to have the respect and dignity that they deserve.\n  This is a commonsense bill. It has passed this body two times before, \nalmost unanimously. I hope that, as Mr. Heck said, the third time is \nthe charm and that we will finally get this through the Senate. It is \nwell deserved and long overdue. I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support this fair and commonsense proposal that will help \nour veterans.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished lady \nfrom New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for her fine work on this bill \nand for her strong support. I also want to thank the sponsor of the \nbill, the distinguished gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heck), for again \nbringing this to our attention and again attempting to right a wrong \nhere. This is certainly something we certainly need to support and will \ndo. I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1816, as amended\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3266-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3266-H3284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1700\n             JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

This threat must be fought \n     with trained personnel and highly specialized counter-child-\n     exploitation strategies and technologies.\n       (3) The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n     of the Department of Homeland Security serves a critical \n     national security role in protecting the United States from \n     the growing international threat of child exploitation and \n     human trafficking.\n       (4) The Cyber Crimes Center of the United States \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a vital national \n     resource in the effort to combat international child \n     exploitation, providing advanced expertise and assistance in \n     investigations, computer forensics, and victim \n     identification.\n       (5) The returning military heroes of the United States \n     possess unique and valuable skills that can assist law \n     enforcement in combating global sexual and child \n     exploitation, and the Department of Homeland Security should \n     use this national resource to the maximum extent possible.\n       (6) Through the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative (HERO) \n     Child Rescue Corps program, the returning military heroes of \n     the United States are trained and hired to investigate crimes \n     of child exploitation in order to target predators and rescue \n     children from sexual abuse and slavery.\n       (b) Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Investigations \n     Unit, and Computer Forensics Unit.--\n       (1) In general.--Subtitle H of title VIII of the Homeland \n     Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.\n\n[[Page H3273]]\n\n     451 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 890A.

(commonly \n     referred to as the ``STOP Violence Against Women Formula \n     Grant Program''); or\n       (B) section 41601 of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 \n     (42 U.S.C. 14043g) (commonly referred to as the ``Sexual \n     Assault Services Program'').\n       (2) Termination.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``termination'' means, when used \n     with respect to parental rights, a complete and final \n     termination of the parent's right to custody of, guardianship \n     of, visitation with, access to, and inheritance from a child.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     be construed to require a State, in order to receive an \n     increase in the amount provided to the State under the \n     covered formula grants under this title, to have in place a \n     law that terminates any obligation of a person who fathered a \n     child through rape to support the child.\n\n     SEC. 403. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Men who father children through rape should be \n     prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children.\n       (2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in \n     the United States.\n       (3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their \n     child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face \n     custody battles with their rapists.\n       (4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious \n     crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in \n     less than 5 percent of rapes.\n       (5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most \n     common standard for termination of parental rights among the \n     50 States, territories, and the District of Columbia.\n       (6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and \n     convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for \n     allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in \n     Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)).\n       (7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape \n     survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights \n     of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the \n     child was conceived through rape.\n       (8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the \n     survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which \n     can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and \n     can make it more difficult for her to recover.\n       (9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely \n     negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child.\n       (10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or \n     parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting \n     rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them.\n\n     SEC. 404. INCREASED FUNDING FOR FORMULA GRANTS AUTHORIZED.\n\n       The Attorney General shall increase the amount provided to \n     a State under the covered formula grants in accordance with \n     this title if the State has in place a law that allows the \n     mother of any child that was conceived through rape to seek \n     court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her \n     rapist with regard to that child, which the court is \n     authorized to grant upon clear and convincing evidence of \n     rape.\n\n     SEC. 405. APPLICATION.\n\n       A State seeking an increase in the amount provided to the \n     State under the covered formula grants shall include in the \n     application of the State for each covered formula grant such \n     information as the Attorney General may reasonably require, \n     including information about the law described in section 404.\n\n     SEC. 406. GRANT INCREASE.\n\n       The amount of the increase provided to a State under the \n     covered formula grants under this title shall be equal to not \n     more than 10 percent of the average of the total amount of \n     funding provided to the State under the covered formula \n     grants under the 3 most recent awards to the State.\n\n     SEC. 407. PERIOD OF INCREASE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide an \n     increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered \n     formula grants under this title for a 2-year period.\n       (b) Limit.--The Attorney General may not provide an \n     increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered \n     formula grants under this title more than 4 times.\n\n     SEC. 408. ALLOCATION OF INCREASED FORMULA GRANT FUNDS.\n\n       The Attorney General shall allocate an increase in the \n     amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants \n     under this title such that--\n       (1) 25 percent the amount of the increase is provided under \n     the program described in section 402(1)(A); and\n       (2) 75 percent the amount of the increase is provided under \n     the program described in section 402(1)(B).\n\n     SEC. 409. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     title $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019.\n\n                TITLE V--MILITARY SEX OFFENDER REPORTING\n\n     SEC. 501.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson \nLee) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on S. 178, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We are here today to consider comprehensive legislation that will \nhelp address the scourge of human trafficking, generally, and child sex \ntrafficking, specifically, that is occurring in every corner of the \nUnited States as we stand here today.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, sex trafficking is \nthe fastest growing business of organized crime and the third largest \ncriminal enterprise in the world. One organization estimates that child \nsex trafficking in the United States alone is a $9.8 billion industry.\n  Criminal organizations, including some of the most violent criminal \nstreet gangs like MS-13, have realized that selling children can be \nmore profitable than selling drugs. This is because drugs are only sold \nonce, but minor children can be and are prostituted multiple times a \nday, every day. It is time for Congress to send a clear message that we \nwon't stand for this.\n  Today marks the third time that I have stood on the House floor \nurging the passage of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. The \nHouse passed similar legislation in May 2014 and, again, in January of \nthis year.\n  S. 178, the bill we consider today and its predecessors, are \ncomprehensive legislation that, among other things, provide additional \nresources to law enforcement and service providers through a victim-\ncentered grant program, help to facilitate investigations by providing \nthat child sex trafficking and other similar crimes are predicate \noffenses for State wiretap applications, address the demand side by \nclarifying that it is a Federal crime to solicit or patronize child \nprostitutes or adult victims forced into prostitution, and strengthens \nthe existing Federal criminal laws against trafficking through a number \nof clarifying amendments.\n  I am very pleased that a number of separate trafficking vehicles that \nwere originally passed by the House Judiciary Committee and then by the \nfull House are contained within S. 178, including the Stop Exploitation \nThrough Trafficking Act of 2015, introduced by Mr. Paulsen of \nMinnesota; the SAVE Act of 2015, introduced by Mrs. Wagner of Missouri; \nand the Human Trafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act of \n2015, introduced by Mrs. Noem of South Dakota. I thank all of my \ncolleagues for their dedication to ending this terrible crime.\n  I also thank Judge Poe of Texas for sponsoring the two previous House \nversions of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.\n  S. 178 is not perfect legislation, and I thank both House and Senate \nleadership, as well as the bill's sponsor, Senator Cornyn, for agreeing \nto fix technical issues with the bill in future legislation, but it is \nmy belief that this legislation will do much good in the fight to end \nhuman trafficking.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the bill and thus \nsend it to the President to be signed into law.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Let me join my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and thank him for his leadership in making sure that this \nbill would come to the floor. Along with the ranking member, Mr. \nConyers; subcommittee chairman, Mr. Sensenbrenner; and myself as the \nranking member, we are grateful for the leadership of our colleagues in \nworking through the human trafficking legislation.\n  I would associate myself with the words that all of us have said very \noften. Tragically and heinously, sex trafficking, human trafficking, \nand the trafficking of children keeps on giving in an ugly, horrible, \ndisastrous way that ruins the lives of innocent victims for they are \nused over and over again.\n  I stand here recognizing that Houston ranks very high among those \ncities that have the scourge of human trafficking. In fact, as I rise \nto support S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, \nI recognize that human trafficking is a scourge that impacts greatly on \nmy home district in Houston, Texas. Houston currently ranks number one \namong the U.S. cities with the most victims of human trafficking.\n  On the House bill, I congratulate Congressman Poe, my neighbor in \nHouston, and Carolyn Maloney, a member from New York, who worked \ntogether to bring about this bipartisan legislation.\n  I want to thank my colleagues as well from the Homeland Security \nCommittee. Judge Poe joined us in the first human trafficking hearing \nthat I held in Houston, Texas, to further emphasize the coming together \nof law enforcement and social service advocates for the importance of \nthis legislation.\n  In fact, as I recall this bill being written, there were so many \ndifferent groups from faith organizations putting on walks to talk \nabout trafficking. Houston recognized that they had a problem they need \nto fix.\n  In the backdrop of this legislation, as it was making its way through \nthe House, we even had a massive human trafficking raid, if you will, \nwhere there were 20 to 30 persons in a home just a short distance from \ndowntown. A couple of the individuals were minors. We know what their \nend would be.\n  Twenty-five percent of all human trafficking victims are in my home \nState of Texas. Currently, 30 percent of all human trafficking tips to \nthe national rescue hotline come from Texas; but this is a national \nproblem. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \nestimates that one of every seven endangered runaways reported to the \ncenter are likely victims of minor sex trafficking and that at least \n100,000 American children are victims of sex trafficking each year.\n\n  It is our duty to rescue these children, shelter them, and help them \nrecover from the trauma that has been inflicted upon them. It is also \nour duty to prevent those crimes before they happen and to provide law \nenforcement with the tools they need to combat human traffickers.\n  This bill will be a significant weapon in the war against sex \ntrafficking which, unfortunately, is the fastest growing business of \norganized crime in the United States, generating an estimated $9 \nbillion annually. Mr. Speaker, we have said it continues to generate \nincome and revenue.\n  I am very glad that there are a number of legislative initiatives \nincorporated into this final legislative document and that this will go \nto the President's desk and be signed.\n  I am glad it includes language I submitted in the Judiciary Committee \nthat puts Congress squarely on the record in the sense of Congress, \nthat we stand together on the issue of opposing human trafficking and \nviewing it as a dastardly deed.\n  Although not perfect, this is a comprehensive bill that includes a \nvariety of measures intended to strike at the problem of child sex \ntrafficking through prevention, law enforcement, and rehabilitation \nservices for victims.\n  What I like most of all is that it puts the United States Congress \nand, ultimately, the President of the United States and the laws of the \nland on the side of children and on the side of victims who have been \ntrafficked or victims of sex trafficking. The bill strikes at the \ndemand for this business by adding criminal prohibitions for those who \nsolicit and advertise human trafficking.\n  Law enforcement across the U.S. has identified online sex acts as the \nnumber one platform for buying and selling of sex with children and \nyoung women.\n\n[[Page H3278]]\n\nThese men can sit idly and relaxed in their homes and victimize \nindividuals. This is an important step forward for law enforcement, to \nhave the tools to reach those predators wherever they are.\n  This legislation provides the tools to rebuild the lives of those \nexploited by this business, and it specifically addresses the needs of \nthousands of homeless children, many of whom are on the streets of \nHouston. I say to them today that they will be embraced with a document \nthat stands on their side, many who have fled physically and sexually \nabusive homes, only to be victimized again by sex traffickers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that this bill is moving, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my pleasure to yield \n5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), a member of the \nJudiciary Committee and a champion in the fight against child sex \ntrafficking and the author of one of the underlying pieces of \nlegislation that led to the bill that we are considering here today.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for bringing this legislation \npromptly to the House floor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, it was 155 years ago that this Nation debated in this \nChamber several volatile issues, including slavery. After 600,000 \nAmericans, both from the North and the South, died in war, slavery was \nforever banned by the 13th Amendment to our Constitution.\n  Now, in our time, this ugly scourge has risen its head again one more \ntime. The evil enterprise has taken on the enslavement of women and \nchildren. Traffickers--slave masters--buy and sell the young in the \nmarketplace of child sex exploitation.\n  They treat these victims as cattle to be led to the stockyards of \nslavery. The traffickers even brand the victims, Mr. Speaker, on the \nneck so that other traffickers will know whose property they are.\n  The illicit revenue from trafficking is second only to the drug \ntrade; and, as has been mentioned, my hometown of Houston seems to be \nthe hub for child sex trafficking in United States.\n  The average age of the minor sex traffic victim, Mr. Speaker, is 13. \nMaria was an 11-year-old girl. She met a person that treated her \nnicely. He was an older male. Traffickers, Mr. Speaker, do not wear \nlong trench coats. They are relatively young, good-looking guys.\n  He enticed her; he brought her some presents; he took her to his \nhome, and then she became a slave. At 11 years old, she was sold on the \nmarketplace for a long time, until she was able to escape the \ntraffickers. That is what is taking place in our country.\n  Today, unlike 155 years ago, this Congress is united in stopping this \ncurse of slavery. Ten bills dealing with sex trafficking overwhelmingly \npassed the House of Representatives. One of those was one that I \nsponsored, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, along with \nCarolyn Maloney, who is here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are all bipartisan pieces of legislation, and you \ndon't get much more bipartisan than Carolyn Maloney from New York and \nTed Poe from Texas agreeing. We are only separated, as Churchill said, \nby a common language. I want to thank her for her hard work for years \non the issue of trafficking. The Senate combined these 10 bills, made \nsome positive changes, and their bill passed the Senate 99-0.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act goes after the \ntrafficker--the slave master, the slaveholder. It treats the child as a \nvictim and not as a criminal and not as a child prostitute. It rescues \nthe victim, and it targets the demand--the buyer, the child abuser--\nthat buys these children for pleasure.\n\n  This legislation also allows Federal judges to impose not only prison \nfor these criminals, but may order that fees go into a fund. That fund \ncan be used for victims' services and even training for peace officers. \nMake these criminals pay the rent on the courthouse and pay for the \nsystem that they have created.\n  I want to thank all those that have been involved in these numerous \nissues. I especially want to thank the ladies of the House of \nRepresentatives on both sides for bringing this issue to a vote today. \nThey are very powerful, Mr. Speaker, on this issue. They deserve \nrecognition.\n  I also want to commend Senator Cornyn for the legislation he pushed \nforward--the original bill that we are voting on today--in the Senate \nof the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, America can no longer deny the inconvenient truth of sex \ntrafficking. The enslavement of children is not acceptable, and it will \nnot be tolerated. It will not be tolerated in this country, and it is \nnot going to be tolerated in other countries as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the Record a letter sent by 163 \ndifferent organizations in support of this legislation.\n\n                                                   April 29, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader Pelosi: We are an \n     alliance of organizations and individual advocates from \n     across the United States dedicated to improving the lives of \n     vulnerable women and children. We write to express our \n     support for the Senate anti-trafficking package, the Justice \n     for Victims of Trafficking Act, as amended, S. 178 (JVTA \n     package) recently voted out of the Senate unanimously. This \n     package, which includes nearly all of the trafficking bills \n     passed overwhelmingly by the House in January, would provide \n     much needed services to victims of human trafficking and help \n     ensure that child victims ensnared in the sex trade are no \n     longer arrested and treated as criminals.\n       According to the FBI, over 80 percent of all confirmed sex \n     trafficking cases in the U.S. involve U.S. citizens, yet \n     across the country, victims still lack basic necessities. \n     Simply stated, there are more animal shelters in our country \n     than programs or beds for victims of trafficking. This \n     critical legislation provides unprecedented support to \n     victims, who for too long have endured arrest, imprisonment, \n     and stigma for their victimization instead of support and \n     services. The Senate package contains critical funding for \n     housing and services--a crucial element the House companion \n     lacks. Moreover, the legislation supports training for \n     federal prosecutors and judges on the importance of \n     requesting and ordering restitution, so that victims can \n     receive the compensation they are rightly owed by law.\n       Every day in this country, thousands of women and children \n     are bought and sold. The unfettered demand for sex has caused \n     pimps and exploiters to resort to more extreme tactics in \n     order to meet exploding demand. The JVTA package directs the \n     Department of Justice to incorporate strategies for reducing \n     demand into anti-trafficking training programs and sting \n     operations, including Innocence Lost. Women and children, \n     especially girls, are advertised online where buyers purchase \n     them with ease and anonymity. This happens in every city, in \n     every state. The JVTA package would help fight online \n     exploitation and work to bring buyers of child sex to \n     justice. It creates a new partnership with wounded warriors, \n     training them to serve as online investigators of child \n     pornography and exploitation.\n       Advocates know: this is the most comprehensive and \n     thoughtful piece of anti-trafficking legislation in years. \n     The JVTA package represents a tremendous bipartisan effort to \n     provide necessary support and protections for our victims of \n     human trafficking, and at long last ends the culture of \n     impunity for those who purchase our most vulnerable for sex. \n     But these victims have waited too long. After several years \n     of advocacy and over a month of delay on the Senate side, we \n     are just one step away from providing this population with \n     justice and healing.\n       As leaders in the anti-trafficking, anti-violence, faith-\n     based, child welfare, law enforcement, and human rights \n     movements, we urge the House to take up and pass this vital \n     legislation without delay.\n           Sincerely,\n       Human Rights Project for Girls (Rights4Girls); National \n     Domestic Violence Hotline; Coalition Against Trafficking in \n     Women (CATW); Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN); \n     ECPAT-USA; Girls Inc.; Shared Hope International; Equality \n     Now; National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges \n     (NCJFCJ); National Association of Police Organizations \n     (NAPO); National Alliance to End Sexual Violence; New York \n     State Coalition Against Sexual Assault; Washington Coalition \n     of Sexual Assault Services; Utah Coalition Against Sexual \n     Assault; Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic \n     Violence; Florida Council Against Sexual Violence; New \n     Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic & Sexual Violence; Ohio \n     Alliance to End Sexual Violence.\n       Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault; Connecticut \n     Sexual Assault Crisis Services; National Children's Alliance \n     (NCA); Jewish Women International (JWI); Children's Advocacy \n     Institute; National Association of Counsel for Children; \n     Courtney's House, survivor-led service provider; PROTECT; \n     First Focus Campaign for Children; Franciscan Action Network; \n     Breaking Free, survivor-led service provider; The \n     Organization for Prostitution Survivors; Religious Sisters of \n     Charity; Sanctuary for Families; Maryknoll Sisters of St. \n     Dominic.\n\n[[Page H3279]]\n\n       Dominican Sisters of Peace; DC Rape Crisis Center; \n     Congregation of St. Joseph; Religious of the Sacred Heart; \n     Survivors for Solutions, survivor-led service provider; \n     YouthSpark; Poverty Elimination and Community Action (PEACE) \n     Foundation; Providence House Inc.; Freedom From Exploitation; \n     Society of the Holy Child Jesus, American Province; Sisters \n     of Mercy; Second Life of Chattanooga; Girls Inc. of the \n     Pacific Northwest; Advocacy for Justice and Peace Committee \n     of the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia; Naomi Project; \n     YWCA National Capital Area; U.S. Fund for UNICEF.\n       National Center for Youth Law (NYCL); Christ United \n     Methodist Church; ENC Stop Human Trafficking; Sisters of St. \n     Joseph CA; W.

America's kids, Mr. Speaker, are not for sale.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great privilege to yield 5 \nminutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. \nMaloney), whom I have worked with over the years on issues dealing with \nwomen's rights and the abuse and misuse of children and certainly her \nwork on the issues of sexual abuse and sex trafficking of children and \nwomen.\n  Congresswoman Maloney is a member of the Financial Services Committee \nand an original cosponsor, along with Congressman Poe, of this \nlegislation in the House.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong \nsupport of the Senate-passed Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.\n  I commend the ranking member for the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations for her hard work on \nthis bill and so many others and on this issue, and to Chairman \nGoodlatte and the leadership for bringing this bill swiftly to the \nfloor.\n  I particularly applaud the efforts of Congressman Poe, who, as a \nformer judge and prosecutor, brought a keen understanding and passion \nto moving this bill forward. For well over 10 years, I have worked on \ntrying to pass legislation that focused on the demand side of sex \ntrafficking. It is only by going after the demand side that you will \never make a dent in protecting these young girls and boys. With his \nleadership, he brought new life and focus to getting this passed, and I \ncannot thank him enough. I truly believe that this bill will save \nlives.\n  I am so pleased that Democrats and Republicans have come together, as \nwe have historically done, in efforts to combat human slavery, human \ntrafficking, and to bring forward a bill to help victims of this \nmodern-day form of slavery.\n  This bill cracks down on traffickers and provides resources to \ntrafficking survivors. There are an estimated 21 million victims around \nthe world today, including in all 50 States, being sold for sex and \nslave labor.\n  Business is very good for some very bad people. Every year, sex \ntrafficking yields well over $9 billion in illegal profits. But unlike \nguns and dope that can only be sold once, the human body can be sold \nover and over again, usually until they die. This legislation starts to \nput a dent in those profits by levying fines on convicted traffickers \nand using the money to create the domestic trafficking victims fund.\n  This is appropriate justice. Traffickers are forced to pay for \nrehabilitative services for the girls, boys, men, women, and children \nwhom they have victimized and profited from.\n  But we have to capture these criminals first, and perpetrators too \neasily have slipped through the cracks. In fact, trafficking victims \nare commonly charged with prostitution, while their pimps and johns and \ntraffickers are never held accountable for their terrible crimes.\n  This bill will flip that equation by giving law enforcement tools to \nhelp victims, and new powers and resources to identify, arrest, and \nprosecute buyers and sellers of sex with minor children, pornography, \nslave labor, and other forms of sex and labor trafficking. This will \nclarify, once and for all, that traffickers and johns and pimps are the \ntrue criminals in sex trafficking because, make no mistake, \nprostitution is not, and never has been, what has often been called a \nvictimless crime.\n  Patronizing a trafficked individual is not a casual act of sex; it is \na criminal act of rape. Stiffening penalties and levying fines on \nperpetrators of these terrible crimes can start to decrease demand and \nput the people who buy and sell children behind bars, protecting other \nchildren from being hurt and destroyed--put them behind bars, where \nthey belong.\n  This bill also enables victims and survivors to get the help that \nthey deserve. Most trafficked individuals have multiple encounters with \nlaw enforcement while enslaved, but police are not sufficiently \nequipped to identify them. To that end, the bill also provides support \nfor law enforcement to better identify and serve trafficking victims. \nThese are victims who need help, not culprits to lock up while their \ntraffickers and pimps go free.\n  We cannot afford to miss opportunities to recognize a trafficked \nvictim when he or she walks into the police station or hospital or \nlocal clinic. And there must be protocols, such as those called for in \nthis bill, in place to ensure their safety and not to treat them as the \ncriminals.\n  This bill provides a comprehensive approach to address these issues \nand to banish this horrific crime from the United States of America. I \nurge Congress to act right away so victims need wait no longer for \njustice and the critical services and resources that they so \ndesperately deserve. I urge complete\n\n[[Page H3280]]\n\nbipartisan support for this bill. It is long overdue, and it will give \na better future for those who have survived the worst crime in the \nworld.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. This bill is so critically \nimportant. Of all the bills that we have passed--and this body, in a \nbipartisan way, has passed a whole series of bills--this particular one \nhas enforcement, it has prevention, and it has help for the survivors.\n  I applaud everyone who worked on this important piece of legislation, \nand we can't pass it fast enough.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I, too, would like to join the gentleman \nfrom Texas in thanking the gentlewoman from New York for her good work \non this for a long time now, and to thank the ranking member of the \nCrime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee, \nMs. Jackson Lee, for this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. \nWagner), another champion in the fight against sex trafficking, \nparticularly on the Internet.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. I thank the chairman very much for his leadership on \nthis issue and so many others.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 178, the Justice for \nVictims of Trafficking Act, and all of the House-passed human \ntrafficking legislation that was incorporated into this Senate bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, today marks the culmination of a long journey for myself \nand many Members in both Chambers who have worked on this important \nissue. This legislation represents a significant step forward in the \nFederal Government's efforts to combat the scourge of modern-day \nslavery, known as human trafficking. This bill makes enormous progress \nin the fight against trafficking by providing resources to law \nenforcement officials and collecting fees from sex traffickers that go \ninto a new fund for victims.\n\n  It also includes my signature legislation, the SAVE Act, which make \nit illegal to knowingly advertise the victims of human trafficking, \nespecially on the Internet. I thank my friends and colleagues, Senator \nMark Kirk and Dianne Feinstein, for offering the SAVE Act as an \namendment to this very important legislation.\n  Beyond the multiple tools and resources it gives to law enforcement \nand survivors, this legislation also serves an important symbolic \npurpose. This bill symbolizes the longstanding and steadfast commitment \nthat Members of Congress have towards protecting the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society.\n  No longer will the cruel exploitation of women and children be \nallowed to continue unchecked. No longer will sexual predators be \nallowed to torture, rape, and kill young Americans in the name of \nfinancial profit. Mr. Speaker, with this legislation, we are providing \nvoice to the voiceless and advocating for those who cannot advocate for \nthemselves.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of all of the good, bipartisan work done \nby my colleagues here in Congress on this issue of human trafficking. \nYears of work by many of my colleagues, including Representatives Poe, \nSmith, Noem, Paulsen, Beatty, Maloney, and many, many others, Mr. \nSpeaker, have laid the foundation for this long overdue action.\n  I am grateful that many of my colleagues have held events in their \nhome districts to raise awareness and educate the public about human \ntrafficking. Awareness, training, and education are the key to \npreventing this horrible crime from happening in the first place. Young \npeople must be warned about the devious and manipulative strategies \nemployed by traffickers to ensnare them in the trap of sexual slavery.\n  The children at risk are not just school students. Pimps or \ntraffickers are known to prey on victims as young as 9 years old. \nTraffickers may target minor victims through social media Web sites, \nafterschool programs, shopping malls and clubs, and through friends or \nacquaintances who recruit students on school campuses.\n  One of the best ways to combat human trafficking is through \neducation. Many States have successful programs that train school \npersonnel about how to identify the victims. We should work with \nschools to develop policies and protocols and partnerships to address \nand prevent the exploitation of children.\n  Partnership between public and private sectors is the key to \ncombating human trafficking. Many times, frontline employees in the \ntransportation and hospitality industry are the ones best suited to \nidentify trafficking victims or their predators. Increased awareness \nand training will lead to more victims being identified, which is the \ncritical step in breaking the cycle of exploitation and victimization.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation and \nall efforts to combat human trafficking, and I look forward to \ncontinuing this work in the House of Representatives, and this Congress \nas a whole, for years to come.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Smith), a great advocate for human rights here in the \nHouse.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. \n178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, a \ncomprehensive bill authored by Senator Cornyn, with input from many.\n  This extremely important legislation includes numerous bipartisan \nbills passed by the House earlier this year under the extraordinary \nleadership of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Conference Chair Cathy \nMcMorris Rodgers, and our own good chairman, Bob Goodlatte.\n  When enacted into law, S. 178 will provide powerful new tools in the \nstruggle to abolish modern-day slavery, including a domestic \ntrafficking victims fund designed to provide assistance to victims of \nhuman trafficking and grants to States and localities funded by a \n$5,000 penalty assessed on convicted offenders.\n  The bill seeks to protect runaways from the horror of trafficking, \nstrengthen the child welfare agency response, aid victims of child \npornography, and criminalize advertisement for the commercial \nexploitation of children.\n  Each year, Mr. Speaker, as you know, there are approximately 100,000 \nAmerican children, mostly runaways, trafficked in the U.S. The average \nage of initial enslavement is 13.\n  These children, when found, are often charged with prostitution, \nfined, or put in juvenile detention, where there are, or should be, \nother options available. These children, mostly young girls, need to be \nprotected and cared for and treated with compassion and respect, not \nprosecution. The pending bill moves us towards this goal.\n  Indeed, title VI authorizes DOJ to give preferential treatment in \nawarding public safety and community-oriented police grants to an \napplicant from a State that treats a minor engaged in commercial sex as \na victim.\n  Title VII was inspired by a groundbreaking study conducted by Laura \nLederer and funded by several foundations, including the Charlotte \nLozier Institute, that found that approximately 88 percent of domestic \ntrafficking victims ``had contact with a health care provider while \nbeing trafficked, with the most common being a hospital'' or a hospital \nemergency room, almost 64 percent.\n  Situation awareness coupled with best practices will, without a \ndoubt, help victims escape from this cruelty to freedom and protection.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 178--the Justice for \nVictims of Trafficking Act of 2015--a comprehensive bill authored by \nSenator Cornyn, with input from many.\n  This extremely important legislation includes numerous bipartisan \nbills passed by the House earlier this year under the extraordinary \nleadership of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Conference Chair Cathy \nMcMorris Rodgers and Chairman Goodlatte.\n  When enacted into law, S. 178 will provide powerful new tools in the \nstruggle to abolish modern day slavery including a Domestic Trafficking \nVictims Fund designed to provide assistance to victims of human \ntrafficking and grants to states and localities funded by a $5,000 \npenalty assessed on convicted offenders.\n  The bill seeks to protect runaways from the horror of human \ntrafficking, strengthen the\n\n[[Page H3281]]\n\nchild welfare agency response, aid victims of child pornography, \ncriminalize advertisement for the commercial exploitation of children, \nand beefs up the Departments of Homeland Security, Defense and HHS' \nanti-human trafficking activities.\n  Each year there are approximately 100,000 American children, mostly \nrunaways, trafficked in the U.S. The average age of initial enslavement \nis 13 years old.\n  These children, when found, are often charged for prostitution, fined \nor put in juvenile detention, when there are--or should be--other \noptions available. These children, mostly young girls, need to be \nprotected and cared for and treated with compassion and respect--not \nprosecuted. The pending bill moves us toward this goal.\n  Indeed, Title VI authorizes DOJ to give preferential treatment in \nawarding public safety and community oriented police grants to an \napplicant from a state that treats a minor engaged in commercial sex as \na victim--because that is what they are and that's already federal law \ndue to the TVPA of 2000.\n  Title VII of S. 178 was inspired by a groundbreaking study conducted \nby Laura Lederer and funded by several foundations, including the \nCharlotte Lozier Institute, that found approximately 88 percent of \ndomestic trafficking victims ``had contact with a health care provider \nwhile being trafficked with the most common contact being a hospital/ER \n(63.3%).''\n  Situation awareness coupled with best practices will without a doubt \nhelp victims escape to freedom and protection.\n  So, in response, Title VII requires HRSA to award a competitive grant \nto an eligible entity to design and implement a pilot program utilizing \nevidence-based best practices to train health care professionals to \nrecognize trafficking victims and respond effectively.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, anti-human trafficking bills are often \ndifficult to pass. When I first introduced the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act, in 1998, the legislation was met with a wall of \nskepticism and opposition. People both inside of government and out \nthought the bold new legislation that included sheltering, asylum, and \nsignificant protections for the victims long jail sentences and asset \nconfiscation for the traffickers, and tough sanctions for governments \nthat failed to meet minimum standards was merely a solution in search \nof a problem.\n  So as the prime author of the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection \nAct of 2000 as well as reauthorizations of that law in 2003 and 2005, I \nbelieve the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act will further prevent \nthe horrific crime of human trafficking, protect and assist victims, \nand aid in the prosecution of those who exploit and abuse.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining on \neach side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 5\\3/4\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Texas has 9\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Paulsen), who has also contributed one of the pieces of \nlegislation included in this effort, and I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the chairman and the \nranking member for their leadership on combating this issue because \ntoday is a very important moment in the fight against modern-day \nslavery.\n  For several years, members of both parties have been working \ndiligently with law enforcement, with victims, with social service \nproviders and policy experts to end the sale and victimization of \ninnocent girls. This bill today is the culmination now of all the \ninitiatives previously passed in the House that will increase penalties \nfor pimps and johns, that will enhance the Federal Government's \nresponse to trafficking, that will increase cooperation with \ngovernments overseas, and it will go after the Web sites that aid in \nthe trafficking of minors.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  I am pleased that this package also includes my legislation, the safe \nharbor legislation, that ensures that we will be treating minors who \nare trafficked as victims, rather than as criminals, and improve the \nservices that they receive.\n  Mr. Speaker, the traffickers that we see today, they use every tool \nthey can use to keep victims silent and under their control, whether it \nis by using threats, violence, drugs, or deception.\n  And trafficking victims all share one thing in common: it is a loss \nof freedom and a loss of the ability to speak out. Today we stand with \nthese victims to bring them out of the shadows and say, enough is \nenough, because our girls are not for sale.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the Members who have spoken and highlighted a number of \npoints that I want to reinforce.\n  I want to reinforce what my good friend from New York (Mrs. Carolyn \nB. Maloney) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) have said: that we \nare now looking the pimps and the johns straight in the eye and really \nfocusing on demand. But connected to demand are those lives, those \nlives that we want to restore and give them a new opportunity in life. \nWe want them to not be bruised. We want them to have the ability to \nrestore their lives as young as under 10, 11, or 12, teenagers or young \nwomen.\n  This particular legislation, which I want to highlight, promotes \nrehabilitation by encouraging the development of specialized court \nprograms for victims of child human trafficking.\n  As the chair of the Children's Caucus, I realize how vulnerable our \nchildren are all over the world. And what I am most interested in is \nthe outpatient treatment, life skills training, housing placement, \nvocational training, education, family support services, and job \nplacement.\n  When you find a homeless teen or one who has been victimized, they \nare empty. They are without any substance to know that they have \nsomething of quality to save and to mold and to build. The \nrehabilitation part of this particular legislation--and I do want to \nacknowledge the gentleman from Texas, Senator Cornyn--is a very, very \nimportant part of this legislation.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my pleasure to yield \n1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the legislation \nbefore us to combat human trafficking.\n  Not only would I like to thank the gentleman from Virginia, Chairman \nGoodlatte, and his committee, but I would also especially like to thank \nour senior Senator from the State of Texas, Mr. Cornyn, for his \nleadership in getting this important legislation through the Senate.\n  This bipartisan bill will strengthen our laws against human \ntrafficking, train law enforcement to better target criminals engaged \nin trafficking, and ensure that the victims of human trafficking are \ncared for with compassion.\n  These victims are taken from their homes, enslaved, treated as \nobjects. Human trafficking is a terrible, heinous crime, and its \nvictims are usually voiceless. Today we are their voice, and we are \ntaking action on their behalf.\n  This legislation provides resources and services that help victims to \nbe identified, rescued, and, most importantly, to begin to heal from \nthese traumatic events. S. 178 takes steps that would serve as a model \nfor other nations to follow in combating the inhumane crime of human \ntrafficking.\n  We must do all that we can to restore dignity to its victims and \nbring justice to its perpetrators, and I urge all of my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this important legislation.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of now yielding 4 \nminutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), the \nauthor of H.R. 246 that protects children from being criminalized, \nwhich is included in this bill, and I thank her for her work.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the \nbipartisan Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, S. 178.\n  But first I would like to thank both Chairman Goodlatte of Virginia \nand Ranking Member Conyers of Michigan of the Judiciary Committee for \nbringing this important bill to the floor for consideration. I also \nwould like to thank the gentlewoman from Texas, Congresswoman Sheila \nJackson Lee, for her leadership and for managing the bill today for the \nDemocrats, and a special thank you to the original sponsors.\n  This comprehensive legislation is a major milestone in our efforts to \ncrack down on sex trafficking and to help protect vulnerable children \nacross America.\n  One of my top priorities in the 114th Congress was to pass my \ntrafficking\n\n[[Page H3282]]\n\nbill, H.R. 246, and today's bill includes it and nine other bipartisan \nHouse bills aimed at combating the scourge of human trafficking.\n  I thank Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley of Iowa for \noffering the language of my bill as an amendment during the markup of \nS. 178 to ensure its inclusion in this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, on March 2, 2015, I sat through the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee markup to witness and hear the committee's discussion and \nvote. Today I am proud to stand on this House floor with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, advocating for this legislation that will \nprovide child sex trafficking victims with greater restitution, \njustice, and resources.\n  Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is one of the fastest-growing crimes \nin the world. We have heard that, and it is worth repeating.\n  In fact, according to the United States State Department, human \ntrafficking is the world's second-largest criminal enterprise after the \nillegal drug trade.\n  As we know, it is not just happening in faraway lands. It happens in \nour own backyards.\n  I am proud to have participated and led discussions on preventing \nchild sex trafficking in my district. Last year, I joined a bipartisan \nroundtable discussion to hear firsthand stories and challenges from \nonce child victim Theresa Flores, who is now a national spokesperson \nand best-selling author of ``The Slave Across the Street.''\n  In the United States, some 300,000 children are at risk each year for \ncommercial sexual exploitation. In my home State of Ohio, each year, an \nestimated 1,100 Ohio children become victims of human trafficking, and \nover 3,000 more are at risk.\n  The average age of trafficked victims in the United States is between \n12 and 13 years of age. At this early age, Mr. Speaker, children should \nbe in middle school, making new friends, playing sports, enjoying \nafterschool programs, or just being children.\n  Mr. Speaker, these children deserve better, and today's legislation \nis a much-needed step in that right direction.\n  We know that no single system can successfully combat trafficking. \nPreventing, identifying, and serving victims of trafficking requires a \nmulticoordinated approach across all levels of government as well as \ninput and assistance from nongovernmental entities and the American \npeople.\n  My provision in this bill will update Federal law to include the term \n``child sex trafficking'' to reinforce that children who are trafficked \nshould not be criminalized as prostitutes; instead, treated as victims. \nWe need to ensure people understand that if they report an instance of \nchild sex trafficking, law enforcement is not going to pursue the child \nand prosecute them as a criminal. They are victims.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, let me end by asking and encouraging all \npeople, when they see something, say something.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to support this legislation \nso we may send it to the President's desk for signature, finally \nbringing justice to the tens of thousands of human trafficking victims.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on \neach side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 3\\1/4\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Texas has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, so many important points have been \nmade, and I would just like to quickly summarize by adding my \nappreciation, again, to the sponsors and to the speakers today, \nCongresswoman Maloney and Congresswoman Beatty, and, of course, the \nspeakers of our friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  I want to emphasize something that I think should pierce our hearts, \nwhich is that children should be protected. There are several elements \nthat I think are important to make mention of regarding these children \nbeing protected.\n  One, I would like to acknowledge the responsibilities of the Attorney \nGeneral to create a system to monitor the issuance and enforcement of \nmandatory restitution. Remember, these children have been victimized \nover the years and really have been thrown to foster care or other \nagencies where moneys were not available. These restitution orders will \ncompensate victims not only of human trafficking but also related \nimmigration and child pornography cases. The establishment of a \ndomestic victims fund will also improve the conditions for our \nchildren.\n  We worked on a cybersecurity bill, an important part of this bill \nthat establishes a national cyber crimes center to manage and provide \ndata essential for this effort. It authorizes the U.S. Marshals Service \nto provide assistance to State, local, and other Federal law \nenforcement agencies. It has placed the U.S. Marshals in a very \neffective manner.\n  Let me note the fact that there are mandatory minimums. In a very \nsmall way in this bill, we will be looking at sentencing reformation \nand reform in the following months.\n  What I would say is that our children are enormously important. This \nis a very important bill. And I think it is very important that we move \nthis legislation and view it as an embracing of our children and \nprotecting of our women, standing as a country against the violence of \nsex trafficking and child trafficking.\n  Might I also say that this bill encourages and forces training for \nour law enforcement, something that we view as very important as we are \ngoing forward, to investigate human trafficking as well as training for \nthose essential to our criminal justice system.\n  I might, as I close, indicate that we have finally come full circle \nto be able to stand again on the floor of the House and acknowledge \nthat if you engage in these activities, we will find you wherever you \nare, and we will prosecute you. And the idea that you can hide as a \npimp or a john is no more, and the idea that children are left to their \nown devices after they have been victimized is no more.\n  We look to reunite families, to strengthen families, to provide for \nthese children, and, as my colleague has just said, not to criminalize \nthe children but, tragically, first to restore the victims' lives.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Senate bill, the underlying bill, \nthe bill on the floor of the House. I thank the members of the \nJudiciary Committee of the Senate, the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee here in the House, both the chairman and ranking member, and \nthe members of our committee as we work through this process, and all \nthe Members who put forward outstanding initiatives that are now a part \nof this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is a scourge that greatly impacts on \nmy home district in Houston, Texas. Houston currently ranks #1 among \nU.S. cities with the most victims of human trafficking. Twenty-five \npercent of all human trafficking victims are in my home state of Texas. \nCurrently, thirty percent of all human trafficking tips to the National \nRescue Hotline come from Texas.\n  Obviously, Houston does not shoulder this threat alone. Human \ntrafficking impacts our whole nation. The National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children estimates that one of every seven endangered \nrunaways reported to the Center are likely victims of minor sex \ntrafficking, and that at least 100,000 American children are the \nvictims of sex trafficking each year.\n  It is our duty to rescue these children, shelter them, and help them \nrecover from the trauma that has been inflicted upon them. It is also \nour duty to prevent these crimes before they happen and to provide law \nenforcement with the tools they need to combat human traffickers.\n  This bill will be a significant weapon in the war against sex \ntrafficking, which unfortunately is the fastest growing business of \norganized crime in the United States, generating an estimated $9 \nbillion annually.\n  Although not perfect, S. 178 is a comprehensive bill that includes a \nvariety of measures intended to strike at the problem of child sex \ntrafficking through prevention, law enforcement, and rehabilitation \nservices for victims.\n  This bill addresses the demand for this business by adding criminal \nprohibitions for those who solicit and advertize human trafficking. Law \nenforcement officials across the U.S. have identified online sex ads as \nthe number one platform for the buying and selling of sex with children \nand young women.\n  The legislation provides the tools to rebuild the lives of those \nexploited by this business. It specifically addresses the needs of \nthousands\n\n[[Page H3283]]\n\nof homeless children, many who have fled physically and sexually \nabusive homes, only to be victimized again by sex traffickers.\n  The bill promotes rehabilitation by encouraging the development of \nspecialized court programs for victims of child human trafficking. \nThese court programs will provide: outpatient treatment, life skills \ntraining, housing placement, vocational training, education, family \nsupport services, and job placement.\n  These programs will largely respond to the practical needs of those \nvictimized by human trafficking. It is our duty to provide the tools to \nreclaim these stolen lives.\n  The bill goes further by encouraging through grant programs to the \nStates that establish safe harbors for children who have been victims \nof sex trafficking. These safe harbors play a critical role in \npreventing youth, forced into the sex trade, from being re- victimized \nand stigmatized a second time by the criminal justice system.\n  Mr. Speaker, with this bill we are stating clearly: these children \nare not criminals. They are victims of one of the most heinous types of \ncrime, and they deserve to be rescued and treated so that they may have \nthe opportunity of overcoming their horrendous traumas.\n  The bill also allows victims of sex trafficking with related criminal \ncharges to be eligible for acceptance in Job Corps program, an \nimportant process for reintegration into society.\n  Victims of sex trafficking deserve and need restitution for \nrehabilitation. This bill requires the Attorney General to create a \nsystem to monitor the issuance and enforcement of mandatory restitution \norders. These restitution orders will compensate victims not only of \nhuman trafficking, but also related immigration and child pornography \ncases.\n  The establishment of a Domestic Trafficking Victims Fund will also \nimprove services to children who have been rescued, in the form of \nlong-term rehabilitative services, relief that is long overdue.\n  The requirement to monitor enforcement of restitution orders will in \nturn provide a strong basis for determining the next steps necessary to \nensure that victims are justly compensated for the traumas inflicted on \nthem by their traffickers.\n  The necessary reporting must also identify current gaps in research \nand data. This information will be helpful in formulating effective \nstrategies in deterring children from becoming victims of trafficking. \nIt requires the Government Accountability Office to report on both \nfederal and state enforcement efforts to combat human trafficking and \nthe commercial sexual exploitation of children.\n  The bill provides significant support for law enforcement officers to \nidentify and rescue the victims of human trafficking. The bill \nestablishes a National Cyber Crimes Center to manage and provide data \nessential for this effort. It authorizes the U.S. Marshals Service to \nprovide assistance to state, local, and other federal law enforcement \nagencies in locating and recovering missing children when requested to \ndo so by those agencies.\n  Given the Marshals Service's well-established history, reputation, \nand success in locating missing persons and fugitives, this requirement \nmakes perfect sense.\n  We must not underestimate the task ahead for law enforcement to \neffectively combat human trafficking. In my home state, it is well \nknown to both state and federal officials that Mexican cartels \nfacilitate, control, and benefit from nearly all human smuggling \nactivity along the Texas-Mexico border. As I've already mentioned, \ndomestic human trafficking is a nine billion-dollar business.\n  This legislation provides law enforcement with the tools to prosecute \nthese crimes and to rebuild the lives of those exploited by this \nbusiness\n  S. 178 gives block grants to states to assist law enforcement with \nthe expenses of wiretaps, the use of experts, and essential travel.\n  The legislation requires better coordination between law enforcement \nand a variety of other entities, including: child advocacy centers, \nsocial service agencies, state governmental health service agencies, \nhousing agencies, and legal services agencies.\n  When it comes to recovering and rehabilitating our missing children, \nwe must utilize every available resource.\n  Several provisions in this bill encourage and foster training for law \nenforcement to investigate human trafficking as well as for training \nfor those essential to our criminal justice system, such as physical \nand mental health care providers, federal prosecutors, and judges.\n  S. 178 empowers women who have been the victims of rape by providing \nincentives to states to pass laws allowing termination of parental \nrights of rapists.\n  In addition, the bill seeks to hinder demand by prosecuting not just \nthe trafficker, but also--for the first time--those who patronize and \nsolicit children for illicit sexual acts. Without the consumers of the \nhuman sex trafficking, there would be no victims.\n  And, S. 178 would criminalize the act of using the Internet to \nadvertise human trafficking. While the Internet has enriched out lives \nsignificantly, it has also provided traffickers with a ready tool used \nto further the heinous trafficking of minors for sex.\n  Finally, the bill will help to foster better collaboration among \nfederal, state, and local law enforcement in the fight against sex \ntrafficking. Specifically, S. 178 directs that a task force be \nestablished within the Violent Crimes Against Children Program to \nfacilitate such coordination.\n  This bill attacks the scourge of human trafficking by undercutting \ndemand, providing law enforcement with the tools they need for \nintervention, and by providing rehabilitation and recovery for the \nvictims of human trafficking.\n  I had hoped that before S. 178 was presented to the President, it \nwould not contain provisions that extend the use of mandatory minimum \nsentences. Frankly, I am surprised that the final bill includes \nadditional mandatory minimum sentencing provisions. Mandatory minimums \nhave led to mass incarceration and a one- size-fits-all philosophy in \nsentencing that we should reject. But the overall value of the bill in \nprotecting child sex victims and adult and child trafficking and sex \nvictims is crucial. I support the vital purpose of this bill. On \nbalance however, the many other positive provisions this legislation \nprovides to combat human trafficking counsels in favor of its passage. \nNevertheless, we must be vigilant in monitoring the execution of this \nbill after it becomes law, and effectuate modifications if necessary. \nThe health and welfare of so many of our young people depend on it. The \nU.S. Department of Justice estimates that 300,000 children in this \ncountry are at risk of being trafficked.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is for these innocent children that I strongly \nencourage support for this legislation.\n  With that, I ask for Members' support on this legislation, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as \nshe may consume to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem) who \nhas also contributed a major piece of the legislation before the House \ntoday.\n  Mrs. NOEM. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is an issue that I believe many people \nsee as far removed from them and their families, but the reality is \nthat it is happening all around us: in our schools, near our homes, on \nWeb sites that our kids visit and frequent.\n  My words are not intended to alarm people today but to bring into \nperspective that it isn't just happening overseas or in communities far \naway from our homes. It is happening across this country, even in my \nhome State of South Dakota.\n  In my State, there are three main ways that people are trafficked, \naccording to Kimberly LaPlante, who works at an organization called \nCall to Freedom in Sioux Falls. One, trafficking victims are brought \nfrom bigger cities or from our Native American reservations and sent to \nthe North Dakota oil fields. Two, they are sold at large events, like \nthe annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. Or three, it is homegrown \ntrafficking, meaning this demand originates in my State, and that, by \nthe way, is the most common problem across this country.\n  In 2013, the South Dakota Attorney General's Office held a 6-day \nundercover operation at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in western South \nDakota. They put up an online ad and, over the 6 days, received more \nthan 180 responses.\n  Local law enforcement did the same thing in a community not far from \nmy home. Over the course of 2 days, they received 110 responses.\n  This form of slavery is happening almost every single day, and it is \ntime we do something about it. This bill is our opportunity to do \nsomething about it. It is an opportunity for both Chambers of Congress \nto stand together and support legislation that protects our children \nand our communities.\n  One of the components of this legislation is a provision that I wrote \nto help combat many of the problems that we are facing in South Dakota \nbut also other places in the country.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Today there are only about 200 beds for underage victims in the \nUnited States. The language that I wrote included in this bill ensures \nthat shelters can get access to more resources to build safe housing \nfor those trying to escape and recover from trafficking.\n  There is also a severe lack of information about trafficking and its \nvictims. To help prevent it and to intervene when it does occur, my \nlanguage\n\n[[Page H3284]]\n\naims to make sure that the information on the state of trafficking in \nthis country is analyzed and used to decide how those Federal resources \nshould be used to combat it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to see this package coming to the floor \ntoday. I urge the President to sign it quickly so that we can all join \nhands and act to prevent this human trafficking from continuing across \nour country and protect as many children and help them heal as we \npossibly can.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 178.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3284-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3284-H3293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Graves) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1987.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Louisiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1987, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015, \nreauthorizes funding for the United States Coast Guard through fiscal \nyear 2017 at levels that are fiscally responsible and that will reverse \nthe misguided cuts proposed by the administration.\n  The President's budget would slash the service's acquisition budget \nby over 17 percent. This will only worsen the Coast Guard's growing \ngaps in mission performance, increase acquisition delays, drive up the \ncosts of new assets, and deny our servicemembers the critical resources \nthey need to perform their duties.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Coast Guard has become somewhat of the Swiss Army \nknife of the seas. They are responsible for law enforcement, dealing \nwith fisheries, alien interdiction, drug interdiction, maritime law, \nand national security. Mission after mission has been heaped upon the \nCoast Guard without the corresponding resources for those \nservicemembers to do their job. H.R. 1987 provides sufficient funding \nto ensure these cuts do not happen and the service has what it needs to \nsuccessfully conduct its missions.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  May 18, 2015, on page H3291, the following appeared: Mission \nafter mission has been heaped upon the Corps of Engineers without \nthe corresponding resources\n  \n  The online version should be corrected to read: Mission after \nmission has been heaped upon the Coast Guard without the \ncorresponding resources\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The bill also makes several reforms to Coast Guard authorities, as \nwell as laws governing shipping and navigation. Specifically, H.R. 1987 \nsupports Coast Guard servicemembers by authorizing sufficient funds to \nallow for pay raises consistent with the NDAA and by ensuring they \nreceive access to some of the same benefits as their counterparts in \nthe Department of Defense.\n  It improves Coast Guard mission effectiveness by aligning the \nleadership structure of the service to that of other armed services and \nby replacing and modernizing Coast Guard assets in a cost-effective \nmanner.\n  The bill enhances oversight of the Coast Guard, reduces inefficient \noperations, and saves taxpayers' dollars by making commonsense reforms \nto the service's administration and its acquisition process. It \nsupports the U.S.-flagged and crewed vessels by strengthening the \nenforcement of cargo preference laws. It encourages job growth\n\n[[Page H3292]]\n\nin the maritime sector by cutting regulatory burdens on job creators. \nIt reauthorizes and reforms the administrative procedures of the \nFederal Maritime Commission to improve accountability.\n  Finally, it includes language to require an independent assessment of \nleases versus constructing a new polar icebreaker. Mr. Speaker, right \nnow, other nations operating in the Arctic far exceed the capabilities \nof the United States. This is an area where we must focus and ensure \nthat the United States' capabilities are capable of protecting our \ninterests in that region. I believe it could potentially deliver this \ncritically needed asset--polar icebreaking capabilities--much sooner \nand save a tremendous amount of taxpayer funds if we pursue a public-\nprivate partnership to acquire a polar icebreaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1987 is a bipartisan effort that was put together \nin close consultation with the minority. I want to commend Ranking \nMembers DeFazio and Garamendi for their efforts, as well as Chairman \nShuster and Subcommittee Chairman Hunter for their leadership.\n  I also want to thank the men and women of the Coast Guard for the \ntremendous job they do for our Nation. Coast Guard servicemembers risk \ntheir lives on a daily basis to save those in peril, ensure the safety \nand security of our ports and waterways, and protect our environment; \nand they do all this on aging and obsolete cutters and aircraft, some \nof which were first commissioned in World War II.\n  Passing H.R. 1987 will help rebuild and strengthen the Coast Guard. \nIt will also demonstrate the strong support Congress has for the men \nand women of the Coast Guard and the deep appreciation we have for the \nsacrifices they make for our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 1987, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Subcommittee Ranking Member Garamendi \nand Chairman Hunter for their work on this legislation. I fully support \nthis very important piece of legislation.\n  H.R. 1987 authorizes robust funding for the United States Coast \nGuard's operations, and particularly for its acquisition program. The \nCoast Guard has been cut to the bone, and everybody knows that. If we \nfail to ensure adequate funding for the construction of critically \nneeded new cutters, then the Coast Guard of the future will be less \ncapable than the Coast Guard of the past has been, something that \nshould be unacceptable to our Nation.\n  I strongly support section 303 of this measure, which strengthens the \nenforcement of existing statutes that require government-impelled \ncargoes to be carried on U.S.-flagged vessels. Today, according to the \nMaritime Administration, there are just 83--just 83--ships flying the \nU.S. flag in the foreign trade. We have lost more than 20 ships from \nthe U.S.-flagged foreign trade fleet just since the end of 2012.\n  Our merchant marine not only carries commercial cargo, it provides \nvital sealift capacity to the United States military. And yet, \nparticularly during periods of demobilization, we have repeatedly \nallowed our blue-water fleet to decay until unforeseen crises have \ncreated an urgent new need for sealift capacity. Such a post-\nmobilization decline is happening again, but now our fleet is falling \nto such low levels that we risk reaching a tipping point from which we \nmay never recover. We cannot afford to let that happen, and I remind my \ncolleagues this is our watch.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, effective enforcement of our existing cargo preference \nrequirements is essential to the success of our U.S.-flagged fleet, and \nit is just like any other Buy America policy that ensures the \nexpenditure of U.S. taxpayer dollars supports the interests of United \nStates taxpayers.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the Coast Guard and Maritime \nTransportation Subcommittee for working with me to look closely at this \ncritical issue. I also commend Chairman Hunter for offering an \namendment to the NDAA that would provide a 1-year increase in the MSP \nannual operating stipend. I want to thank him for his leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I close, I note that section 302 of this bill is of \ndeep concern to me. Section 302 would gut much of what was enacted in \nsection 609 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010. Section 609 \nwas enacted to ensure that all survival craft approved by the United \nStates Coast Guard provide the basic protection of keeping individuals \nout of the water if they are forced to abandon a vessel. Of particular \nconcern is ensuring that the elderly, children, and those with \ndisabilities have access to a survival craft that can actually ensure \ntheir survival. The National Transportation Safety Board has been clear \nfor the last 40 years that out-of-water survival craft save lives.\n  Rather than rolling back the requirements contained in the Coast \nGuard Authorization Act of 2010, we should be focused on ensuring full \nimplementation of these requirements. As such, I hope that before this \nauthorization is finalized, section 302 is removed from it.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I again thank my colleagues for their hard \nwork on this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).\n  Mr. ROYCE. I thank the gentleman.\n  Congratulations here to Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio \nfor getting this important bill to the floor today. We are certainly \nproud to support our men and women serving in the United States Coast \nGuard. They play such a critical role there through rescue and saving \nlives and the role that they play also in drug interdiction and in \nprotecting our territorial waters.\n  I would also like to recognize the cooperative way in which Chairman \nHunter has worked to address concerns about how this bill would impact \nan important lifesaving program under the jurisdiction of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee, and that is the Food for Peace program. Over the \npast several years, the effort to reform the Food for Peace program so \nthat we can feed more people in crisis overseas in less time for less \nmoney has been portrayed as a zero-sum game between the intended \nbeneficiaries of our generosity and the U.S. merchant marine. That is \nunfortunate because that is wrong.\n  What is clear, though, is that we need to fix this problem in the \nsense that, after Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in 2013, U.S. \npurchase and shipping requirements delayed deliveries of U.S. food for \n3 weeks. Now, fortunately, with the Food for Peace program, those needs \nwere met.\n  But now in Nepal, it would take 45 days to get U.S. food in country \neven though food has been pre-positioned in nearby Sri Lanka. So that \nis why this element of the Food for Peace program is so important. If \nwe had to wait 45 days to respond to every humanitarian disaster, some \npeople would perish. Certainly many would be on the verge of starvation \nover that 45-day period.\n  I am, therefore, pleased to see that this year the Coast Guard \nauthorization bill does not raise cargo preference requirements from 50 \npercent to 75, and further, the bill's cargo preference enforcement \nprovisions maintain important consultation and public comment \nrequirements. At the same time, the recently passed national defense \nauthorization bill will accelerate support for the existing Maritime \nSecurity Program.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  I appreciate Chairman Hunter's work to ensure that U.S. maritime \nsecurity needs are fulfilled through a national defense mechanism \nrather than relying upon food aid cargos.\n  Mr. Speaker, preserving U.S. maritime security is essential, but it \nneed not come at the expense of food aid. I look forward to continuing \nto work with Chairman Hunter and Ranking Member Garamendi on creative \nsolutions that enable us to preserve U.S. maritime security while \nmaking Food for Peace more effective, more efficient, and most \nimportantly, getting it there on time for those that are in need after \na disaster.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, we have no more speakers, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  We, obviously, covered all the key points of this legislation, the \nimportant side.\n\n[[Page H3293]]\n\n  I would like to briefly highlight the fact that the U.S. Coast \nGuard's mission has fundamentally changed over the last several years \nin regard to the mission upon mission heaped upon this agency and the \ngreater role they are now playing in regard to national security, \ncooperating with our other defense and Armed Forces.\n  I want to make note that this legislation ensures that the Coast \nGuard is on a path to playing that role and being able to perform their \nresponsibilities and their duties proficiently.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I first want to echo Chairman Hunter in \nstating my strong support for H.R. 1987, the Coast Guard Authorization \nAct of 2015, legislation that will tend to the needs of our Nation's \nfifth military service, the United States Coast Guard.\n  I also want to express my sincere appreciation to Chairman Hunter for \nhis genuine bipartisan collaboration throughout the development of this \nimportant legislation. Not only will this bill improve our oversight of \nthe Coast Guard, it also will enhance the capabilities and performance \nof this indispensable, multi-mission maritime agency.\n  I also want to thank the Chairman of the Transportation Committee, \nBill Shuster, and the Ranking Democrat Member, Peter DeFazio, and \nacknowledge them for their thoughtful contributions.\n  I am particularly pleased that this legislation will provide \nstability in budget authority for the Coast Guard. Erratic budgets and \nperpetual continuing resolutions have had a deleterious impact on the \nCoast Guard. Perhaps most notable, unpredictable and insufficient \nfunding has hampered the Coast Guard's ability to keep pace with its \nlong-term program to recapitalize its offshore fleets of surface and \nair assets.\n  Some of the Coast Guard's legacy cutters are fifty years old. These \nvessels are well beyond their estimated service life and have become \nincreasingly unreliable and much more expensive to maintain and repair. \nWe can, and we should, do better by our Coast Guard.\n  The authorized funding levels for the Acquisitions, Construction and \nImprovement Account in this legislation will allow the Coast Guard to \nkeep this recapitalization initiative on track. I am optimistic that \nthese authorizations will send a strong signal to our colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I also support provisions in the bill that will require the Coast \nGuard to initiate long-term capital planning, to require better \nassessments of mission performance metrics and personnel needs, and to \nassess and test new communication and vessel management technologies.\n  The bill also contains provisions important to our merchant marine. \nProvisions that would harmonize the renewal of different mariner \ncredentials and allow mariners greater flexibility in acquiring their \nmedical certifications should improve convenience without sacrificing \ncompliance with fitness and training standards.\n  The bill also further advances my strong interest in using the \nimminent U.S. LNG export trade as a new economic opportunity for our \nshipyards and the U.S. flag in our foreign trade.\n  This legislation would direct the Secretary of Transportation to \ndevelop guidelines to promote the use of U.S. flag vessels and U.S. \nseafarers in the transport of LNG. I urge members to support this \nprovision that will create maritime jobs here at home.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is not perfect, but rarely \nis that the case. This legislation is, however, a balanced, responsible \nand forward thinking product that will support our Coast Guard and \naddress important issues raised by maritime stakeholders.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor, and I urge members on both \nsides to support this legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

In fact, one out of every six \npeople will suffer from a stroke in his or her lifetime, yet\n\n[[Page H3296]]\n\nstrokes are largely preventable and treatable.\n  Small changes in diet and exercise can have an enormously positive \nimpact on your heart health and help prevent a stroke. America's \namazing medical researchers and practitioners are also doing their part \nby pioneering new treatments that save lives every day.\n  Finally, let's remember these four letters, F-A-S-T: face drooping, \narm weakness, speech difficulty, and it is time to call 911.

Madam Speaker, 50 years ago today, President \nLyndon B. Johnson announced from the White House Rose Garden that \nenrollment would begin for an early childhood education program called \nProject Head Start.\n  For the last half century, Head Start has been more than just an \neducation program. It not only includes quality preschool but also \ncritical support services, including family engagement, health \nservices, and good nutrition. Studies have found that children in Head \nStart do better academically, have better behavior, and better health \nstatus than their peers. The program also saves more money than it \ncosts by reducing teen pregnancy, high school dropouts, and the \nlikelihood of incarceration.\n  Madam Speaker, we know that Head Start works. As we mark the occasion \nof 50 years of one of the most successful early intervention programs, \nlet us recommit ourselves to the ideal that all of our children have \naccess to quality preschool education, like Head Start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3296-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PENNSYLVANIA AMERICAN LEGION'S EAGLE SCOUT OF THE YEAR\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Since \nthen, Devin has dedicated himself to church, school, scouting, and \ncommunity and personifies all that an Eagle Scout should be.\n  Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of attending Devin's Eagle Scout \nceremony back in November of 2012, and I knew right away, then and \nthere, that this young man had a bright future ahead. Devin now \nadvances to the national level, where he will compete among 56 \napplicants to earn the coveted National Eagle Scout of the Year award.\n  Like Devin's parents, Joe and Karen Anderson, I am so proud of all of \nDevin's accomplishments, and I wish him all the best as he competes for \nthis national award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3296-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            125TH ANNIVERSARY, UA LOCAL 50 OF NORTHERN OHIO\n\n  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. KAPTUR.

The power of America was before us in the hands and minds of \nthose who have the skills to build for us.\n  The training academy they have built at local 50 is probably the \nfinest in the country, at least one of the finest. And I am just so \nproud of the younger men and women who are coming up in the trades. \nThey have a decent wage. They can earn enough to join the middle class. \nThey have retirement plans. They have health plans, including the one \nthey built from scratch, serving thousands and thousands and thousands \nof people.\n  Congratulations at 125 years to United Allied Trades Plumbers and \nPipefitters Local 50 in Ohio.

However, it is more than awards, Madam \nSpeaker, because anyone who has met Rabbi Kravitz will tell you, it is \na passion that he has for the causes that he advocates for that brings \nhis success.\n  I wish Rabbi Kravitz success in moving forward and the best as he \nmoves on to new endeavors, which I am sure will include many continued \nprojects to make the world a better and safer and just place.

For the first time in 18 \nyears, the Rockets are in the Western Championship.\n  Oh, I know that it is not the championship of the National Basketball \nAssociation, but it is really good for Houstonians.\n  We had a rockin' good time. For those who were able just to be on the \nstreets, those who were inside the arena, those who were at various \nsites around the city, I watched my constituents have just a great \namount of joy.\n  It is my privilege to thank the owners, the coach, and, yes, all of \nthe team. We know there are great stars on the team. We know that they \nwork as a team, and that is what makes the Houston Rockets great.\n  I am here today saying, what about those Rockets, with a red coat on \nto salute the Houston Rockets and push them on tomorrow night to be \nchampions again. I thank them for being the right kind of role models \nfor our young people and letting them know that academics and sports go \ntogether. The National Basketball Association realizes the importance \nof young people having role models but young people staying in school, \nand they are staying focused on that.\n  So I am rooting for the Houston Rockets.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I am glad to be joined by my colleague and \nfriend, the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Robin Kelly. Thank you, \nCongresswoman Kelly, for joining me in coanchoring this Special Order \nhour tonight. Thank you also to the members of the Congressional Black \nCaucus and to all those watching from home.\n  Madam Speaker, last month, Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old man Baltimore \nman, died in police custody from a spinal cord injury. His death, ruled \na homicide, has drawn ongoing national attention to the increasingly \nfrayed relations between police and communities throughout the United \nStates.\n  Tonight we come together as a caucus to address the urgent need to \nreform our criminal justice system and promote police accountability \nand also to talk about many different issues of diversity in our \nNation.\n  Our Nation is at a crossroads. Failure to make meaningful reforms to \nour criminal justice system risks damaging relations between \ncommunities and police beyond repair. But real commonsense reforms that \nenhance transparency, advance public safety, eradicate discrimination, \nand instill trust can create a system that works for all Americans.\n  Currently, our law enforcement system and criminal justice system \naren't working for African Americans and other minorities. As a result, \na meaningful dialogue between law enforcement and the communities they \nare charged with protecting remains illusive.\n  Tonight we will speak to the urgent need to reform our criminal \njustice and police systems so that we can breathe new life into the \nAmerican promise of full equality and justice for all.\n  With that, Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois \n(Ms. Kelly).\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank my friend from New Jersey for leading \ntonight's Special Order hour.\n  Madam Speaker, once again, the Congressional Black Caucus has the \nopportunity to discuss some of the many important issues and challenges \nfacing our Nation right now. I strongly believe that our conversation \nhere tonight is a critical discussion for the record as we continue the \nwork of making our communities and country better. The urgency of now, \naddressing reform, accountability, equality, and diversity, that is \nquite a title, but what does it all mean in the context of our full \ndiscussion?\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  America is celebrated for being a melting pot, but I like to say a \ntossed salad or a stew, because in a stew or salad you don't lose your \nidentity, but you learn to live together in the same gravy or the same \nsalad dressing. This Congress is, without a doubt, a true testament to \nthe diverse people, personalities, and communities that make this great \nNation so great.\n  But in these dynamic times, how can we ensure that our laws and \npolicies are fully embracing our melting pot or our stew of a nation? \nHow can we ensure that we make this great Union even more perfect? It \nstarts with holding ourselves accountable in just a myriad of respects \non the economic front, with respect to our justice system, in \nappreciating our diversity and inclusion for all Americans. I look \nforward to a fruitful conversation on this and thank my coanchor, \nRepresentative Payne.\n  I did want to acknowledge the Diversity Dinner that we had last week. \nThese days we hear so much about the toxic partisan atmosphere in \nCongress, titles like ``How Congress Became So Partisan'' in The \nWashington Post to Nick Gass at Politico's piece, ``This Graphic Shows \nHow America's Partisan Divide Grew.'' The reports of Congress' \nhyperpartisanship are abundant. The reports point to the loss of \ncamaraderie and friendship amongst colleagues across the aisle. This \nperception undoubtedly contributes to our dismal 15 percent approval \nrating.\n  Since my time as a State legislator in the Illinois statehouse, I \nhave been hosting Diversity Dinners to grow friendships and nurture \ncollegial working relations among legislators who may not otherwise \ninteract. Tonight as we discuss equality and diversity, I want to \nreflect on what I see as encouraging in bridging differences and \nunderstanding in different communities.\n  Last week I hosted, along with other Members, my second annual \ncongressional Diversity Dinner. Forty Members of Congress from both \nparties, including Members from both Republican and Democratic \nleadership, showed up and enjoyed a meal with their colleagues. During \nthe dinner, we weren't Democrats or Republicans; we were colleagues \nwith some great stories to share. At this year's dinner, I saw a \nmicrocosm of our Nation, a crowd made up of Members from coast to coast \nwith truly diverse backgrounds coming together to enjoy each other's \ncompany.\n  If we can put aside our partisan blinders to break bread together, I \nam confident we can find ways to work together. That is what America \nwants and needs, and that type of leadership is the kind of leadership \nwe deserve.\n  Today we have an opportunity to celebrate diversity and show that \nbipartisanship can thrive in Congress. In recent months we have seen \nthe trust between political parties, law enforcement, and communities \nacross the Nation spike. Now is the time for us to come together to \naddress the reforms needed to rebuild this trust. Let's show the \nAmerican people that we are a diverse body that won't let party lines \ndivide us or define us.\n  Mr. PAYNE. I would like to thank the gentlewoman for her thoughtful \ncomments.\n  Madam Speaker, it is true, we have come to a point in this Nation \nwhere one side has gone to one corner and the other side has gone to \nanother corner not to meet in the middle to solve issues and problems. \nThere was a time when this great body would compromise. You didn't get \neverything you wanted, and I didn't get everything I wanted. So that \nmeans we compromised and came to a decision.\n  The gentlewoman also makes a good point about working with Members on \nthe other side of the aisle. The gentlewoman from Arizona, the Speaker \npro tempore this evening, has become a great collaborator with myself \non the Homeland Security Subcommittee which she chairs, and we have \nworked extensively together on legislation that we both support. We \nneed more of that. We need more of that to happen. We need to take the \ntime to hear each other, to listen, and to see where we don't agree on \neverything but there are common threads that we can build and bind \ntogether.\n  So with that, I am proud to see her sitting in that chair. I get to \nsit next to her in committee, so it puts me closer to the Speaker's \nchair, and I feel privileged for that.\n  Right now, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas, the Honorable \nSheila Jackson Lee. She is one of the most thoughtful Members of the \nUnited States House of Representatives. She hails from Houston, Texas, \nand she always has great words of wisdom, thoughts, and ideas on the \nissues that we face in this great Nation.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I think by the spirit and the tone of \nthis Special Order we can see that there is hope and a pathway for \ncollaboration.\n  Let me thank Mr. Payne, who has evidenced those collaborative efforts\n\n[[Page H3298]]\n\nthrough his leadership on homeland security and successful leadership, \npassing any number of legislative initiatives in a bipartisan manner. I \nalso am delighted to join Congresswoman Robin Kelly. And she is right. \nShe had a very successful Diversity Dinner last week, and I am sure it \noutdid the one the year before, and there was a lot of cross-\npollination, good feelings, and discussions about very important \nissues.\n  We found that America is a diverse nation, and we are happy when we \nhave the ability to understand each other's cultures or understand the \nbackground that each of us have come from. Our own neighborhoods make \nus different, our own faith modes are different, our family members' \nmode is different, where we went to school. Yet in this place, the \nAmerican people ask us, as both Mr. Payne and Ms. Kelly are saying \ntoday, to walk a pathway of bipartisanship, but really towards success. \nSo allow me just briefly to comment on one or two points regarding \ndiversity.\n  I would highlight that one of the areas is where I formerly served as \na member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. In years \npast, we have gathered around science, technology, engineering, and \nmath, and we have gathered around transportation infrastructure. I hope \nin our words tonight that we will find a way to forge a way forward for \ntransportation infrastructure, because every one of us needs not only \ngood roads, highways, and dams, but we need good public transportation, \nas evidenced by the heinous and unacceptable tragedy last week with \nAmtrak.\n\n  I might add that I am a space chauvinist, a NASA supporter. Many \ncenters are around the Nation. It is a job creator, as is \ninfrastructure, and I would hope that we would write a bill and have \nRepublicans and Democrats support the value of human space exploration. \nWhat a pathway for bipartisanship. We haven't gone that way, Madam \nSpeaker, but I am hoping that the words we offer tonight will see us do \nthat.\n  Let me focus on my last point and indicate that we have a moment, a \nsignificant moment in history. This is a great cause, and that cause is \nto find a pathway for criminal justice reform. Yesterday marked the \n61st anniversary of the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of \nEducation, a decision that overruled the separate but equal doctrine of \nPlessy v. Ferguson and gave needed momentum for the fight for reform, \nequality, and diversity in our Nation's schools and, I would say, \nsociety at large.\n  Many communities are waiting for that kind of evenhandedness in \njustice in the criminal justice system. This does not mean that we \nthrow targets at our friends in law enforcement. It means that we find \nways for there to be an acceptance that we all can stand improvement, \ncorrection, enhancement, educational opportunities, tactics, and \ntraining. There is no shame to any of that.\n  As I stood with our officers and families who were on the grounds of \nthe Capitol on May 15, as I joined them for the police memorial for \nthose who had fallen in duty, there were faces from all backgrounds, \nand we were singularly noting the tragedy of lost officers. At the same \ntime as we mourn those officers, we know that there are officers who \nwill look to work with us as we move this criminal justice system \nalong.\n  I would just like to acknowledge that as we do so, we can find \nbipartisanship, because the cost of incarceration, for example, is \nalmost prohibitive. Madam Speaker, $75 billion is spent on local, \nState, and Federal incarceration. We have the largest percentage, 2 \nmillion people, incarcerated across America.\n  We can do better, and part of that is expanding community-oriented \npolicing, building trust, a bill that I introduced, H.R. 59, that would \ncreate a pathway for ensuring that communities feel that they are being \nprotected but not feel differently that they are being, if you will, \nput in a certain category to be utilized as a basis for revenue raising \nin our communities.\n  Then we heard FBI Director Comey, and I agree with him. The science \nof doing a better job is data and statistics. So I introduced the CADET \nbill, Collection and Analysis of Data to Educate and Train Law \nEnforcement Officers. What it simply means is give them the numbers, \nthe statistics, to know how they can do a better job at planning, going \nforward, how they police. Let there be information for us to be able to \ndesign the right kind of policing tactics that work for law enforcement \nand for the community. It is right out of the FBI Director's playbook. \nHe said that we are operating without data, without statistics, and, \nfrankly, that is not what we should be doing.\n  Tomorrow we will be holding a hearing on the issue of police \naccountability and gaining the facts in the Judiciary Committee, but \nthere is much more for us to do. For example, what are the educational \nrequirements? What are the various resources used for mental health? \nAnd psychological needs and training and nonviolent conflict resolution \nreceived by police forces, police officers, the feasibility and \nemphasis of making greater use of the technological devices, such as \nbody cameras. But I want more technology, laptops. Many law enforcement \nhave laptops. We might need to move to iPads to be able to give them \nquicker response times and quicker support systems, to be able to \nensure that we have the right tools to work together.\n  And yes, you cannot breathe life into the reform of a criminal \njustice system if you do not have a component dealing with our youth, \nso I have introduced, of course, the Juvenile Accountability Block \nGrant Reauthorization bill and the antibullying Bullying Prevention and \nIntervention Act to be able to address a sort of a cause and a release \nfor our young people. Madam Speaker, I would offer to say that there is \nmuch work that we can do. We will be looking at the legislation that \nmany people have passed.\n  I want to conclude on this note, to simply acknowledge the ranking \nmember, John Conyers, on the Judiciary Committee that wants to join \ntogether with me to embrace the legislative initiatives of our Members \nto get the right kind of omnibus bill going forward for the American \npublic to see criminal justice reform. I want to thank my colleagues \nfor allowing me these comments and, as well, the bipartisan approach \nthat you have taken.\n  Madam Speaker, yesterday marked the 61st anniversary of the landmark \ndecision in Brown v. Board of Education, the decision that overruled \nthe ``separate but equal doctrine'' of Plessey v. Ferguson and gave \nneeded momentum to the fight for reform, equality, and diversity in our \nnation's schools and society at large.\n  Although much progress has been made in narrowing the gap between the \nnation's founding ideals and the objective reality, recent events \ndemonstrate that we still have a ways to go before the dream of the \nRev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is realized in the areas of criminal \njustice reform, economic opportunity, and workplace diversity.\n\n\n                        CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM\n\n  Madam Speaker, the problems revealed by several of the more notorious \nincidents involving the use of lethal force against unarmed citizens \nthat have captured the attention of the nation over the past several \nmonths require a national response because the problems identified are \nnot isolated or limited to one region of the country.\n  For example, the death of 43 year-old Eric Garner resulting from the \napplication of a NYPD police chokehold occurred in the Northeast and \nthe death of 18 year-old Michael Brown and the resulting events in \nFerguson occurred in the border state of Missouri.\n  The killing of 12 year-old Tamir Rice by a Cleveland police officer \noccurred in the Midwest and death of unarmed 26 year-old Jordan Baker \nby an off-duty Houston police officer occurred in Texas.\n  In Phoenix, Arizona, Rumain Brisbon, an unarmed black father of four, \nwas shot to death when a police officer allegedly mistook his bottle of \npills for a gun.\n  In Pasadena, California 19 year-old Kendrec McDade was chased and \nshot seven times by two police officers after a 911 caller falsely \nreported he had been robbed at gunpoint by two black men, neither of \nwhom in fact was armed.\n  And, of course, on April 4, the conscience of the nation was shocked \nby the horrifying killing of 50 year-old Walter Scott by a North \nCharleston police officer in the southern state of South Carolina.\n  Madam Speaker, while the problem is national in scope, it appears to \naffect disproportionately and adversely a particular demographic group: \nAfrican American males.\n  Because all lives matter in our great nation, it is imperative that \nwe in Congress act swiftly and decisively to focus much needed \nattention and resources on legislative proposals intended to address \nthe problem of misuse of\n\n[[Page H3299]]\n\nlethal force by law enforcement and to rebuild the public trust and \nconfidence needed to ensure that law enforcement receive and maintain \nthe support of the communities they serve and protect.\n  As Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I note that there are \nseveral promising legislative criminal justice reform initiatives that \nhave been introduced and are worthy of consideration.\n  Among them are H.R. 59, the ``Build TRUST in Municipal Law \nEnforcement Act of 2015'' (Rept. Jackson Lee); H.R. 1459, the Democracy \nRestoration Act of 2015 (Rep. Conyers); H.R. 1810, the ``Collection and \nAnalysis of Data to Educate and Train Law Enforcement Officers'' \n(``CADET Act''); H.R. 920, the ``Smarter Sentencing Act of 2015'' \n(Rept. Labrador); and S. 675, the ``Record Expungement Designed to \nEnhance Employment Act of 2015'' (REDEEM Act) (Sens. Paul and Booker).\n  Madam Speaker, earlier this year FBI Director James Comey delivered a \nremarkable speech at Georgetown University in which he laid out several \nhard truths about the administration of the criminal justice system and \nstate of community policing in our country.\n  One of the hardest truths discussed by Director Comey is the fact we \nhave limited information and inadequate data regarding the scope and \nextent of the problems endemic in the criminal justice system.\n  This lack of information hampers the ability of policymakers and \nadministrators at the federal, state, and local level to identify and \nimplement laws, policies, and practices to remedy identified problems.\n  The Judiciary Committee should immediately conduct hearings to \neducate the Congress and the public on the nature and extent of \ndeficiencies in the nation's criminal justice systems and the efficacy \nof proposed solutions.\n  Specifically, hearings should be held to investigate practices and \npolicies governing: 1. the use of lethal force by state and local \npolice departments; 2. educational requirements, mental health and \npsychological evaluations, and training in non-violent conflict \nresolution received by veteran law enforcement officers and new \nrecruits; and 3. the feasibility and efficacy of making greater use of \ntechnological devices such as body cameras.\n  A fourth area to be explored is the state of the social science \nresearch in the academic study of criminal justice reform because there \nis much the Committee can learn by engaging leading experts in the \nfield regarding the state of knowledge in their respective disciplines.\n  Madam Speaker, reforming the criminal justice system so that it \ndispenses justice impartially and equally to all persons is one of the \nmost important challenges facing this Congress.\n  And it is a goal that can be achieved if we work together in a spirit \nof goodwill and bipartisan cooperation.\n  There are few things we can do that will provide a greater service to \nour nation.\n\n\n                     Jobs and Economic Opportunity\n\n  Madam Speaker, the current unemployment rate for African Americans is \n9.6%, this is nearly twice of the 4.7% unemployment rate of white \nAmericans.\n  African American children between the age of 16 and 19 have an \nunemployment rate of 27.5% whereas the unemployment rate for white \nteenagers of the same age is 14.5%.\n  The median African American (34,600) household income is nearly \n24,000 less than the median income for White Americans' household.\n  African Americans are almost 3 times more likely to live in poverty \nthan white Americans.\n  Madam Speaker, although the unemployment rate has decreased over the \npast year, a significant race-gap still remains.\n\n\n                          workplace diversity\n\n  Workplace diversity is critical to an organization's success and \ncompetitiveness.\n  Workplace Diversity allows for an increased adaptability, broader \nservice range, a variety of viewpoints, and more effective execution.\n  Madam Speaker, with an increasingly global economy, the workforce has \nbecome more diverse, and an organizations success depends on its \nability to manage diversity.\n  That is why, for example, introduced an amendment that was adopted by \nthe House to H.R. 4899, the ``Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an \nAmerica that Works Act of 2014,'' to include legislation establishing \nan Interior Department Office of Energy Employment and Training charged \nwith working with minority-serving educational institutions and other \nto expand the numbers and diversity of persons from across the \nvoluntary with the skills and qualifications needed to take advantage \nof the exciting and rewarding opportunities that American energy \nindustry has to offer and to keep America the world leaders in emerging \nenergy technologies.\n  I also introduced H.R. 70, the ``Deficit Reduction, Job Creation, and \nEnergy Security Act,'' that requires the Secretary to establish an \noffice of Energy Employment and Training and an Office of Minority and \nWomen Inclusion responsible for all matters of the Department of the \nInterior relating to diversity in management, employment, and business \nactivities.\n  I also introduced, and the House adopted, an amendment to H.R. 4923, \n``Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act \nfor FY 2015,'' that increased funding for the Office of Economic Impact \nand Diversity by $500,000 to provide grants to Minority Serving \nInstitutions to expand STEM programs and opportunities.\n  Mr. PAYNE. I really appreciate the always thoughtful and timely \nremarks by the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Madam Speaker, at this time I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSessions), a gentleman who has served this House with distinction. He \nserved with my father, and now I have the great opportunity to work \nwith him.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New \nJersey. In fact, he did refer to the relationship that I had with Don \nPayne, a young Congressman from New Jersey who, in fact, engaged me as \na new Member in the Caribbean Caucus. During that period of time that I \nengaged with the Congressman's father, we tried to pay attention to the \nCaribbean, as some would say, a gateway to the United States of \nAmerica, but a land of a number of islands of people who are not only \nmost accommodating to the United States of America, but really \nthoughtful in ingenuity involved in the people of the Caribbean.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  I found through the relationship that I had with then-Congressman \nPayne, as he was co-chairman of the Caribbean Caucus, I learned the \nthings that he tried to teach me about not only people, but about a \nrelationship with the United States of America.\n  I do miss Don. I want to thank the gentleman for not only knowing \nthat, but acknowledging that. I want to thank the gentleman for \nyielding time to me to file the rule.\n  I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. PAYNE. I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas who, as I \nsaid, has had a distinguished career to this point and will continue to \nshow great leadership in this House of Representatives, and I thank him \nfor his friendship.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order \ntonight.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, we heard a common thread about diversity. \nAt the bottom of the Statue of Liberty, there are words on it and it \nsays: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to \nbreathe free.''\n  That has allowed many diverse people come here and look for the \nfreedom that this Nation can extend to you and prosper. We need to \ncontinue that great tradition.\n  I hear a lot these days about the borders and eliminating pathways to \ncome here, and that has not been our tradition, so I do not believe, at \nthis point in time in this Nation's history, that we should talk that \nway, or else, we should remove those words from the bottom of Lady \nLiberty.\n  Equality and diversity is the center of criminal justice concerns. \nThe inequality force is distrust which erodes relationships between \npolice and communities. Baltimore and other police-related tragedies \nover the past year speak to the broader challenges.\n  Unfortunately, racial discrimination persists throughout our Nation, \nundercutting the gains of African Americans in their communities.\n  As we work to reform our criminal justice system, we must also work \nin support of equality in all context. This is the only way to fully \nmeet the needs of our communities.\n  As a caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus is committed to ensuring \nthat the increasing diversity of the Nation is reflected in American \nbusiness. To that end, we will make sure that American businesses \nreceive the government contracts and tax preferences and taking \nconcrete steps to improve diversity in efforts at all levels.\n\n[[Page H3300]]\n\n  Diversity in the workforce means diversity in all sectors, including \ntechnology industries where there is a lack of African Americans. We \nneed to engage the tech center in increasing African American \nrepresentation and inclusion in the industry.\n  The American promise that we all are created equal must guide our \nefforts at all levels, from policing in our communities, to expanding \nopportunities for minorities in the workforce.\n  Madam Speaker, there has to be balance in everything. We see the \nissues that towns such as Ferguson and Baltimore and Long Island, New \nYork, have suffered with the tragedies of losing people in those \ncommunities, but we also know that police organizations have a \ndifficult job, and they are trained to protect and serve. We must make \nsure that that is the goal, to protect and serve.\n  Unfortunately, at times, we find circumstances or situations where \nthey are in a position where they are not protecting and serving, but \nmore like an occupying force. That is not what we need from our law \nenforcement officers.\n  We need for them to engage in the community and understand what is \ngoing on in that community and have a good enough relationship that, \nwhen and if there is a circumstance where they need information, that \nthe community feels comfortable enough to go to them with the \ninformation they need in order to serve the issue.\n  There is good and bad in everyone, Madam Speaker. There are good \npublic servants and bad public servants; there are good teachers and \nbad teachers; there are good speakers and bad speakers, poor speakers, \nbut, when it comes to law enforcement, we need to have them serve the \ncommunity.\n  I stand here to say I thank them for the difficult task that they \nhave every single day, to go into the community, and their families say \ngood-bye to them and hope they return from that shift that evening. I \ndon't take it lightly.\n  There is enough responsibility on all sides, from law enforcement and \nfrom the community, that has a responsibility to law enforcement, but \nwe need to continue to strive to make this a more perfect union.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Payne. I did want to \nsay to Madam Speaker, I appreciate you participating in the Diversity \nDinners last week. I can't have Congressman Payne have a one-up on me, \nso thank you so much. I really appreciate it.\n  As we continue our conversation on accountability, equality, and \ndiversity, I would like to offer some statistics on our economy 50 \nyears ago and today with respect to the African American community and \nwomen.\n  In 1965, African American jobseekers could be denied employment based \non the color of their skin; and, when they could find jobs, they were \ndisproportionately paid less than White males in the same position. In \nfact, in 1965, the Black unemployment rate was 8.1 percent, almost \ntwice the national unemployment rate which stood at 4.5 percent.\n  Fifty years later, we have made great strides, and our Nation's \nworkforce is more diverse than ever, but we have much more work to do. \nToday, at 10.4 percent, the Black unemployment rate is still almost \ndouble the national unemployment rate of 5.6 percent. While it is \nsignificantly smaller, there is still a racial wage gap.\n\n  The median African American household has less than two-thirds the \nincome of the average White median household. In the past year, we have \nseen the greatest economic growth in decades. More and more women have \nbeen able to enter the workforce, reducing the employment rate among \nwomen to a 6-year low.\n  Unfortunately, Black women have yet to reap the benefits of the \neconomic rebound. In fact, while the overall unemployment rate for \nwomen declined, the Black female unemployment rate has increased over \nthe past 2 months. According to a recent analysis by the National \nWomen's Law Center, the Black women's unemployment rate is more than \ntwice the unemployment rate of White women.\n  Despite having comparable levels of education, Black women have had \nthe highest unemployment rate of any other group. A possible factor in \nthe stubborn unemployment rate for Black women is that we are \ndisproportionately employed in the public sector, which is experiencing \na much slower recovery than the private sector.\n  NWLC said the stagnant job situation for Black women is a ``red \nflag'' in the employment landscape and urged lawmakers to act to \npromote a stronger, more widely shared recovery. I couldn't agree more.\n  We need to invest more in job training and retraining programs that \nhelp Black women adapt to the changing workforce and prepare for the \ncareers of tomorrow. We must work to promote diversity in hiring and \nencourage employers to model their workforces on the communities in \nwhich they operate.\n  As we look for ways to help increase diversity in the workplace and \nhelp women succeed, we must be mindful of the unique challenges Black \nwomen face and develop targeted policies that help level the playing \nfield for all women.\n  These facts I have just covered point to the systemic problems. We \nneed to address them today. It should be our mission today to see to it \nthat in 50 years, when lawmakers stand here, they will proudly be \ntouting the progress our Nation has made because all Americans are paid \nequally and no is discriminated against in the workplace.\n  As chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, I am \nworking to address our Nation's health equity gap by exploring \nlegislative and policy initiatives to reduce minority health \ndisparities and promote better health outcomes for all Americans.\n  With respect to the African American community, the health disparity \ngap is particularly wide as Blacks have high rates of many adverse \nhealth conditions. Across the medical spectrum--from cancer to \ndiabetes, from hypertension to stroke--Blacks are overrepresented and \noften undertreated.\n  A major barrier to African Americans getting the medical care they \nneed is the lack of African American doctors in their communities. \nStudies show that African Americans are more comfortable seeking \ntreatment from doctors who look like them and are much more likely to \nadhere to courses of treatment prescribed by Black doctors; yet, while \nAfrican Americans comprise 13 percent of the U.S. population, we \nrepresent only 4 percent of the physician workforce, according to the \nAssociation of American Medical Colleges' 2014 diversity in the \nphysician workforce report.\n  The infamous Tuskegee study fostered an enduring legacy of mistrust \nof the medical establishment in the African American community that \nmakes diversity in medicine vital to closing the health disparities \ngap.\n  In order to achieve health equity, we must work to create a physician \nworkforce that reflects our Nation. One key way to do that is to \nencourage more African Americans to pursue education and training in \nscience, technology, engineering, and math. Congress must do more to \nsupport investments in STEM education and to create avenues of access \nfor African American students to enter the STEM fields.\n  In my district, I launched the Second Congressional District STEM \nAcademy to expose students to STEM fields in hopes of encouraging them \nto pursue STEM-related careers.\n  Also, a STEM workforce made up of diverse ranks is crucial to future \ninnovation. To help in that mission, folks across the country and in \nSilicon Valley have taken note. I know Facebook has sought to change \nthe face of innovation through efforts like their Facebook Academy and \nFacebook University, which target high school and college students from \nunderrepresented groups.\n  Similar to my STEM Academy, it is good to see them making an effort \nto build a pipeline and introduce women and people of color to jobs in \nSTEM--which, of course, could be IT, engineering--and hopefully, more \nyoung people decide to become doctors, and they can work in African \nAmerican communities or underserved communities.\n  A medical student population that reflects our country's population \nwill create a pipeline of diverse doctors to our communities which \nwill, in turn, put all Americans on track to live a healthier life.\n\n[[Page H3301]]\n\n  I turn back to my colleague from New Jersey, Congressman Donald \nPayne.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Thank you, Ms. Kelly. We appreciate your comments.\n  In closing, I would like to thank you for cohosting the Special Order \non criminal justice reform, accountability, and diversity. It is \nthrough these Special Orders that we are able to speak directly to our \nconstituents about the valuable work the Congressional Black Caucus \ndoes to reduce injustice and promote equality for all African American \ncommunities.\n  Our criminal justice and police systems are in a state of crisis. Too \noften, under these systems, Black lives are treated as though they \ndon't matter. We saw this last month, when Baltimore's Freddie Gray \ndied in police custody from a brutal spine injury. Such tragedies erode \ntrust between our communities and the police.\n  This problem is compounded by a wide range of factors, from \ndisturbing gaps in incarceration rates to racial disparities in \nsentencing. We need a system that holds criminals accountable and \nprotects law enforcement while, at the same time, ensuring the safety \nand equal treatment of all communities.\n  This includes implementing police body cameras in order to promote \ntransparency and accountability while deterring wrongdoing.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  At the same time, we need to make sure that law enforcement officers \ndon't resort to discriminatory policing practices.\n  It is undeniable that racial profiling remains an ongoing crisis in \nour Nation. There is a clear and growing need to ensure a robust and \ncomprehensive Federal commitment to ending racial profiling by law \nenforcement agencies. The End Racial Profiling Act, which I proudly \nsupport, would do just that. It was constructed after a law in New \nJersey, authored by my uncle, Assemblyman William Payne. It was the \nfirst racial profiling law passed in the United States, a law of which \nI am very proud. I took that idea and brought it Federal.\n  Of course, real accountability means that we will, at times, need \nindependent investigations of police-related deaths. We are glad to \nsee, finally, Attorney General Lynch launch an investigation into the \nBaltimore Police Department, with the stated goal of assisting police \ndepartments across the country in developing their practices. In less \nthan 1 month on the job, Attorney General Lynch is already making a \ndifference, and we thank her for that.\n  As we reflect on the dire need for the reform of our criminal justice \nsystem, we need to advance the cause of equality in all contexts. This \nmeans expanding diversity in the workforce, in health, and in all \naspects of life--from the mailroom to the boardroom, from the \nmanufacturing industry to the technology sector. Many of these \nchallenges we face today are great, but as a caucus, we remain \ncommitted to solving them.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today along \nwith my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, in support of \ntoday's Special Order Hour: ``The Urgency of Now: Addressing Reform, \nAccountability, Equality and Diversity.'' As the conscience of the \nCongress since 1971, these issues are of paramount importance to the \nCongressional Black Caucus in the 114th Congress.\n  There is a crisis in America--one that centers on criminal justice \nreform and law enforcement accountability. Just over a month ago, \nFreddie Gray lost his life at the hands of the police in a city plagued \nby a weak economy, high levels of crime, and a lack of good-paying \njobs. While Baltimore is a city with a unique set of issues, its \nproblems are common to many of America's inner cities. The pressure to \naddress, not only the police accountability and criminal justice \nissues, but the context in which those issues arise, grows \nexponentially with each new tragedy.\n  As we watch American cities battered, bruised and burned during \ndemonstrative outcries against injustice, I am reminded of the words of \nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. ``We are now faced with the fact that \ntomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In \nthis unfolding conundrum of life and history, there ``is'' such a thing \nas being too late. This is no time for apathy or complacency. This is a \ntime for vigorous and positive action.'' These words are just as true \ntoday as they were when Dr. King delivered them at the 1963 March on \nWashington.\n  Far too often, unarmed African American men die at the hands at \npolice officers with little or no accountability. This reinforces the \npainful narrative that black life is not valued in this country. It is \nsad, yet very telling, that Americans celebrated when state officials \nannounced that criminal charges were being brought against the \nBaltimore police involved in Freddie Gray's death. For too long, \nAfrican-American communities nationwide felt as if no one could hear \nits cry. But the cries are not just the result of pain caused by police \nbrutality. They are the result of a nation divided: one that grants \naccess to quality healthcare to some, while denying it for others; one \nthat provides economic security for a privileged few, while denying \nopportunities to the poor and the middle class; one that seeks justice \nfor the unwarranted taking of a human life; while ignoring the rising \ndeath toll of American youth at the hands of police officers.\n  We cannot view the situations in Baltimore and Ferguson as limited \nincidents; instead, we have to look at the toxic environments that \nbirthed these situations of unrest. If we do not comprehensively \naddress the systemic issues that plague cities like Baltimore, \nrelations between the people and its government will only grow worse. \nIt is time that we honor the sacred truth of this nation--that all men \nare created equal, and demand equal justice. As we strive to become a \nmore perfected union, it is imperative that the commitments of the \nAmerican system be applied to African-Americans, just as it is to every \nother American. Madam Speaker, the urgency of addressing these issues \nhas reached its pinnacle. Congress must act. We must act swiftly, and \nwe must act now.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3301-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1806, AMERICA \n COMPETES REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF \n H.R. 2250, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016; AND PROVIDING \nFOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2353, HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ACT \n                                OF 2015\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (during the Special Order of Mr. Payne) from the \nCommittee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, I thank the House for the \nopportunity to talk this evening about the 2016 President's budget \nrequest and energy policy in this Nation.\n  Madam Speaker, there are a number of energy programs in this Nation \nwhereby public lands resources are leased and energy is produced on \npublic lands and in the offshore waters of this Nation.\n  As you can see here, this is a table that explains some of the \ndifferent programs that are out there today.\n  Onshore, on Federal lands, when you produce Federal resources--or \nenergy resources--like oil, gas, coal, and other resources, you can see \nthat 50 percent of the funds from that energy production on Federal \nlands goes to the Federal Government and that 50 percent goes to the \nStates under the Mineral Leasing Act. There are no constraints \nwhatsoever in regard to how those\n\n[[Page H3302]]\n\nStates can spend those funds. So 50 percent of the money from energy \nproduction on Federal lands goes directly to the States.\n  Right here, of the 50 percent that goes to the Federal Government, 40 \npercent of that 50 percent--or 80 percent of the Federal funds--\nactually goes into what is called the reclamation fund to be used on \nwater projects in the 17 Western States. In effect, 90 percent of the \nfunds that are produced from energy production on Federal lands goes \nback and is invested, in many cases, in those same States where \nproduction occurs. There is one anomaly, and that is the State of \nAlaska, where 90 percent of the money goes back to the State with no \nstrings attached whatsoever.\n  You can see here on geothermal energy that 25 percent goes to the \nFederal Government, and 50 percent goes to the State. Even the counties \nshare in 25 percent of the revenue. For offshore alternative energy, \nsuch as wind and wave energy and things along those lines, 27 percent \nof the revenues are shared with the adjacent States.\n  I am going to come back to this one on oil and gas offshore, but I \nwill just make note that there is an extraordinary disparity in regard \nto how these different resources are treated.\n  I made reference to the Mineral Leasing Act. Again, except for in the \ncase of Alaska, when you produce energy on Federal lands, 50 percent of \nthe money goes directly to those States. Of the offshore dollars, up to \n$900 million each year goes into what is called the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, which all 50 States benefit from, for national \nparks, for urban parks, for playgrounds, and for wildlife refuges that \nthe States manage.\n  You have $150 million that goes into the Historic Preservation Fund \nto ensure the preservation of historic buildings. You have 27 percent \nin the 3-mile zone offshore of the 6 States that produce energy, and \nthey get 27 percent under section 8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf \nLands Act. Under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, you also have \n12.5 percent of the revenues given to the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, and then remaining funds go to the General Treasury.\n  Let me just recap this disparity here.\n  If you are producing energy on Federal lands onshore, 50 percent of \nthe money goes directly to the State with no strings attached; 40 \npercent of the money goes into the reclamation fund; and only 10 \npercent goes into the U.S. Treasury. If you are producing energy in the \noffshore, effectively, all of that money goes to the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  I will show you another poster here that demonstrates some of the \ndollars that have been given to States that produce offshore energy.\n  You can see here, in the case of Alaska--and this accounting \nmechanism came off of the Department of the Interior's Web site and \nfrom the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, and this pertains to \ndifferent types of sales year data, so it will vary to some degree each \nyear--that between 2009 and 2014, 97 percent of the funds that were \ngenerated from energy production on Federal revenues was returned to \nthe State of Alaska. They received $158 million out of $163.6 million \nin revenue generated on Federal lands.\n  In the case of California, 52 percent of the money went to the State \nof California. It was over half a billion dollars during that time \nperiod. To give you an idea on some of these amazing figures, you can \ngo to the State of Colorado, where they produced nearly $2 billion in \nenergy production on Federal lands, and they received over $900 million \nwith no strings attached.\n  Madam Speaker, there are two extraordinary ones. The State of New \nMexico generated $5.5 billion in revenue between 2009 and 2014 from the \nproduction of energy on Federal lands. That State received $2.75 \nbillion back, or approximately 50 percent. In the case of Wyoming, they \nproduced $11.7 billion in revenue between 2009 and 2014 from energy \nproduction on Federal lands, and they received $5.8 billion--over $1 \nbillion a year--with no strings attached whatsoever.\n  I want to be clear that I think that is great. I think that is how \nFederal policy should work. I think the revenues should be returned and \nshared with the States that host such energy production, but here is \nthe incredible, absolutely indefensible comparison of what happens with \noffshore energy revenues.\n  This shows you that, in 2009, less than 1 percent of revenues were \nreturned to the States that produced offshore energy. Those are the \nStates of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, California, and \nAlaska. Those States in 2009 generated over $5 billion in revenue for \nthe U.S. Treasury. Those 6 States--and in some cases shared with \ncounties and parishes--received only $30 million of that, or 0.56 \npercent. In 2010, they received 0.06 percent. In 2012, they produced \n$6.5 billion in revenue for the Federal Government from energy \nproduction offshore of the coasts of those States, and those 6 States \nin 2012, on $6.5 billion in revenue, shared only $837,000. \nUnbelievable--less than $100,000 per State.\n  If you take overall the comparison between 2009 and 2014, \napproximately $41 billion in revenue was produced from offshore energy \nproduction, and less than $50 million of that, or 0.12 percent, was \nshared. In the case of onshore energy, States, in some cases, are \ngetting 90 percent of the revenues. In the case of offshore energy, the \n6 States that produce all of this offshore energy are receiving 0.12 \npercent, not the 90 percent and not the 50 percent. They are receiving \n0.12 percent.\n  Madam Speaker, you have to ask: What roles do these six States play \nin our overall energy production?\n  It is pretty amazing. With just 2 percent of the offshore Outer \nContinental Shelf actually leased, the oil production offshore accounts \nfor 18 percent of all of the oil production in the United States. With \njust 2 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf offshore leased for \nenergy production, that production is approximately 5 percent of the \nNation's natural gas production. For example, in 2014, it generated \nincredible numbers--$7.3 billion. This is one of the largest recurring \nnontaxed revenue streams that goes into the U.S. Treasury each year.\n  To add insult to injury, I guess it would be five of the six States \nthat produce offshore energy only have 3 miles of State waters, which \nmeans they only get 100 percent of revenues from State water energy \nproduction, which would be between zero and 3 miles offshore of their \ncoasts.\n  In the cases of Florida, which doesn't produce energy, and the State \nof Texas, they actually have three times that--or 9 miles--of State \nwaters. So you have disparity, and that onshore production gets 50 to \n90 percent of the revenues. In the case of offshore production, the \nStates only get 0.12 percent of the revenues to date, and you have the \nfact that the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, California, \nand Alaska only have 3 miles of State waters. In the cases of Texas and \nFlorida, they have 3 marine leagues, or, roughly, 9 miles, of State \nwaters. The disparity is unbelievable.\n  This House has taken many efforts dating back decades ago, with some \nof the more recent ones in the mid-nineties, to try to rectify--to try \nto address--this disparity. Dating back to the mid-nineties, the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act, known as CARA, brought together such \ndiverse interests as those of Congressman Don Young of Alaska and \nCongressman George Miller of California, who are two Members who, I am \nquite certain, agreed upon nothing except for this. It was really \namazing to see this House pass legislation bringing together everyone \nfrom the oil and gas community to the environmental community in order \nto ensure that these resources were reinvested back into coastal States \nthat produced energy and back into ensuring that we conserve and \nprotect our outdoors and opportunities for future generations. \nUnfortunately, that legislation, despite passing the House with a \nstrong margin, didn't pass in the Senate.\n\n  Rolling forward to the early 2000s, in 2001, as I recall and I \nbelieve again in 2003, additional efforts included in the Energy Policy \nAct, during a conference report, passed the House of Representatives, \nonce again, with a strong margin to share offshore energy revenues with \nthe States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, California, Alaska, and \nthose States that produced offshore energy. Unfortunately, those \nefforts died in the United States Senate.\n  Then you roll forward to 2006. In 2006, the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act--in December of that year--was\n\n[[Page H3303]]\n\nenacted. What that did is that largely replicated an offer that \nPresident Truman made to the States decades ago whereby President \nTruman offered those States that produced offshore energy 37\\1/2\\ \npercent of all of the revenues generated from energy production in \nFederal waters. Those States, apparently, turned down that offer from \nPresident Truman and asked for a higher share. Despite that being \noffered decades and decades ago, it was not until 2006 when Congress \nfinally acted and enacted again what is known as the Gulf of Mexico \nEnergy Security Act, which would share 37\\1/2\\ percent of revenues from \nnew energy production. I want to be clear on that distinction--new \nenergy production--which is energy production that occurs prospectively \nafter December of 2006.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  It is not 37\\1/2\\ percent of all energy production. It is not 37\\1/2\\ \npercent of these numbers you see here, of the overall energy \nproduction, the billions of dollars. It is merely a fraction of that. \nSo it is not anything close to parity with what happens for onshore \nrevenues, but it is a start; and it is establishing parity in onshore \nand offshore policy, and it is a movement in the right direction.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the State of Louisiana, we actually passed a \nconstitutional amendment with an amazing margin that dedicated every \npenny of those revenues from the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, \nGOMESA, here, dedicated every penny of it to hurricane protection and \ncoastal restoration, to making our coastal communities and our coastal \necosystem more resilient, ensuring that we don't see a repeat of what \nwe all witnessed from Hurricane Katrina, where in our home State of \nLouisiana we had over 1,200 of our brothers and sisters, of our \nneighbors, of our friends, of our coworkers lose their lives--over \n1,200.\n  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 caused or resulted in gasoline \nprice spikes nationwide to the tune of 75 cents a gallon--nationwide \naverage. And again in 2008 we saw price spikes $1.40 a gallon on \naverage in the 50 States--$1.40--constituting the largest price spike \nin gasoline since the Arab oil embargo.\n  Mr. Speaker, you may be wondering the reason I am here tonight. The \nreason I am here tonight is to talk about the President's budget \nrequest. This year, when the President submitted his budget request, he \nsubmitted a request where he proposes to withdraw the Gulf of Mexico \nEnergy Security Act, to withdraw the pittance--or in 2014, the $8.6 \nmillion--that was split among the four Gulf States that produce \noffshore energy, trying to prevent that from ever happening again.\n  In the President's budget request he says: This proposal generates \n$5.6 billion in savings over 10 years through legislative reform \nproposals, including oil and gas management reforms to encourage \ndiligent development of Federal energy resources while improving the \nreturn to taxpayers from relative reforms.\n  Well, let's talk about that for a minute. He says that it is going to \ngenerate savings. He says that its management reforms on oil and gas \nproduction are going to encourage diligent development. Mr. Speaker, by \nwithdrawing revenue sharing and potentially discouraging offshore \nenergy production, that is not encouraging diligent development. It \nresults in us having to import more energy from other nations.\n  I remind you, nations like Venezuela, nations like Nigeria and many \ncountries in Africa and the Middle East that don't share America's \nvalues, we are sending hundreds of billions of dollars to those \ncountries. In 2011, over one-half of this Nation's trade deficit was \nattributable to importing energy from other nations. That effectively \nis sending jobs. It is sending hundreds of billions of dollars to those \nother countries that in many cases are taking those same dollars and \nusing them against the United States' interests around the globe. It \ndoesn't encourage diligent development of Federal energy resources, as \nthe President's budget request suggests.\n  They also say that it improves the return to taxpayers. I am \nstruggling with how this improves the return to taxpayers whenever \nstudy after study is crystal clear that proactive investment in things \nlike coastal restoration, hurricane protection, hazard mitigation \ninvestments, according to the CBO it returns $3 for every $1 invested; \naccording to a FEMA study, it returns $4 in cost savings for every $1 \ninvested; and many, many others have estimated that the cost savings \nare multiple times that.\n  Now, what is incredible to me, when we had the Secretary of the \nInterior, who I asked for a meeting, I believe it was, on February 4, \nand here we are on May 18 and we still have not been able to get that \nmeeting, including offering to meet with the Deputy Secretary or anyone \nelse who can speak intelligently on this issue. I will take the \nreceptionist, if you are watching. We have asked for that meeting.\n  In their budget request, it specifically says this cut has been \nidentified as a lower priority program activity for purpose of the GPRA \nModernization Act. Now, that is the Government Performance Results Act. \nSo I said: Well, wow, they did an evaluation. So let's go ahead and ask \nthe Secretary, Madam Secretary, could you explain to me how you did an \nevaluation and what the outcome of that was?\n  Well, her first response was: What is GPRA?\n  Well, this is in her budget request, and she asked me what GPRA was, \ndespite the fact that it said they did an analysis and it determined \nthat it was a low-priority program. After I explained it, they were \nunable to answer the question.\n  I asked if they would provide us their calculation here to show how \nit is a lower priority program and how it may compare with other \nonshore programs. Of course, here we are months later, and you will be \nshocked to learn that we still have not received that information that \nsimply doesn't exist.\n  Politics, Mr. Speaker, at its best. Unbelievable.\n  You can't justify it from a policy perspective; you can't justify it \nfrom a financial perspective; you can't justify it from a resiliency \nperspective; you can't justify it from an environmental perspective. \nAbsolutely incredible.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, I would like to read a quote here from the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, from the National Wildlife Federation, and \nfrom the National Audubon Society, where they note, let's see: ``This \nproposed budget undercuts the administration's previous commitments to \nrestore critical economic infrastructure and ecosystems in the \nMississippi River Delta, where we are losing 16 square miles of \ncritical wetlands every year--a preventable coastal erosion crisis.''\n  ``We urge Congress to fund the President's commitments to coastal \nrestoration and conservation by maintaining GOMESA funding that is \nvital to the Gulf Coast and by identifying additional funding for . . . \nother priorities.''\n\n  That is a quote from the environmental community. This is the \nadministration, I guess, attempting to win accolades from the \nenvironmental community, who turned around and criticized him for that.\n  Now, the irony goes even further in that in 2013, Secretary Jewell \nactually sends out a press release saying how great these dollars that \nare being shared are. It talks about how these revenues were \ndistributed to State, local, and Federal tribes to support critical \nreclamation, conservation, and other projects. So here they are taking \ncredit for it, saying how great it is, and then they come back and make \nan about-face that they can't explain, justify, can't even meet on, and \nhaven't even been able to provide any documentation as to how they came \nto their decision.\n  In December of 2014, once again a press release from the Department \nof the Interior giving all sorts of accolades to themselves for sharing \nthese revenues and all the great investments that they will result in, \nyet in the fiscal year 2016 budget request we have seen them attempt to \nwithdraw those dollars.\n  Now, what is interesting in the press release, the administration \nsaid that this should be done because these resources, these public \nresources, these energy resources offshore, should be shared by all \nAmericans. Well, okay, let's talk about that.\n  As we noted here, for onshore production, 50 percent of the money \ngoes to the Federal Government, but of that, 80 percent of this \nactually is returned\n\n[[Page H3304]]\n\nback to the States; 50 percent goes directly to the States with no \nstrings attached. So the Federal Government only gets 10 percent. The \nFederal Government only gets 10 percent, yet they didn't cut this \nprogram.\n  So I am struggling with how they have determined that these resources \nshould be shared with all Americans, yet they are only doing it for \nthis one program and leaving this other program entirely intact. Once \nagain, the disparity cannot be defended.\n  Let's go ahead and take their idea that resources should be shared \nwith all Americans, and let's apply it to other Federal resources. What \nabout a national park? What about a national wildlife refuge? What \nabout some BLM land somewhere?\n  These facilities that charge entrance fees, they take all those \ndollars, and they give it right back to that park. The State of \nLouisiana doesn't get any of it. It goes back to the park. We don't get \nany disparate benefit from that. The State that hosts the national park \nand hosts the national wildlife refuge, it benefits from that in the \nform of tourism and economic activity and a place for their citizens to \nrecreate. Explain to me that disparity. Once again, it simply can't be \ndone.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to make note of the problem in coastal Louisiana \nand why it is so critical that these dollars be invested, that the Gulf \nof Mexico Energy Security Act be continued. In coastal Louisiana, prior \nto the Federal Government building levees on the Mississippi River, the \nAtchafalaya River, and our coastal region of the State, the State of \nLouisiana was growing to the tune of three-quarters of a square mile \nper year, on average. Our State was accreting; it was growing in land.\n  When the Corps of Engineers came in and built levees on our river \nsystem, we immediately went from growing, or accreting, to losing land. \nIn some decades, we have lost an average of 16 square miles per year. \nIn other decades, we have lost closer to 26 or 28 square miles per \nyear. In 2005, we lost nearly 200 square miles of our coast per year. \nTo add it all up, the total figure, we have lost 1,900 square miles of \nour State since the 1930s. To put it in comparison, if the State of \nRhode Island lost 1,900 square miles, the State of Rhode Island \nwouldn't exist anymore. If the State of Delaware lost 1,900 square \nmiles, it would consist only of its inland waters. Nineteen hundred \nsquare miles is an extraordinary amount of land. Then to watch this \nadministration come out and say: You know what? We are going to propose \nthis new waters of the U.S. definition, because waters of the United \nStates are so important and wetlands are so important to us, we have \ngot to protect them. Yet the Federal Government is causing the greatest \nwetlands loss in the United States--prospective, ongoing, and \nhistoric--the Federal Government, the same agency, the Corps of \nEngineers, that actually is supposed to be enforcing wetlands laws.\n  So the State of Louisiana said, yes, we are going to take these \ndollars whenever they finally begin flowing in some degree in 2017 and \n2018, we are going to take those dollars and we are going to invest \nthem. We are going to protect them by constitutional amendment. We are \ngoing to complement them with billions of dollars and other State-\ncontrolled spending, and we are going to invest them in making the \ncoast of Louisiana more resilient, making our communities more \nresilient, making the economy of this Nation more resilient.\n  I remind you, in 2005, because of hurricane impacts to the State of \nLouisiana, prices spiked 75 cents a gallon nationwide, on average. In \n2008, when hurricanes hit the Gulf Coast and Louisiana, prices spiked \n$1.40 a gallon, on average, nationwide. This is a national issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, following the 2005 hurricanes, the Federal Government \nexpended over $100 billion--by some estimates, perhaps close to $130 \nbillion or $140 billion--responding to these disasters. If we had taken \nsomewhere in the range of $8 billion to $9 billion, we could have \nprevented the 1,200 lives that were lost that I referenced earlier. We \ncould have prevented the expenditure of well over $100 billion in \ntaxpayer funds, the majority of that going toward deficit spending.\n  It doesn't save money to cut the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. \nTo the contrary, Mr. Speaker, it is going to cost our Nation more \ndollars; and history has proven that, studies by Congressional Budget \nOffice, studies by FEMA, and many others have proven that this is \npenny-wise and pound-foolish. It will result in additional deaths. It \nwill result in additional flooding. It will result in additional \neconomic disruption in this Nation, and it is the wrong approach.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I am going to say it one more time. Onshore \nenergy revenues are shared 90 percent between the Mineral Leasing Act \nand the Bureau of Reclamation funds, 90 percent; offshore energy \nrevenues, we get well less than 1 percent, well less than 1 percent per \nyear today. And as we try and slowly begin addressing the disparity but \nnowhere close to what happens for onshore production, when we try to do \nthe right thing and make sure that these funds are constitutionally \nprotected to be invested in making the communities more resilient, \nmaking the ecosystem more resilient, and addressing the wrongs of the \nFederal Government, addressing natural resource flaws of the Federal \nGovernment, we now have this administration who is supposed to be the \nenvironmental administration coming out and taking these dollars away, \nwhich is once again why the Environmental Defense Fund, National \nWildlife Federation, Audubon Society, and many, many others came out \nagainst this.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to urge, as we continue to move through \nthe appropriations bills and continue to work on energy policy, that we \ntruly seek to do what the President says in regard to an all-of-the-\nabove policy, which includes conventional fuels, to ensure that the \nStates that are producing these energies receive some type of \nmitigative funds or revenue sharing, to ensure that the State of \nAlaska, that the East Coast and other States that are bringing offshore \nproduction online are treated fairly, and to ensure that these dollars \nare reinvested back in the resilience of these communities and in the \necosystem.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3304-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3304-H3307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  2030\n                              CURRENT NEWS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Katko).

Well, that was something that we weren't expecting back when \nPresident Bush went into Iraq when he made that call that some day, \nSaudi Arabia and others in the Middle East would become so nervous \nabout the chaos created in the Middle East that they would determine: \nWe may need to get nuclear weapons ourselves. In the past, we have \nalways been comforted by the fact that the United States would keep \npeace in the Middle East. They wouldn't let anything get out of hand. \nThey would keep other Middle Eastern countries, especially radical \nIslamist countries, from having nukes.\n  This administration has shown it is not capable of preventing nukes \nfrom proliferation in the Middle East, so therefore, our allies our \ngetting quite nervous.\n  Here is an article from today by a brilliant prosecutor of the \noriginal bomber of the World Trade Center in 1993, Andrew McCarthy. It \nis dated today, May 18. The title of his article in National Review \nsays: ``The Iraq Question is the Iran Question--At Least It Should \nBe.''\n  He goes on to point to the question that is being asked of some \nRepublican Presidential candidates. Obviously, the mainstream media, \nthose that donate\n\n[[Page H3305]]\n\nto the Clinton foundation, and those kind of folks--those that would \ntake a hostile position against Republicans in debates, those who act \nas mediators or emcees in a debate would actually speak on behalf of \nthe Democrat--they are not asking this question of Democrats, but it is \na legitimate question.\n  This is what Andrew McCarthy brings up. He says: ``Was it a mistake \nto invade, knowing what we know now?''\n  He is talking about Iraq.\n  Mr. McCarthy says:\n\n       It is a very fair point that the question should not be \n     asked solely of Republicans--Hillary Clinton and other \n     Democrats who supported the war should be grilled, too.\n\n  He says further down: ``Many of us who supported the Iraq war based \nthat support on the principles enunciated in the Bush doctrine.''\n  Then he sets out his take on the Bush doctrine. I think it is well \nset out.\n  It says: ``Attack the jihadists wherever they operate and make rogue \nstates understand that if they support the terrorists we will treat \nthem as enemies. In that calculation, Iraq was an enemy regardless of \nwhether it had weapons of mass destruction. It''--talking about Iraq--\n``obviously was not the worst such enemy--Iran was. And it obviously \nwas a potentially more dangerous enemy if it had weapons of mass \ndestruction that could have been shared with jihadists. Iraq, \nnevertheless, was surely in the camp of states that, using Bush's `with \nus or against us' metric, was against us.''\n  Then we have an article here from IJReview: ``U.S. Special Forces \nJust Took Out a Top ISIS Leader--And Captured His Sex Slavery-Condoning \nWife,'' by Justen Charters.\n  It says: ``While airstrikes continue to hammer ISIS positions, it \nturns out that that is not the only thing the jihadists need to worry \nabout. U.S. Special Forces appear to be doing more than just training \n`rebels,' they're now engaging the enemy. And, they just put down a top \nIslamic State leader: Abu Sayyaf.\n  ``USA Today reported further on the operation, which will be hurting \nthe terrorists' bankroll and morale.''\n  It goes out to set out something from USA Today.\n  That is such an intriguing story, Mr. Speaker. I find it very \nintriguing because I can't remember how many times, but it was many \ntimes that the President and other members of this administration said: \nThere will be no boots on the ground in Syria in this area--no boots on \nthe ground.\n  We were told that over and over, which is really perplexing because \nwe all trust the same people that told us, If you like your insurance, \nyou can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep him--all these \nthings--that they are not going to persecute people of religious \nbeliefs, then they persecuted them.\n  Who would have thought that this administration would say there will \nbe no boots on the ground and then put boots on the ground?\n  Now, it could have been, in fairness to the administration, that they \nhovered and were able to lift up the wife of the ISIS leader without \nactually getting boots on the ground, or it is quite possible they \ndidn't wear boots. Maybe they were wearing moccasins or something like \nthat; maybe they went barefoot, and that would explain why those in the \nadministration would say: We will never put boots on the ground; no \nboots are going to be on the ground.\n  Maybe they really weren't wearing boots. I know boots have come a \nlong way since I was in the Army, and I never did understand why we had \nto wear those black boots that you had to spit-shine to shine them up. \nIt made no sense to me.\n  I like the new boots the military is wearing now much better; but \nmaybe they have got some other shoes they have figured out so they \ndon't have to actually put boots on the ground.\n  In any event, what happened in the Middle East is most intriguing.\n  Then we have a story today from Judicial Watch. Judicial Watch has \nnow gotten documentation as a result of a court order on May 15. They \nhave been able to get more documentation than Congress has been able to \nget because they are fighting this administration in court, and they \nare getting court orders to force the issues.\n\n  The only way you will get information out of this transparent Obama \nadministration is if you bring them out kicking and screaming with the \ndocuments, under threat of what a judge can order and do; that is \nobvious because, as a Member of Congress asking for the documents that \nwere provided in discovery in 2008 to the convicted terrorists in the \nHoly Land Foundation trial, I got on a Web site one time. I asked for \nthe boxes of documents that the Justice Department gave to the \nterrorists.\n  I understand Attorney General Holder was saying there may be \nclassification issues, but I keep coming back to the point they gave \nthem to terrorists. Surely, you can give them to Members of Congress, \nbut that also points to a problem that is ongoing in this \nadministration. They keep helping the wrong people.\n  In Egypt, we have been told by the administration: Gee, President \nMorsi was elected in a very questionable election, and there were \nallegations of a great deal of fraud.\n  But I was told by Egyptians that it was made clear to the opponent of \nMorsi that, if he raised any issues about fraud in the election, the \nMuslim Brothers would burn the country down, and he chose not to \ncontest what was some apparent fraud in the election.\n  Morsi allegedly got 13 million votes or so, and despite the fact--\nwell, at least reported by many news organizations--there were over 30 \nmillion Egyptians out of their 90 million or so in the country that \nwent to the streets peaceably.\n  It was the largest demonstration, peaceable or otherwise, in the \nhistory of the world, from the best I can find out. They went to the \nstreets. They demanded a nonradical Islamist President. They demanded \nthe peaceable ouster of Morsi, who they believed had committed treason \nand who they understood had basically torn up, figuratively, the \nconstitution that the U.S. Government was helpful advising in, but \nsomehow, our advisers did not persist in making sure they had a \nprovision for a peaceful impeachment of the President of Egypt. They \nhad no way to get him out.\n  These moderate Muslims--and I have talked to a number of them that \nwere there demonstrating--these secularists, Christians, Jews, and the \nCoptic Pope himself told me how moved he was to have so many people \nfrom so many walks being an encouragement: We don't want you persecuted \nin our country of Egypt anymore. It is not right.\n  Naturally, what would the Obama administration do? They would demand \nthat the man that was figuratively shredding the constitution in Egypt, \nthat was persecuting Christians, that was weaponizing the Sinai, which \nwas building the radical Islamism organization within Egypt, this \nadministration was giving them weapons, wanted to help them any way \nthey could, which leads to the question that I have been asked by \nmoderate Arab Muslim leaders in the Middle East: Why does this \nadministration keep helping the Muslim Brothers? Do you not understand \nthey are at war with you?\n  Well, it should have been clear, but this administration was helping \nthe wrong side. It didn't stop with pushing for the ouster of this \ncountry's ally in Egypt, Mubarak. This administration decided to oust \nQadhafi, a dictator with blood on his hands from the eighties and \nnineties.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  After 2003, after the Bush administration ordered the taking out of \nSaddam Hussein, Qadhafi got scared, opened up his weapons, says he will \nnot pursue nukes; he will do whatever the United States tells him with \nregard to his weapons.\n  As some in Israel have told me, he was really helping with \ninformation against terrorists more than anybody but maybe us; yet this \nadministration undertook a bombing effort against Qadhafi.\n  Now, we find out confirmation from documents that have been acquired \nby Judicial Watch that this administration was actually helping with \nweapons, at least that is the way it appears; that is what we have been \nhearing all along.\n  Some have said even in my trip to Libya with friends Steve King and \nMichelle Bachmann, if it weren't for the Obama administration bombing \nQadhafi, they could not have gotten him out of office, and he would \nstill be helping us find and kill terrorists.\n\n[[Page H3306]]\n\n  Now, Libya is in chaos. There are Muslim Brothers doing the best they \ncan to put Egypt in chaos. Syria is now in chaos. Iran is taking over \nmore and more, including, just last September, this President referred \nto the success story in Yemen. Now, Iran is the power player in Yemen, \nnot the United States. The Obama administration in Yemen basically has \nbeen whipped by Iran.\n  This is scary stuff, when you look at what has happened in the Middle \nEast since this administration took over. The story from Judicial Watch \ndated May 18, it is pretty timely, includes information about the \ndocumentation that was ordered by the United States District Court and \nhas now been obtained, even though the administration blacked out a lot \nof information that apparently would be embarrassing to it.\n  The story says: ``Judicial Watch announced today that it obtained \nmore than 100 pages of previously classified 'Secret' documents from \nthe Department of Defense and the Department of State revealing that \nthe DOD almost immediately reported that the attack on the U.S. \nConsulate in Benghazi was committed by the al Qaeda and Muslim \nBrotherhood-linked `Brigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman,' and had \nbeen planned at least 10 days in advance. Rahman is known as The Blind \nSheikh''--that is the one that Andrew McCarthy had prosecuted as lead \nprosecutor--``and is serving life in prison for his involvement in the \n1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terrorist acts. The new \ndocuments also provide the first official confirmation that shows the \nU.S. Government was aware of arms shipments from Benghazi to Syria. The \ndocuments also include an August 2012 analysis warning of the rise of \nISIS and the predicted failure of the Obama policy of regime change in \nSyria.\n  ``The documents were released in response to a court order in \naccordance with a May 15, 2014, Freedom of Information Act lawsuit \nfiled against both the DOD and State Department seeking communications \nbetween the two agencies and congressional leaders `on matters related \nto the activities of any agency or department of the U.S. Government at \nthe Special Mission Compound and/or classified annex in Benghazi.'\n  ``A Defense Department document from the Defense Intelligence Agency, \nDIA, dated September 12, 2012, the very day after the Benghazi attack, \ndetails that the attack on the compound had been carefully planned by \nthe'' Brigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman'' to `kill as many \nAmericans as possible.' The document was sent to then-Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, and the Obama White House National Security Council. \nThe heavily redacted Defense Department `information report' says that \nthe attack on the Benghazi facility `was planned and executed by The \nBrigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman.' The group subscribes to `al \nQaeda ideologies.' ''\n  Now, that was part of the message of September 12, 2012.\n  Now, it is understandable why President Obama would not have gotten \nthis message because, clearly, he had to get a good night's sleep \nbecause he was going to a campaign event in Las Vegas on September 12. \nHe surely didn't have time to review this material in pursuit of his \ncampaign. Here he was, just less than 2 months away from election day.\n  It is understandable that he would not get the information and would \nnot know that this was not about a video; it was about a carefully \nplanned attack by subscribers to al Qaeda.\n  The Defense Intelligence Agency knew that, and that message was sent \nto Hillary Clinton. It was sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and it \nwas sent to those who were not out campaigning in Las Vegas at the \nWhite House.\n  The article goes on: ``The attack was planned 10 or more days prior \non approximately 01 September 2012. The intention was to attack the \nconsulate and to kill as many Americans as possible to seek revenge for \nU.S. killing of Aboyahiye''--also lists him as Alaliby--``in Pakistan \nand in memorial of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade \nCenter buildings.''\n  This is quoting from the DIA report. It says: `` `A violent radical . \n. . the leader of BCOAR is Abdul Baset,' '' also called Azuz. `` `Azuz \nwas sent by Zawari' ''--the leader of al Qaeda, that is--`` `to set up \nal Qaeda bases in Libya.' The group's headquarters were set up with the \napproval of a `member of the Muslim Brotherhood movement . . . where \nthey have large caches of weapons. Some of those caches are disguised \nby feeding troughs for livestock. They have SA-7 and SA-2\\3/4\\ MANPADS \n. . . they train almost every day focusing on religious lessons and \nscriptures, including three lessons a day of jihadist ideology.' ''\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very confused by that. I don't understand how these \nMuslim Brothers, these jihadists, could be studying scripture, and this \nis quoting from the Defense Intelligence Agency report, when it says \nthey are focused on religious lessons and scriptures, including three \nlessons a day of jihadist ideology because this Defense Intelligence \nAgency reports they are studying religious lessons and scripture, \nclaiming to be Islamists.\n\n  That couldn't possibly be because this administration has made clear \nthese people are not religious. They are not Islamists. They have \nnothing to do with Islam. These people are just ne'er-do-wells. I don't \nunderstand why the Defense Intelligence Agency would report that they \nwere studying religious lessons when they are not religious at all, \naccording to this administration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I take you back to that so-called Arab Spring, when this \nadministration was helping the Muslim Brothers, and I stood right here \non this floor and pointed out: Look, we know that there are al Qaeda in \nthese rebels. We don't know what percentage; we don't now how many, but \nwe know there is some al Qaeda in these rebels that this administration \nis helping. We should wait and not keep militarily supporting people \nthat we know include al Qaeda until we find out more.\n  But this administration went ahead.\n  As this story says: ``The Defense Department reported the group \nmaintained written documents in `a small rectangular room, \napproximately 12 meters by 6 meters . . . that contain information on \nall of the al Qaeda activity in Libya' ''--wow, al Qaeda ties.\n  Anyway, ``The DOD documents also contain the first official \ndocumentation that the Obama administration knew that weapons were \nbeing shipped from the Port of Benghazi to rebel troops in Syria.''\n  An October 2012 report also is confirming: ``Weapons from the former \nLibya military stockpiles''--which word is we helped get there--``were \nshipped from the Port of Benghazi, Libya, to the Port of Banias and the \nPort of Borj Islam, Syria. The weapons shipped during late August 2012 \nwere sniper rifles, RPGs, and 125-millimeter and 155-millimeter \nhowitzers missiles.''\n  Anyway, it goes on. The DIA report said ``the opposition in Syria was \ndriven by al Qaeda and other extremist Muslim groups: `the Salafist, \nthe Muslim Brotherhood, and AQI are the major forces driving the \ninsurgency in Syria,' '' which this administration wants to keep \ncalling vetted moderate Syrian rebels, when their own report says they \nhave got al Qaeda ties.\n  As this says: ``The deterioration of the situation has dire \nconsequences on the Iraqi situation,'' and it goes on to set those out.\n  I think the big question that should be forcefully put to former \nPresident George W. Bush and anybody who is running for President the \nnext time, they ought to be asked this question: If you had known \nbefore we went into Iraq, going after the brutal dictator Saddam \nHussein, who had killed hundreds of thousands of people, including \nKurds, with chemical weapons and other weapons, and you knew he could \nbe ousted, and after a surge, the war could be won; but then that, \nafter your victory in Iraq, following the surge, you would be followed \nas President with an administration that was too incompetent to \nnegotiate a status of forces agreement with Iraq, and so you end up \nhaving--that administration is going to have to leave and actually \ncommit other acts that will help create absolute chaos in the Middle \nEast; and you are going to be followed by this administration that will \nhelp the Muslim Brothers that your Muslim allies in the Middle East \nsay, The Muslims Brothers are at war with you, yet this administration \nthat follows you will keep helping America's enemies, and that, because \nof the creation of chaos by this\n\n[[Page H3307]]\n\nsucceeding administration, Iran will be pursuing nuclear weapons; and \nthat the succeeding administration will be so incompetent and clueless \nas to what is happening in the Middle East, they think it is okay to \nlet them keep enriching uranium, pursuing nukes, and it gets so bad \nthat this next administration will even cause our allies like Saudi \nArabia, to go buy nukes; and then we end up with this subsequent \nadministration that helps the Muslim Brothers create more chaos than we \ncould have imagined, knowing all of that, would you go into Iraq?\n  That is a question.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  But it is really a tough question. How in the world would President \nGeorge W. Bush have known that he would be followed by such \nincompetence that would help our enemies and would just create chaos \nacross the entire Middle East such that our friends would be in \nconferences with people like me going: We don't understand America \nanymore. You keep helping your enemies. We don't get it. We thought we \nwere your friends, but you are helping the people at war with you.\n  I mean, how could President George W. Bush be expected to anticipate \nthat that is the kind of thing that would follow his administration and \ncompletely destroy the situation in the Middle East and in Iraq and in \nthe Sinai and in Gaza and in Libya, in Lebanon, in Syria, a massive \nmigration into Jordan. Jordanian pilots now to the point they would be \nburned alive. Christians raped, persecuted, killed in all kinds of \nhorrendous ways. Jews ostracized, killed.\n  Who would have ever dreamed that we would have an administration come \nin and take the success after the surge and turn it into the chaos it \nis today?\n  So I will be interested, Mr. Speaker, in the days ahead, as people \nseek to lead this country, to find out which leaders would have gone \nahead into Iraq, knowing the chaos they would create in the subsequent \nadministration.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3307-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Culberson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account \nof flight delays.\n  Mr. Lamborn (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \na flight delay.\n  Mr. Tiberi (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \nflight delays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/18/house-section/article/H3307-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BILLS PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Karen L.
