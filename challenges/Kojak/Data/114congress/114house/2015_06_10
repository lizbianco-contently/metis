The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, TSA is the government agency that is \nsupposed to keep us safe at airports, safe from would-be terrorists \nthat would go through screening and get on America's airplanes. It \ncomes about as a result of the 9/11 attacks on our Nation.\n  Anybody who flies has been through firsthand--no pun intended--the \nTSA experience at airports. I, like many Members of Congress, go \nthrough TSA screening two times a week, back and forth from my district \nin Texas. I know numerous TSA employees. Many of them are my friends.\n  My comments today are not about the TSA employees, but recent news \nreports about what is taking place at TSA generally, and these news \nreports are disturbing, Mr. Speaker.\n  Recent internal investigation has revealed that 67 out of 70 times \nbanned items got through TSA screening at airports through undercover \ninvestigations. That is a 96 percent failure rate or, looking at it the \nother way, that is a grade of 4. TSA gets a grade of 4, Mr. Speaker.\n  Now, one example, there was an instance where a TSA screener failed \nto find a fake bomb strapped to the back of an undercover agent going \nthrough screening. This was even after the fake bomb set off the \nmagnetometer. They still didn't find it. Now, isn't that lovely? Good \nthing it was a fake bomb. Fortunately, this was a test. This was part \nof the undercover investigation. It was not a terrorist seeking \nmischief at America's airports.\n  There is more alarming news. Not just the fact that the investigation \nshows a grade of 4 in folks that are going through the security system, \nit is also reported this week that TSA failed to identify 73 airport \nworkers who were linked to terrorism. Now, what is this? These are not \nTSA employees. These are the folks that work behind the security area \nin the airport, and TSA was not able to identify 73 airport workers \nlinked to terrorism. Now, isn't that lovely? These people, you see, are \nthe people who go to the airport every day, maybe sometimes go through \na special line to get behind the security area.\n  TSA claims it didn't have access to the terror watch list \ninformation, so it couldn't identify these potential bad guys. I \npersonally find that difficult to believe that the agency in charge of \nsecurity at the airport is not able to get security background \ninformation about people that work behind security at the airport. In \nany event, that is not an acceptable excuse for this type of action.\n  You know, Mr. Speaker, a grade of 4 would not be acceptable anywhere, \nanyplace in our society, at a business, at school, anywhere, the TSA \ngrade of 4.\n  I will give you another example. Let's say you want to have a home \nsecurity system at your residence, and you go out and you solicit \ndifferent folks that are in the home security business. You meet one \nsales rep, and you start asking the sales rep, ``How good is the \nsecurity system?'' The security guy says, ``Well, we have a grade of 4. \nWe have a 4 success rate. 96 percent failure rate.'' You probably \nwouldn't hire that guy to install the security system on your home.\n  If you ask him a few more questions and he says, ``We are not only in \ncharge of the security for your home, but we secure the folks that work \non your residence when you are gone to work, the plumber, the welder, \nor the guy who comes in your house, whatever,'' then if you found out \nthat those people who are allowed to go in your home and work through \nthis security system have a reputation for being burglars, you probably \nwouldn't hire this security agency to do the security on your home.\n  That is exactly what is happening at our airports. The success rate \nis only 4. We wouldn't hire that agency to do our home, but yet here is \nthe agency that we have to guard our airports.\n  This is not an indictment about TSA employees, but I think it is an \nalarming concern about TSA's general management. The problem is the TSA \nmodel of security. It can only get a grade of 4--which would not be \nacceptable under any system.\n  You know, there really can't be mistakes and errors like this at our \nNation's airports. One thing that we could\n\n[[Page H4008]]\n\ndo, one consideration is we could go to private screening at our \nairports. The law allows for that. Airports ought to consider those \nprivate screeners and maybe think it through, whether or not that is a \nbetter alternative to the TSA system that gets a grade of 4.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4008-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHANGE THE CONVERSATION TO HELP AMERICA'S CHILDREN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend and all day on cable \nnews ever since, we watched a police officer in McKinney, Texas, \nwrestle with a 14-year-old teenager after what was reported to be a \npool party. He throws her to the ground, pulls his gun out and points \nit at some other kids, screams at her, and then sits on the teenager, \nwho is in her bikini, for a period of time. This is the latest \ninstallment of the hit cable television news story of the last year or \nmore called ``Cops Behaving Badly Caught on Tape.''\n  This version was not the most deadly, although there have been \nversions of this story that end in death. It has caused a lot of hot \nair on radio and TV. Some of it is constructive, and some of it is just \noffensive.\n  But has it caused a more serious discussion of police and communities \nof color? Has it sparked a more serious discussion about how teenagers \nand police interact or should interact? I hope so, but I kind of doubt \nit.\n  Recently, I met with a young man from Chicago who made a real \nimpression on me. He is from the Phoenix Military Academy, a smart \nteenager. He is going to go places. He said: You know what, \nCongressman? I have taught myself strategies to deescalate the \nsituation whenever I come in contact with police.\n  Did you hear that? A teenager feels he needs to teach himself ways to \ndeescalate tensions with adult police officers. We are apparently \nleaving it up to our teenagers to figure out ways to deal with the \npolice, which is precisely backwards from how things ought to be.\n  What the videotape from Texas and the comment from my young friend at \nPhoenix Military Academy in Chicago have in common is that there does \nnot seem to be any communication between adults on the police side and \nyoung people in our community, who the police are sworn to protect. \nInstead of a cooperative relationship between teenagers and adults who \nare there to protect them, there is an adversarial relationship.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I looked around while I was at a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing on policing strategies in the 21st century, and all I \nsaw were people who were 50, 60, and 70 years old. There were no young \npeople called to testify, to tell us what they face, how they feel, and \nwhat we, as adults, should do to help them.\n  Very few of us are former or current law enforcement. And while all \nof us are former teenagers, still, for most of us, it has been quite \nawhile since we were a teenager, and our experiences may not be all \nthat typical of what young people and the police face today.\n  I hope adults like me in places of influence and authority can be \nhelpful in creating the conditions where avenues of communication are \ncreated, but a 3-hour hearing with political undertones and more than a \nlittle grandstanding is not nearly enough.\n  Almost every city in America is one bad incident, an overzealous \npoliceman, or a videotaped moment of stupidity or hatred away from a \nriot. Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and Freddie Gray are \nnames we know, but knowing their names is just not enough. We need a \nsustained effort from Congress and from every institution in our \nsociety to address the chasm between young people, and especially young \npeople in communities of color and the police hired to keep them safe.\n  And let's remember, while the country was transfixed with a video of \nthe cop, the teenagers, and the pool party in Texas, two of my \nconstituents were shot and killed this past weekend in Chicago. They \nwere among 5 dead in Chicago and among 27 people shot from Friday to \nMonday. At least 5 people were killed and 25 others were shot in and \naround Chicago the weekend before; 12 dead and 56 were wounded over the \nlong Memorial Day weekend.\n  Knowing the names of Sandy Hook, Newtown, and Columbine are not \nenough when Baltimore, Chicago, and other cities are also losing young \npeople--mostly young people--at this rate.\n  It goes beyond police practices and the easy availability of guns, \nbut that is part of it. When legislators spend more time making guns \neasier to carry and stand-your-ground laws make murder wraps easier to \nbeat, our priorities are skewed.\n  It goes beyond racial profiling, but that is part of it. When 84 \npercent of sobriety checkpoints in Chicago are set up in Black and \nLatino neighborhoods so that cops can stop anyone who drives by, that \nsends a message that is destructive.\n  It goes beyond economic opportunity, but that is also part of it. \nHonestly, we do not spend much time in this Congress thinking about how \nwe help 10- and 12-year-olds know that a bright future is possible for \nthem. We do not do much for children to help them achieve their future, \nbut instead we cut things like Head Start and spend more and more money \non jails.\n  Listen, in America, we must change the conversation so that we as a \nnation are working together to help make sure the next generation lives \nto adulthood first. We need to stop talking so much about what protects \nus from those kids and start talking more about what we as adults are \ngoing to do to protect those kids from the world we have created for \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4008-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4008-H4009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HELPING FAMILIES IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on some of the issues my \nfriend from Chicago just stated, I couldn't disagree more. Let me \nexplain why, why we have problems with our prisons in America and \nhomelessness.\n  Nearly 10 million Americans have severe mental illness like \nschizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. Yet millions are \ngoing without treatment as families struggle to find care for loved \nones.\n  Over the last 30 years, we have shut down the old asylums and what we \nhave seen is an increase in incarceration, suicide, homelessness, \nemergency room visits, unemployment, substance abuse, and substance \nabuse deaths. We have failed on all these metrics.\n  Anyone who thinks we are being successful in helping those with \nsevere mental illness is delusional. We have traded the old hospital \nbed for the prison cell, the emergency room gurney, the homeless \nshelter, and the cemetery. We have seen horrible and disturbing \nincreases of the mentally ill being victims of crime, like sexual \nassault, robbery, and bullying. In fact, we lose 40,000 Americans to \nsuicide each year, and there are another 1.3 million suicide attempts.\n  These stories are haunting, and the numbers are staggering. Four \nmillion people with serious mental illness are not receiving treatment. \nThere is a shortage of 1,000 psychiatric hospital beds nationwide, so \nthere is often nowhere to go when there is a crisis.\n  How cruel and tragic it was when Senator Creigh Deeds of Virginia \ntook his son to a hospital to be told there were no psychiatric beds, \nand we know the tragic outcome of that story and the thousands of times \nit is repeated every year.\n  We have one child psychiatrist for every 2,000 children with a mental \nhealth disorder. While we know that 50 percent of severe mental illness \nemerges by age 14 and 75 percent by age 24, we don't have a sufficient \nnumber of professionals to treat it, so it gets worse.\n  We have Federal rules to protect privacy, which has frustrated \ncountless numbers of doctors and family members, generating 70,000 \nofficial complaints. It was meant to improve patient care, but it acts \nas an impossible barrier to breach because loving family members can't \nconnect with someone with serious mental illness.\n  We have a mental health agency in this country that the Federal \nGovernment has that doesn't employ a single psychiatrist. This is what \nthe American taxpayer buys for $130 billion a year. Is this success \nfrom the over 112 Federal programs and agencies meant to deal with \nmental illness?\n\n[[Page H4009]]\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  We have failed not because we don't know what to do when it comes to \neffectively identifying and treating mental illness, but it is because \nthe Federal Government has stood in the way with poorly administered \npolicies and antiquated attitudes.\n  Our ability to treat serious mental illness is in the 21st century. \nWe know more effective treatments for this brain illness. However, our \nbeliefs about mental illness are still mired in the 19th century. As \nlong as we think that mental illness is an attitude or a difference in \nperception or that hallucinations and delusions are bizarrely labeled \nas nonconsensus reality, we are wrong.\n  Quite simply, we have created the most difficult system for those who \nhave the most difficulty. Now is the time to change and turn this \nsystem from top to bottom.\n  That is why I have reintroduced the Helping Families in Mental Health \nCrisis Act, H.R. 2646. It reforms Federal programs, removes Federal \nbarriers to care, and refocuses research that is updated and innovative \nlegislation that will produce a new paradigm of treatment for those \nwith serious mental health problems.\n  This bill empowers parents and caregivers to access care before stage \nIV. It fixes shortages of inpatient beds, helps to reach underserved in \nrural populations, expands the mental health workforce, drives \nevidence-based care, provides alternatives to institutionalization. It \nintegrates primary and behavioral care. It increases the mental health \nworkforce in underserved areas by volunteerism. It increases minorities \nin the mental health workforce. It advances critical mental research \nand brings accountability to mental health and substance abuse parity \nin this Nation.\n  If we want to get people treatment, not jail time, not abandonment; \nif we want to help the tens of millions of people affected by mental \nillness and the hundreds of millions of friends and relatives who are \nemotionally strained; if we want accountability, transparency, and more \neffective spending of Federal dollars to get care in the community \nwhere it is needed; if we want to stop victimization of the mentally \nill; if we want to prevent the next Newtown, Tucson, Aurora, Isla \nVista, Columbine, or Navy Yard, we have to do something comprehensive \nand research based, and we have to do it now.\n  What we need is not only for Congress to act, but, during these next \nfew weeks, we need to hear from every doctor and first responder and \nteacher and parent and patient and judge and consumer that we have to \nact thoroughly and thoughtfully and responsibly and now.\n  On every concern, America needs to speak up and speak out. We need to \nstart treating mental illness as we do other diseases like AIDS or \ncancer or diabetes, and this legislation, H.R. 2646, gives us the tools \nto do so. We need evidence-based care before crisis; we need treatment \nbefore tragedy.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill, the Helping Families in \nMental Health Crisis Act, because treatment delayed is treatment \ndenied, and this legislation marks a new dawn for mental health in \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4009-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, House action is expected on trade \nprovisions this week. A vote on a package that establishes the rules \nfor how the next major trade agreement will be handled, the trade \npromotion authority, may be voted on, this Friday.\n  It has been fascinating for me to hear the arguments at home and in \nWashington, D.C., of those who are opposed to trade promotion authority \nand have already decided against the Trans-Pacific Partnership before \nthe agreement is even finished.\n  The critics often cite concerns about the environment, but what I \nhear from some of my friends on the other side of this question at home \nstands in stark contrast to what I think reality is. The dreaded \n``secret negotiations'' are somehow raised as a negative.\n  To the best of my knowledge, all major serious agreements are \nnegotiated in private like all labor union contracts. It is after they \nare negotiated that the Members have them and look at whether or not it \nis worthy of their support.\n  There are concerns about various corporate advisers whispering in the \nTrade Representative's ear and having access to confidential \ninformation tilting the playing field. Last week, I met with two of \nthose sinister advisers who happen to be respected environmental \nleaders. Yes, the advisory panels include environmental leaders and, in \nfact, union leaders as well.\n  There was an interesting point that came forward in my conversation \nwith environmentalists that the only way to stop, slow, and reverse the \nrape of the oceans is by an international trade agreement, and this one \nis actually shaping up to be pretty strong.\n  Oceans are threatened by overfishing, having fishery stocks collapse; \nyet the countries in the 12 countries that are negotiating this \nagreement have, on average, a 20 percent subsidy to encourage more \nfishing, overfishing, paying their fishermen to catch the very last \nfish. The only way to deal with this is by having a multinational \nagreement that is enforceable to reduce this destructive policy.\n  Along with the oceans, there is deep concern about what is going on \nwith deforestation, the exploitation of endangered species in the \nforested areas. Since 2000, we have lost an area ten times the size of \nGreat Britain to deforestation just in the Amazon basin alone. That is \nwhy, in the last round of trade negotiations, I fought hard to have \nprovisions against illegal logging in Peru and for them to raise their \nstandards.\n  We are struggling to make sure that they are fully enforced, but \nnobody that I have talked to seriously thinks that we wouldn't be \nbetter off without an agreement. It gives us leverage, and things are \nimproving.\n  Well, likewise, we are seeing thugs illegally harvesting endangered \nspecies like elephants and rhinos. They are taking illegally harvested \nexotic timber and disrupting indigenous people.\n  No nation can prevent the exploitation by themselves, but many \nnations, armed with an enforceable agreement that we can use trade \nsanctions to be able to put teeth in it, can make a difference now and \nraise the bar for future agreements.\n  The package moving forward has faced some changes that I find \ntroubling. All major legislation that I have seen in my career in \nCongress is a mixed bag. They had some good things; they had some bad \nthings; and some things that are hard to figure out.\n  That is going to be our job this week and beyond, to make that \nevaluation; but on balance, while we are trying to figure out whether \nwe are better off with or without it, it is important that that \ndecision be made on a factual basis, not hypothetical scare tactics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4009-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4009-H4010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING THE TITUSVILLE HERALD ON ITS 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, the sciences and the facts don't lie. \nCongress has stood here for too long debating the truth about climate \nchange. What is there to debate?\n  More than 12,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies are in agreement. \nClimate change is real, and humans are significantly to blame. For \nthose of you keeping track at home, there are zero peer-reviewed \nscientific studies that state the opposite.\n  As we continue to harm the environment, we are ultimately hurting \nourselves and human health. In the movie ``Birdman,'' it was written: \n``A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing.''\n  I feel the need to remind my colleagues that climate change is a real \nthing, regardless of what is said of that climate change thing; just \nbecause you don't want to believe it doesn't make climate change any \nless real. It is rapidly becoming a threatening crisis in public \nhealth. As the planet warms, sea levels rise and lead to increased \nfloods. Droughts are more frequent and intense. Heat waves and \nhurricanes are more severe.\n  Climate change makes existing diseases and conditions worse, but it \nalso helps introduce new pests and pathogens into communities. \nRespiratory allergies and diseases are becoming more prevalent because \nof increased pollen, molds, air pollution, and dust. Higher \nconcentrations of these particles in the air cause severe breathing \nproblems and lead to heart disease, asthma attacks, inflammation, and \nlung cancer.\n  Every year, 220,000 people learn they have lung cancer, and 160,000 \npeople die from lung cancer. That is twice the population size of my \nown neighborhood, Lakeview.\n  Children who are especially vulnerable to these pollutants are harmed \nby the air they breath. Their lungs shouldn't be at risk when they go \noutside to play or walk to school, but asthma is the third leading \ncause of hospitalization among children under the age of 15.\n  Nearly half of this Nation--our Nation--lives in areas with dangerous \nlevels of pollution, 44 percent. My own district is included. Chicago \nearned itself an F in an air quality study from the American Lung \nAssociation.\n  According to the same study, the Windy City is ranked in the bottom 5 \npercent for most polluted city in terms of short-term particle \npollution in the Nation, and it is only getting worse. Not only is our \nair quality dangerous, but our most essential resource, which we all \ndepend on, our water, is at risk due to climate change.\n  Water is vital to survival. As temperatures rise, people and animals \nneed more water to maintain their health and thrive. Increases in water \ntemperature, precipitation frequency and severity, and changes in \ncoastal ecosystem health could increase the incidence of water \ncontamination. Currently, more than 840,000 people die each year from \nwater-related diseases. That is more than the entire city of San \nFrancisco.\n  Climate change is expected to produce more frequent and severe \nextreme precipitation events worldwide. Over the past 50 years, the \namount of rain falling during the most intense 1 percent of our storms \nincreased by 20 percent. These turbulent changes breed outbreaks of \nwaterborne diseases. In fact, in the United States, from 1948 to 1994, \nheavy rainfall correlated with more than half of the outbreaks of \nwaterborne disease.\n  Water sustains our economy by producing energy at power plants, \nraising livestock, and growing food crops. Many water supply sources \nare already overallocated, and people are suffering from degraded water \nquality.\n  Given our current trajectory within the Western U.S. in severe \ndrought, the competition for water resources will only increase, \nleading to great impacts on human health.\n  Albert Einstein once said: ``We can't solve today's problems by using \nthe same kind of thinking we used when we created them.'' We need to \nadjust how we think about climate change. We need to understand that \nsevere weather, pollution, and changes in our water are not only \nharmful to the planet, but harmful to the people who inhabit that \nplanet.\n  Climate change is a direct threat to humanity, and it is time we \nreexamine how we think about it, talk about it, and respond to this \ngrowing problem. The health of humans worldwide is at stake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4010-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING CANON HUTCHESON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fleischmann).

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Roybal-Allard) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce the \nProfessional's Access to Health Workforce Integration Act, better known \nas the PATH Workforce Integration Act, of 2015.\n  The National Center for Health Workforce Analysis predicts that, by \n2020, the United States will have a shortage of as high as 20,000 \nphysicians. Other projections are that we will have a shortage of up to \n250,000 public health workers. In addition, the Department of Labor \nprojects that, by the year 2025, we will need 500,000 more nurses, \n46,000 more mental and behavioral health workers, 38,000 more \npharmacists, and 15,000 more dentists.\n  There are a number of contributing factors to the projected health \ncare workforce shortage. The U.S. population by 2030 is expected to \nrise by 18 percent. The population of those over the age of 65 is \nexpected to increase three times its current rate, and the Bureau of \nHealth Professions projects a 5.2 percent increase in the utilization \nof health services. This is all happening while our current health care \nworkforce is retiring in greater numbers than we are able to graduate \nnew workers.\n\n[[Page H4011]]\n\n  While it is true the Affordable Care Act incorporated numerous \nprovisions for addressing the workforce shortage, our Nation's current \neducational infrastructure lacks the capacity to train health care \nprofessionals fast enough to fill the projected health workforce \nshortages. In our country today, we have internationally trained health \nprofessionals, residing legally in the United States, who are unable to \nwork in their chosen profession. They currently represent a missed \nopportunity to address our health care workforce shortages.\n  The PATH Act helps to address this shortage by providing the over 2 \nmillion foreign-trained health professionals legally residing in the \nUnited States the guidance that they need to work in employment \nmatching their health professional skills, education, and expertise. \nThis includes internationally trained doctors, nurses, dentists, mental \nhealth providers, and pharmacists whose linguistic and cultural skills \nwill also help improve the health needs of our diversifying Nation.\n  What the PATH Act would do is facilitate counseling and training \nopportunities to reduce barriers to the health workforce; provide \naccess to accelerated courses in English as a second language; provide \nassistance in the evaluation of foreign credentials; and help in \neducating employers about the competency of health professionals \ntrained outside of the U.S.\n  Mr. Speaker, our health care system is rapidly approaching a crisis \ndue to a lack of qualified health professionals. The PATH Act of 2015 \nwill help prevent this crisis, and I encourage my colleagues to \ncosponsor this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4011-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, NOT PEACE THROUGH ENDLESS WAR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Duncan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, several weeks ago, I spoke to \nabout 200 people at the famous Willard Hotel in Washington in a program \nput on by the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. I had been told that \nthis was a group of CEOs and owners of major companies in southern \nCalifornia--obviously, a very upper-income group.\n  I got to a point in my speech when I said: ``It is long past the time \nwe need to stop trying to run the whole world and start putting our own \npeople in our own country first once again.''\n  Much to my surprise, the audience broke into applause. Middle- and \nlower-income people have applauded when I have said similar things in \nmy district and around the country. Many upper-income people claim to \nbe moderates, and contrary to popular belief, conservatives lose most \nvery wealthy areas 2-1 or worse. I have spoken to a very wide variety \nof groups in Washington and around the country and in my district, and \nI have gotten an overwhelmingly positive response every time I have \nsaid it has been a horrible mistake to spend trillions on unnecessary \nwars in the Middle East.\n  When I was a teenager, I remember reading a publication from the \nRepublican National Committee that read: ``Democrats start wars. \nRepublicans end them.''\n  There was a time, until recent years, when the Republican Party could \nmake a legitimate claim to being the Peace Party. I sent my first \npaycheck as a bag boy at the A$19 and some cents--as a contribution \nto the Barry Goldwater campaign. I have worked on Republican campaigns \nat the national, State, and local levels for over 50 years, and it \nsaddens me to hear almost all of the Republican candidates for \nPresident try to outdo each other in their hawkishness. Based on the \nresponse I have gotten, I think it is a recipe for defeat if my \nRepublican Party becomes known as the party favoring permanent, forever \nwars--wars without end.\n  All of our candidates try to convince people that they are like \nRonald Reagan. President Reagan once wrote: ``Our troops should be \ncommitted to combat abroad only as a last resort--when no other choice \nis available.''\n  Reagan was certainly no warmonger Republican or a man eager to go to \nwar.\n  President Eisenhower, one of our greatest military leaders, was \nanother ``peacenik'' Republican. He knew of the horrors of war, unlike \nmany modern day chickenhawks. He famously warned us at the end of his \nPresidency about the dangers of being controlled by a very powerful \nmilitary-industrial complex. I think he would be shocked at how far we \nhave gone down the road that he warned us against.\n  In his book ``Ike's Bluff,'' Evan Thomas wrote: ``Eisenhower would \nperiodically sigh to Andy Goodpaster, his Chief of Staff: `God help the \nNation when it has a President who doesn't know as much about the \nmilitary as I do.' ''\n  Pat Buchanan wrote on March 20: ``In November 1956, President \nEisenhower, enraged he had not been forewarned of their invasion of \nEgypt, ordered the British, French, and Israelis to get out of Suez and \nSinai. They did as told. How far we have fallen from the America of \nIke.''\n  Senator Robert Taft, who was sometimes referred to as ``Mr. \nRepublican'' in the 1940s and 1950s, once said: ``No foreign policy can \nbe justified except a policy devoted . . . to the protection of the \nliberty of the American people, with war only as the last resort and \nonly to preserve that liberty.''\n  Most of the Republican Presidential candidates have attacked \nPresident Obama for acting in some ways that are unconstitutional, and \nhe has. But where in our Constitution does it give us the authority to \nrun other countries as we have been doing in Iraq and Afghanistan--even \nmaking small business loans and training local police forces?\n  My Republican Party was always the party of fiscal conservatism. Yet, \nwith a national debt of over $18 trillion, how can we justify \ncontinually spending megabillions in religious civil wars between the \nShia and Sunni?\n  Some people and companies that make money off of an interventionist \nforeign policy always very quickly fall back on the slur of \nisolationism, but most conservatives believe in trade and tourism and \ncultural and educational exchanges with other countries and in helping \nout during humanitarian crises. We just don't believe in endless war.\n  We are told, if we don't support an interventionist foreign policy, \nthat this means we don't believe in American exceptionalism, but this \nNation did not become exceptional because we got involved in every \nlittle war around the globe. It became exceptional because of our great \nfree enterprise system and because we gave our people more individual \nfreedom than any other country.\n  I have said in thousands of speeches that we are blessed beyond \nbelief to live in this country and that the United States is, without \nquestion, the greatest country in the history of the world, but there \nwas much less anti-Americanism around the world when we tried to mind \nour own business and take care of our own people, and this Nation had \nmore friends when we followed the policy of peace through strength, not \none of peace through endless war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4011-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4011-H4012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REAUTHORIZE THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker and Members, I rise this \nmorning to sound the alarm, and I want my colleagues to understand that \nthere are just 10 legislative days remaining for Congress to act before \nthe Export-Import Bank shuts down. It is outrageous that we are here \ntoday, in this countdown, as the hands of the clock have become a \nknife-edge pressed against the future of American businesses and the \njobs they create.\n  The Ex-Im Bank has a proven track record of supporting hundreds of \nthousands of jobs in every single congressional district across this \ncountry, and the fact that anyone would even consider shutting it down \nis shortsighted, and it is harmful to our economy. Ex-Im supports our \nbusinesses and our workers, all while not costing taxpayers a dime. In \nfact, over the past two decades, the Bank has generated a profit of \nclose to $7 billion--a true win-win for our taxpayers. Yet, for the \nideologues who are committed to chopping away government programs that\n\n[[Page H4012]]\n\nsupport our Nation's students and seniors, exporters, and others, the \nfacts don't really matter. They just see ending the Bank as a \nconservative litmus test.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is simply shameful that the extremist, antigovernment \nwing of the Republican Party has, once again, pushed us to the brink of \nactively damaging our Nation's businesses and our competitiveness with \nthis standoff. It doesn't have to be this way. A majority of the House \nof Representatives is already on record in its support of a long-term \nreauthorization of the Bank. It is time for Speaker Boehner to \nintervene by immediately putting a measure up to keep its doors open \nfor a vote on the House floor.\n  For 2 years, despite the calls from Democrats and Republicans, \nChairman Hensarling has made it clear that this manufactured crisis is \nexactly what he has wanted all along. This is not a fight between \nDemocrats and Republicans. It is a fight between ideology and reason in \nthe Republican Party. While the ideologically driven crusade to \neliminate the Bank may be a game here in Washington, it certainly isn't \na game for the hundreds of thousands of our businesses all over this \ncountry.\n  For example, let's take Michael Boyle, a Republican and a veteran, \nwho recently testified that, thanks to the Bank, he has been able to \nquadruple his company's revenue and expand his business from just 8 \nemployees to 60 currently.\n  Mr. Boyle's story is the American story of thousands of businesses, \nlarge and small, across this country that rely on the Bank to compete \non the global stage. Nevertheless, in the United States Congress, we \nare talking about shutting down one of the best resources our \nbusinesses have--just to make a political statement.\n  As the deadline for reauthorizing the Bank nears, I have been \nencouraged to increasingly hear from some of my Republican colleagues \nwho have come out and said, ``Enough is enough.'' As a matter of fact, \nas I sat in committee, I was very pleased to hear Mr. Fincher, a \nRepublican, say that his wife told him:\n\n       You don't represent and you don't work for the chairman of \n     the committee, Mr. Hensarling. You don't work for the \n     Speaker, Mr. Boehner. You work for the people who elected you \n     to come to Congress.\n\n  Mr. Fincher basically said to his chairman that it is time to stop \nplaying the game, that we have got to reauthorize the Export-Import \nBank.\n  I want you to know that Mr. Hensarling and those rightwing \nconservatives who want to use this as a political point will have you \nbelieve, ``Oh, this Bank is only for Big Business,'' but that is \nabsolutely not true. Not only does the Bank support thousands of small \nbusinesses, but the suppliers to the big businesses are small \nbusinesses all over this country who rely on the Export-Import Bank for \ntheir ability to create jobs and have businesses in their districts.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  All of the Members on the Democratic side of the aisle support the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, and many of the Members on \nthe opposite side of the aisle support the Bank. So I don't know why \nthe Members on the opposite side of the aisle can't rein in their \nchairman. I don't know why they are afraid of him. I don't know why \nthey don't speak up.\n  We have 10 more days. Let's get busy and get this bill reauthorized \nand this Bank. I am asking Speaker Boehner to exercise his leadership \nand get it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4012-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4012-H4013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 JOIN ME IN OPPOSING THE INNOVATION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Rohrabacher) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to alert my colleagues and \nto alert the American people that a bill is being marked up in the \nCommittee on the Judiciary this coming Thursday, H.R. 9. This bill is a \ngrave threat to the rights of the American people to own the \nintellectual property rights that they have created with their own hard \nwork and their own innovative skills.\n  The bill that is being marked up is called, in fact, the Innovation \nAct. It is one of the worst misnomers that I have seen in my time in \nCongress. This should be called the ``Anti-Innovation Act.'' This is \nyet the latest of a decades-long attack on the patent rights of the \nAmerican people that were placed into the Constitution by our Founding \nFathers.\n  For decades now, large multinational corporations, very powerful \neconomic entities that have influence on government, have been trying \nto neuter the patent rights of the American people. Why have they been \ndoing this? Why do they want to eliminate or to dramatically reduce the \nrights of our inventors to control what they have invented? Because \nthese are big guys who don't want to pay the little guys when they \nsteal from them.\n  The fact is that our Founding Fathers knew it was important for \nsomeone who has created something, whether it is a writer or an \ninventor, to have the right to control his or her creation for a \ncertain period of time. The time period has been 17 years, \ntraditionally, since the time of our Constitution. Our Founding Fathers \nknew this was important to our country's well-being, not just in terms \nof the rights of the individual, which we agree with as Americans and \nwhich were written into our Constitution as part of the Bill of Rights.\n  Only one place is the word ``right'' used in the body of the \nConstitution, and that is in the section dealing with providing our \ninventors and, yes, our writers with the right to control what they \nhave created for a certain period of time in order to profit from it.\n  Our big corporations and these multinational corporations that have \nno loyalty to the United States, these people who are continually going \noverseas to China and elsewhere are trying to neuter this so that they \ncan take any new innovation without having to pay the person who has \nactually been the inventor and created this. That is totally contrary \nto what our country has been all about.\n  We have had the strongest patent system in the world--the strongest \nin the world. What has that given the American people? It has uplifted \nour standard of living of ordinary people. Yes, these folks in the \nmultinational corporations, they live very well. Well, the American \npeople have lived well because we have had the technology, whether it \nis agricultural technology or transportation technology or any of the \nother type of energy technologies that we have. These have uplifted us \nand created more wealth for our society.\n  Americans' security, prosperity, and, yes, freedom have been due to \nour technological advantages. It is not that our people worked harder. \nIt is not that we had such natural resources. There are countries all \nover the world where people work hard and have natural resources. It is \nour freedom and our respect for the individual rights of our citizens \nthat have given us prosperity and security and freedom.\n  Now these powerful multinational corporations have targeted our \npatent system; and, yes, their motive, as I say, is to steal, let the \nbig guys steal from the little guys. That is what this supposed \nInnovation Act, which, as I say, should be called the ``Anti-Innovation \nAct,'' is all about.\n  In fact, there is a legitimate problem of frivolous lawsuits in our \ncountry. There is no doubt about that. It is not just in the area of \ntechnology. It is throughout our medicine and everywhere else. But \nthere have been a number of people who have taken patent law and \nclaimed rights that they weren't given by the Patent Office and issued \nfrivolous lawsuits to people to try to get them to pay money to them. \nThey are called patent trolls.\n  This excuse for changing our patent system is a lame excuse in the \nsense that we don't need to destroy the patent rights of the little guy \nin order to cure this problem. Every provision of the Innovation Act--\nevery provision--limits the rights of legitimate patent holders in \norder to protect their own creation.\n  Let's not eliminate our freedom to handle those people, those few \npeople, who are abusing it. I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing \nthat and alerting the American people to this challenge to their \nfreedom and their security and their prosperity.\n\n[[Page H4013]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4013-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESSES NEED THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Heck) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, today I have a simple ask: let \nthe Export-Import Bank answer the call. 2,655--2,655--that is how many \nsmall businesses called the Export-Import Bank last year and asked for \ntheir assistance in selling American-made goods and services around the \nglobe. That is how many businesses the Export-Import Bank said yes to, \nwithout any impact on taxpayers--no cost to taxpayers whatsoever--in \norder to help those 2,655 businesses be competitive in a global market.\n  The truth is, in each district--Democratic districts, Republican \ndistricts, urban, rural, coastal, interior--each district is rich with \nbusinesses large and small. Every Member has small businesses that are \nthe result of hard work, families pulling together to build something \nof value and worth that can be assisted by the Export-Import Bank--\nbrand-new business as well, not just those that are intergenerational. \nThese are the businesses that create jobs and employ millions of our \nloved ones and our neighbors and our family. When they want to export \ntheir goods and services, who do they call? They call the Export-Import \nBank.\n  Alliance Rubber Company is just one of the 2,655 small businesses \nthat made that call. Alliance is the largest manufacturer of \nrubberbands in America. It is a women-owned small business located in \nHot Springs, Arkansas. They employ a whole 156 employees. Alliance \nplans to add 15 employees within the next year, but without exports, \nthey will be cutting 10 jobs--our family members, our neighbors. Add 15 \nor cut 10? It seems like the choice is obvious to me.\n  Here is what another company said: ``Thanks to credit insurance \navailable through the Ex-Im, we have hired a salesman dedicated to \ngrowing international sales. Growing our traffic and safety business \ninternationally will mean more jobs in our Fife facility and more \nbusiness for our local vendors.''\n  That is in my district, Fife, Washington. The company is Pexco, \nanother one of the 2,655 businesses. There are Pexcos in Republican \ndistricts and in Democratic districts all over this country. There are \nAlliance Rubber companies in Republican Districts and Democratic \ndistricts. And if you listen to these business leaders, it makes sense \nto help them do what they are doing.\n  Who will answer the call after June 30? Well, unfortunately, not \nlocal banks or even the big banks. If you don't believe me, ask them. \nThey are the ones that usually refer the businesses to the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  We have 10 days left, 10 legislative days to act before the help on \nthe other end of the line is gone. Companies have 15 business days to \nmake the call and see how they can sell their goods and expand their \nexports to foreign customers. If you are a small business looking to \nexport, call 1-800-565-EXIM, 1-800-565-3949. That is why the Bank is \nthere. That is why it should remain.\n  As a matter of fact, Chairman Hensarling's own witness--I couldn't \nmake this stuff up--who testified against the Bank as a small-business \nowner last week told her hometown newspaper this later: ``The fact is \nthat there are a lot of small businesses and large businesses that need \nthe Bank right now, and to pull that rug out from under them would be \ndevastating.'' I couldn't make this up.\n  Hold a vote, Mr. Speaker. Hold a vote. Give your colleagues the \nopportunity to vote for our small businesses and the jobs they provide. \nThey are the backbone of this community and this economy and this \nNation; 2,655 of them and counting. Let the Export-Import Bank answer \nthe call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4013-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AMERICANS DESERVE TO KNOW WHO RAISED THEIR FOOD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Massie) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, Americans want to know: Where does their \nfood come from? Parents want to know before they give it to their \nchildren: How was this food raised? Where did it come from? Moms want \nto know, dads want to know, and today they can; but if proposed \nlegislation passes this body this week, we won't have that information \nnecessary to make those decisions for our family and our family's \nhealth.\n  What legislation am I talking about? I am talking about the country \nof origin labeling. In other words, right now, if you buy food and it \ncomes from a foreign country, it must be labeled. If you buy pork, you \nbuy beef, you buy chicken, wouldn't you want to know where that food \ncame from?\n  Why would you want to know? Well, different countries have different \nrules and different cultures. If you remember back in 2007, we had some \npet food that came from a foreign country that killed a lot of pets. It \nwas enhanced with melamine to up the protein readings in it, and it was \nunsafe for pets. A lot of pets died as a result. Well, it came from a \ndifferent country that has different ethics. I think Americans deserve \nto know who raised their food, which country did it come from. But the \nlegislation that is in front of us this week will repeal that \nrequirement to label beef, poultry, and pork.\n  Now, why are we doing this? Why are we in such a rush? Because we \nhave been told that the World Trade Organization requires it.\n  What is the World Trade Organization, and who are they to tell \nCongress what laws we have to pass? These judges weren't appointed by \nthe President. They weren't confirmed by the Senate. These are not \njudges from our Constitution. These are extra-constitutional judges, \nyet they are telling us here in Congress you have got to do this or \nthere will be repercussions.\n  I think our Founding Fathers would be appalled at this notion, that \nwe have given up our sovereignty. I don't accept the premise that we \nhave to make laws here based on what some world court agrees to, but I \nsuppose somebody made a trade agreement in some Congress previous that \nbound us to decisions of this court.\n  Now, even if you accept the premise that we have to abide by the \nWorld Trade Organization, and because they have ruled that we can no \nlonger label pork and beef as from foreign countries to inform our \nconsumers, then you have got to ask the question: Why did we add \nchicken to this bill? The World Trade Organization is silent on the \nsubject of chicken, yet it is in the bill.\n  We are going to remove the labeling requirements for chicken. I think \nit is a bad idea. I think it is probably motivated by some large meat \npacking companies; but they are represented here in Congress, and the \nAmerican consumer and small livestock farmers are not.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  I proposed voluntary country of origin labeling last night in the \nRules Committee. I had an amendment. It said: Okay. Maybe we shouldn't \nmandate. Maybe we shouldn't force the foreigners to label their meat \nwhen it comes into the country; but how about voluntarily letting \nAmerican producers put that proud stamp and know that it is the seal of \napproval that most consumers want so they know that beef, that pork, \nwas raised in this country?\n  I was shot down in the Rules Committee. It was just a voluntary \nprogram. In fact, it was proposed 10 years ago by this Speaker of the \nHouse, by the former chair of the Ag Committee, by the current chair of \nthe Ag Committee, and by the current chair of the Rules Committee; yet \nthey wouldn't allow my amendment for a vote in the Rules Committee. All \nI sought to do was let American farmers proclaim that their beef is \nraised in the United States.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, that is why I am here. I am here today to say \nthat we need to assert our sovereignty, the sovereignty of this body. \nWe all took an oath to the Constitution. We didn't take an oath to the \nWorld Trade Organization. We need to assert our sovereignty, and we \nneed to uphold our commitment to the Americans who sent us here.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the repeal of the country of \norigin labeling bill later today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4013-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4013-H4014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Williams) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, our Commander in Chief admitted \nthat, in the fight against the Islamic State, the U.S. does not have \n``a complete strategy.''\n\n[[Page H4014]]\n\n  It is hard to believe that it has been 1 year since the Islamic State \nof Iraq and Syria--ISIS, ISIL, or whatever you want to call them--began \nmaking headlines in American newspapers. It is hard to believe that it \nhas been nearly 1\\1/2\\ years since the Director of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nthat it was ``likely ISIL will attempt to take territory in Iraq and \nSyria.''\n  But it goes back even farther. In January 2014, the U.S. Ambassador \nto Iraq said the Islamic State is ``capable of taking and holding \nground and causing a lot of trouble.'' In November 2013, a State \nDepartment official testified before a House Foreign Affairs \nsubcommittee and specifically cited the ineffectiveness of Iraq's \nmilitary.\n  Then Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iraq and Iran said: \n``ISIL has benefited from a permissive operating environment due to \ninherent weaknesses of Iraqi security forces.''\n  Mr. Speaker, all of these warnings occurred after Iraq's Prime \nMinister made an appeal to President Obama to help defeat the growing \nthreat to his country. That was 2 years ago; so here we are.\n  In June 2015, the leader of the free world tells an international \nconference in Austria that the United States does not have a complete \nstrategy to defeat an enemy he once called a JV squad. Well, that JV \nsquad is responsible for the horrific murders of American citizens.\n  That JV squad has overtaken territory fought so hard for by American \ntroops, territory that nearly 4,500 American servicemen and -women died \nto protect in the most violent battles witnessed by U.S. troops since \nthe Vietnam war. That JV squad waves black flags while driving stolen \nmilitary equipment through streets where Americans made the ultimate \nsacrifice.\n  From overlooked redlines to bypassed deadlines, the Obama \nadministration will serve as a case study in how not to conduct foreign \npolicy for future world leaders.\n  Today, the President wants us to believe that his administration's \nnegotiations with Iran are in Israel's best interests. Ironically, \nIsrael's Prime Minister made a direct appeal to the American people \nexpressing the contrary.\n  This past March, Prime Minister Netanyahu petitioned Congress from \nthe podium right behind me because he, like so many, has lost faith in \nthe abilities of our Commander in Chief.\n  He is right; he is right to be skeptical about the State Department's \n``trust above all else'' policy with Iran, whose leaders have publicly \nproclaimed their desire for Israel to be wiped off the map. Mr. \nNetanyahu has rightly questioned America's once unwavering commitment \nto his homeland, Israel--our partner, our ally, but, most importantly, \nour friend.\n  As I have said before, for those who do not believe in the United \nStates' moral obligation to protect Israel, I remind them about the \nUnited States' strategic obligation. Israel benefits from a secure \nAmerica, just as America benefits in having a secure, stable, and \ntrustworthy ally in a very volatile and dangerous region of the world.\n  The Obama administration's inability to realize this twofold bond \nbetween the United States and Israel illustrates their lack of \nunderstanding. I suggest to the President and his advisers that, if \nthey really want to salvage any remaining trace of foreign policy \ncompetence for their history books, they walk away from this deal.\n  I urge our President to pause and reflect on America's role in the \nworld. Mr. Speaker, I urge him to reassess our courses of action \nabroad. The President must start by determining what is important for \nAmerica. Only then will he be capable of developing a strategy, let \nalone the right one.\n  In God we trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4014-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4014-H4015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REAUTHORIZE THE ESEA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, across my congressional \ndistrict, elementary and secondary school students are packing up their \nlockers, taking final exams, and saying good-bye to their classmates \nand homeroom desks for the summer.\n  While our students head into a well-deserved summer recess, our \nteachers have already started thinking ahead to the next academic year, \nsetting up lesson plans and figuring out what their course curriculums \nwill be.\n  Unfortunately, many of our teachers will be faced with yet another \nyear of stifling one-size-fits-all testing requirements and deadlines. \nInstead of enabling our teachers to do what they love and inspiring our \nchildren to learn and succeed, they are forced to waste classroom time \nby preparing and administering redundant and often low-quality tests.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 15 weeks since I last spoke on the \nHouse floor about the need to provide relief from burdensome testing \nrequirements for our teachers, students, and parents.\n  At the time, the House was actively considering H.R. 5, legislation \nto reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as well as \nan amendment I was pleased to offer with my Democratic colleague, \nSuzanne Bonamici of Oregon. Our bipartisan amendment, which was adopted \nand included as part of H.R. 5, offers a solution to the overtesting \nproblem that is taxing our schools and teachers.\n  Our amendment empowers teachers and parents by giving existing \nFederal funding to State and local education agencies to develop \ncurriculum plans to make better use of tests for the students, with the \nability to reduce testing.\n  It would also allow for quicker delivery of assessment data to \neducators and parents and a more qualitative analysis of how to shape \ncurriculum for that student from the local school district and parent, \nnot the Federal Government.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to continue our work on this bill and \nreauthorize the ESEA. We owe it to our colleagues who have worked for \nmonths on this bill and underlying policy. We owe it to our teachers \nwho have dedicated their livelihood and careers to the betterment of \nour children.\n  Most of all, we owe it to our children, who deserve the best possible \neducation that we can provide, an education that encourages them to \nthink, learn, and succeed and not that simply tells them how to fill in \nthe blanks on a generic test.\n  For those of my colleagues who may be undecided on advancing this \nbill and reauthorizing the ESEA, I ask you to consider: Are you happy \nwith the status quo? Are you content to sit on the sidelines while \nCommon Core standards and a myriad of tests are imposed on our \nstudents?\n  I would like to read into the Record a letter I received from the \nsuperintendent of my home school district. Let me preface this by \nsaying it was not written to me as a Member of Congress, but rather as \na taxpayer in the West Chester Area School District.\n  I read this because there is no better example of a need and an \nopportunity for us to help our families back home do our job and govern \nhere in Congress. It reads:\n\n       Dear Parents, many of us are quick to fault the U.S. public \n     education system, comparing it to other smaller European \n     countries and finding deficits and gaps. The system and the \n     way it is funded are far from perfect. However, we manage to \n     educate generations of children who go on to do incredible \n     things.\n       Now, we are asking our students to do something that is \n     entirely unfair: to spend weeks and weeks filling in bubbles, \n     taking standardized tests, and having their entire \n     educational ambition directed toward passing them. This is \n     not what public education was intended to do, nor should do.\n       As the superintendent of the West Chester Area School \n     District, I believe in very high standards for our students. \n     I believe in accountability. I do believe that tests can be a \n     good thing, but not the way we are being forced by the \n     government to give them.\n       We officially began the PSSA testing window on April 13, \n     and we will continue to test through May 27, when we finish \n     with the high school Keystone Exams, a new graduation \n     requirement. Beginning with the class of 2017, even a \n     straight-A student who doesn't do well on these tests won't \n     receive a diploma under State law.\n       State and federally mandated testing has been around for a \n     long time, and is certainly here to stay, but it has become a \n     massive burden that is stifling creativity and love of \n     teaching and learning.\n       While our district has embraced high standards and \n     accountability, we now spend the first 7 months of the school \n     year preparing to take three standardized tests; then we \n     spend approximately 6 weeks giving tests to students. Unlike \n     private and parochial\n\n[[Page H4015]]\n\n     schools, public schools are mandated to use these tests to \n     determine graduation for students and for teacher and \n     administrator evaluations. It is positively stressing us--and \n     our system--to the max.\n       Our teachers, students, and parents all say the extreme \n     amount of time focused on testing is causing ridiculous \n     amounts of stress in the classroom, faculty room, and at \n     home. The angst is palpable as you walk through our hallways.\n       Where is there time for creativity in teaching? Where is \n     there time for exploration and collaboration? Our talented \n     staff do their very best to find ways to incorporate what \n     needs to be tested into their dynamic lesson plans, but it is \n     difficult, given the time constraints and enormous amount of \n     material being covered.\n       Ultimately, that negativity is going to drive down our test \n     scores. Learning should be challenging, but also enjoyable \n     and exciting. Teaching should be dynamic and creative. We are \n     missing that because of these tests.\n       I am not advocating a system without any testing, rigor, or \n     accountability, but what we are doing right now isn't \n     working.\n       Teachers have literally sent me hundreds of examples of how \n     students are worried, anxious, and depressed. The rules for \n     taking these exams are crazy as well.\n       Springtime in a school should be full of excitement and \n     learning--not anymore. The last 3 weeks, our schools have \n     looked more like prisons than educational institutions. The \n     rules allow students to take as much time as they need, but \n     once they close the booklet, the session is over, and they \n     can't return to it.\n\n  Let's reauthorize the ESEA. Let's reduce the Federal footprint over \npublic education. It is the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4015-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago today was one \nof the most meaningful of my life as I served as an election observer \nfor the post-Communist parliamentary elections in the Republic of \nBulgaria with the International Republican Institute, nominated by RNC \nChairman Lee Atwater.\n  It was a dream come true to visit talented and enthusiastic people at \npolling locations in the Hissar, Plovdiv region and see a restoration \nof democracy amidst the amazing antiquities of ancient Thracian, Greek, \nand Roman cultures. I was welcomed by Professor Stefan Stoyanov, who \nwas elected to the National Assembly and later reinstituted the Rotary \nClub of Sofia.\n  In Congress, I have been grateful to co-chair the Bulgarian Caucus; \nwork with dynamic Ambassador Elena Poptodorova; and, this year, led a \ndelegation to Sofia to meet with Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, who is \ncourageously promoting reforms for the people of Bulgaria.\n  It has been uplifting to meet with dedicated Bulgarian troops, along \nwith my son, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, who now train with \nAmericans at the Novo Selo training base.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n  God bless Bulgaria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4016-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JOHN GRANVILLE\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, John Granville grew up in south Buffalo. He \nhad a curiosity about the world and a desire to serve others. He was a \nFulbright scholar and a Peace Corps volunteer who became a career \ndiplomat for the United States Agency for International Development.\n  In 2007, John was distributing solar-powered radios to remote \nvillages in South Sudan to ensure that the people could participate in \nupcoming elections. On New Year's Day in 2008, John and a colleague \nwere targeted and assassinated by terrorists in Khartoum. He was 33 \nyears old.\n  Four men were convicted of the murders, but 6 years ago today, they \nescaped with the aid of a man later pardoned by Sudanese President al-\nBashir. Two of the killers remain at large, and the Department of \nJustice has offered a $5 million reward for their arrest.\n  Today, I will introduce a resolution calling on the State Department \nto maintain Sudan on the state sponsors of terrorism list until al-\nBashir's pardon is repealed and John's killers are captured.\n  When his family expressed concern about his safety, John would say \nthat he knew his work was dangerous, but he wouldn't want to be doing \nanything else. Today, we remember a man of light and peace and pledge \nto bring to justice those who took him from us far too soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4016-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING\n\n  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, my thanks to Chairman Conaway and the \nAgriculture Committee for their prompt, bipartisan response to the \nrecent WTO ruling against country of origin labeling.\n  Since 2009, Canada and Mexico argued that our country of origin \nlabeling policy distorts trade across our borders and increases the \ncost of meat and poultry. In the U.S., we had hoped for a favorable \nruling from the WTO, but their rulings and appeals have all been \nagainst us. Today, it is time to act to address the problems posed by \nCOOL and prevent the retaliation from our friends in Canada and Mexico.\n  If not addressed, Canada and Mexico have threatened $3.6 billion in \ntrade retaliation. This would be a major blow to pork and beef \nproducers in my district; but it is not just livestock producers that \nwould feel the pain. Threatened retaliation would also impact the corn \ngrowers in my district, one of the most productive corn growing \ndistricts in the Nation, and candy makers like Hershey and Mars that \nhave plants in my district.\n  Again, I am grateful to Chairman Conaway and his attention to this \nissue and his prompt response to the WTO's ruling. I support this bill \nto repeal COOL and end the years of uncertainty faced by our farmers, \nranchers, and so many others and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4016-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4016-H4017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, fixing our Nation's crumbling \ninfrastructure to boost the economy and increase transportation safety \nshould not be a partisan issue; yet Republicans in Congress continue to \nshow neglect and indifference towards the Nation's infrastructure and \ntransportation safety needs.\n\n[[Page H4017]]\n\n  The 2-month extension of the highway trust fund they offered in their \nunacceptable T-HUD appropriation bill is the latest example. The T-HUD \nbill shows a dangerous disregard for safety measures on America's \nhighways at a time when we well know transportation safety should be a \npriority.\n  It allows massive, double 33-foot tractor-trailers to travel at high \nspeeds on America's Interstate Highway System, and it suspends Federal \nsafety guidelines aimed at eliminating trucker fatigue, allowing long-\nhaul truckers to work more than twice the average workweek for \nAmericans.\n  Mr. Speaker, the short-term highway trust fund does not solve the \nproblem of deteriorating roads and bridges; it simply puts a Band-Aid \non it.\n  Republicans kicked the can down the road, but it got stuck in a \npothole. Now is the time to fix the infrastructure in our counties, and \nwe need to put people back to work in order to do it, but what we \nreally need is a robust, long-term commitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4017-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n               COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of \nH.R. 2393, the Country of Origin Labeling Amendments Act of 2015.\n  I want to thank Chairman Conaway for his leadership on this issue.\n  On May 18, the World Trade Organization ruled against the U.S. COOL \nrequirements. This ruling gives Canada and Mexico the green light to \nretaliate against United States products, particularly beef, pork, and \nchicken products. We are not looking here at a slap in the face, ladies \nand gentlemen. Unless COOL is repealed, U.S. goods could be hit with \nretaliatory tariffs that total $3.6 billion.\n  My home State of Iowa would be hit really hard. We have over 20 \nmillion hogs and almost 4 million cattle. Last year, Iowa exported \nalmost $2 billion of pork, with Canada and Mexico as our top export \nmarkets. We need to repeal the country of origin labeling requirements \nin pork, beef, and chicken, which could hurt American workers.\n  While COOL is well-intentioned, we have voluntary programs already in \nplace that give consumers information and the right to know where these \nproducts came from. We are out of options. Other legislative and \nregulatory fixes have been ineffective.\n  As the U.S. and State economies recover, the choice is clear. We \ncannot wait and see what trade retaliation from our closest trading \npartners would look like. It is time to repeal COOL now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4017-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE TIM COLE EXONERATION REVIEW COMMISSION\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the Texas State \nLegislature in passing House Bill 48, establishing the Tim Cole \nExoneration Review Commission. Tim Cole was wrongfully convicted of \nrape and was the first Texas man to be posthumously cleared by DNA \ntesting.\n  I know that, oftentimes, when people hear these stories, they think: \nWhat did he do to get on the police department's radar? Had he done \nsomething previously in his life that would have made the police \ndepartment suspect him? I can tell you that, in Tim Cole's case, Tim \nwas an Army veteran from Fort Worth; he was a Texas Tech student; and \nhe honorably served in the military. Sadly, it was just a very bad time \nto be a Black man living in Lubbock, Texas. Tim was sentenced to 25 \nyears in prison, and he died behind bars without being able to prove \nhis innocence.\n  I am happy to let you know that this 11-member panel will examine \nwrongful convictions to determine what went wrong and then will make \nrecommendations aimed at avoiding in the future the mistakes that were \nmade in Tim Cole's case. On June 1, Governor Abbott signed a bill into \nlaw affirming that all Americans are entitled to due process. Tim \nCole's family can take some small solace in the knowledge that his \ndeath has resulted in changes that can provide hope to those who are \nalso wrongfully convicted.\n  I want to applaud Tim's brother, Cory Session, who has worked \ntirelessly for years to clear his brother's name. I also applaud his \nlate mother, Ruby Session, who didn't get to see this bill signed into \nlaw, but she did get to see some changes made in Texas. I am just happy \nfor this family. I am sad that this happened to Tim Cole, but I am glad \nthat something positive has taken place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4017-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PTSD AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. ZINKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. ZINKE.

June is PTSD \nAwareness Month.\n  In my home State of Montana, nearly 15,000 veterans, or 15 percent of \nthe population of all veterans, suffer from PTSD. PTSD, no doubt, is a \nserious condition that touches every aspect of a person's life. Every \nday, 22 veterans commit suicide nationwide. Many of them struggle to \nlive with PTSD. Many of our veterans who live with PTSD struggle to \ntransition to civilian life because they have not been given essential \nresources in the care they need at VA hospitals and clinics or from \ntheir local communities.\n  I urge the Veterans Health Administration and local communities to \nwork together to do everything we can to combat this epidemic.\n  God bless America and the men and women who serve and defend her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4017-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SALVATION ARMY\n\n  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of this year's \nbeing the 150th anniversary of the Salvation Army.\n  It all started in 1865 with a minister named William Booth. He took \nto the streets of London's slums to champion the poor and neglected, \nand he decided that we have got to do something. That ``something'' was \ntransformed into innovative approaches to eliminate poverty by \ndemonstrating faith and by offering practical support to those in need.\n  In my Third Congressional District and across the Nation, the \nSalvation Army provides assistance to families in need by providing \nclothes and furniture, food, job training, and much more. We have all \nseen the volunteers with red kettles who ring the bells and ask for \ndonations. Nationally, they have raised $135 million and continue to \nmake tremendous contributions locally in Ohio, nationally, and \nglobally.\n  I thank the Salvation Army's members, staff, board, and volunteers in \nmy district, and I honor their work and service throughout this \nyearlong celebration of their 150th anniversary.\n  Happy anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4017-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4017-H4018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NEGOTIATION WITH IRAN\n\n  (Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, as the House debates giving guidelines to the \nPresident on opening up American trade, I rise to urge the President to \nsecure a verifiable nuclear agreement with Iran.\n  America's response to Iran's nuclear program will be the most \nimportant foreign policy decision in a generation.

Mr. Speaker, much of the economic turmoil that has gripped \nthis Nation is the result of the Federal Government's spending beyond \nits means. However, Democrats continue to insist on ignoring the \nconsequences of our crushing debt burden. Last week, Democrats in the \nSenate announced they would block any appropriations bill, including \nlegislation providing funds for the defense of this Nation, until \nRepublicans meet their demands for increased government spending.\n  At a time of grave threats to our Nation, we must be vigilant, \ndetermined, and united in the full support of our military personnel. \nProviding for the common defense of the United States of America is the \nFederal Government's primary duty. Holding hostage the funding for our \ntroops, their families, and the Nation's veterans in order to extract \nmore taxpayer dollars for Washington bureaucracy is the worst kind of \npolitical gamesmanship. It is time to make protecting this Nation a \npriority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4018-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EQUAL PAY ACT\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the 52nd \nanniversary of the passage of the Equal Pay Act, I rise today to \nreflect on our commitment to equality and the work ahead to turn this \ncommitment into a reality.\n  In 1963, our Nation declared that women deserved equal pay for equal \nwork; yet, more than half a century later, we still have much work \nahead to end pay discrimination against women. Today, women make just \n77 cents for every dollar men earn, amounting to an $11,000 gap per \nyear between full-time men and women. That is almost $1,000 each month \nto help with groceries, rent, and student loans.\n  The workforce disparities have disastrous effects on our Nation. \nAccording to the Census Bureau, 1 in 3 women lives 200 percent below \nthe Federal poverty line compared to 1 in 4 men, and of the more than \n100 million Americans who live paycheck to paycheck, almost 70 percent \nof them are women and their children. Meanwhile, of the S 500 \ncompanies, women make up just 14.2 percent of their leadership \npositions, and only 24 companies have female CEOs.\n  Women deserve a fair shot at the American Dream. I urge my colleagues \nto work with me to address these issues.

During his service, Dearborn witnessed history in \nthe making, having seen the final Japanese surrender aboard the USS \nMissouri on September 2, 1945, marking the end of World War II.\n  Dearborn remained as an active member of the veterans community and \njust this April traveled from Manchester, New Hampshire, to Washington, \nD.C., to participate in an Honor Flight with other veterans from around \nthe Nation. His service, legacy, and courage live on.\n  We will never forget the service and sacrifice that Captain Dearborn \nmade for our freedoms and our liberty. It is because of our Nation's \nheroes like Dearborn that our Nation remains the land of the free and \nthe home of the brave.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate \nMarissa Bartels on winning an astounding four gold medals at the recent \nMinnesota State track and field meet.\n  Marissa was born with spina bifida but refuses to let that slow her \ndown. In middle school, when no longer able to participate in the \nsports she knew and loved, Marissa discovered wheelchair sports. This \nwas her third year participating at State, and Marissa dominated, \nwinning the 100 and 800 meter races as well as shot put and discus.\n  Marissa's athletic abilities extend beyond track and field. She is \nalso a national champion in baseball and basketball. It is no surprise \nthat this impressive competitor will be heading to the University of \nWisconsin-Whitewater in the fall as a student athlete.\n  Best of luck and congratulations, Marissa.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today relating to \nthe new CFPB rule combining the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act \nand Truth in Lending Act disclosure that is scheduled to take effect on \nAugust 1.\n  On behalf of home buyers across this country, the real estate \nindustry has requested a grace period or hold harmless period for 90 \ndays. To date, the CFPB will only commit to saying they will have \nrelaxed enforcement for a period similar to that of the qualified \nmortgage/ability to repay rule.\n  Now, leaving aside whether this rule will provide more clarity or \nmore confusion to the real estate purchaser, leaving aside whether it \nwill provide more protection to buyers or be more problematic for them \nto close on a real estate transaction, I want to focus on the August 1 \ndeadline.\n  I spent 10 years in the real estate industry working with real estate \nagents, banks, mortgage professionals, title insurance agents, and it \nis well known that June, July, and August tend to be the most active \nmonths for real estate transactions. Changing disclosure requirements \nin the middle of the busiest part of the calendar year for real estate \ndeals causes difficulty for those involved in conducting settlements. \nAnd changing them without the ability for professionals to test their \nsystems and procedures doesn't make much sense, either.\n  It is also unfair to consumers in that you are compelling their \nretained professionals to receive the training during the busiest \nmonths, implement new procedures, and account for unanticipated \ndisruptions. Any hiccup along the way is actually to the detriment of \nthe consumer.\n  Let's make the rule effective in January or February of 2016, which \nare historically the slowest months of the year, and when it is most \nfair to real estate consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4019-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4019-H4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING ALL THE ROSIE THE RIVETERS\n\n  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, Mae Krier of Levittown, Bucks County, \nPennsylvania, was a young woman\n\n[[Page H4020]]\n\nwhen our country went to war in 1941.

The gentleman from Washington is recognized \nfor 1 hour.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield \nthe customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nDuring consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the \npurpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 \nlegislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Committee on Rules met and \nreported a rule, H. Res. 303, providing for consideration of two \nimportant pieces of legislation: H.R. 2393, the Country of Origin \nLabeling Amendments Act of 2015, and H.R. 2685, the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act, 2016.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2393 under a closed rule \nand H.R. 2685 under the customary modified open rule process, which \nallows any Member to offer an amendment to the bill so long as the \namendment complies with the rules of the House. The only restriction is \non the amount of time that will be allotted for debating each \namendment.\n  H.R. 2393 is an urgent and critical response to the World Trade \nOrganization's ruling on May 18 of this year, which found country of \norigin labeling, or COOL, for muscle meat cuts to be in violation of \nthe U.S. trade obligations with Canada and Mexico. H.R. 2393 will \nsimply repeal the COOL meat cut provisions, making the U.S. compliant \nand prevent retaliation.\n  Critics of H.R. 2393 will say we have more time, but in truth, we \ndon't. This final ruling is the fourth time the WTO has ruled against \nthe U.S. for various versions of COOL, and on this final appeal, the \nWTO has given both Canada and Mexico the authority to impose more than \n$3 billion in combined retaliatory tariffs against U.S. products within \n60 days of the ruling.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, we are now down to just 37 days to respond before \nthese tariffs are imposed. This could deal an enormous blow to U.S. \ncompanies and the workers they employ, just when our economy is \nbeginning to rebound.\n  There is also an argument floating around that this will prevent all \nlabeling or that a ``Made in North America'' label will satisfy our \ntrade obligations. A North American label will not necessarily satisfy \nour obligations and can in no way, no matter how fast we try, be \nnegotiated in the remaining 37 days to prevent retaliation.\n  Also, it is important to note that repealing mandatory COOL doesn't \nprevent voluntarily labeling, as some companies already do.\n  Finally, it is worth noting that some critics claim that this will \nweaken inspections for meat imports. Nothing can be further from the \ntruth.\n  The United States Department of Agriculture has and will continue to \nprovide the most rigorous, science-based import inspections, \ninspections of foreign plants which export to the United States. \nWhether or not the product has a mandatory country of origin label on \nit will not affect these rigorous inspections.\n  This legislation is desperately needed. Our manufacturers, pork \nproducers, grape growers, confectionary exporters, and ranchers have \nrepeatedly asked Congress to ensure that we repeal the COOL provisions \nand bring the U.S. back into compliance with our WTO obligations fully \nand quickly.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2393 is important to ensure our economy is \nprotected and that the U.S. plays by the rules we agreed to with two of \nour biggest trading partners, which are by far our largest export \nmarkets.\n  This rule also provides for the consideration of H.R. 2685, the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act, which funds our Nation's \nnational defense and provides the resources necessary to continue our \nessential military efforts abroad, as well as the funding for health \nand quality of life programs for the brave men and women of our Armed \nForces.\n  Overall, the bill provides $578.6 billion in discretionary funding, \n$800 million more than the President's request and $24.4 billion above \nthe fiscal year 2015 funding level. Within this amount, $88.4 billion \nis appropriated for our war efforts in the global war on terrorism.\n\n[[Page H4021]]\n\n  H.R. 2685 is an imperative measure that funds our critical national \nsecurity programs and addresses the vital needs of our men and women in \nthe armed services. An effective military, one that is well equipped \nand well trained, is indispensable to the common defense of our country \nand is in the best interest of all Americans. This bill includes vital \nfunding for the U.S. military and intelligence community as they remain \nengaged in responding to instability abroad.\n  This bill contains $133 billion to provide for 1.3 million Active-\nDuty troops and 820,000 National Guard and Reserve troops; $219 billion \nis included for operations and maintenance, which provides for the \nfunding of readiness programs that prepare our troops for combat and \npeacetime missions.\n  The Constitution charges the Congress to provide for our national \ndefense, and this bill ensures we will fulfill that obligation. Our \nhighest national priority should always be the protection of our \ncountry, and the funding levels in this bill will ensure our military \nremains the most capable, prepared, and exceptional armed force \nanywhere in the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must provide the resources necessary to fight \nAmerica's enemies abroad. With the rise of ISIS, the continued presence \nof al Qaeda, the growth of terrorist groups in North Africa, \ninstability throughout the Middle East, and Russian aggression in \nUkraine, our military must be prepared for not only current threats, \nbut for future ones as well.\n  We also need to support those willing to fight alongside us, which is \nwhy H.R. 2685 includes critical support for our allies who are also \nfacing this unprecedented instability due to the aggression of nation-\nstates and terrorist organizations alike.\n  This bill makes difficult budgetary choices without undermining the \nsafety, security, and success of our servicemembers and their families. \nIt uses every tax dollar responsible to give our Armed Forces the \nresources they need to stay prepared, safe, and in peak fighting form.\n  Supporting the men and women of our armed services--who, day in and \nday out, risk their lives in the service of our country--is one of the \nmost important functions that we perform as Members of Congress, and \nthis responsibility should not be taken lightly.\n  I am proud to support this bill and the important funding it provides \nfor our Nation's military, security, and our courageous men and women \nin uniform.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for \nconsideration of two very critical pieces of legislation that will \nprotect our economy, provide necessary funding for our servicemembers \nand the defense of our country, and I support its adoption.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rule, as well as the underlying \nbills, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Newhouse) for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield \nmyself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this grab bag rule \nand both underlying pieces of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, today marks the 18th time in this Congress that House \nRepublicans have brought to the floor a grab bag rule, a single rule \nthat governs floor debate for two or more unrelated pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Since the Republicans took control of the House in 2011, the use of \ngrab bag rules has dramatically increased by over 400 percent. Using \none rule to govern multiple, oftentimes unrelated bills stifles debate, \nwhich I guess is the point of them merging all these bills under one \nrule on the House floor, and leads to disjointed and confusing \ndiscussion between two sides.\n  Ranking Member Slaughter and my Democratic colleagues on the House \nRules Committee have raised these concerns with Chairman Sessions, but \nunfortunately, we are back on the floor today to consider one rule for \ntwo completely unrelated measures.\n  Today's rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2393, the Country of \nOrigin Labeling Amendments Act, also known as COOL, under a completely \nclosed process. No amendments are allowed, none.\n  Clearly, this is an issue that we need to address sooner rather than \nlater, but H.R. 2393 is not the answer. It was introduced just 2 days \nafter the World Trade Organization ruled against the United States' \ncountry of origin labeling requirements for meat.\n  H.R. 2393 is a knee-jerk reaction to the WTO ruling that completely \ndoes away with labeling requirement for beef, pork, and chicken, which \nwasn't even addressed in the WTO ruling.\n  We know from past WTO disputes that there are several steps that need \nto occur before retaliation would take place. The arbitration panel \ntakes at least 60 days, but in the U.S.-Brazil cotton case, it took 15 \nmonths to produce a ruling. The sky is not falling; we have some time \nto come up with a workable solution.\n\n  Instead of H.R. 2393, we ought to be working toward a more thoughtful \napproach that balances consumers' right to know where their meat comes \nfrom with our trade obligations.\n  More than 60 countries have successfully implemented COOL-like \nlabeling requirements that comply with WTO standards, and we ought to \nlook toward these programs for a workable solution.\n  Such an important issue that impacts the safety of food we eat and \nthe health of American families deserves the most robust debate \npossible, but this closed rule from House Republicans prevents us from \nhaving that kind of debate. As I said, not a single Member, Democratic \nor Republican, is allowed to offer an amendment to this bill. It is \ncompletely closed.\n  Today's rule also provides for the consideration of H.R. 2685, the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the fiscal year 2016 Defense \nAppropriations Act, there is much to praise about the bill. It contains \nmany important provisions and strong funding for suicide prevention and \ntraining, improved response to sexual assault and prevention, and \nmedical research.\n  I applaud the hard work put into drafting this bill by Defense \nSubcommittee Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Visclosky, along \nwith Appropriations Committee Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey. \nHowever, this bill suffers from two major--I emphasize the word \n``major''--flaws, which to my mind makes it difficult, if not \nimpossible, to support.\n  First and foremost, this bill continues to use the overseas \ncontingency operations account, or OCO, as a slush fund to get around \nparts of the Budget Control Act that Republicans don't like--namely, \nthe caps on defense spending--while ignoring the damage the caps are \ndoing to all our nondefense programs.\n  This bill, like the Defense Authorization bill before it, completely \nbypasses the caps set down by the BCA by increasing OCO funding by $38 \nbillion above the President's request. The bill shifts $38 billion from \nthe defense base budget and shoves those moneys into the off-budget OCO \nmeant to cover the costs of our various wars.\n  Rather than wrestle with the hard question of how to get rid of the \nsequester and the budget caps and bring our spending back into regular \norder, the Republicans have decided to wallow in a slush fund. Quite \nsimply, Mr. Speaker, it is a disgrace.\n  Mr. Speaker, don't you think it is about time that we found a way to \nprovide for our national security needs without relying on war \ncontingency slush funds to pay for the everyday expenses of the \nDepartment of Defense?\n  Members on both sides of the aisle have recognized that the sequester \ndoes not work. Shouldn't we be honest about that? Shouldn't we \nnegotiate a workable plan, rather than play these games of smoke and \nmirrors that actually undermine the Pentagon's ability to budget and \nplan for the long term?\n  Second, Mr. Speaker, this bill continues to appropriate billions of \ndollars to carry out the war against the Islamic State in Iraq, Syria, \nand elsewhere; but Congress has not even debated, let alone authorized \nthat war.\n  The leadership of this House continues to fail in carrying out its \nresponsibilities under the Constitution and bring an AUMF before this \nbody to authorize the military operations that have been ongoing since \nlast August.\n\n[[Page H4022]]\n\n  In fact, just last night, we learned that the U.S. presence in Iraq \nwill increase even further, with the administration planning to \nestablish a new military base in Anbar province and send hundreds of \nadditional American military trainers.\n  This move is aimed at helping Iraqi forces to retake the city of \nRamadi from the Islamic State, but it is clear our involvement is \ngetting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger--but still, no word \nfrom this leadership that it has the political will or intention to \nbring an AUMF to the House floor this month, next month, or the month \nafter.\n  With Americans investing more and more in this conflict--we are told \nthat we spend about $3.5 million an hour on this latest war against the \nIslamic State--there has never been a greater urgency for this Congress \nto debate and to vote on this war.\n  Time and again, bipartisan letters have been sent to the Speaker \nasking him to bring an AUMF to the House floor. Time and again, \nindividual Members have sought to bring amendments up for debate that \nwould authorize military operations in Iraq and Syria, only to have the \nRepublican majority on the House Rules Committee reject them, depriving \nthem of consideration and depriving them of debate.\n  Just last night, I offered an amendment that simply states that no \nfunds in this act may be obligated or spent on military operations in \nIraq and Syria in the absence of an AUMF for such operations. It was \nalso rejected by the Republicans of the House Rules Committee.\n  Some stated that they voted to reject it because 10 minutes, which is \nthe amount of time limiting debate on all amendments to the defense \nbill, is simply not enough time to debate a serious question. Well, I \nagree. Ten minutes is not enough time, but the Rules Committee has the \npower to increase that limit to as much time as it feels appropriate, \nand it failed to do so.\n  The Rules Committee could provide 2 hours of debate or 2 days of \ndebate or 2 weeks of debate; that is the power of the Rules Committee. \nDon't hide behind this excuse as a reason for Congress not to live up \nto its constitutional responsibilities.\n  Mr. Speaker, it seems that we can always find the time and find a way \nto spend billions of billions of dollars to fund wars; we can always \nfind a way to send our brave men and women overseas to fight and die in \nthese wars, but we can't ever seem to find the backbone or the time to \ndebate and authorize them.\n  Each night, each week, the Members of this House get to go home to \ntheir families and their communities, surrounded by loved ones and \npeople who support them. If we don't have the stomach to take \nresponsibility for sending our troops into danger, then the least we \ncan do is bring them home to their families so that they might enjoy \nthe same peace and privileges that we take so much for granted.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  If we want to spend our Nation's treasure on these wars, if my \ncolleagues believe that the war in Iraq and Syria is a priority for our \nNation and our national security, then we should carry out our \nconstitutional mandate and debate and vote on an AUMF.\n  Now, I welcome the fact that the House Appropriations Committee, in a \nbipartisan vote, supported an amendment by the honorable gentlewoman \nfrom California, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, that says: ``Congress has a \nconstitutional duty to debate and determine whether or not to authorize \nthe use of military force against ISIL.''\n  That provision is in the Defense Appropriations bill. But the fact of \nthe matter is, Mr. Speaker, that we shouldn't just be saying that \nCongress has a constitutional duty; we should actually be carrying out \nour constitutional duty.\n  So I hope that every single one of my colleagues will remember that \nwhen they cast their votes for final passage of this bill, you are \nproviding money and equipment and lives to carry out a war that this \nHouse doesn't even have the courage to debate and vote on.\n  The leadership of this House has to stop whining and stop trying to \nshift the responsibility on to anyone and everyone except to whom the \nresponsibility really falls. It falls upon each of us to say to this \nleadership that the time has come to bring an AUMF before this body, \nand for the leadership to let us debate it and vote on it.\n  It is time that we stopped acting like cowards and started behaving \nlike Members of Congress our constituents elected to make the tough \ndecisions. So I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this rule and \nthe underlying legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, just let me say before I turn to some of \nmy colleagues who have joined me on the floor that I agree with the \ngentleman from Massachusetts. These are important issues, especially \nwhen we are talking about appropriations for the Defense Department. We \ndo need an AUMF, and I remain committed to work with the gentleman from \nMassachusetts to accomplish that; that we should have that open debate \nand that discussion through the committee system.\n  This is not the vehicle. But we will do that. We need to do that, and \nI agree with the gentleman.\n  Today, I am very happy to have with me several people who would like \nto speak on this issue. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Crawford), a member of the Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this rule and the underlying \nlegislation to repeal country of origin labeling for meat products, and \nI believe this effort is long past due.\n  I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee for bringing this rule to \nthe floor, and I appreciate Agriculture Committee Chairman Conaway's \nexpeditious response to the WTO's final ruling that sets the table for \na huge hit to America's struggling economy.\n  Not only has COOL been a costly burden on our Nation's meat industry \nfor more than a decade, but now massive retaliatory tariffs from Canada \nand Mexico will inflict pain on a vast amount of U.S. industries and \njobs.\n  At a time when American GDP is actually shrinking, and U.S. farmers \nand manufacturers are desperately seeking export markets, the worst \nthing we can do is allow this policy to damage our ability to get \nAmerican-made to market.\n  COOL represents yet another failed government mandate imposing heavy \ncosts on private sector industry for no defensible purpose. While the \nprimary goal of COOL is to give American-grown meat a competitive \nadvantage, the result has been exactly the opposite.\n  Even the Department of Agriculture agrees that COOL has actually \nnegatively impacted the industry that it was supposed to benefit. As a \ndirect result of this policy, we have not only seen sharp increases in \nthe cost of marketing and selling beef and pork, but looming trade \nretaliation is already costing American industries that contract for \nfuture delivery of goods into these export markets.\n  If we allow these retaliatory tariffs to go forward, our Nation's \nbusinesses will experience billions of dollars of market loss, which \nwill kill jobs, harm our U.S. competitiveness, and have a long-term \nnegative impact on America's economic health.\n  Fortunately, today we have a chance to end the harmful impact of this \npolicy. I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and the \nunderlying legislation to repeal COOL once and for all.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me just say to my colleague on the Rules Committee, I am glad he \nsupports my position that we ought to have a debate on an AUMF when it \ncomes to these wars against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n  But my question is, what are we waiting for?\n  Eleven months ago, Congressman Walter Jones, a Republican, \nCongresswoman Barbara Lee, a Democrat, and myself actually brought a \nresolution to the floor saying that if we are going to be engaged in \ncombat operations in Iraq, that we ought to have a vote on an AUMF, and \nthat passed overwhelmingly.\n  We have been at war now for over 10 months. I mean, bombing every \nday. We have thousands of troops over\n\n[[Page H4023]]\n\nthere. The President is going to send several hundred more over there. \nWhat are we waiting for?\n  We were told in the 113th Congress that we ought to wait till the \n114th Congress. I don't know why, given the fact that the war began \nunder the 113th Congress. But anyway, January came, and we are in the \n114th Congress.\n  Then we were told we have got to wait for the President to submit a \nstrategy or an AUMF. He did.\n  Now, I know you don't like it. I don't like it. Some people want it \nbroader and bigger. Some of us want it more restrictive. But \nnonetheless, he did what he is supposed to do. What we are supposed to \ndo is deliberate.\n  And here we are, 10 months later, and we are all told we will get to \nit. We will get to it. We will get to it.\n  We announced yesterday that we are going to establish a new military \nbase in Iraq, and close to 500 more American troops are going to go \nover there. What are we waiting for?\n  We ought to be debating these AUMFs before we put people into harm's \nway, before we start getting engaged in hostilities.\n  So I have to tell you, I am frustrated not only by the inaction of \nthe leadership of this House, the excuses of the leadership of this \nHouse. I am frustrated by my friends who say, I am with you, but we \nwill just get to it at some other point. I mean, how many months, how \nmany years have to go by before we do our job?\n  The gentleman talked about our constitutional duty to protect the \npeople of the United States. We also have a constitutional duty when it \ncomes to war, and we are not living up to that at all. We are failing \nmiserably, and it really is a disgrace, and it is a disservice to the \nmen and women whom we put into harm's way.\n  Secondly, Mr. Speaker, on the COOL legislation, let me remind my \ncolleagues that consumers, the American people, the people we are \nsupposed to represent, are increasingly seeking more information and \nwant more information about food source and production methods and want \nto make purchases from a trusted source.\n  A 2013 Consumer Federation of America study found that 90 percent of \nAmericans strongly support mandatory COOL for fresh meat and strongly \nfavor requiring meat to be labeled with specific information about \nwhere the animals were born, raised, and processed.\n  A 2010 Consumer Union study shows that 93 percent of consumers would \nprefer to have the country of origin label on the meat that they buy. \nThat is what the American people want.\n  And yet, rather than trying to respond to that, the first inclination \nin the aftermath of this WTO ruling is to basically cave, saying, We \ndon't really care what the American people want. We are just going to \ncave.\n  I think that is the wrong way to proceed, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this COOL legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Conaway), the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington State \nfor giving me the opportunity to testify today regarding the rule \ngoverning debate on H.R. 2393, the Country of Origin Labeling \nAmendments Act of 2015.\n  Country of origin labeling, or COOL for short, was first enacted for \nmeat products as part of the 2002 farm bill. Implementation of the law \nwas delayed until 2008.\n  Less than 5 months after the COOL implementing rule was published, \nCanada and Mexico challenged the rule at the WTO, arguing that it had a \ntrade-distorting impact by reducing the value and number of cattle and \nhogs shipped to the United States.\n  The process has since progressed through the dispute settlement panel \nphase and a U.S. appeal to the WTO's Appellate Body. In both instances, \nthe WTO found that the way the regulations were implemented violated \nWTO obligations by discriminating against imported livestock.\n  The United States was given until May 13, 2013, to bring its COOL \nregulations into compliance. In response, USDA issued a revised COOL \nrule in May of 2013 which required that production steps--born, raised, \nand slaughtered by origin country--be included on meat labels. The \nrevised rule also prohibited the commingling of meat from imported and \ndomestic livestock.\n  At the request of Canada and Mexico, the WTO established a compliance \npanel to determine if the revised rule brought the United States into \ncompliance with the previous ruling. Canada and Mexico claimed that not \nonly did the revised rule fail to bring the United States into \ncompliance, but certain parts, especially the prohibition on \ncommingling, were even more onerous than the original rule.\n  A key criterion for current COOL implementation is that it requires \n``segregation'' of animals by country of origin, which significantly \nraises the cost of utilizing imported livestock. The compliance panel \nreport, released October 20, 2014, upheld the earlier findings of \ndiscrimination.\n  The United States appealed the compliance panel report and on May 18, \n2015, the WTO rejected, again, the United States appeal, and found for \nthe fourth and, believe it or not, final time that the U.S. COOL \nrequirements for beef and pork were unavoidably discriminatory.\n  The final rule kick-starts the WTO process to determine the level of \nretaliatory tariffs that Canada and Mexico can now impose on the United \nStates, which has been widely predicted to have effects in the billions \nof dollars.\n  During a hearing in the House Agriculture Committee's Livestock and \nForeign Agriculture Subcommittee to examine the implications of \npotential retaliation against the U.S., witnesses made it clear that \nlosing the final appeal to the WTO and the inevitable impacts of \nretaliation against the United States would have a devastating impact \non our economy.\n  Witnesses included representatives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, the National Confectioners \nAssociation, the Wine Institute of California, National Cattlemen's \nBeef Association, National Pork Producers Council, and the National \nFarmers Union.\n  Some have asked why we should act on the basis of a WTO decision. If \nCOOL worked, perhaps there would be a response other than a repeal, but \nthe fact is COOL is a marketing failure. In an April 2015 report to \nCongress, USDA explained that COOL requirements result in extraordinary \ncosts with no quantifiable benefits.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. In response to those who argue that COOL enhances food \nsafety, I have also maintained for over 10 years now that is simply not \nthe case. If it were, then all meat served at restaurants would come \nwith an information label of the meat's origin. But it doesn't, and \nthat is because retail food establishments are exempt from the COOL \nrequirements.\n  In a May 1, 2015, letter to Congress, Secretary Vilsack reaffirmed \nthe need for Congress to repeal the disputed COOL label requirements. \nIn other words, if we go down this path with Canada to try to negotiate \nsomething they have no reason to negotiate on, it will fail as well.\n  Repeal is the only viable option for us to avoid these retaliatory \nstatements. Canada and Mexico have both said they are uninterested in \nnegotiation. We are now at a point of fixing this.\n  COOL repeal is the answer. This bill does that. I support the rule \nand the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, at this time it is my pleasure to yield 3 \nminutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.\n  We have been involved with a long struggle in this Congress and \nCongresses before, dating back some 13 years, and even before that, \nabout country of origin labeling. Do people have the right to know \nwhere their food comes from?\n  As the gentleman from Massachusetts pointed out, the American public \nsupports this.\n  We have had a ruling from the WTO that does not prohibit country of \norigin labeling. To the contrary, the case upheld the country's right \nto require food labeling when it serves a broad\n\n[[Page H4024]]\n\npublic interest that does not lead to treatment of a foreign product in \na less favorable way than a domestic one.\n  We are rushing in a repeal that goes beyond just the disputed \nelements, adding poultry, and raising questions, I think, about our \ncommitment to being able to give consumers what they want.\n  There are those that would attach cost to this, but it also is in \nterms of what people want.\n  And I think, we ought to take a deep breath. There is not going to be \nany retaliatory tariffs that are going to be actually inflicted \nquickly. This is a process that is going to take months.\n  The Brazilian cotton subsidies, about which I personally think Brazil \nwas right--we had inappropriate cotton subsidies, and we are paying \nBrazilian cotton interests now because of our refusal to make our own \ncotton policies WTO-compliant.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  That is another scandal, in my judgment, that we are giving $148 \nmillion to Brazilian cotton farmers, because we are giving \ninappropriate subsidies to American cotton farmers when we have other \npriorities.\n  But in this case, we have plenty of time in this Congress to follow \nregular order, to be able to carve out specific provisions that speak \nto the weakness in what the United States did. Because the United \nStates, in enacting this for meat products, it was pretty convoluted, \nand the American Government had been told before that it would not be \nWTO compliant.\n  So this isn't a surprise. It is not an emergency. It is a \nresponsibility we have to try to make these adjustments.\n  I don't want to have our other industries penalized with retaliatory \ntariffs, and they won't be, but we don't have to pass this bill. We \nought to deal with the underlying problems, be narrow, be specific, and \nuphold the right of American consumers to have as much information as \nwe can give them.\n  So I would strongly recommend that we reject the rule and the \nunderlying bill. Let's have this conversation. Let's do it right. And \nlet's make sure that we defend our right under WTO to have appropriate \nfood labeling.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), another member of the Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2393, the Country of \nOrigin Labeling Amendments Act of 2015.\n  This very important legislation is a direct response to the fourth \nand final World Trade Organization ruling that mandatory country of \norigin labeling, or COOL, is anticompetitive and will allow Canada and \nMexico to seek over $3 billion in tariffs on American products, \ndirectly placing American producers at a competitive disadvantage.\n  H.R. 2393 removes cattle, hogs, and chicken from COOL labeling to \nallow our producers to maintain access to two of our largest trading \nmarkets and protect U.S. exports from destructive sanctions.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to adopt this combined rule and vote in \nsupport of the COOL Amendments Act. I encourage the Senate to move this \nlegislation as quickly as possible so our producers can compete on a \nlevel playing field.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, country of origin labeling stands for the \nproposition that knowledge is power. The more knowledge you have, the \nbetter decisions that you can make. This is true about the food that \nyou eat, and it is also true about the trade deals that we are being \nasked to swallow this week.\n  With Fast Track hurtling down on us for a vote the day after \ntomorrow, this recent World Trade Organization decision against the \nUnited States ought to serve as more than a blinking yellow light. It \nought to be viewed as a giant red stoplight.\n  The World Trade Organization ruled that it just isn't ``cool'' to \nsupply consumers more information. And while this decision may not \nactually overrule our law, what you are seeing today is the \npossibility--indeed, the probability--of expensive retaliation against \nAmerican exports unless we yield to this WTO decision. If you support \nlocal decisionmaking, you need to consider the significance of our \nexperience at the World Trade Organization.\n  There have previously been some challenges to United States laws just \nlike this, and the record of the United States at the World Trade \nOrganization when it is challenged is not one to be really proud of. We \nhave had 6 wins and 66 losses. These are losses that have been \nsustained when other countries challenge our laws.\n  Only recently, as my colleague from Connecticut Rosa DeLauro and I \nattempted to present an amendment to a bill to say that corporate \ndeserters--those that leave our country and renounce their charters \nhere in order to dodge taxes--ought not to be given government business \npaid for by our taxpayers, we had some organizations who came and said: \nYou can't do that. You can't deny corporate deserters an opportunity to \nget money from other taxpayers for government work because the World \nTrade Organization wouldn't like it.\n  So there is already a range of threats being used based on existing \ntrade laws. Consider now what will happen when the number of those who \ncan challenge decisions in this Congress, at the State level, and at \nthe local level is multiplied geometrically because of the fact that \nnow, under an investor-state dispute settlement provision, thousands of \nforeign corporations can challenge our regulations and our laws. \nTaxpayers will be exposed to unprecedented amounts of liability because \nof our decision to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the \npeople that we represent.\n  At least the World Trade Organization, the group that decided this \ncase, has an appeal process. There is no such appeal process for these \ncases that will be brought by foreign corporations.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. And the panels that will decide them are usually made up \nof a majority of private lawyers, who one day are litigating cases for \nmultinationals and the next day are deciding these cases.\n  If you agree that foreign investors should not receive greater rights \nthan American investors, if you support local and State decisionmaking \nto keep our air and water and our environment clean without having to \npay foreigners for the privilege of doing so, then there should be \ngreat concern about these trade deals that are being fast-tracked this \nweek.\n  We don't have to look far to see the damage that could occur, because \nonly three months ago, in Canada, it happened when a local decision \nabout expanding a quarry in an environmentally sensitive area was \nchallenged successfully. That is an unfortunate decision.\n  We need to be wary of these Fast-Track proposals and insist that they \nput us on the right track for more trade without jeopardizing the \nhealth and safety of Americans. I tried to do that in the Ways and \nMeans Committee, but, like every other amendment to put us on the right \ntrack, it was rejected. We need to reject that wrong track approach \nthis week.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the good gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for this rule \nand for the underlying bill, H.R. 2393, the Country of Origin Labeling \nAmendments Act. This bill repeals the country of origin labeling \nrequirement for certain meat products because, as it currently stands, \nit threatens the economic livelihood of farmers and ranchers in \nnortheast Georgia and, really, across the Nation.\n  Like so many other regulations that have been promulgated and upheld \nby this administration, it has achieved nothing but harm to our \neconomy--not what it was ``intended to do.'' It does not improve food \nsafety, and it now threatens to further devastate the ability of \nAmerica's agriculture industry to provide for their families by \nviolating our trade obligations and encouraging retaliation from two of \nour largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico.\n\n[[Page H4025]]\n\n  I was sent to Washington to be the voice of 700,000 Americans who \nlive in northeast Georgia. These hard-working Americans produce more \nchicken than any other district in the United States. And now, like so \nmany other Americans, they are facing devastating financial harm \nbecause of the COOL requirement, which arbitrarily mandates that meat \nproducts have a label that shows what country they were produced in.\n  You see, the WTO has ruled on four separate occasions that mandatory \nCOOL requirements violate our obligation to treat our trade partners \nfairly, just as we demand to be treated fairly by them. Now Canada and \nMexico may seek to impose retaliatory tariffs against not only our meat \nexports, but exports on virtually every industry in the United States.\n  Now I can't imagine how knowing that a pork chop came from a pig that \nwas born in Canada could possibly improve food safety, and I really \ncan't imagine it when we already require that all meat imports be \ninspected by at least the same standards that the USDA uses to inspect \nmeat here at home, but I can tell you that it takes no imagination to \nforesee how this will impact our economy. Our trade partners will \nretaliate against us by taxing our exports.\n  Retaliatory tariffs are expected on $493 million worth of Georgia \nexports alone. Nationally, tariffs will impact billions of dollars \nworth of exports. Chicken exports from my district will be taxed the \nmoment they leave the country, and with 20 percent of chicken produced \nin the United States being exported, the impact will be overwhelming.\n  So what will happen if we fail to repeal these mandates? The hard-\nworking farmers in my district and in districts across the country will \nbe unable to compete in the international market.\n  We need to support this rule and the bill.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, let me say that this COOL repeal I think is a \nrash overreaction to the WTO ruling, and I think that we owe it to the \nAmerican people to try to figure out whether there is a middle ground \nhere.\n  And to answer my friend from Georgia, who was like: Well, why do \npeople want to know? Well, maybe the American people want to support \nAmerican farmers. Maybe they want to support the small- and medium-\nsized farms that are doing such incredible work all across this \ncountry. I don't think that that is an outrageous idea. As I mentioned \nbefore, there is overwhelming support for this. Ninety percent of the \nAmerican people support this country of origin labeling.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues, let's do something really radical. \nLet's actually give the American people something that they want.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, at this point, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek), another member of the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2393, the \nCountry of Origin Labeling Amendments Act of 2015, as well as the rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, we oftentimes hear the debate that the mandatory COOL \nlabel is about food safety and protecting our food supply. Let me be \nclear. Mandatory COOL labeling is not about food safety. No matter \nwhere our food comes from, regulations remain in place to ensure safety \nand traceability, regardless of origin. This debate is about the cost \nthat a government-mandated marketing program is having on our economy.\n  The World Trade Organization has ruled against the United States four \ntimes in favor of Mexico and Canada, our largest trading partners. Over \nthe next month, Canada and Mexico will begin seeking retaliatory \ndamages against U.S. products from all over the country. In fact, \nCanada has already announced that it will seek more than $3 billion in \nretaliatory sanctions. These damages are real. They will affect \nfarmers, manufacturers, and small-business owners in my State of \nMichigan and around the country.\n  Michigan's First District produces 70 percent of the tart cherries in \nthe country. We export a lot of these cherries to Canada. Canada has \nplaced cherries on the list for retaliatory sanctions.\n  We also produce other things in my district, like apples, pork, wine, \nmaple syrup. Michigan is also famous for its auto and steel industry. \nCanada plans to target all of these things. These penalties are real. \nThey will cost jobs, which is the last thing we can afford to lose \nright now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMissouri (Mrs. Hartzler), another fine member of the Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas and the \ngentleman from California for their leadership in bringing this \nlegislation to the House floor. I will make my remarks short and \nsimple.\n  Country of origin labeling, or COOL, has been a 13-year failed \nexperiment in public policy. It provides little to no value for the \nconsumer, raises costs for all producers, and has created a significant \ntrade dispute with our number one and number two trading partners, \nCanada and Mexico.\n  It is an embarrassment to our country that we have lost four times in \nthe WTO court and now are facing significant retaliation from our two \nclosest trading partners. This is particularly concerning when you \nconsider that my home State of Missouri alone could face up to $623 \nmillion in economic losses from retaliation.\n  America should be a leader in creating free and fair trade around the \nworld by focusing on removing tariff and nontariff trade barriers, not \ncreating our own.\n  Americans expect labels on their meat and other food products to \nclearly state the health and safety information. COOL goes beyond that, \nthough, and has amounted to nothing more than a government-mandated \nmarketing program that provides little to no value to producers and \nconsumers. The only solution to this failed experiment in public policy \nis full repeal of the country of origin labeling law.\n  I support the underlying bill and encourage my colleagues to vote for \nH.R. 2393.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would just say to the gentlewoman from \nMissouri that a lot of small- and medium-sized farmers strongly \ndisagree with her. There are a lot of consumers who would like to \nsupport American farmers. Nine out of 10 Americans support country of \norigin labeling. Repealing this law would restrict their access to \ncritical information about the food they feed their families, making it \nimpossible to avoid food from countries with poor safety records.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  The WTO has repeatedly ruled that using country of origin labels to \ninform consumers about the source of the food that they eat is a \nlegitimate goal. More than 60 other countries have done this \nsuccessfully without sanctions. So instead of throwing out COOL \nentirely, we should study the successful models and develop an \nalternative system that still maintains our constituents' access to the \ninformation that they demand.\n  The legislation that we are talking about here today goes beyond the \nscope of the WTO case and repeals labeling requirements for ground \nbeef, ground pork, and chicken, ultimately putting the interests of \nindustrial meat processors above the concerns of 90 percent of the \nAmerican public.\n  Again, it shouldn't be a radical idea around here to try to do what \nthe American people want. They want to know where their food is grown, \nwhere their food is produced. Let's give it to them. Let's try to work \na compromise out here rather than just this knee-jerk bill that kind of \nthrows the baby out with the bathwater.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I have no more speakers, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Washington has 11 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4026]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, first of all, on the COOL repeal, I include for the \nRecord a letter to Chairman Conaway and to Ranking Member Peterson \nsigned by hundreds of organizations--farm organizations, consumer \ngroups, labor groups, food safety groups, and I could go on and on and \non--basically saying that this legislation that we are considering here \ntoday is a bad idea.\n\n                                                     June 8, 2015.\n     Hon. K. Michael Conaway,\n     Chairman, House Agriculture Committee, 1301 Longworth House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Collin Peterson,\n     Ranking Member, House Agriculture Committee, 1301 Longworth \n         House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson: The \n     undersigned 283 farm, rural, faith, environmental, labor, \n     farmworker, manufacturer and consumer organizations \n     respectfully urge you to reject the repeal of the Country-of-\n     Origin Labeling (COOL) law and support commonsense food \n     labeling. Polls show that nine out of ten Americans support \n     COOL. Consumers continue to demand more information about \n     their food and producers want to share that information.\n       Although the World Trade Organization (WTO) Appellate Body \n     has issued its decision on COOL, the United States has a \n     sovereign right to allow the dispute process to proceed to \n     its completion and then decide how and whether to implement \n     the adverse ruling. Our organizations remain steadfast in \n     their opposition to any efforts to undermine COOL through \n     repeal or any other measures.\n       It is premature for the Congress to unilaterally surrender \n     to saber-rattling from our trading partners in the midst of a \n     long-standing dispute. COOL opponents have highlighted Mexico \n     and Canada's threats of retaliation as if their aspiration to \n     seek billions of dollars in penalties were already approved \n     by the WTO. But these unapproved, unrealistically high \n     retaliation claims are merely aggressive litigation tactics \n     designed to frighten the United States--a standard practice \n     in WTO disputes. Congress should not fall for it.\n       The WTO can only authorize penalties based on the extent to \n     which COOL caused a reduction in the volume and price of \n     livestock imports. But the economic recession was the driving \n     factor behind declining livestock imports, not the \n     application of a simple label.\n       Cattle imports are higher today than when COOL went into \n     effect and hog imports are rapidly rebounding, even with COOL \n     in place. This straightforward logic is buttressed by a \n     recent economic report from Auburn University that \n     demonstrates that COOL has not impacted the livestock trade \n     and that any harm to our trading partners has in fact been \n     negligible at most.\n       Moreover, retaliation is only relevant if the United \n     States, Canada and Mexico cannot reach an agreement after the \n     parties have undergone the full WTO arbitration process. In \n     past WTO disputes that the United States has lost, the United \n     States has waited for the process to conclude and then has \n     successfully avoided WTO-authorized trade sanctions by \n     negotiating a settlement with the other country in the \n     dispute.\n       Finally, the proposed COOL repeal legislation is \n     particularly extreme in that it would roll back commonsense \n     labels that the WTO actually supported or that never even \n     were raised in the WTO dispute. The legislation would repeal \n     COOL for ground beef and ground pork as well as for chicken, \n     but the WTO explicitly ruled that the COOL label on ground \n     meat was WTO-legal, and the dispute never addressed chicken \n     or other covered commodities (including seafood, fresh and \n     frozen fruits and vegetables, goat, venison and some nuts).\n       COOL is extremely important to our organizations and to the \n     American public. We oppose any legislation that would repeal \n     any portion of the COOL law. We urge Congress to stand up for \n     America's consumers, farmers and ranchers by rejecting any \n     effort to unilaterally repeal a popular food label even \n     before the WTO process has concluded.

Again, I would just say to my colleagues on this \nlegislation, the American people do not want a total repeal. Nine out \nof ten Americans support country of origin labeling. We ought to work \nout a good compromise so the American people can get what they want and \nhave access to the knowledge about their food that they want. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule with regard to this and ``no'' on \nthe underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to say a few words about the Defense \nAppropriations bill. And for the viewing public who are watching this \nand who are trying to figure out what does country of origin labeling \nhave to do with a Defense Appropriations bill, I would again remind \nthem that the Republican leadership and the Republicans on the Rules \nCommittee have this new technique of bunching diverse pieces of \nlegislation together under one rule to stifle debate and to make it \nmore difficult for people to have their say on these important bills \nand to try to confuse things.\n  But I do think that it is important that people understand that the \nDefense Appropriations bill is given a role under this rule, and I \nwould urge my colleagues to think long and hard before they vote. I \nwould urge them to vote ``no'' on the Defense Appropriations bill for a \nwhole number of reasons, notwithstanding the slush fund, the so-called \nOCO account, that is playing fast and loose with the numbers so that my \nRepublican colleagues don't have to deal with the issue of \nsequestration. But I would also urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on \nthis, because this bill will appropriate billions of more dollars for a \nwar in the Middle East that Congress hasn't had the guts to debate and \nvote on.\n  It has been 10 months--10 months--thousands of our troops have been \ndeployed into harm's way. The President announced last night we are \nestablishing a new base in Iraq. Close to 500 more American troops are \ngoing to be deployed in Iraq, and not a single debate in this Congress, \nnot a single vote on whether this is the best strategy.\n  The President has submitted his AUMF. I think it is too broad; some \npeople think it is too restrictive. But it is up to the Congress to \nfashion an AUMF that gets 218 votes or to vote to bring our troops \nhome. That is the choice. But doing nothing is not a choice. That is an \nabrogation of our constitutional responsibilities.\n  Every single Member should be ashamed of the fact that 10 months into \nthis war we haven't done a thing. How do you explain that to your \nconstituents whose sons and daughters have been placed into harm's way? \nHow do you explain that to your constituents that we are mostly \nborrowing $3.5 million an hour to pay for these wars, but we don't have \nthe time to debate it or to vote on it?\n  Mr. Speaker, I will include for the Record two articles. The first \none is an Associated Press article, entitled, ``U.S. to Send More \nTroops to Iraq for Expanded Training Mission''; and the other is a New \nYork Times article, entitled, ``U.S. Embracing a New Approach on \nBattling ISIS in Iraq.''\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Jun. 10, 2015]\n\n     U.S. To Send More Troops to Iraq for Expanded Training Mission\n\n                 (By Robert Burns and Lolita C. Baldor)\n\n       Jerusalem.--An expected White House decision to send \n     several hundred more troops to Iraq to expand training of \n     Iraqi forces in Anbar province is not a shift in U.S. \n     strategy but is aimed at helping Iraq retake the provincial \n     capital, Ramadi, and eventually blunt the Islamic State's \n     battlefield momentum.\n       The decision, which could be announced as soon as \n     Wednesday, would increase the number of U.S. training sites \n     in Iraq from four to five and enable a larger number of \n     Iraqis--mostly Sunni tribal volunteers, in this case--to join \n     the fight against the Islamic militant group. It is \n     consistent with the overall U.S. approach of building up \n     Iraqi forces while simultaneously conducting aerial bombing \n     of Islamic State targets.\n       U.S. officials have said repeatedly that getting the Sunnis \n     more deeply involved in the war is critical to ousting IS \n     from Anbar.\n       It leaves open, however, the larger question of whether the \n     Shiite-led Iraqi government will make the troop commitments \n     necessary to oust the Islamic State from Ramadi, which the \n     militants captured last month, and Fallujah, which they have \n     held for more than a year. Up to now, Iraqi officials have \n     chosen to deploy most U.S.-trained Iraqi troops in defensive \n     formations around Baghdad, the capital.\n       President Barack Obama has ruled out sending U.S. ground \n     combat forces to Iraq.\n\n[[Page H4028]]\n\n     There now are slightly fewer than 3,100 U.S. troops there in \n     training, advising, security and other support roles. The \n     U.S. also is flying bombing missions as well as aerial \n     reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering missions to degrade \n     the Islamic State's forces, while counting on Iraqi ground \n     troops to retake lost territory.\n       A U.S. official said Wednesday that the extra U.S. training \n     site will be at al-Taqqadum, a desert air base that was a \n     U.S. military hub during the 2003-2011 war. Establishing the \n     training camp will require between 400 and 500 U.S. troops, \n     including trainers, logisticians and security personnel, the \n     official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because a \n     final administration decision had not been announced.\n       The U.S. already is training Iraqi troops at four sites--\n     two in the vicinity of Baghdad, one at al-Asad air base in \n     Anbar province and one near Irbil in northern Iraq.\n       The addition of one training site is a modest tweak to the \n     existing U.S. approach in Iraq. It was unclear Wednesday how \n     many more Iraqi troops could be added to the fight against IS \n     in coming months by opening one new training base. One \n     official said the training at al-Taqqadum is likely to being \n     this summer.\n       Over the past year the U.S. has trained approximately 9,000 \n     Iraqi troops.\n       The new plan is not likely to include the deployment of \n     U.S. forces closer to the front lines to either call in \n     airstrikes or advise smaller Iraqi units in battle, officials \n     said. One official, however, said the adjustment may include \n     a plan for expediting the delivery of arms and military \n     equipment to some elements of the Iraqi military.\n       On Tuesday, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, said in Jerusalem that he has recommended \n     changes to President Barack Obama but he offered no \n     assessment of when decisions would be made and announced. He \n     suggested the president was considering a number of \n     questions, including what adjustments to U.S. military \n     activities in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world might be \n     needed if the U.S. does more in Iraq.\n       Dempsey said the Pentagon also is reviewing ways to improve \n     the effectiveness of its air campaign, which is a central \n     pillar of Obama's strategy for enabling Iraqi ground forces \n     to recapture territory held by the Islamic State.\n       Obama said Monday that the United States still lacks a \n     ``complete strategy'' for training Iraqi forces. He also \n     urged Iraq's Shiite-dominated government to allow more of the \n     nation's Sunnis to join the campaign against the violent \n     militant group.\n       Dempsey said Obama recently asked his national security \n     team to examine the train-and-equip program and determine \n     ways to make it more effective. Critics have questioned the \n     U.S. approach, and even Defense Secretary Ash Carter has \n     raised doubts by saying the collapse of Iraqi forces in \n     Ramadi last month suggested the Iraqis lack a ``will to \n     fight.''\n       The viability of the U.S. strategy is hotly debated in \n     Washington, with some calling for U.S. ground combat troops \n     or at least the embedding of U.S. air controllers with Iraqi \n     ground forces to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of \n     U.S. and coalition airstrikes. Dempsey was not specifically \n     asked about that but gave no indication that Obama has \n     dropped his resistance to putting U.S. troops into combat in \n     Iraq.\n       ``What he's asked us to do is to take a look back at what \n     we've learned over the last eight months of the train-and-\n     equip program, and make recommendations to him on whether \n     there are capabilities that we may want to provide to the \n     Iraqis to actually make them more capable . . . whether there \n     are other locations where we might establish training \n     sites,'' and look for ways to develop Iraqi military leaders, \n     he said.\n       Dempsey said there will be no radical change to the U.S. \n     approach in Iraq. Rather, it is a recognition that the effort \n     has either been too slow or has allowed setbacks where \n     ``certain units have not stood and fought.'' He did not \n     mention the Ramadi rout specifically, but Dempsey previously \n     has said the Iraqis drove out of the city on their own.\n       ``Are there ways to give them more confidence?'' This, he \n     said, is among the questions Obama wanted Dempsey and others \n     to answer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 10, 2015]\n\n         U.S. Embracing a New Approach on Battling ISIS in Iraq\n\n                         (By Michael R. Gordon)\n\n       Washington.--In a major shift of focus in the battle \n     against the Islamic State, the Obama administration is \n     planning to establish a new military base in Anbar Province, \n     Iraq, and to send up to 450 more American military trainers \n     to help Iraqi forces retake the city of Ramadi.\n       The White House on Wednesday is expected to announce a plan \n     that follows months of behind-the-scenes debate about how \n     prominently plans to retake Mosul, another Iraqi city that \n     fell to the Islamic State last year, should figure in the \n     early phase of the military campaign against the group.\n       The fall of Ramadi last month effectively settled the \n     administration debate, at least for the time being. American \n     officials said Ramadi was now expected to become the focus of \n     a lengthy campaign to regain Mosul at a later stage, possibly \n     not until 2016.\n       The additional American troops will arrive as early as this \n     summer, a United States official said, and will focus on \n     training Sunni fighters with the Iraqi Army. The official \n     called the coming announcement ``an adjustment to try to get \n     the right training to the right folks.''\n       The troops will set up the training center primarily to \n     advise and assist Iraqi security forces and to engage and \n     reach out to Sunni tribes in Anbar, a senior United States \n     official said. The focus for the Americans will be to try to \n     accelerate the integration of Sunni fighters into the Iraqi \n     Army, which is dominated by Shiites. That will be an uphill \n     task as many of the Sunni fighters in the area do not trust \n     the Iraqi Army.\n       But the Obama administration hopes is that the outreach \n     will reduce the Iraqi military's reliance on Shiite militias \n     to take back territory from the Islamic State. ``The Sunnis \n     want to be part of the fight,'' the official said, speaking \n     on the condition of anonymity. ``This will help empower them, \n     creating more recruits and more units to fight ISIL,'' he \n     added, using another acronym for the Islamic State.\n       He said the arms and equipment sent will go to the Iraqi \n     government forces in Anbar, not directly to the Sunni tribes, \n     adding that the new strategy was not a change in policy to \n     directly arm Sunnis, but rather a faster way to get equipment \n     and arms to the battlefield, which the Iraqi government had \n     requested.\n       The United States Central Command's emphasis on retaking \n     Mosul depended critically on efforts to retrain the Iraqi \n     Army, which appear to have gotten off to a slow start. Some \n     Iraqi officials also thought the schedule for taking Mosul \n     was unrealistic, and some bridled when an official from the \n     Central Command told reporters in February that an assault to \n     capture the city was planned for this spring.\n       Now, pending approval by the White House, plans are being \n     made to use Al Taqqadum, an Iraqi base near the town of \n     Habbaniya, as another training hub for the American-led \n     coalition.\n       Alistair Baskey, a National Security Council spokesman, \n     said that the administration hoped to accelerate the training \n     and equipping of Iraqi security forces, and that ``those \n     options include sending additional trainers.'' The United \n     States now has about 3,000 troops, including trainers and \n     advisers, in Iraq. But the steps envisioned by the White \n     House are likely to be called half-measures by critics \n     because they do not call for an expansion of the role of \n     American troops, such as the use of spotters to call in \n     airstrikes.\n       There has long been debate within the administration about \n     what the first steps in the campaign should be. Led by Gen. \n     Lloyd J. Austin III, the Central Command has long emphasized \n     the need to strike a blow against the Islamic State by \n     recapturing Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which was \n     taken by the group in June 2014. Mosul is the capital of \n     Nineveh Province in northern Iraq and was the site of a \n     sermon that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic \n     State, defiantly delivered in July. The Baiji refinery, a \n     major oil complex, is on a main road to Mosul.\n       While General Austin was looking north, State Department \n     officials have highlighted the strategic importance of Anbar \n     Province in western Iraq.\n       Anbar is home to many of Iraq's Sunni tribes, whose support \n     American officials hope to enlist in the struggle against the \n     Islamic State. Ramadi, the provincial capital of Anbar, is \n     less than 70 miles from Baghdad, and the province borders \n     Saudi Arabia and Jordan, two important members of the \n     coalition against the Islamic State. The differing \n     perspectives within the administration came to the fore in \n     April when Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, asserted that Ramadi was not central to the \n     future of Iraq. The Islamic State's capture of Ramadi last \n     month also punctured the administration's description that \n     the group was on the defensive.\n       Iraqis are ISIS, are Sunni, are Shia. But we'll train \n     whomever shows up and give them weapons and air support. At \n     what point does U.S . . . .\n       Suddenly, it appeared that the Islamic State, not the \n     American-led coalition, was on the march. Prime Minister \n     Haider al-Abadi of Iraq scrambled to assemble a plan to \n     regain the city.\n       The Islamic State now controls two provincial capitals, as \n     well as the city of Falluja. With the help of American air \n     power, the Iraqis have retaken Tikrit, northwest of Baghdad, \n     but so many buildings there are still rigged with explosives \n     that many of its residents have been unable to return.\n       To assemble a force to retake Ramadi, the number of Iraqi \n     tribal fighters in Anbar who are trained and equipped is \n     expected to increase to as many as 10,000 from about 5,500.\n       More than 3,000 new Iraqi soldiers are to be recruited to \n     fill the ranks of the Seventh Iraqi Army division in Anbar \n     and the Eighth Iraqi Army division, which is in Habbaniya, \n     where the Iraqi military operations center for the province \n     is also based.\n       But to the frustration of critics like Senator John McCain, \n     Republican of Arizona, who say that the United States is \n     losing the initiative to the Islamic State, the Obama \n     administration has yet to approve the use of American \n     spotters on the battlefield to call in airstrikes in and \n     around Ramadi. Nor has it approved the use of Apache \n     helicopter gunships to help Iraqi troops retake the city.\n       General Dempsey alluded to the plan to expand the military \n     footprint in Iraq during a visit to Israel on Tuesday, saying \n     that he\n\n[[Page H4029]]\n\n     had asked war commanders to look into expanding the number of \n     training sites for Iraqi forces. The United States is not the \n     only country that is expanding its effort.\n       Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, said this week \n     that his country would send up to 125 additional troops to \n     train Iraqi forces, including in how to clear improvised \n     bombs.\n       Italy is also expected to play an important role in \n     training the Iraqi police.\n       Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Jerusalem.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this House, this Congress, is not working. \nThe fact that we can be in the middle of a new war, spending all these \nresources, committing all these young lives into harm's way, and we \ncan't even bring an AUMF to the floor to have a debate, it is \nappalling. I don't know how we can face our constituents, look them in \nthe eye, and say we are doing our job here. We are not. I don't know \nanything more important that we should debate and deliberate on than \nwar. I mean, war is a big deal. The unfortunate thing in this \ninstitution, war has become too easy. I am tired of the excuses, and I \nam tired of the whining. The President has done what he is supposed to \ndo. Everybody has done what they are supposed to do except us. I am not \ngoing to vote for any bill that appropriates more money for a war that \nwe don't even have the guts to authorize.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, again I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this \ngrab bag rule, vote ``no'' on this ridiculous COOL repeal, and vote \n``no'' on the defense appropriations bill. Let's vote these down and \ncome back and do our job the way the American people expect us to do \nour job.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and \nlet me say thank you to the gentleman from Massachusetts and the points \nhe raises. I enjoy serving on the Rules Committee with Mr. McGovern.\n  Let me just say, this Congress, we are on track to be one of the most \nproductive Congresses in many, many years, and part of the reason is \nthe use of the compound rule, which provides for separate consideration \nof each underlying measure under a single rule. It helps expedite \nlegislative business. Consideration of one rule allows the House more \ntime to debate the underlying measures. It has given us the opportunity \nto achieve that efficiency and that effectiveness and productivity.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Will the gentleman yield for a 10-second question?\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts for a 10-\nsecond question.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. How does this rule give us more time to debate the COOL \nrepeal? It is a pretty straightforward, limited debate that we are \ngiven. I would argue that what you are doing is denying us the right to \ndebate appropriately these important issues. We are not saving time. \nWhat the Republican majority is doing is limiting our opportunity.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Reclaiming my time after that 10-second question, the \nAgriculture Committee has had ample time for debate on that question. \nWe are bringing forward what is a very critical decision that has to be \nmade in a very limited timeframe, and so it is an appropriate approach \nto addressing this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, the issues we are considering today have serious \nconsequences for the security and economic well-being of our country, \nwhich is why I am urging my colleagues to support this rule and the \nunderlying bills.\n  H.R. 2685 is an important measure that funds our Nation's national \ndefense and its critical national security programs. It provides the \nresources needed to continue our essential military efforts abroad and \naddresses the vital needs of our men and women in uniform.\n  An effective, well-equipped, well-trained military is in the best \ninterest of all Americans and is indispensable to the common defense of \nour country. This bill includes vital funding for the U.S. military and \nintelligence community as they remain engaged in responding to these \nchallenges abroad. This bill also makes difficult budgetary choices \nthat will help us save taxpayer dollars wherever possible, but it does \nso without undermining the safety, the security, and the success of our \ntroops and their families.\n  With the rise of ISIS, the continued presence of al Qaeda, the \nemergence and growth of terrorist groups in North Africa, near systemic \ninstability across the Middle East, and the ongoing situation in \nUkraine, our military must remain strong and ready to address evolving \nthreats both at home and abroad.\n  Our highest national priority should always be the protection of our \ncountry, and the funding levels in this bill will ensure our military \nremains the most capable, prepared, and exceptional armed force \nanywhere in the world. To me the choice is clear. What side are we on? \nWe choose to be on the side of our troops, and I am proud to support \nthis bill and the important funding it provides our Nation's military, \nsecurity, and our courageous men and women in uniform.\n  This rule also provides for the consideration of H.R. 2393, the \nCountry of Origin Labeling Amendments Act, a measure that warrants \nimmediate and serious consideration by both Houses of Congress, because \nthe ramifications of doing nothing will be severe and could imperil \nmany sectors of our country, from ranchers and grape growers to \nmanufacturers and exporters.\n  With only 37 days left to respond, the threat of retaliation is very \nreal. My friends on the other side of the aisle may argue that we have \nmore time to address this issue, but the reality is time is simply \nrunning out. For over 7 years, we have been trying to rectify this \nissue. WTO's latest verdict, handed down on May 18, is our fourth and \nfinal loss in the court proceedings. Now both Canada and Mexico have \npublicly stated they will retaliate against the United States, and the \nofficial request for retaliation is set to occur on June 17. This is \nnot an idle threat. It is not saber rattling. Last week, Canada \nannounced that it will seek $3 billion in retaliatory measures, and \nMexico stated it will be seeking tariffs totaling $635 million.\n  Even before retaliation, COOL has had a negative economic impact in \nmany areas across the country. Tyson Foods has a plant in my district, \nand given the proximity to Canada, this plant in Pasco depends on \nCanadian cattle. However, under COOL, the plant cannot commingle U.S. \nand Canadian cattle. They have to be run in separate lines, and the \nplant has to use multiple labels depending on the origin of those \ncattle. COOL has increased the Pasco facility's operating costs due to \nthe requirements and inefficiencies involved with the segregation of \nthe cattle; and with less animals available across the Pacific \nNorthwest, the plant is currently operating at less than 40 hours per \nweek, leading to less money being put into the local economy from less \ncompensation from employers.\n  Mr. Speaker, COOL threatens the trade relationships we have with two \nof our biggest markets for the export of U.S. meat and agricultural \nproducts. If we don't repeal the requirements of COOL, we are in \nviolation of our WTO obligations. As I said, we could face billions of \ndollars in retaliation that would hurt farmers and ranchers, small \nbusinesses, and, yes, American consumers. We need this legislation now \nin order to prevent those retaliatory actions and to bring the United \nStates into compliance with our WTO obligations, which can only be done \nby repealing these provisions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the discussion we have had over the last \nhour. Although we may have some differences of opinion--we usually do--\nI believe this rule and the underlying bills are strong measures that \nare important to the future of our country. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport House Resolution 303 and the underlying bills.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise against yet another closed \nrule on an issue that deserves weeks of open, transparent debate: \ntrade.\n  This House is debating whether or not to repeal a consumer protection \nmeasure that 9 in 10 Americans support--country of origin labeling on \nmeat in our grocery stores. This essential provision could be reversed \nin one fell swoop all because the World Trade Organization has decided \nthat those labels hurt Mexico and Canada, our so-called ``Trading \nPartners,'' who have threatened the United States with billions of \ndollars in sanctions if we don't capitulate.\n  The WTO's ruling highlights yet another example of a trading system \nthat benefits foreign competitors and global corporations at the \nexpense of the American consumer.\n\n[[Page H4030]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues will remember this vote when the House turns its \nattention to fast track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade \nagreement.\n  Advocates of fast track are selling the American people a flawed \ntrade deal which has been negotiated in secret by multi-national \ncorporations. This trade deal, which proponents will tell you will \nreinvigorate the middle class, create jobs, and strengthen the American \neconomy, will do just the opposite. What's more, the president wants to \ncircumvent congressional authority by stopping debate and using fast \ntrack to ram a bad deal through this chamber.\n  Not only will fast track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership cause \nserious harm to the American worker, they threaten American \nsovereignty, and this repeal bill is a prime example of that.\n  Not only does this silence the voice of the American people, it cuts \nout the People's House and would topple even more consumer protections.\n  From changing fuel efficiency standards, limiting access to \nprescription drugs, weakening the Clean Air Act, and more, the TPP is \nnot simply about trade, it puts every facet of our daily lives at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to reconsider their path forward and work for \nthe American people, not against them.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on adoption of House Resolution 303 will be followed by 5-\nminute votes on the motion to suspend the rules and agree to H. Res. \n295 and agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 244, \nnays 187, not voting 2, as follows:\n\n

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 2393.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I rise in support of H.R. 2393, the Country of Origin Labeling \nAmendments Act of 2015.\n\n       Mandatory country of origin labeling is really a marketing \n     program, a heavy-handed approach by this Federal Government \n     to demand a marketing program that may or may not work.\n\n  Those were my words before this very Chamber, spoken more than 10 \nyears ago today. It turns out that my doubts were well founded. The \nprogram has not worked, and it is time to put this failed experiment \nbehind us once and for all.\n  Country of origin labeling, or COOL for short, was first enacted for \nmeat products as a part of the 2002 farm bill. Implementation of the \nlaw was actually delayed until 2008.\n  Less than 5 months after the COOL-implementing rule was published, \nCanada and Mexico challenged the rule at the WTO, arguing that it had a \ntrade-distorting impact by reducing the value and number of cattle and \nhogs shipped to the United States market.\n  The WTO process has since progressed through the dispute settlement \nphase, a U.S. appeal to the WTO'S appellate body, review by a WTO \ncompliance panel, and an appeal by the U.S. of that decision. In all \nfour instances, Mr. Speaker, the United States lost.\n  In the fourth and final decision, released on May 18, the WTO \nrejected the United States' argument and found that the U.S. COOL \nrequirements for beef and pork are unavoidably discriminatory. The \nfinal rule kick-starts the process to determine the level of \nretaliatory tariffs Canada and Mexico can now impose on the U.S., which \nhas widely been predicted to have effects in the billions of dollars.\n  During a hearing of the House Agriculture Committee's Livestock and \nForeign Agriculture Subcommittee to examine the implications of \npotential retaliation against the U.S., witnesses made it clear that \nlosing the final appeal to the WTO and the inevitable impacts of \nretaliation against the United States and its economy would be \ndevastating.\n  Some have asked why we should act on the basis of a WTO decision. If \nCOOL worked, perhaps there would be a response other than repeal, but \nthe fact is COOL has been a marketing failure. In an April 2015 report \nto Congress, USDA explained that COOL requirements result in \nextraordinary costs with no quantifiable benefits.\n  Although some consumers desire COOL information, there is no evidence \nto conclude that this mandatory labeling translates into measurable \nincreases in consumer demand for beef, pork, or chicken.\n  In response to those who argue that COOL enhances food safety, as I \nhave maintained now for 10 years, that is simply not the case. If it \nwere, then all meat served at restaurants would come with information \nregarding the meat's origin, but it doesn't. That is because retail \nfood establishments are exempt from COOL requirements.\n  Meat sold in the U.S. will continue to be inspected for safety by the \nUSDA Food Safety and Inspection Service. This bill does nothing to \nchange that and will simply repeal a heavy-handed, government-mandated \nmarketing program that has proven to be unsuccessful.\n  Here we are with a policy that imposes high costs, no benefits, and \nif we keep it in place, our national economy will suffer significant \ndamage that can reach into the billions of dollars.\n  Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack has been quoted numerous times \nacknowledging that repeal of the COOL requirements is a viable option \nfor bringing the U.S. into compliance with its WTO obligations and \navoiding retaliatory measures.\n  In a recent letter to Congress, Secretary Vilsack reaffirmed the need \nfor Congress to repeal the disputed COOL requirements or develop a \ngeneric North American label. However, Canada and Mexico have \npreviously rejected the North American label, rendering that option \nunacceptable.\n  In other words, if we go down this path which Canada and Mexico have \nalready rejected, we will continue to face retaliation unless and until \nwe can demonstrate we are in compliance with our trade obligations. \nRepeal is the only viable option before us to avoid this retaliation.\n  I urge all Members to support this simple, straightforward \nlegislation so that we can, in the best bipartisan tradition of this \nHouse, avoid damage to our economy.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in opposition to this bill. H.R. 2393 is a premature reaction \nto the WTO ruling against the U.S. country of origin labeling, or COOL, \nlaw. Rather than taking the time to find a workable solution, the \ncommittee passed a repeal just 2 days after the WTO issued a ruling. We \nunderstand that this needs to be dealt with.\n  My problem with this whole process is that it just is not giving \npeople enough time to look at this and figure out what is a reasonable \nsolution. Most other countries have labeling. The American people want \nto know where their ag products come from.\n  If we repealed this on meat, we wouldn't be able to know where meat \ncomes from, but we would be able to know where your carrots, lettuce, \nand all these other things come from. They all have mandatory country \nof origin labeling.\n  We understand that this needed to be worked on, and we understand \nthat we can't get into a situation with the retaliation, but this is a \nrush to judgment that is not necessary because this retaliation process \nis going to take a while.\n  We had the Step 2 cotton case. It went 2 or 3 years before it got \nresolved; this is going to go faster, but the first thing that has to \nhappen is they have to figure out what the damage is. That is going to \ntake them a while, a month or two, and then they are going to have to \nhave an arbitration panel to get everybody to agree that that is \nexactly what it is.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  So this Canadian claim that there are $3 billion in economic losses \ndue to COOL is ridiculous and is based on unsubstantiated and not \npublicly available data. The U.S. studies, using USDA data, have found \nlittle, if any, economic harm.\n  As I said, more than 60 other countries, including Canada, have their \nown version of COOL. In fact, Canada has a host of protectionist \nagriculture laws in place that damage the U.S. dairy, poultry, and egg \nsectors.\n  The Canadian system puts U.S. products at a disadvantage every day. \nAnd yet, the Canadians take issue when we try to give consumers \nadditional information on where their meat comes from, claiming it \ndisadvantages Canadian producers.\n  Additionally, consumers are demanding more and more information about \nwhere their food comes from and how it is produced. The WTO has \nrepeatedly ruled that COOL is a legitimate goal.\n  Rather than abandon our efforts to provide consumers with this \ninformation, we need to have the time so we will be able to find a \nreasonable solution to work this out without WTO sanctions. I believe \nit can be done, and it can be done in fairly short order.\n  So, as I said, my biggest problem is that this bill is premature. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the former chairman of the House Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, Mr. Conaway, for his leadership on yet another \nimportant issue for agriculture this week in the Congress.\n  I rise in strong support of the Country of Origin Labeling Amendments \nAct of 2015, which would repeal mandatory country of origin labeling \nfor meat and bring the United States back into international trade \ncompliance.\n  I have always had concerns about mandatory country of origin \nlabeling, and now the WTO's continued rulings against this practice, as \nwell as Canada's and Mexico's threats to seek $3\n\n[[Page H4034]]\n\nbillion in retaliatory tariffs, make the hard and fast case for repeal.\n  For my home State of Virginia, it is estimated the potential economic \nimpact of retaliation from Mexico and Canada could add up to tariffs of \n$331 million worth of exports on products like paper, aluminum, and \nbread.\n  Mandatory COOL has failed and threatens our trade relationship with \ntwo of our strongest partners. Our markets, producers, and consumers \ncannot afford the cost of this failed policy. We will all benefit by \nits repeal.\n  Mandatory COOL for meat has been debated for almost 15 years. Within \n5 months of its 2009 implementation, Canada and Mexico challenged COOL \nat the WTO, arguing that it had trade-distorting impact by reducing the \nvalue of cattle and hogs shipped to the U.S. market. The WTO ruled in \nfavor of Canada and Mexico four times.\n  Now that the U.S. has lost its final appeal, it is imperative that \nthe Congress act quickly to avoid billions of dollars in retaliation.\n  In the case of cattle, hogs, and chicken, it has proved to be a \nfailed experiment, imposing significant costs on producers, packers, \nand consumers with no quantifiable benefit.\n  United States Department of Agriculture Secretary Vilsack has stated \nthe Department has no further options for administrative remedies. The \nissue has to be fixed legislatively through Congress, and this way of \nrepeal is, by far, the best.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa).\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure to repeal \nthe country of origin labeling.\n  I want to thank the chairman for bringing this measure up. I also \nwant to thank the ranking member always for his efforts to be balanced \nand to try to solve problems.\n  But I have been saying--and he and I disagree on this measure--for \nyears that this country of origin labeling has simply not worked. So I \nam pleased that we are here today to debate the legislation that, in \nfact, repeals the country of origin labeling for beef, pork, and \nchicken products. Hopefully we can move on to figure out a solution to \nthis problem.\n  That said, let's be clear: I want to emphasize, this measure has \nnothing to do with food safety. Let me repeat. It has nothing to do \nwith food safety. The inspection process by the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration remains \nin place for all consumable products that the American public eats.\n  So what this has to do with is simply about how we market beef, pork, \nor chicken across the country.\n  Going further, to ensure that we act on this measure, we do not want \nto have to deal with a devastating blow to our economy through economic \nretaliation.\n  Last month, as has been noted by my colleagues, the World Trade \nOrganization rejected the United States appeal. This was our last and \nfinal appeal. And for many of us, we felt it was predictable.\n  We now face harsh trade retaliations from two of our largest export \nmarkets, Canada and Mexico, against products that are produced in \nAmerica. This especially impacts California, the number one \nagricultural State in the Nation. The Canadian Government has already \npublished its list of commodities that will be subject to tariff \nincreases and estimates the impact could reach in excess of $3 million, \nwith the direct effect in California being over $1 billion.\n  This is real. They prepared the list, and it could be implemented as \nearly as this fall.\n  For example, Canada imports 90 percent of its table wine from my home \nState of California. If the tariff is increased to 100 percent, that \nwill mean customers in Canada will have to pay double for a bottle of \ngood California wine. If consumers in Canada see that price double, I \nsuspect they are going to buy their wine elsewhere.\n  This will be detrimental to U.S. trade, as an example, but to all \nproducts that are produced in America.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PETERSON. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. COSTA. The bottom line is, we don't want to see any retaliatory \nefforts made by Canada and Mexico, and I don't think they want to \nimpose them.\n  This bill is our only option right now to satisfy the WTO compliance. \nIn addition, as has been noted, the Secretary of Agriculture has stated \na legislative fix is required to resolve this problem.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure, and let's take \naction. And the Senate will need to then act, and then we have a chance \nto come together and fix this legislation.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Aderholt), the chairman of the House Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Agriculture.\n  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I also rise in support of \nH.R. 2393, which, as has been mentioned, provides a long-overdue repeal \nof the country of origin labeling requirements for beef, pork, and \npoultry products.\n\n  Over the years, this law has forced USDA to use limited resources to \nimplement and enforce a program that has nothing to do with food \nsafety, and there is little to no evidence that it has increased \nconsumer demand, according to a USDA-commissioned survey.\n  Serving as chairman of the House Appropriations Agriculture \nSubcommittee, I am very aware of the economic harm that this burdensome \nlaw has already caused U.S. livestock producers, and more economic harm \nis on the horizon.\n  The World Trade Organization, the WTO Appellate Body, has ruled in \nfavor of Canada and Mexico and found the U.S. country of origin \nlabeling requirements are in violation of international trade \nobligations.\n  Both the Governments of Canada and of Mexico have clearly expressed \ntheir intent to seek authority from the WTO to retaliate. This could \nend up suffering economic impact in this country of almost $4 billion.\n  The FY 2015 exploratory statement accompanying the omnibus \nappropriation bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to provide a \nreport with his recommendation for establishing a trade-compliant \ncountry of origin labeling program. In his response, repeal of this \nprovision was a clear solution.\n  I know that there are some here in the Chamber this afternoon that \nwill not agree with the answer, but there have been ample opportunities \nto craft another labeling program that meets our trade \nresponsibilities.\n  This could have been addressed in the farm bill, or those individuals \nwanting a labeling program could have been working on it since last \nOctober, when the WTO ruled again that this law violated our trade \nobligations.\n  We are out of time, and the repeal is the only option that we have at \nhand. I urge my colleagues to support the bill that is before us today \nin order to prevent harm to U.S. jobs, to prevent harm to the United \nStates economy, and to protect the trading relations with our Nation's \nstrongest partners.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMaine (Ms. Pingree).\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me \nthis time and for taking up this important issue and helping us to \nbetter understand the importance of it.\n  In my opinion, we shouldn't even be here today debating a repeal of \nthis important consumer protection law. I don't know if this bill is a \nhuge overreaction to the WTO decision or it is just an excuse to gut \nthese commonsense country of origin labeling requirements.\n  For years, we have required labels on virtually everything imported \ninto the United States. Every piece of clothing you wear has to have a \nlabel showing where it was made. Your smartphone has to have a label \nshowing where it was manufactured. Even umbrellas and tablecloths have \nto list their country of origin.\n  But for some reason we are here considering a bill that would make it \nimpossible for parents to know whether the chicken they are serving \ntheir family came from the United States or China. Think about that. \nWhat consumer, what parent would tell you they don't care what country \nthe food came from that they are about to serve their children?\n  Let's just talk about the WTO ruling for a minute. First of all, the \nWorld Trade Organization ruling said that the\n\n[[Page H4035]]\n\nlabels for ground beef were acceptable but doesn't even consider any \ncomplaints from Canada or Mexico about chicken. So why are we voting on \na repeal of the labeling requirement for those products?\n  Secondly, the WTO has not even ruled about the extent to which \ncountry of origin labeling affects exports from Canada and Mexico. And \nit can't be much, since Mexico exports more beef into the United States \nthan before this law went into effect.\n  We do not have to give in to the WTO this easily. These kinds of \ndisputes are frequently settled by negotiations with Canada and Mexico, \nnot by giving up and throwing out an entire set of consumer \nprotections.\n  We don't back down this easily, and we shouldn't back down this \neasily.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. PETERSON. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. PINGREE. So maybe the powerful special interests behind this \nrepeal are really using this WTO ruling as an excuse to roll back basic \nright-to-know for American consumers. I don't think we should let them \nget away with it.\n  I doubt there is a single consumer in America who says, ``I want to \nknow less about the food I am eating.'' In fact, the opposite is true.\n  Now more than ever, Americans want to know where their food comes \nfrom, and they want to buy local food when they can. Buying local has \ncreated huge new markets for American farmers, great economic growth in \nStates like mine, like Maine.\n  If this bill passes, it will be harder to know if the pork chop or \nhamburger you are buying came from around the corner or around the \nworld.\n  Country of origin labeling is good for consumers; it is good for our \nfarmers and ranchers. Please don't gut these commonsense requirements.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify. We do not import \nchicken from China, period. And the economic impact estimated for the \nState of Maine will be something on the order of $74 million every \nsingle year in imports that won't happen.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Rouzer), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign \nAgriculture.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Livestock and Foreign \nAgriculture Subcommittee, I rise in support of this bill, the Country \nof Origin Labeling Amendments Act of 2015, which repeals the country of \norigin labeling law, also known as COOL.\n  After numerous failed attempts to make COOL compliant with the World \nTrade Organization, it has become apparent that full repeal of COOL is \nunquestionably the right thing to do.\n  That said, I am sure there are some who are concerned that repeal of \nCOOL may compromise food safety. America had the safest, most trusted \nfood supply in the world before COOL and, let me assure you, we will \ncontinue to have the safest food supply after this law is repealed.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Let me explain why. Regardless of origin, if an animal is imported as \na live animal, it is harvested in USDA-inspected facilities. \nAdditionally, cattle, hogs, and poultry are inspected prior to \nharvesting as live animals and throughout processing as a meat product.\n  If the animal originates and is harvested in a different country, the \nplant has to have equivalent U.S. safety inspection standards and must \nbe regularly audited by the USDA. The U.S. only imports meat products \nfrom countries that meet our standards. Furthermore, a foreign plant \nthat does not fully comply with our standards is not permitted to ship \nmeat into this country.\n  In short, the fundamental protocols ensuring food safety are apart \nand separate from country of origin labeling. Suppliers in foreign \ncountries will still be expected to comply with the same inspection \nstandards as they have now.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Chairman Conaway, subcommittee \nRanking Member Costa, and the committee staff for their tremendous help \nand guidance on this important matter.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend this legislation to my colleagues and \nappreciate their support.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and the former co-chair of \nthe Congressional Chicken Caucus, I rise in support of H.R. 2393, the \nCountry of Origin Labeling Amendments Act of 2015.\n  More importantly, as a Congressman for a heavily rural district, with \nlots of poultry and beef production in middle and southwest Georgia, I \nrise to support ending this failed experiment and repealing this \nharmful government mandate.\n  Since its passage in 2002, the country of origin labeling law has \ncaused severe tension between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. \nCanada and Mexico argue that country of origin labeling has hurt their \nlivestock industries, and they have taken their argument to the World \nTrade Organization, which has ruled in their favor and against the \nUnited States four times. We are now out of appeals.\n  Because of the WTO rulings, Canada and Mexico can now request \nauthorization to retaliate against the United States in order to repair \nthe damages they claim our labeling law has caused to their economies.\n  Therefore, we must act decisively to repeal the current COOL \nregulations on beef, pork, and chicken. If we fail to do so, Canada and \nMexico have made clear that they will retaliate against a range of U.S. \nproducts within a matter of months by imposing onerous tariffs, \nresulting in higher costs and lost market share for U.S. producers up \nto $3.5 billion a year. A hit of that magnitude would be devastating to \nthe U.S. pork, beef, and chicken industries.\n  While some say we need to hold out for arbitration, I believe we need \nto repeal this harmful law and correct the situation ourselves before \nfacing overwhelming retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico.\n  By the way, it should be noted that this bill will not entirely undo \nthe country of origin labeling law, only parts of it.\n  I urge support for H.R. 2393 because it will safely remove \nunnecessary burdens on our beef, pork, and poultry industries; bring us \ninto compliance with our trade obligations; and ensure that we avoid \ndamaging retaliatory tariffs.\n  Please join me in supporting H.R. 2393.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott), the ranking member on the \nCommodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit Subcommittee.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's make no mistake about it. I will just tell you \nthis retaliation situation is real from Canada and from Mexico.\n  The question is: Why should we here put our agriculture foundation at \nsuch a tremendous risk? Canada and Mexico are right now moving to \ninstitute retaliatory tariffs against U.S. exports.\n  It is critical that Congress also take this corrective legislation \nand act on it right away before the August recess--it is just that \nimportant--so we can send a powerful, quick message because Canada has \nalready issued a preliminary retaliation list, targeting our \ncommodities and our manufactured products not just in one State, not \njust in two States, but in every State in the United States of America, \ntotaling over $3.5 billion in the first year alone. My own State of \nGeorgia will have an impact of losing $180 million.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's deal with this right. This country of origin \nlabeling is not about food safety. Let's not scare the American people \ninto thinking that; we don't need to make the American people confused \nor feel that we are doing something to make the food unsafe.\n  What we are doing is protecting our American economy. We are \nprotecting our agricultural interests. More than anything else, at a \ntime when America needs it the most, we are standing up for America for \na change. Protect our farmers. Protect our agricultural economy. \nProtect our people.\n  Make sure we pass H.R. 2393. Send a powerful message that we are not \ngoing to stand for Mexico and Canada putting their tariffs on us. We \nare going to stand firm and protect American interests.\n\n[[Page H4036]]\n\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. \nPeterson) for yielding and for all of his work on this issue. He has \nbeen great at trying to mitigate the problems.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise as a strong supporter of the idea of country of \norigin labeling, and I think it is a good idea.\n  I refute what some have said, that there is no benefit to this. There \nis great benefit to this. Area of origin labeling allows people to get \nto know from where their food comes, and that is, I think, incredibly \nimportant.\n  I don't think that repeal is the number one preference here. I don't \nthink that is what we should be doing; we should be fixing the problem, \nbut, because the majority hasn't been willing to work to fix the \nproblem, we are in a real catch-22.\n  I rise today in support of this bill because, if it is not repealed, \nwe are going to face tremendous retaliatory acts from both Mexico and \nCanada, and these are going to be of great fiscal impact to our \neconomy.\n  My home State of California, for instance, it is estimated that we \nwill be hit by $1.8 billion worth of retaliatory action. A good part of \nthat comes from my home industry, the wine community; they will be hit \nheavily. We know what happens. We have seen this movie before, and the \nend is not good.\n  When Congress put in place the trucking program to deal with the \nMexican trucking problems, we were sued. The wine industry was hit with \nretaliatory actions, and we saw a 25 percent reduction in our business. \nThat was financially devastating not only to California, but this is an \nindustry that puts $160 billion a year into the national economy. This \nhurt us all. That was bad enough, but it took us 3 years to get back \nthat market share that we had lost.\n  It is important that we repeal this and then get on to fixing it \nright away. I ask that we vote in favor of this bill today.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), who has worked really hard on this \nparticular piece of legislation.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the chairman for yielding and for leading \non this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just would remark that wine has informed the meat \ndebate several times here today, and I am glad of that.\n  I rise in support of this legislation to repeal these components of \ncountry of origin labeling. I have long held the position that this is \na North American market. We don't treat our best trading partners as \nwell as we should, Mr. Speaker, and that includes Mexico, and it \nespecially includes Canada.\n  I often have to go through the list of things we have done that turn \nout to be something that looks like trade protection at least to them. \nWe have done it with steel. We have done it with softwood timber. We \nhave done it when we have BSE circumstances with beef, which did \noriginate in Canada, spilled over to the United States, and they opened \nup their foreign trade before we did.\n\n  This is one of these examples of what happens when you go a little \noverboard in an effort to try to establish some trade protectionism. \nThis was driven by the people, especially in the Northwest, that \nthought that they would get an advantage on their cattle industry in \nthat part of the country.\n  Now, we are looking at these sanctions which, by my numbers, likely \ngo to somewhere in the area of $3.15 billion in sanctions between \nCanada and Mexico. Mr. Speaker, 85 percent of our consumers don't even \nlook at the label to see where that comes from.\n  Consumers still have a choice. There is nothing that would prohibit \nin the aftermath of this legislation. The consumer is saying: I would \nlike to know if this pig was born in Canada and fed in the United \nStates.\n  To give you an example of how this is, there is a lot of U.S. capital \nthat is invested also, especially in farrowing operations in Canada. \nWhen the exchange rate was even more advantageous than it is today, a \nlot of U.S. dollars went into Canada to establish farrowing operations \nto raise pigs up there because they could isolate in order to do \ndisease prevention and because it was a good investment; then those \nisowean pigs came down to the United States.\n  The numbers that I had was 6 million pigs coming down; 4 million of \nthem came to Iowa. A third of the pork raised in the United States is \nfrom my State, and they are at a disadvantage because of this country \nof origin labeling. It penalizes, Mr. Speaker, the very people we are \ntrying to help.\n  I urge the adoption of this bill.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Cuellar).\n  Mr. CUELLAR. I thank the ranking member for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 2393, the Country of \nOrigin Labeling Amendments Act.\n  As it has been discussed in this debate, the WTO has made its fourth \nand final ruling against the United States. Farmers and ranchers in my \ndistrict in Texas will be hit with tariffs if we don't act right away. \nCOOL has already put a burden on the beef, chicken, and pork producers \nin the State of Texas.\n  For example, Texas cattlemen are required to spend another $35 to $45 \nper animal just to comply with complex cattle identification \nrequirements mandated by COOL. This cost will only get worse if \nretaliatory tariffs are implemented on our exports, tariffs which are \ncompletely legal under the World Trade Organization agreement that we \nhave.\n  For example, I have spoken to my friends on the other side of the \nriver, on the Mexican side, and they said that the American products \nthat will be hit by tariffs include beef, wine, corn, corn syrup, \nfurniture, dairy products, machinery, and a range of fruits and \nvegetables. That doesn't even include the tariffs that the Canadians \nwill put, which probably includes jewelry, bread, beef, tomato \nproducts, and other goods.\n  Again, we cannot afford these tariffs, and we should pass the \namendments to this COOL bill that we have to remove the threat of those \ntariffs completely.\n  In Texas, we raise beef, chicken, and pork that is ``made in the \nU.S.'' We only ask that this be voluntary labeling. We should act \nquickly to avoid those tariffs, so we don't punish those farmers and \nranchers in the State of Texas.\n  I thank the ranking member and the chairman for all the good work \nthey have done.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is left \non each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 16 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Minnesota has 16 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Chairman Conaway for his \nleadership in bringing the repeal of the COOL amendments to the House \nfloor so quickly.\n  I would like to thank my fellow Ag Committee colleagues for their \nbipartisan support in passing the repeal of the COOL amendments out of \nthe committee.\n  The COOL amendments, or country or origin labeling, has nothing to do \nwith food safety. It is a mandatory marketing program. The USDA stamp \nof inspection ensures consumers the meat we eat is safe and wholesome, \nnot COOL.\n  Mr. Speaker, here are the facts. The U.S. has lost its last three \nappeals in the WTO to Canada and Mexico regarding COOL. Both countries \nare ready to retaliate against us, as we have heard, to the tune of \nbillions of dollars, thus hurting our ag sector and American jobs.\n  Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack has said that only a legislative \nfix of COOL would bring the U.S. back into compliance.\n  Again, I thank and congratulate Chairman Conaway and urge all of my \nfellow colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill.\n  Let me first point out the irony that we are considering this bill in \nwhat\n\n[[Page H4037]]\n\ncould be a matter of days before we will vote on the administration's \nrequest for trade promotion authority.\n  Last month, President Obama said in his speech at Nike: ``Critics \nwarn that parts of this deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, would \nundermine American regulation--food safety, worker safety, even \nfinancial regulations. They're making this stuff up. This is not true. \nNo trade agreement is going to force us to change our laws.''\n  Country of origin labeling was passed by the Senate, passed by the \nHouse. It is the law of the land. Yet today, the House of \nRepresentatives is getting ready to repeal country of origin labeling. \nWhy? Because the World Trade Organization ruled against it, a trade \nagreement ruled against it.\n  Contrary to what the President has said, trade agreements have a \ndirect effect on our sovereignty. They have the ability to uproot \ndomestic laws here in the United States. Members and the public need to \nknow what we are opening ourselves up to when we sign these trade \nagreements. Literally no area of United States law is safe: food \nsafety, drug safety, consumer protection, environmental protection, \nhealth care, label rights, Dodd-Frank, even the minimum wage.\n  In fact, today's trade agreements, including the TPP, go further than \nthe WTO rules. They allow challenges to U.S. laws not only by \ngovernments, but also by foreign and domestic multinational \ncorporations who can circumvent U.S. courts and seek a remedy in an \nindependent tribunal.\n  Today, the casualty is country of origin labeling. I was conferree on \nthe farm bill in 2008 with my colleague Ranking Member Peterson. I \nhelped to work to author the language that expanded the country of \norigin labeling. I have worked on this issue for many years as a member \nand a former chair of the Agriculture Appropriations Committee. I am \nproud of that record.\n  People deserve to know where their food comes from. American farmers \nand ranchers deserve the opportunity to distinguish their products. It \nis an economic truism that complete and accurate information is one of \nthe cornerstones of a free market. More than a decade of polling data \nproves that American consumers consistently and overwhelmingly want \ncountry of origin labeling, and frequently by majorities of more than \n90 percent.\n  The World Trade Organization itself has repeatedly ruled provision of \ninformation to consumers to be a legitimate goal for domestic \nregulations. In light of that ruling, I agree that we should seek to \nprotect American exporters by avoiding retaliatory sanctions, but that \nhas not yet become necessary. It has been less than a week since Canada \nand Mexico filed their retaliatory tariff requests. The WTO Dispute \nSettlement Body will not consider it for another week.\n  We do not know whether retaliation will be approved. Canada and \nMexico have asked for $3 billion, but they must prove that they have \nbeen harmed, and that could be difficult.\n  A study by Dr. Robert Taylor of Auburn University found that in the \ncase of Canada, COOL had no significant negative impact on either \nimports of cattle or the price of imported cattle relative to domestic \ncattle. Instead, Dr. Taylor concluded the decrease in exports was \nlikely the result of the global recession and a weak recovery. Even if \nharm is found and retaliation is approved, it will probably not go into \neffect for several months.\n  There is plenty of time to look for a reasonable resolution, as we \nhave done previously. More than 60 other countries have mandatory \nlabeling requirements. So it seems there is a scope to find an \nacceptable way forward without compromising U.S. sovereignty. It is \nmuch too early for outright appeal, but that is what this bill does. \nIndeed, it is unprecedented for Congress to intervene so early in the \nWTO process.\n  Moreover, this bill goes well beyond the scope of the WTO ruling. It \nwould repeal country of origin labeling on chicken, which is not \naddressed in the ruling, and on ground beef and ground pork, which the \ntribunal explicitly found compliant.\n  Why are we rushing to judgment on this issue? I am forced to conclude \nthat this bill is, in fact, a veiled attempt by the meatpacking \nindustry to deny consumers their right to know where their meat and \npoultry is coming from. Is it coming from China? Is it coming from \nAustralia? Is it coming from New Zealand? Where is it coming from?\n  Earlier this week, a broad coalition of 283 agricultural \norganizations wrote to Chairman Conaway and to Ranking Member Peterson \nurging them to reject the repeal of country of origin labeling. \nFarmers, rural advocates, faith groups, environmentalists, labor \nunions, farmworkers, manufacturers, consumer groups all oppose this \nill-conceived and premature repeal. Why are we not listening to them?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. PETERSON. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. As I mentioned at the outset, the context for this bill \nis a failure of U.S. trade policy. The administration tells us that \ntrade agreements do not alter domestic laws. Clearly, this is false.\n  I admonish my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, beware of the \nroad that you go down today. Beware of a trade agreement that puts \nAmerican sovereignty at risk.\n  I hope that Members will bear that in mind and in that context as we \nvote on this bill today and, in addition to that, when we come to \ndebate the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and grant fast-track \nauthority on that agreement.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  The gentlewoman referenced a letter opposing what we are trying to do \nhere today. As you look through that list of organizations that is \ncited, it is not surprising to find that several have consistently \nadvocated for policies that are intentionally destructive to animal \nagriculture. So it is no wonder that these groups support a policy that \nimposes a heavyhanded financial burden on livestock producers, \nprocessors, and, ultimately, consumers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nBost).\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise \ntoday in support of H.R. 2393, the Country of Origin Labeling \nAmendments Act.\n  In my home State of Illinois, we are a rich agricultural State, and \nwe have a rich agricultural heritage. Illinois is a national leader in \ncorn and soybean, but also beef and pork production. If Congress does \nnot act to address this issue of labeling, products in my State could \nface higher tariffs from Canada and Mexico to the tune of $880 million \nworth of goods.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with American agriculture and support \nthe underlying legislation in order to avoid this harmful measure.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Peterson for yielding \nme this time, and I rise in support of maintaining food labeling for \nthe American people.\n  Polls show 9 out of 10 Americans overwhelmingly support country of \norigin labeling. I certainly look for those labels when I go to the \nstore. It ensures that the public knows the source of their food. What \ncould be more important? In fact, American producers want to share that \ninformation because it is a way to differentiate their products in an \nincreasingly international marketplace.\n  Country of origin labeling is strongly supported by America's farmers \nand ranchers, who are proud of what they produce. Restoring local food \nmarkets, in fact, is a growing trend across the Midwest and the whole \ncountry. Farmers and ranchers know that people are demanding more and \nmore information about their food. Restaurateurs are putting on their \nmenus ``local beef,'' ``local pork,'' and ``local chicken.''\n  COOL allows farmers and ranchers the ability to market their products \nwith pride because the label has integrity. The widespread support for \ncountry of origin labeling is what led to its enactment and \nimplementation in the 2002, 2008, and 2014 Farm Bills. The trend is \nvery clear.\n  Current efforts in Congress to repeal country of origin labeling are \nsimply veiled attempts to gut these laws for meat--for beef, for pork, \nfor chicken, three arenas that are completely controlled by a few \nprocessing companies. It is just like the book that Upton Sinclair \nwrote at the beginning of the 20th\n\n[[Page H4038]]\n\ncentury. We are back to the jungle. We are back to the jungle.\n  Opponents are pressing for less information for consumers, not more. \nThey want to hide the product's origin.\n  H.R. 2393 is a premature attempt to undermine food labeling. They \nargue it is necessary because of the World Trade Organization decision \nthat puts Canada and Mexico at a disadvantage. Well, this bill, as \nsuch, was never even raised in the WTO dispute, and labeling is \nsupported by the WTO. The WTO dispute never addressed chicken. It has \nexplicitly ruled U.S. labeling requirements for pork and beef are \nlegal. And more importantly, Canada's claims of $3 billion in economic \nloss due to COOL are absolutely unfounded. The data is not even \npublicly available, and they are unsubstantiated.\n  The bottom line is the rationale behind this bill is a clear example \nof what is wrong with our trade policy. Congress should not let a few \nmeatpacking companies use trade disputes as an excuse to gut important \nconsumer protections and the rights of farmers in this country. It is \nour duty to protect American consumers, American farmers, and American \nranchers, not the trade interests of any other country. Our people \ndeserve a right to know where their food is produced and where it comes \nfrom.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  The previous speaker made reference to the current animal agriculture \nbusinesses as being associated with those horrible circumstances of the \nUpton Sinclair book. My guess, Mr. Speaker, is they would be vehemently \nopposed to that comment because their practices today do not remotely \nreflect those in Upton Sinclair's book.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar), a \nvalued member of the committee.\n  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.\n  Agriculture is the backbone of many communities in Michigan's Fourth \nCongressional District. With over 10,000 farms and 15,000 farm \noperators, approximately $1.7 billion in products from our area are \nsold across the country and around the world.\n  The law on the books right now that mandates country of origin \nlabeling threatens the success of agricultural exports. It is \nunnecessary. It imposes a heavy burden on our farmers. It puts our \nagricultural exports at risk, and it needs to be repealed.\n  Recently, based on the ruling from the World Trade Organization, it \nis apparent that severe consequences could result and that our trading \npartners and neighbors could penalize American-made products sold in \nthose countries with steep tariffs.\n  Already, Canada has announced that it will put tariffs on beef, pork, \nand cherries if the current labeling law is not repealed. Manufactured \ngoods, including office furniture, would also be subjected to tariffs.\n  H.R. 2393 passed the Agriculture Committee on a bipartisan vote of \n38-6. It is a good bill, and it repeals the current labeling law. It \nwill eliminate the possibility of steep tariffs and let Michigan \nfarmers and manufacturers focus on creating jobs and growing their \nbusinesses without worrying about more regulations or retaliation.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor this bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote \n``yes.''\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Schrader).\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member.\n  COOL was perhaps a worthwhile effort at the time but, unfortunately, \nhas outlived its usefulness and its appropriateness. Country of origin \nlabeling, well intended, has started to cause irreparable harm to \nproducers in the Pacific Northwest. Beef and hog producers are facing \nserious problems trying to work things through the packing plant.\n  We have international trade now; we have a global market. That needs \nto be recognized. It is harming not just Canada and Mexico, but Pacific \nNorthwest producers. That point has to be driven home.\n  We are now facing huge retaliatory tariffs in the Pacific Northwest. \nSome of our premier crops are wine, cherries, apples, cheese, potatoes.\n  COOL may have been well intended, but we lost four times at the WTO. \nWe tried to fix it. We worked on it in the farm bill last go-around \nlast year--couldn't get it done. We are facing these retaliatory \ntariffs right now. Let's repeal it, and let's move on.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIowa (Mr. Blum).\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you and your committee for \nyour hard work on this most important legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support to the passage of H.R. \n2393, the Country of Origin Labeling Amendments Act of 2015.\n  This important legislation repeals country of origin labeling \nrequirements for muscle cuts of beef and pork. Unfortunately, the World \nTrade Organization issued the final judgment of a long-running case \nbrought by Canada, ending all doubt that COOL violates U.S. trade \nobligations.\n  Now, America's two largest export markets, Canada and Mexico, are \nmoving to institute retaliatory duties against U.S. products, including \n$1.3 billion of products from Iowa. Canada has published their list of \nretaliatory targets, including those aforementioned meat cuts, but also \ncorn, fructose, cereals from my district, along with products from \ndistricts all across the United States.\n  Mexico has not yet published their list, but is likely to include \nsome of the same corn-based products and perhaps even include ethanal.\n  It is critically important that COOL requirements be repealed to \ncomply with existing trade obligations as soon as possible. \nImplementations of these tariffs would negatively affect a great deal \nof farmers and processors in my district and across Iowa.\n  I urge the House to pass this legislation today and the Senate to act \nswiftly to avoid these potentially devastating economic consequences.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Nolan).\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, I want to join my \ncolleagues in rising in opposition to this important consumer and \nfarmer protection legislation. Someone said it earlier; knowledge is \npower. When people know where something comes from, it gives them some \nvery clear ideas about what the content of it may be.\n  Furthermore, the legislation, as has been pointed out here, is really \nquite, quite, quite premature. We need to let this process play itself \nout. There may very well need to be a fix here on this whole matter, \nbut right now, it hasn't really been conclusively proven that the \nCanadian and the Mexican claims are valid. There has been some \nsuggestions that perhaps they are not. Of course, this legislation goes \nway beyond the scope of the dispute at hand here.\n  I want to thank my ranking member, Mr. Peterson, and all my other \ncolleagues for standing up in opposition to this legislation. Let's let \nthe process play itself out, and then, when and if it is necessary, we \ncan fix things at that time.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, I don't think anybody on our side wants to have retaliation, \nbut, again, we believe this is premature right at this moment.\n  We don't know how much damages are going to be found, if any. We just \nfeel that repeal is not where we are going to end up and where we \nshould end up. We understand this needs to be fixed, but I think there \nis another way to do it short of repeal.\n  At this point, because of that, I encourage people to vote against \nthe bill. I kind of understand where this is going, but, as it gets \nover to the Senate, we will figure out a way to work through this so \nthat we end up not having any retaliation.\n  We still have a system where people can figure out where their food \nis coming from. It would be ironic, if this repeal would happen to get \nthrough the Senate and signed by the President, you wouldn't be able to \nfind out where your chicken or beef or pork came from, as I said \nearlier, but you will be able to find out where all the other ag \nproducts come from, which I think most consumers would see as kind of \nridiculous.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose the measure, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4039]]\n\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is gratifying to know that no one wants the \nretaliatory measures to be put into place. A ``yes'' vote on this bill \nthat we will take up on the floor here shortly will assure that of \nhappening.\n  Arguments that it is premature fall on deaf ears. Four years of \narguing with the Canadians and the Mexicans in the world court in this \ndeal has left ample time to have come to some sort of conclusion if, in \nfact, there was a deal out there.\n  Quite frankly, if we had won a trade issue as decisively and \nresoundingly as Canada and Mexico did, we wouldn't negotiate either. We \nhave no leverage; we have none to leverage against Mexico and Canada to \nget some sort of a deal that might fix this without the repeal.\n  Frankly, this is not about the merits of country of origin labeling; \nit is not about the merits of people knowing where their food comes \nfrom. We are beyond that point. We lost four straight times.\n  If those merits or those arguments upheld in the court in our trade \nobligation, then it would have prevailed, but it didn't. This isn't \nabout people knowing where their food comes from. This is about \navoiding the retaliatory measures that will be implemented by Canada \nand Mexico.\n  The argument that folks want to know where their food comes from, if \nyou walk up to a normal person on the street and ask them that \nquestion, I am surprised it is not 100 percent of Americans who would \nsay: Yes, I want to know where that food comes from.\n  But, if you follow that person into the grocery store and they go up \nto the meat counter, they buy based on price and quality of the meat \nand what it looks like. They are not looking at the label; 85 percent \nof them couldn't care less.\n  If you go into every single restaurant and you order chicken or beef \nor pork or fish or whatever, you have no clue where that came from. You \ntrust the safety network that we have in place at USDA to make sure \nthat that beef or that chicken, that pork, that whatever, is, in \nfact, safe for you.\n\n  The argument that we are somehow depriving the American people of \ninformation that they desperately need in order to make informed \nconsumer decisions, again, falls on deaf ears.\n  Mexico is not a stranger to retaliatory measures. As my colleague \nfrom California mentioned earlier, they implemented those measures in \n2011 as a result of a trucking case that we also lost in that regard, \nand it took the wine industry 3 years to recoup and get back to where \nthey were when those retaliatory measures went in.\n  If you are not a wine connoisseur, pork rinds were also targeted. We \nhad testimony from an individual from New Mexico that said they lost 15 \npercent of their business as a result of Mexico including pork rinds on \nthe retaliatory measure. Somewhere between pork rinds and wine, you \nhave got some products that are going to be impacted by this.\n  These retaliatory threats that are going to come happen are already \nhaving a chilling effect on commerce between our three countries. If \nyou are a wine distributor in Canada, you are not going to make any \nkind of long-term deals with the United States until you know whether \nor not what the impact is going to be. Commerce right now is being \naffected; hence, time is of the essence to get this behind us and move \nforward.\n  I would also argue that most Members down here would be very quick to \nargue and demand, quite frankly, that our trading partners around the \nworld live up to their obligations, and we demand that. We get on our \nhigh horse, and we thump our chest like crazy, demanding that other \nfolks live up to their agreements. That is what this is.\n  We have lost the appeals every step of the way. We have an agreement \nthat says we will treat our trading partners certain ways. We crafted a \nlaw that broke that deal. We are now being demanded and required to \nlive up to our trade obligations. This is no different than us trying \nto force all the other countries around the world to live up to their \nobligations as well.\n  This is about protecting American exports from these retaliatory \nmeasures that are unnecessary to happen. If consumers want their \nbusiness and want to know where their food comes from, we can certainly \ncraft a voluntary program that allows the market to exploit that \ninformation if, in fact, consumers want that.\n  Nothing that we are doing today will prevent us from creating some \nsort of a voluntary program that would, in fact, give consumers that \ninformation without being in violation of our trade agreements with our \npartners.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, avoid these retaliatory \nmeasures, which are totally unnecessary, if we would, in fact, do the \nwork we are supposed to do.\n  I also want to thank my team that put together the work on this. They \nhave been incredibly diligent. I know the folks on the other side as \nwell have worked hard on this.\n  We have tried to come to a bipartisan agreement; we just couldn't get \nthere, but I want to thank my team for the great work that they have \ndone in getting us to that point.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, consumers deserve greater access to \ninformation about where their meat comes from, which is why I have \nalways believed Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) is a critical tool \nfor American families and ranchers.\n  I join many South Dakotans in being deeply disappointed by the World \nTrade Organization's recent ruling against COOL. While I don't \nnecessarily concur with the WTO's conclusions, I agree with my \ncolleagues that something ought to be done to make COOL workable and \nprevent any damages against our agriculture industry. After all, it is \nessential that South Dakota farmers and ranchers can continue to be \ncompetitive in the export market.\n  The COOL repeal bill that the House is considering today, however, is \npremature. By moving on this legislation just weeks after the WTO \nruling, we do not have the time necessary to explore what other options \nmay be available. We owe it to consumers and producers to thoroughly \nconsider alternatives. For these reasons, I am voting against the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Holding). All time for debate has \nexpired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. PETERSON.

In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to\n\n[[Page H4040]]\n\nthe Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that \nthe national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of \ncertain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons to \nundermine Belarus's democratic processes or institutions that was \ndeclared in Executive Order 13405 of June 16, 2006, is to continue in \neffect beyond June 16, 2015.\n  The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of \nBelarus and other persons to undermine Belarus's democratic processes \nor institutions, to commit human rights abuses related to political \nrepression, and to engage in public corruption continue to pose an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign \npolicy of the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 2685 and that I may \ninclude tabular material on the same.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 303 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2685.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) to preside over \nthe Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2685) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes, with Mr. \nPoe in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Visclosky) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As I rise to present the House Appropriations Committee's \nrecommendation for the fiscal year 2016 Department of Defense \nAppropriations bill, there are nearly 200,000 servicemen and -women \nserving abroad, doing the work of freedom on every continent, and there \nare many more at home who are serving in every one of our States--\nActive, Guard and Reserve--all volunteers. We are grateful to them and \ntheir families.\n  They are certainly not all experts in some of the language and terms \nthat will be part of our vocabulary during this debate over the next 24 \nhours--phrases like ``sequester'' and ``continuing resolution,'' \n``Budget Control Act,'' ``overseas contingency account,'' and the \n``global war on terrorism account''--but they have every expectation \nthat they will have our united, bipartisan support for this bill \nwhether they serve aboard a ship, fly through airspace, or provide \noverwatch on land to support a military mission. This legislation was \ndeveloped after 12 hearings, many briefings, travel to the Middle East \nand Europe, and countless staff hours, with those who serve us, \nmilitary and civilian, very much in mind.\n  This is a product of a very bipartisan and cooperative effort, for \nwhich I thank my good friend, the ranking member, Pete Visclosky. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with him. We are both fortunate to have \ncommittee members who are engaged and committed so much to this \nproduct. We are grateful for the support of Chairman Rogers and Ranking \nMember Lowey.\n  In total, the bill provides just over $578 billion in discretionary \nspending, an increase of $24.4 billion over the fiscal year 2015 \nenacted level. This topline includes $88.4 billion in the global war on \nterrorism funding for war efforts, and it is at the level assumed in \nthe House-Senate budget conference agreement. I would point out that \nour House total is very close to the number President Obama submitted \nin his fiscal year 2016 budget request for national defense. Of course, \nthe base funding recommendation is just over $490 billion, which \nreflects the budget caps enacted in 2011 as part of the Budget Control \nAct, signed by President Obama.\n  To reach our reduced allocation, we reviewed in detail the \nPresident's submission and found areas and programs where reductions \nwere possible without harming military operations, warfighter \nreadiness, or critical modernization efforts. Please be assured we made \nevery dollar count. To do so, we have taken reductions from programs \nthat have been restructured or terminated, subject to contract or \nschedule delays, contain unjustified cost increases or funding \nrequested ahead of need, or because of historical underexecution and \nrescissions of unneeded funds.\n  Of course, our bill keeps faith with our troops and their families by \nincluding a 2.3 percent pay increase, a full percentage above the \nPresident's own request. It also provides general funding to their \nbenefits and critical defense health programs. In another key area, \nthis package contains robust funding to counter serious worldwide cyber \nthreats--now an everyday occurrence.\n  But I think we would all agree that the world is a much more \ndangerous, unstable, and unpredictable place than it was in 2011 when \nthe Budget Control Act was signed into law by President Obama. The \nbudget caps developed back then could never have envisioned the \nemerging and evolving threats that we are seeing today in the Middle \nEast, North Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere.\n  So, to respond to current and future threats and to meet our \nconstitutional responsibilities to provide for the common defense, we \ndeveloped, in a bipartisan way, a bill that adheres to the current law \nand provides additional resources to end catastrophic cuts to military \nprograms and people. These additional resources are included in title \nIX, the global war on terrorism account. That account has been \ncarefully vetted to assure its war-related uses.\n  Our subcommittee scrubbed the President's base budget for this year \nand past budget requests, and it has identified those systems and \nprograms that are absolutely connected to our ongoing fight against \nthreats presented by ISIL, al Qaeda, al-Nusrah, the Khorasan Group, \nBoko Haram, and other radical terrorist organizations, including the \nIranian Quds Force.\n  We also projected what resources the military and intelligence \ncommunity will need to meet ongoing challenges of nation-state \naggressors like Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and others. Not \nsurprisingly, we have heard objections about the use of title IX to \nboost our topline national security spending in this bill. Frankly, I \ndo not believe there is anyone on either side of the Capitol who \nbelieves this should be our first go-to option. Rather, it is a process \nwe undertake as a last resort to make sure our troops can answer the \ncall amid a worsening threat environment around the world.\n  Again, we have been very careful about what went into this global war \non terrorism account. We resisted the temptation to simply transfer \nlarge portions of the base bill's operations and maintenance accounts \ninto the global war on terrorism account. We painstakingly worked to \nprovide needed resources for the preparation of our forces in the field \nwhenever a crisis may exist or develop in the future, like the current \nunfolding disaster which is Iraq.\n  In a recent Statement of Administration Policy, the White House \nasserted that the global war on terrorism funding--the old OCO account, \nthe overseas contingency account--in their words is a ``funding \nmechanism intended to pay for wars.'' I could not agree more, and that \nis why we enforce that account to provide President Obama with the \nfunding resources he needs to lead us as Commander in Chief. Within \nthat\n\n[[Page H4041]]\n\naccount, I want to highlight two areas of critical importance--ISR and \nreadiness.\n  We believe that a strong intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance--ISR--capability is a critical component of the global \nwar on terror; yet a succession of combatant commanders has testified \nbefore our committee that only a fraction of their ISR requirements is \nbeing met, in essence, leaving them blind to the enemy's activities, \nmovements, and intentions. Accordingly, the global war on terrorism \naccount contains an additional $500 million above the President's 2016 \nrequest to improve our ISR capabilities: the procurement of additional \nISR aircraft and ground stations, the training of ISR pilots and other \npersonnel, and the processing of that type of derived data.\n  Likewise, we share the concern of the Army, Air Force, and Marines \nabout the overall erosion of readiness in the force. So, to begin to \nreinvest in readiness, title IX includes an additional $2.5 billion \nabove the President's request for this purpose to be distributed to all \nof our services and to the Guard and Reserves. I would add that this \nsum must be detailed and justified to Congress 30 days before it is \nspent.\n  Again, this bill is structured to give the President the tools he \nneeds to act. For example, when he finally does develop a long-awaited, \ncomplete, and comprehensive strategy to combat ISIL and other terrorist \ngroups, we have provided in this bill the resources he will need to \nexecute his plans. I think we would all agree that America must lead, \nand this bill enables leadership.\n  Mr. Chairman, I will allow myself a closing thought:\n  The Washington Post recently editorialized on the defense \nauthorization bill: ``There isn't much bipartisan governance left in \nWashington, but if anything fits that description, it's probably the \nannual defense bill.''\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill deserves bipartisan support, and after many \nhours of productive debate, I look forward to a bipartisan vote. Our \ntroops deserve it. Our national security requires it. Our adversaries \nneed to see it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n    \n\n[[Page H4042]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH10JN15.001\n\n\n\n[[Page H4043]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH10JN15.002\n\n\n\n[[Page H4044]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH10JN15.003\n\n\n\n[[Page H4045]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH10JN15.004\n\n\n\n[[Page H4046]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH10JN15.005\n\n\n\n[[Page H4047]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH10JN15.006\n\n\n\n[[Page H4048]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH10JN15.007\n\n\n\n[[Page H4049]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH10JN15.008\n\n\n\n[[Page H4050]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH10JN15.009\n\n\n\n[[Page H4051]]\n\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to my good \nfriend, Chairman Frelinghuysen, and to congratulate him on the \ncollegial and the transparent manner in which he has crafted this \nlegislation.\n  I also want to express my sincere appreciation for the efforts of \nChairman Hal Rogers, Ranking Member Nita Lowey, and of all the members \nof the Defense Subcommittee.\n  This bill, obviously, could not have been written without the \ndedication, long hours, discerning judgment, and thoughtful input of \nour committee staff and personal staffs. I thank them very much.\n  The chairman has fully and fairly described the bill we are \nconsidering today. I believe he has accurately described the very \ndangerous and unpredictable world in which we live. As such, I will \nenter my detailed comments on the bill for the Record. Instead, I want \nto use my time during general debate to discuss the albatross around \nCongress' neck--the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n  Despite near universal disdain and plenty of buyer's remorse from the \n187 current House Members who voted in favor of the Budget Control Act, \nit has proven to be an extremely resilient--yet utterly ineffective--\npiece of law. We have seen short postponements of sequestration. We \nhave seen 2-year alleviations of the budget caps. Yet we find ourselves \nnearly 5 years since its enactment far from the consensus needed to \nrepeal the law. Further, the continued halfhearted attempts to fix the \nBudget Control Act are almost as detrimental to the law, itself, as \nthey add to the Nation's uncertainty.\n  Additionally, it is becoming increasingly difficult to point to any \npositive changes in our fiscal situation as a result. While intended to \nreduce the budget deficit through spending limits and reductions, our \nnational debt has increased by 24.5 percent since the enactment of the \nlegislation, mainly because the committees that are not truly \nconstrained by discretionary spending caps continue to push politically \npopular legislation with little regard for its impact on the Federal \nbudget.\n  For example, in April of this year, Congress passed legislation that \npermanently fixed the longstanding issues with Medicare's payment rates \nfor physician services. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \nthis fix will result in a $141 billion increase in Federal budget \ndeficits over the next 10 years; yet the measure sailed through both \nHouses of Congress with very little opposition, and it was greeted by a \ncheerful signing statement at the White House. After 17 temporary \nmeasures, it is clear that a permanent doctor fix was long overdue. \nHowever, I believe it illustrates my larger point that we are nowhere \nclose to having a sincere conversation about our deficits while \nnondiscretionary spending and a lack of revenue continue to, largely, \nget a free pass.\n  Until the President and Congress stop whistling past the graveyard \nand confront the continued growth and mandatory spending, while \nsimultaneously increasing revenues, our committee--the Appropriations \nCommittee--has no choice but to carry out the implausible mandate \ncontained in the Budget Control Act and try to control deficits with \njurisdiction over only 34 percent of one half of the Federal Ledger.\n  It does not help, I fear, that a majority of our colleagues have no \nidea when the fiscal year starts except that that is when you shut the \ngovernment down. I despair that most think continuing resolutions are \nthe norm and that sequestration is not all that bad, and that there is \nsome delight every time a civilian Federal employee is furloughed. To \nme, all are symptoms of failure.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  The time we have caused people to waste by not finishing Congress' \nwork on time, enacting innumerable continuing resolutions, and \nvacillating from one top line to another is deplorable. Whether it is a \nFederal agency, a State, other political subdivisions, a nonprofit \norganization, contractors, or an allied nation all have been less \nefficient in recent years because of the constant uncertainty \nsurrounding the Federal Government's finances.\n  To illustrate, in nearly every fiscal year since the Budget Control \nAct's enactment, there have been attempts to alter the caps on defense \nand nondefense spending. Two years ago, the House and Senate had \nallocations that were $91 billion apart, yet the suballocation for \ndefense was only about $4 billion as far as a difference. Both were in \nexcess of the caps. Needless to say, we ended up at a point somewhere \nbetween the two, but only after we wasted an incredible amount of time, \nand shut down the Federal Government.\n  While not a mirror image of 2 years ago, the fiscal year 2016 process \nis careening toward a similar fate. This fiscal year, the President got \nthe process started by submitting a budget request that did not comply \nwith the limitations mandated by the Budget Control Act across all \nbudgeted fiscal years. The majority party's response to the President \nwas to pass a budget resolution that purports to abide by the caps for \nfiscal year 2016 for defense and nondefense discretionary spending, yet \nevades the defense cap by proposing $38 billion above the President's \nbudget request for overseas contingency operations--for purposes of \nthis act, the global war on terror. Despite the objections of the \nSecretary of Defense, this additional funding was further entrenched by \nthe recently passed fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  There is no question that Presidents Bush and Obama, the Department \nof Defense, and Congress have been complicit since 2001 in using \nemergency war funding to resource enduring requirements for the \nmilitary. For the past few years, despite the constraints of the Budget \nControl Act, the Defense Subcommittee, led by my good friend Chairman \nFrelinghuysen, has begun to make strides in limiting what is an \neligible expense for OCO and shift activities to the base budget; and \nhe is doing exactly the right thing. This was done because it is \nincreasingly difficult, after 14 years, to argue that this operational \ntempo for our military is a contingency and not the new normal in \ndefending our great Nation and our interests.\n  Needless to say, I find the increased reliance on contingency funding \nvery troubling--and not because I object to providing additional funds \nfor the Department of Defense. I agree with the Department, and I agree \nwith the chairman that sticking to the caps for defense spending would \nnecessitate our forces assuming unreasonable risk in carrying out our \nnational defense strategy.\n  But at the same time, Mr. Chairman, we need a strong nation as well \nas a strong defense. We cannot continue to let our country deteriorate, \nwith interstate bridges that collapse and kill our citizens, meaningful \nscientific research that atrophies, and a population whose educational \nattainment falls further and further behind.\n  Looking ahead, only the most Pollyannaish among us fails to see that \nwe will be in the throes of another crisis in December. Our time, our \nstaff's time, Congress' time, the country's time should not be wasted \nany longer. The President of the United States and the leaders of both \nparties of both Houses ought to start meaningful negotiations now so \nthat they can conclude before October 1 to allow this great committee, \nthe Committee on Appropriations, to again do the business of the \ncountry in an orderly, thoughtful, and timely fashion.\n  I stress, this is not an issue of process. Congress should not be \nsearching for ways to alter the process in order to avoid making hard \ndecisions on an annual basis. This is a matter of will, and we need to \nuse the power of the purse to its fullest.\n  I expressed a number of concerns, but I would close, relative to the \nlegislation before us, given the constraints that this committee faces, \nby observing that Chairman Frelinghuysen and the subcommittee have done \nan exceptional job in putting this bill together. In particular, the \nchairman has been meticulous with the $37.5 billion added to title IX \nof this bill. He has avoided the easy path. Rather, he has \npainstakingly worked to provide the needed resources for the \npreparation of our forces in the field. Further, the chair was very \nthoughtful in his construction of the base portion of the bill, and\n\n[[Page H4052]]\n\nI believe it and the report provide the stability needed for our \nmilitary personnel--as the chairman emphasized, its readiness--and it \npreserves our industrial base.\n  I close by indicating I look forward to the debates on the \namendments.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of the full committee.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this Defense Appropriations bill.\n  The demands on our military are high. We are confronted with \nescalating Russian and Chinese aggression, threats from ISIL and other \nIslamic terrorist groups, burgeoning nuclear programs in countries like \nNorth Korea, and ongoing war in Syria, Yemen, Libya, and other places. \nWe just don't know what may sprout up next.\n  But in the face of this uncertainty, we can ensure that our military \nforces are ready and able to meet whatever challenges may arise. We can \nmake very sure that our troops and commanders have the tools and \nsupport that they need to protect this great Nation and our way of \nlife.\n  To this end, the bill provides $578.6 billion in discretionary \nfunding. That is $24.4 billion above last year's level and includes \n$88.4 billion to ensure that we can meet the needs of our military as \nthey fight the global war on terrorism.\n  This level of funding complies with the caps set by the Budget \nControl Act, as well as the House-passed Defense Authorization bill. \nWithin this total, the bill prioritizes military readiness, providing \n$219 billion for operation and maintenance programs that keep our \ntroops trained and prepared to respond quickly and decisively.\n  The bill also provides priority funding to ensure that our Armed \nForces are supplied with the equipment and the weapons that they need \nto conduct successful military operations.\n  Mr. Chairman, our military is the best in the world, and this bill \nensures that it stays that way. We invest $67.9 billion in research and \ndevelopment that will keep us on the cutting edge of defense technology \nand enable us to meet a wide range of future threats to our security.\n  But our military is nothing without the brave men and women in \nuniform who sacrifice so much in their service to this Nation. We must \nkeep morale high and provide for the health and well-being of our \nwarfighters and their families. So the bill includes a 2.3 percent pay \nraise for our troops. That is more than the President requested.\n  The bill contains $31.7 billion for the Defense Health Program to \nmeet all estimated needs this year. This funding includes important \nincreases above the President's request for things like cancer \nresearch, traumatic brain injury and psychological health research, and \nsuicide prevention outreach.\n  I am proud, Mr. Chairman, that this appropriations bill accomplishes \nall of this but also takes important steps to streamline spending at \nthe Pentagon, ensuring that no dollar goes to waste and that we live \nwithin our means.\n  I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and his subcommittee staff and \nmembers and his very trusted ranking member for their good bipartisan \nteamwork on this bill. The chairman and ranking member demonstrated \nironclad commitment to our troops and to the security of this Nation \nwith this bill. I would also like to acknowledge the hard-working \nstaff, Mr. Chairman. They spent many, many hours preparing this bill \nfor consideration by us today.\n  Mr. Chairman, above all else--above all else--we must provide for the \nnational defense of the United States. Nothing can exist--not our \ndomestic government, not our private enterprise, not our freedoms--\nwithout ensuring that that basic need is met.\n  Our national security is far too important to fall victim to \npolitical games. We can't risk having an underfunded military during \nthese uncertain times, and our troops deserve unfailing, unanimous \nsupport as they lay their lives on the line. No political games on this \nbill, Mr. Chairman. This is for real.\n  I urge Members to support this bill. These are bipartisan priorities \naddressed in a bipartisan way, and I want to see that our colleagues \nsend a strong message to our military showing our support and our \nwillingness to sacrifice for them. I urge support of this bill on this \nfloor.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of the full committee.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen, \nRanking Member Visclosky, and Chairman Rogers for their efforts. I \nparticularly want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member \nVisclosky for working in such a cooperative manner.\n  However, the two parties remain very far apart in their approach to \nthe appropriations process. Our differences were plainly evident during \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution. Not one of my \nDemocratic colleagues supported the majority's budget because it \nmaintained sequestration levels. As the President said: the majority \nhas returned our economy to the same top-down economics that has failed \nus before and slashes investments in the middle class that we need to \ngrow the economy.\n  During debate on the previous five appropriations bills, my majority \ncolleagues argued strenuously that allocations at the sequester level \nwere nonnegotiable. They argued our committee was hamstrung by the \nBudget Control Act and that we were powerless to renegotiate another \nsequester relief package, as had been done under the Murray-Ryan \nagreement 2 years ago. At the same time, others on our committee told \nthe press that ``pressure would build'' to address sequestration or \npass a continuing resolution because sequester-level bills cannot be \nenacted.\n  The Defense bill before us appears to be operating under a different \nset of rules, with funding over the magical sequester level, a level we \nwere told was the law of the land. It was not cut below the President's \nrequest, as were all the other nondefense bills. By using $38 billion \nin overseas contingency operations funding to plug the hole created by \nthe budget caps, this bill fully funds defense programs and avoids the \ninadequacies facing the other bills.\n  Let me be very, very clear. I am not making a case that the Defense \nbill is too high or advocating that it should be reduced. We live in a \nvery dangerous world. We need to attend to our defense, but we should \ndo so in a responsible fashion.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Our military leaders have discouraged the use of the overseas \ncontingency operations/global war on terror budget to fund regular \ndefense costs. They contend that doing so undermines the Defense \nDepartment's ability to plan over the long term. Funding $38 billion of \nthe Pentagon's regular base budget activities with war funds creates \nfuture-year budget caps that would be difficult to fill.\n  This practice irresponsibly addresses only one of the budget \nimperatives, creating clear losers in most of the other appropriation \nbills.\n  If this bill were to move forward as is, I fear my majority \ncolleagues would mentally move on; the urgency facing the entire \nappropriations process would fade because we have ``taken care of'' our \nnational security needs.\n  That, my friends, is a dangerous strategy, especially given that we \nknow none of these bills are likely to be signed into law by the \nPresident as they are currently written.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The time of the \ngentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I yield the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. We can deal with that fact now or deal with it again over \nthe holidays, but we are going to have to deal with it.\n  Members of the armed services and their families live in every one of \nour communities. They drive on crowded highways and over crumbling \nbridges. Most of them send their kids to public schools.\n  These families expect the meat and products they buy to be safe and \nthe airplanes in which they fly to be protected. If they should ever \nget sick, they need to have the biomedical research in place so that \nsafe and effective treatments are available to them.\n\n[[Page H4053]]\n\n  These are reasonable expectations. What is not reasonable is to put \nforward several annual spending bills that mindlessly cut these \npriorities simply because we can't agree on a reasonable budget.\n  National security and economic strength are inextricably linked. \nLet's get back to the table and set realistic spending caps to provide \nwhat is needed both for our national security and to create jobs, \nimprove infrastructure, fund biomedical research, and grow the economy.\n  Let's get together. Let's vote ``no'' on this bill and move on.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains on each side?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 15\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Indiana has 14\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crenshaw), a member of the Defense \nAppropriations Committee and a member of my subcommittee.\n  Mr. CRENSHAW. I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for yielding.\n  I want to say a special word of thanks to Chairman Frelinghuysen and \nRanking Member Visclosky for the hard work they have put into bringing \nthe bill before us today. I think, arguably, this is the most important \nissue we face every year.\n  Last year, I pointed out the fact that I think the number one \nresponsibility of the Federal Government is to protect American lives, \nand we work to do that every day. We talked about the fact that the \nbest way to keep America safe is to keep America strong. I think that, \nif you look back, here we are a year later, and not much has changed.\n  National security is still a critical element of what we do here. \nBack home in northeast Florida, the constituents that I represent are \ngreatly concerned about national security. They are greatly concerned \nabout the men and women in uniform and greatly concerned that they will \nhave the necessary resources to accomplish their mission successfully \nand return home safely.\n  They are also concerned that we don't get caught up in the politics \nof the moment and lose sight of the fact that we have a constitutional \nresponsibility to provide for the common defense.\n  I just want to say in closing, Mr. Chairman, that, when we look at \nthe ever-increasing dangerous world that we live in, I think we have to \nmeet these challenges head on.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that most of everything that we have \naccomplished as a great nation, we have accomplished with the \nfoundation built on national security. This bill moves us forward down \nthat path.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a member of the subcommittee.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to this \nbill.\n  Please allow me to acknowledge the tremendous work of Chairman \nFrelinghuysen, Ranking Member Visclosky, and the Appropriations staff \nin moving this Defense bill forward.\n  This bill deserves better treatment by the leadership of this House \nthan to have it cloaked in unfinished budget wrangling that could force \nfuture changes harmful to the defense of our Nation.\n  The bill before us funds key priorities, such as assuring the \nstrongest, most agile and resilient military on Earth; securing base \nand operational independence through energy innovation; improving \ndefense health for the lives of our military and civilian forces; \nadvancing cutting-edge research at our defense labs to improve \nefficiency on the battlefield and drive technology transfer to the \nprivate sector to grow our economy; and maintaining and upgrading \nessential defense facilities across our Nation and globe.\n  Moving forward, our Nation must still address lingering veteran \nunemployment of over half a million Americans, according to the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics. A majority are 45 years of age or older, but over \n200,000 are between the ages of 18 and 44.\n  The capabilities of our National Guard can be leveraged to address \nthis imperative, engaging their talents to meet domestic needs.\n  Globally, too, as leader of the free world, the United States holds a \nspecial responsibility to uphold commitments made in the Budapest \nMemorandum to Ukraine and our allies in Central Europe. This was \nrecently reaffirmed by President Obama and German Chancellor Merkel at \nthe G7 summit.\n  A threat to liberty anywhere is a threat to liberty everywhere. \nRussia's invasion of Ukraine cannot be tolerated. Tough sanctions on \nRussia and enforcement of the Ukraine Freedom Support Act lay the base \nfor liberty's advance.\n  Those Members who in good conscience ultimately will vote ``no'' on \nthis measure will do so to fight for a responsible budget plan that not \nonly meets the needs of our men and women in unform, but builds up the \nNation and citizenry they are fighting to protect.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Palazzo), a member of the Appropriation Committee, for \nthe purpose of a colloquy.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Chairman Frelinghuysen, I would like to thank you and \nyour staff for all your hard work in crafting this Defense \nAppropriations bill.\n  As a marine veteran, a current member of the Mississippi National \nGuard, and a former member of the House Armed Services Committee, I \nfully understand the importance of this legislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, as you well know, the United States Navy and Marine \nCorps are the Nation's forward-deployed, fast-response force in times \nof crisis. The ability to respond to all types of conflict, as well as \nhumanitarian assistance and disaster relief, is what separates the \nUnited States Navy and the Marine Corps team from the rest of the \nworld.\n  However, as a result of declining resources, the Navy has struggled \nto reach its own stated goal of 306 ships. A not-insignificant portion \nof this fleet consists of amphibious ships to support the requirements \nof the Marine Corps.\n  The current number of amphibious ships in the fleet does not meet \nvalidated national requirements to accomplish the tasks the Marine \nCorps is responsible to carry out in time of war or national emergency; \nthis is the very Marine Corps that is tasked to be the most ready when \nour Nation is the least ready.\n  I know this issue also concerns you, and I request your thoughts on \nhow we might get our Navy shipbuilding program back on track.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I thank the gentleman for his remarks and concerns \nand for his own military service. I share his concern.\n  The gentleman is correct. The Navy has been struggling to maintain \nits shipbuilding program for many years. Despite a requirement for 306 \nships, the Navy's fleet has seemed to reach a plateau of about 285 \nships for the last several years.\n  It is our responsibility to work with you and the Navy to ensure that \nour sailors and marines have the finest ships and equipment this Nation \ncan provide.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working closely with you \non this important issue. I can tell you I know where the finest \nwarships are built by the finest craftsmen, that is right there in \nMississippi's Fourth Congressional District.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with you on this important \nissue.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I thank the gentleman for his passion and his \nremarks.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota \n(Ms. McCollum), a member of the subcommittee.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, for more than a decade, this House has been \ncommitted to providing our troops with the body armor they need. Body \narmor is essential to our deployed troops.\n  In order to provide our troops with modern, lightweight body armor, \nthe Department requires a viable industrial base to produce the body \narmor and to continually work to improve it.\n  The fiscal year 2015 NDAA Defense Appropriations bill sustaining the \nindustrial base was prioritized; $80 million was appropriated to the \nArmy to\n\n[[Page H4054]]\n\nspecifically sustain the industrial base for body armor.\n  Those FY15 funds have not been obligated, and as a result, the \nindustrial base for body armor is laying off workers and about to go \nout of business. The Army has ignored Congress' directions and put this \nindustry at risk.\n  The FY16 Defense Appropriations report makes a commitment to body \narmor, saying:\n\n       The committee encourages the Secretary of the Army to \n     ensure that the body armor industrial base is able to \n     continue to develop and manufacture more advanced body armor.\n\n  Unfortunately, the supplier of boron carbide power to make armor \nplates will be out of business before this bill is enacted. \nFurthermore, this bill provides zero funds for the procurement of body \narmor, another blow to the industrial base.\n  We all share a strong commitment to our troops, fully understanding \nhow important body armor is to soldier protection.\n  To the chairman and ranking member, I would like to work with you to \nensure that the existing body armor industrial base is not driven out \nof business by the Army's inability to follow directions from Congress \nand mismanagement of this vital supply chain.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Barr).\n  Mr. BARR. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  I rise today to echo the concerns expressed by my colleague across \nthe aisle from Minnesota in concern for our Nation's warfighters and \nour military base.\n  As you know, the FY15 NDAA authorized and the FY15 Defense \nAppropriations bill provided $80 million for a body armor industrial \nbase initiative in the Army's operations and maintenance program. \nHowever, the U.S. Army is not properly utilizing the appropriated funds \nin the manner Congress intended.\n  Congress has been clear on this matter. Report language for both the \nFY15 and FY16 Defense Appropriations measure demonstrates that the \nimportance of body armor is critical to protecting our soldiers in \ncombat.\n  Because of the Army's repurposing of these funds at odds with \ncongressional intent and the safety of our troops, the Army and the \nU.S. body armor industry will lose the unique capability critical for \nmeeting high-tech U.S. lightweight body armor standards.\n  After the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we must rehabilitate and \nreplace used body armor to ensure the readiness and the safety of our \ntroops in the field if they are called to serve in another conflict.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mr. BARR. If we do not act now to ensure that the body armor \nindustrial base is able to continue the development and manufacturing \nof more advanced lightweight body armor, there will not be a capable \nbody armor industrial base left in the future to fund.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Thompson) for the purpose of a colloquy.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. I thank Ranking Member Visclosky for \ngiving me the opportunity to discuss something that will assist in our \nnatural disaster response.\n  The Air National Guard employs advanced capabilities to assist in \ncivil search and rescue operations during natural disasters and is \ncapable of locating and rescuing people where civilian authorities \ncannot.\n  The Air National Guard uses sophisticated technology to assist in \ntime-sensitive emergency operations, including the AS-4 Pod, which \nincludes wide-area infrared sensors optimized for survivor detection, \nintegrated communications, and specialized radar for maritime, flood, \nand swift water recovery.\n  Lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina, the California wildfires, and \nSuperstorm Sandy highlight the need to outfit the Air National Guard \nwith this important capability. I hope you will consider adding this \nvital piece of equipment to the list of equipment considered for \npriority purchasing with the use of the National Guard and Reserve \nequipment account, which is governed by this legislation.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I want to thank the gentleman from California for \nbringing this to our attention. We look forward to working with you on \nthis important issue as we move forward with the legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield to the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers) for the purpose of a colloquy. He \nis the chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, for \nhis work to bring this important bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Chair, this legislation includes billions of dollars to programs \nthat are vital to the Nation's security and the men and women who have \nvolunteered to serve our Nation.\n  However, I do have a question regarding a recommended reduction of \n$61 million from the Missile Defense Agency request for the Redesigned \nKill Vehicle.\n  Does the gentleman share my belief that this is a critically \nimportant program, and that it, and the 2020 goal for deployment of \nthis capability, are vital to a robust and reliable national missile \ndefense system, which is paramount to the defense of the Nation against \never more capable adversary ballistic missiles?\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman, and I \nknow the gentleman from Alabama will agree that the oversight of scarce \ndefense dollars is important. The request for this program has spiked \nsignificantly between fiscal years 2015 and 2016. Yet, there is no real \nacquisition plan.\n  The Department owes us this information if we are to be responsible \nstewards of these taxpayer dollars\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. I thank the gentleman for that explanation, \nand I hope he will let me know if there is anything the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces can do to make sure that the Department knows that the \nacquisition strategy needs to be delivered to the Congress without \nfurther delay.\n  Can the gentleman also assure me that the deployment of the Aegis \nAshore site in Poland remains a priority of his and that its deployment \nby not later than December of 2018 will not be affected by any of the \nmarks in the bill before the House today?\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Yes, I absolutely agree with the gentleman from \nAlabama that this deployment is vital to our missile defense, and the \nUnited States should be grateful for strong allies like Poland.\n  Nothing in the bill today will in any way impact the one-time \ndeployment of the European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase III.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. I thank the gentleman. I look forward to \nsupporting the bill today and urge the House to do the same to get this \nvital bill passed and to the President for his support of our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, if I could ask how much time remains for \nboth sides, please.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 8\\3/4\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Indiana has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Lee), a member of the committee.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank our ranking member for yielding, \nand for your tremendous leadership on this subcommittee.\n  I also want to thank the ranking member and our chair for including \nreport language on the Department of Defense's efforts to achieve \nauditability by the end of fiscal 2017.\n  Ensuring that the Pentagon is auditable is common sense, and it is \nsomething that Congress mandated, mind you, 25 years ago. It is long \npast time to address the culture of unlimited spending and zero \naccountability at the Pentagon, and I know this issue has strong \nbipartisan support.\n\n[[Page H4055]]\n\n  Yet, there are many provisions of this bill which I cannot support. \nThe appropriations bill includes an additional $38 billion over budget \ncaps in the overseas contingency operations slush fund, and that is \nwhat it is; it is a slush fund. This is simply outrageous and this \nfund, quite frankly, in my opinion, it should be eliminated.\n  We should have transparency, and the public should know how much it \nis costing to fight these wars.\n  This bill also includes $1.3 billion for DOD operations against the \nIslamic State of Iraq and Levant. Mr. Chair, it has been 10 months \nsince the war started and 4 months since the President submitted his \ndraft authorization to Congress, and Congress has yet to act. Now we \nsee additional troops being sent into this war zone. Again, no \ncongressional debate, no vote.\n  Congress cannot continue to fund a war--and that is what this is--\nwithout a robust debate on an ISIL-specific authorization. That is why \nI offered an amendment in committee, which was adopted on a bipartisan \nbasis, that simply reaffirms that Congress has a constitutional duty to \ndebate and determine whether or not to authorize the use of military \nforce.\n  It is also why I am offering two amendments to this bill that would \nprohibit funding for the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for the use of \nmilitary force. With these authorizations still on the books, Congress \nis allowing this President--and any President really--to wage war \nagainst anyone, at any time, anywhere.\n  I hope we defeat this bill because we have got to stop this policy of \nendless wars.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Rogers), the distinguished chairman of the Strategic \nForces Subcommittee, for the purpose of a colloquy.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. I thank the distinguished gentleman from New \nJersey for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, first I would like to express my support for the fiscal \nyear 2016 Defense Appropriations bill and my appreciation for the hard \nwork of the chairman in drafting this very good bill, which will \nprovide essential funding to our national security.\n  However, I have a serious concern with the proposed reduction of \nfunding in this bill for an existing weather collection satellite \ncalled the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, or DMSP.\n  As early as 2017, our military is facing a critical capability gap in \nthe Department of Defense's two highest priority weather requirements. \nAs the Air Force continues to work through its plan for addressing \nweather requirements, launching DMSP will help address these issues.\n  Much has been spent on DMSP already, and it would be a shame to waste \nthose dollars when the satellite could be put to good use.\n  Mr. Chairman, I agree with you that the Air Force has not properly \nmanaged the space weather program, and they must submit a better plan. \nHowever, I ask for your support in working with me in conference to \nensure that our military and intelligence professionals have the tools \nthey need to safely prosecute our missions.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nBridenstine).\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And congratulations on \nproducing a very good bill that will provide the necessary funding to \nproperly defend our Nation.\n  And let me express my appreciation for providing $26 million in your \nbill to fund an Air Force pilot program for the acquisition of \ncommercial SATCOM services.\n\n  Aligned with the House-passed fiscal year 2016 NDAA, the program has \nthe potential to lower costs and increase utilization of commercial \nsatellites.\n  Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving me the opportunity to discuss \nmilitary satellite communications, or SATCOM. As you are aware, the \ndemand for SATCOM has increased by a factor of 10 since the outset of \nour simultaneous commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it continues \nto grow.\n  Further, the need for protection against jamming, spoofing, and other \ninterference has also increased as our adversaries deploy more \nsophisticated countermeasures to deny and degrade communications to our \nwarfighters.\n  The government-owned, government-operated SATCOM system, Wideband \nGlobal Satellite Communications System, or WGS, cannot keep up with \ndemand--not even close. As a result, the Air Force has sought less \nexpensive, more protected SATCOM solutions from the commercial sector \nto augment national capabilities.\n  Mr. Chairman, the military needs more SATCOM capacity, and it needs \nSATCOM that is better protected. Congress can help by restoring $32.8 \nmillion for development and testing activities associated with the \nProtected Tactical Testbed.\n  We also need additional funding for the Protected Tactical Wave Form \nitself. This effort will help make both commercial and WGS satellites \nmore robust and protected against jamming. Alongside the Air Force's \npilot program I referenced earlier, the Protected Tactical Testbed and \nWave Form may begin to give warfighters access to a global architecture \nof protected commercial SATCOM.\n  That said, I understand the Air Force has programmatic challenges \nwith the Protected Tactical Testbed that must be addressed. However, I \nurge the committee to keep an open mind in conference. If the Air Force \naddresses your concerns, then I hope the committee will consider \nrestoring funding for the Protected Tactical Testbed and Wave Form.\n  I thank you again for this opportunity to speak on such an important \nissue to our military servicemen and -women.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentlemen from \nAlabama and Oklahoma, both veterans, for bringing these matters to our \nattention, and we look forward to working with you on these important \nissues.\n  However, in both instances you both highlight important warfighter \ncapabilities that are stymied by poor program planning and execution by \nthe Air Force. Their lack of programmatic and financial discipline has \nled directly to these weather collection and satellite communications \nissues.\n  Consequently, our appropriations bill highlighted each of these \nconcerns and strongly encouraged the Air Force to make adjustments. \nNone, unfortunately, were made in a timely manner.\n  Based on existing capability, I see no evidence that launching the \nDMSP is part of that plan, but I am willing to work with both gentlemen \nin conference if things change. I thank the gentlemen for their support \nand work.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Hahn) for the purpose of a colloquy.\n  Ms. HAHN. Thank you, Ranking Member Visclosky.\n  I have been working to provide our World War II merchant mariners the \nthanks they deserve. I would prefer to offer an amendment to the \nDefense bill which would have provided a token thank you, but it would \nhave been the subject of a point of order.\n  These brave men suffered the highest losses of any military branch in \nWorld War II and did not receive veterans benefits under the GI Bill.\n  Moving forward, I look forward to working with the ranking member to \ngive our brave merchant mariners the recognition they rightly deserve. \nIt is unfathomable that these merchant mariners who served this Nation \nso valiantly have never had full veterans benefits.\n  They were not eligible for tuition subsidies, home loan guarantees, \nor other provisions of the GI Bill that helps millions of veterans \ntransition seamlessly into civilian life.\n  Time is running out. These merchant mariners are now in their \neighties and nineties, and there are only 5,000 left. Let's act now to \nright this wrong.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. HAHN. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I thank the gentlewoman from California for bringing \nthis to our attention and, particularly, given the fact that my father \nis a Naval veteran and 99 years old. So I understand the circumstances \nof what you speak, and we do look forward to working with you on this \nissue as we move forward with the legislation. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith),\n\n[[Page H4056]]\n\nthe dean of the New Jersey delegation, for the purpose of a colloquy.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my good friend for yielding, and I \nrise to raise an issue of particular importance to my constituents in \nNew Jersey.\n  Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst was created by the 2005 BRAC round. \nAnd while joint basing has been successfully implemented at MDL, there \nremains an outstanding issue of gross unfairness for some employees.\n  The overwhelming majority of employees at the joint base are included \nin the New York pay locality area; yet, the wage grade employees on the \nformer McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix remain in the Philadelphia \nlocality area. These employees work on the same installation, but they \nare paid 7 percent less than their counterparts for the same work.\n  Joint Base MDL made a formal request for realignment of the \nPhiladelphia to New York wage survey area to OPM's Advisory Committee, \nFPRAC, in 2010, and the base leadership continues to believe pay parity \nshould be a priority.\n  Mr. Chairman, the joint base is a critical asset to DOD and our \nNational security. Their missions could not be carried out effectively \nwithout the skills of the men and women stationed there and those \nworking in civilian support roles across the base.\n  Joint Base MDL is one installation, and the men and women who work \nthere are part of the same workforce. It is timed to fix this outdated \npolicy.\n  Accordingly, I am hopeful that you will work with me to bring about \nfairness to the roughly 20 percent of the workforce that does not \nreceive equally earned pay.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I thank my colleague for his leadership and for \nbringing my attention to this important issue. And I can assure him we \nwill look forward to working with him as we move forward with our bill \ninto conference.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my good friend, the chairman, for \nyour commitment to the men and women who support our warfighters. I \nlook forward to working with you to move the pay parity for all joint \nbase employees forward.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) for the purpose of a colloquy.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Thank you, Ranking Member Visclosky.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy.\n  As you are aware, our Nation's Federally Funded Research and \nDevelopment Centers, or FFRDCs, play a critical role in advancing \nnational security goals and ensuring that our Nation stays at the \ncutting edge of technological innovation.\n  Mr. Chair, I wanted to engage in this colloquy to clarify Congress' \nintent in section 802(3)(c), which states:\n  ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the funds \navailable to the Department from any source during fiscal year 2016 may \nbe used by a defense FFRDC through a fee or other payment mechanism for \nconstruction of new buildings.''\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. Chair, I am concerned that some could take an expansive \ninterpretation of this provision and view it as preventing the \nexecution of critical facilities modernization projects, even when \nauthorized by Congress through military construction projects.\n  I am also concerned about the provision's medium-and long-term \nimplications for building maintenance and facility modernization \nprojects that are necessary to continue important innovation programs \nfor decades to come.\n  Chairman Frelinghuysen, is it the committee's understanding that this \nprovision is not intended to apply to military construction projects or \nto advanced planning and design funds that are authorized by Congress?\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. TSONGAS. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Ms. Tsongas, yes, that is my understanding.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Thank you, Mr. Frelinghuysen. I look forward to working \nwith you, and I appreciate that construction.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking \nmember of the Defense Subcommittee. Is that your understanding?\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. That is my understanding as well.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Thank you both, and I look forward to working with you.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, could you give us the time that we \neach have left.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 2\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Indiana has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I rise today to express my support for the \nVets4Warriors program, a program in my district that is operated by \nRutgers University Behavioral Health Care. This successful program has \nprovided invaluable assistance to the military in their efforts to \nprevent suicide among veterans. The program ensures that those veterans \nwho are struggling with depression or psychological concerns get the \nsupport they need: peer-to-peer.\n  Sadly, the Department of Defense has terminated this program without \nany public notice. Our nation is now faced with a crisis: since the \nstart of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than 3,000 active-duty \npersonnel have taken their own lives. Programs like Vets4Warriors help \nus to combat this troubling trend.\n  The Vets4Warriors program is unique and will be difficult to replace. \nIt allows veterans a safe space in which they can find help apart from \nthe DOD structure. Service members are often hesitant to reach out to \ntheir superiors regarding personal concerns like mental health. By \nintegrating these programs into the Department's Military OneSource \nprogram, many service members will lose the sense of confidentiality \nprovided by Vets4Warriors.\n  We must fulfill our responsibility to care for those who put \nthemselves in harm's way to protect our nation. It is my hope that the \nDOD will reconsider their decision so that we can assure our veterans \nhave access to the best mental health resources possible.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  During consideration of the bill for amendment, each amendment shall \nbe debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the \nproponent and an opponent and shall not be subject to amendment. No pro \nforma amendment shall be in order except that the chair and ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective \ndesignees may offer up to 10 pro forma amendments each at any point for \nthe purpose of debate. The Chair of the Committee of the Whole may \naccord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member \noffering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the portion of the \nCongressional Record designated for that purpose. Amendments so printed \nshall be considered read.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2685\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2016, for military functions \n     administered by the Department of Defense and for other \n     purposes, namely:\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n                           MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\n                        Military Personnel, Army\n\n       For pay, allowances, individual clothing, subsistence, \n     interest on deposits, gratuities, permanent change of station \n     travel (including all expenses thereof for organizational \n     movements), and expenses of temporary duty travel between \n     permanent duty stations, for members of the Army on active \n     duty (except members of reserve components provided for \n     elsewhere), cadets, and aviation cadets; for members of the \n     Reserve Officers' Training Corps; and for payments pursuant \n     to section 156 of Public Law 97-377, as amended (42 U.S.C. \n     402 note), and to the Department of Defense Military \n     Retirement Fund, $37,295,571,000.\n\n                        Military Personnel, Navy\n\n       For pay, allowances, individual clothing, subsistence, \n     interest on deposits, gratuities, permanent change of station \n     travel (including all expenses thereof for organizational \n     movements), and expenses of temporary duty travel between \n     permanent duty stations, for members of the Navy on active \n     duty (except members of the Reserve provided for elsewhere), \n     midshipmen, and aviation cadets; for\n\n[[Page H4057]]\n\n     members of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps; and for \n     payments pursuant to section 156 of Public Law 97-377, as \n     amended (42 U.S.C. 402 note), and to the Department of \n     Defense Military Retirement Fund, $26,711,323,000.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 9, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 31, line 7, insert after the dollar amount the \n     following: ``(reduced by $2,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman from Texas and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is to \nencourage the Secretary of Defense to allocate resources needed to \nprovide technical assistance by U.S. military women to military women \nin other countries combating violence as a weapon of war, terrorism, \nhuman trafficking, narcotics trafficking, and their impact on women and \ngirls across the globe.\n  Let me thank the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nDefense for the work they have done in the backdrop of the very \noverwhelming sequester, which I certainly oppose so that all of the \nappropriators will have the ability to provide the resources that they \nneed.\n  In particular, my amendment is recognizing the new face of war and \nthe new fight of terrorism.\n  I hold up these pictures of the numbers of countries who are adding \nwomen to their forces. America, of course, has had women in different \nparts of its military for a number of years, going back to nurses in \nWorld War I and II and in the various types of work that have been done \nrecently in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the women are enormously proud \nand very effective.\n  My amendment simply says that, in this new war on terrorism and human \ntrafficking, we would have the opportunity to use the women in the \nUnited States military who have achieved levels of rank that are \nextremely important to be able to train and to provide technical \nassistance to those who are just adding women to their military.\n  The United States Armed Forces possesses an unparalleled expertise \nand technological capability that will aid not only in combating and \ndefeating terrorists, who hate our country and prey upon innocent \npersons--especially women, girls, and the elderly--but we must also \nrecognize that, notwithstanding our extraordinary technical military \ncapabilities, we face adversaries who adapt very quickly because they \nare not constrained by geographic limitations or norms of morality: the \nCaliphate, ISIL, ISIS, Boko Haram, al Shabaab, al Qaeda, all. We are \nalso finding that these organizations are using women, but then, of \ncourse, the institutionalized militaries are also putting more women \nin.\n  What better interface than that of the United States military and \nwomen, in particular.\n  I have an article that I would like to submit into the Record, \n``Turkey's Women Expand Role in Military.''\n\n                 Turkey's Women Expand Role in Military\n\n       At the 24th International Defence Film Festival in Rome, a \n     documentary by film director Elif Ovar of the Turkish Army's \n     Photo-Film Center was selected for the Jury's Award.\n       Her documentary ``Light of Hope''--about Senay Haydar, \n     Turkey's first female gendarmie commander and senior \n     noncommissioned officer (NCO), against the backdrop of gender \n     discrimination and violence against women in the small \n     Anatolian town of Mesudiye--attracted much interest.\n       Haydar works closely with local officials and families and \n     has been credited for eradicating violence against women \n     among the 40,000 residents of Mesudiye. Thanks to Haydar's \n     actions, there hasn't been a single case of violence against \n     women in the last nine months in Mesudiye.\n       Ovar told Al-Monitor that as a woman she has been much \n     impressed with Haydar's accomplishments in a small Anatolian \n     town where traditional culture prevails. ``NCO Senay's \n     success, as much as this is due to [her own accomplishments], \n     is also the success of the commanders who believed in her,'' \n     Ovar said. ``Appointing a female NCO as a representative of \n     law and order to a town with 40,000 residents is truly a \n     revolution for the Turkish army.''\n       Over the last three years, there have been extensive \n     changes in the personnel policy of the Turkish army with the \n     increase of the number of female officers and NCOs and, as \n     was the case with Haydar, in assigning women to active field \n     positions instead of just to administrative work at the \n     headquarters.\n       In an interview with Al-Monitor Haydar said: ``I always \n     wanted to be a field commander who takes decisions instead of \n     working at a desk. I was encouraged by the Gendarmerie \n     General Command. When the results [of my employment] turned \n     out to be positive, scores of female officers and NCOs \n     followed in my footsteps.'' According to a source at the \n     Gendarmerie School in Beykent, Ankara, in October alone, 67 \n     female NCOs have been assigned to Gendarmerie General Command \n     field posts after they completed their basic training; \n     another 90 female NCOs and 30 officers will follow.\n       Capt. Hulya Ercan, an instructor of the UH-60 Sikorsky \n     helicopter at Ankara's Gendarmerie Aviation School, is the \n     first female gendarmerie pilot in Turkey. In an interview \n     with Al-Monitor she said: ``My husband is a captain. I raised \n     my daughters Bensu and Beren without giving up my profession. \n     I actually flew until the third month of my pregnancy with my \n     youngest. My most memorable moment was one time when my \n     husband was away on a mission and I was ordered to fly an \n     urgent mission. I had to leave my 1\\1/2\\-year-old daughter \n     with the duty officer at the base. When I returned five hours \n     later, I found the duty officer and many soldiers \n     entertaining my daughter. That was memorable and funny.''\n       A source at the Turkish General Staff who works on planning \n     of the personnel policies told Al-Monitor that today there \n     are 1,350 female officers in the Turkish army, which is 3.3% \n     of the total number of officers. The target is to increase \n     this to 5% in the next three years. The Turkish army wants to \n     further increase the number of female NCOs, which today \n     stands at 843 (0.9%). The aim is to also increase this to 5% \n     by 2018, which means the employment of an additional 4,000 \n     female NCOs. To achieve these objectives, the Turkish army \n     has been trying to embrace more female-friendly personnel \n     policies.\n       The Turkish army employs 96 female colonels, 140 female \n     lieutenant colonels and 360 female majors.\n       Colonels generally work at headquarters while majors are \n     usually unit commanders. Staff Maj. Bilgehan Bulbul is the \n     commander of the largest transport fleet of the Air Force \n     Command in Ankara and is also the first female fleet \n     commander. There is a noticeable increase of Turkish female \n     staff officers in important headquarter posts in the army and \n     NATO. For example, naval staff officer Maj. Yasemin \n     Bayraktutan is Turkey's current naval attache in London. \n     Within six-seven years, she may well become the first female \n     admiral of the country. In an email to Al-Monitor, she said \n     she wants to return home after excelling in her current \n     position and before becoming an admiral she wants to command \n     a frigate.\n       What is behind the Turkish army's decision to increase the \n     number of female officers and NCOs?\n       There are two practical reasons and one ideological one.\n       The first practical reason is the relative reduction in the \n     number of personnel called up for compulsory military \n     service, as the Turkish army is moving toward becoming a \n     professional entity--increasing the number of females in the \n     army makes up for this loss in man power.\n       The second practical reason is a need for female personnel \n     because of a change in security issues the Turkish army is \n     dealing with--notably, the shift from rural to urban areas of \n     the Kurdistan Workers Party violence in Turkey's southeast. \n     In addition, there is a need for female personnel in \n     international missions that the Turkish armed forces are \n     undertaking in Afghanistan, Kosovo and Bosnia, among others.\n       To have ranking female officers provides significant \n     advantages in communicating with the local population, \n     especially with women, and carrying out civil-military \n     cooperation projects effectively in the health care and \n     education sectors. Thus, the Turkish army is determined to \n     establish more effective links with local populations in low-\n     intensity conflict areas and peace support missions.\n       The ideological reason for increasing the number of females \n     in the Turkish army is that the latter has always been the \n     leading cause of modernization and Westernization of the \n     republic. The army sees itself as a pioneer in all \n     transformation processes in society, and more females and an \n     increase in the visibility of their presence in the Turkish \n     army delivers crucial messages--especially to the rural \n     population--on equality for women and a more active \n     participation of women in society.\n       A female in uniform backed by the Turkish army can better \n     dissuade a man in rural Turkey, for instance, inclined to \n     violence against his wife. ``Because of my uniform and as \n     stipulated by law, I will go after anyone committing violence \n     against his wife or any other female,'' Haydar said.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. So my amendment, of course, is to provide that\n\n[[Page H4058]]\n\npathway for the collaboration of U.S. military women with other \nexcellent forces to be able to help these women and to be able to fight \nthe global war on terrorism through technical assistance, counsel, and \nadvice, which I think will add to the expertise of those militaries \nbut, more importantly, to the work of the United States military.\n  Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member \nVisclosky for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their \ndevotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives \nto keep our nation safe and for their work in ensuring that they have \nresources needed to keep our Armed Forces the greatest fighting force \nfor peace on earth.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, \nwhich is simple and straightforward and affirms an example of the \nnational goodness that makes America the most exceptional nation on \nearth.\n  The purpose of the Jackson Lee amendment is to provide the Secretary \nof Defense flexibility to allocate resources needed to provide \ntechnical assistance by U.S. military women to military women in other \ncountries combating violence as a weapon of war, terrorism, human \ntrafficking, narcotics trafficking.\n  Mr. Chair, the United States is committed to combating violent \nextremism, protecting our borders and the globe from the scourge of \nterrorism.\n  The United States Armed Forces possess an unparalleled expertise and \ntechnological capability that will aid not only in combating and \ndefeating terrorists who hate our country and prey upon innocent \npersons, especially women, girls, and the elderly.\n  But we must recognize that notwithstanding our extraordinary \ntechnical military capabilities, we face adversaries who adapt very \nquickly because they are not constrained by geographic limitations or \nnorms of morality and decency.\n  Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, ISIS/ISIL and other militant \nterrorists, including the Sinai's Ansar Beit al-Maqdis in the Sinai \npeninsula which poses a threat to Egypt.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment will help provide the Department of Defense \nwith the resources needed to provide technical assistance to countries \non innovative strategies to provide defense technologies and resources \nthat promote the security of the American people and nation states.\n  Terrorism, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking and their impact \non women and girls across the globe has had a great adverse impact on \nus all.\n  According to a UNICEF report, rape, torture and human trafficking by \nterrorist and militant groups have been employed as weapons of war, \naffecting over twenty thousand women and girls.\n  Looking at the history of terrorism alone highlights the importance \nof providing technical assistance through our military might, as this \nenables us to chip at terrorism which has plagued us here in the United \nStates.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment will help curb terrorism abroad by making \navailable American technical military expertise to military in other \ncountries, like Nigeria, who are combating violent jihadists in their \ncountry and to keep those terrorists out of our country.\n  Time and again American lives have been lost at the hands of \nterrorists.\n  These victims include Christians, Muslims, journalists, health care \nproviders, relief workers, schoolchildren, and members of the \ndiplomatic corps and the Armed Services.\n  This is why the technical assistance offered by our military \npersonnel is integral to promoting security operation of intelligence, \nsurveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft for missions to empower local \nforces to combat terrorism.\n  Terrorists across the globe have wreaked havoc on our society and \ncannot not be tolerated or ignored, for their actions pose a threat to \nour national security and the security of the world.\n  Mr. Chairman, from the United States to Africa to Europe to Asia and \nthe Middle East, it is clear that combating terrorism remains one of \nhighest national priorities.\n  Collectively, through every action and effort towards empowering our \nneighbors and their military to combat terrorism, eradicate human \ntrafficking, stop narcotics trafficking and negate their impact on \nwomen and girls across the globe is in our national interest.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, the amendment proposes to amend \nportions of the bill not yet read.\n  The amendment may not be considered en bloc under clause 2(f) of rule \nXXI because the amendment proposes to increase the level of outlays in \nthe bill.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, providing science, technology, engineering, \nand math education to America's youth is critical to the global \ncompetitiveness of our Nation. The STARBASE program engages local \nfifth-grade elementary students by exposing them to STEM subjects \nthrough an inquiry-based curriculum and is currently active in 56 \ncongressional districts throughout the Nation.\n  Today I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member \nVisclosky for their strong leadership in reestablishing funding for the \nprogram over the past 2 years. I am respectfully requesting an \nadditional $5 million to help expand the program nationwide.\n  Today I am offering STARBASE amendment No. 18 to H.R. 2685, the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act. My amendment increases \nfunding to the STARBASE Youth Program by $5 million, and while \nproviding support for the program, it also reduces spending by $1 \nmillion.\n  The STARBASE program is carried out by the military services because \nthe lack of STEM-educated youth in America has been identified as a \nfuture national security issue by the Department of Defense. Two years \nago, both the House and Senate rejected the Office of Management and \nBudget's, the OMB, proposal to terminate this critical program.\n  As a Member of Congress, I appreciate OMB's desire to consolidate \nSTEM's programs across the spectrum into one funding line. However, \nthis is a national defense item and has been identified by the Joint \nChiefs of Staff as such. STARBASE was created under the auspices of the \nDepartment of Defense to meet its critical needs in STEM-related \nfields.\n  Regrettably, the funding uncertainty caused by OMB's action during \nthat time resulted in the elimination of all programs operated by the \nNavy and reduced in fiscal year 2014 the number of DOD STARBASE \nprograms from 79 to 56. DOD currently has 25 sites on the waiting list \nfor a program, and that is why we need a small increase in funding for \na number of STARBASE programs. It is one of the most cost-effective \nprograms across the Federal Government, costing an average of $343 per \nstudent.\n  Last year, 3,062 classes were conducted in 1,267 schools in 413 \nschool districts across the country. More than 70,000 students attended \nthe programs, bringing the total to 825,000 students since its \ninception in 1993.\n  It is one of the most effective STEM programs as well. The students \ndemonstrate undisputed improvement in STEM.\n  I will conclude by reading Warrant Officer Stacey Hendrickson of the \nCalifornia State Military Reserve and director of the STARBASE program \nat the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base in my district, who \nsaid:\n  ``Congressman Lowenthal, I wanted to let you know that one of our \nschools, 96th Street Elementary in Watts, earned their highest science \nstandardized test scores ever last year. This is significant because \nthe class is second-year remediation and has English language learners \nand special needs students. Every student's score went up, so this is a \nclass that was very special to us. We were all very excited to hear \nthat, as those students had all shown a big increase in our own pre and \npost test scores. We were happy to see that the improvement was seen on \ntheir Academic Performance Index scores as well.''\n  Mr. Chair, STARBASE inspires America's youth to discover technical \ncareer fields that are imperative. During this time of economic \nrecovery we cannot lose this battle and concede our technical edge to \nthe rest of the world. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise to oppose the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I know the gentleman is a strong supporter of it. \nIndeed, it is a program that does incredible things for students that \nhas a proven record.\n  Unfortunately, once again, the President's fiscal year 2016 budget \ndid not support the program. There were no funds requested. As a \nresult, the committee provided an additional $25 million in fiscal year \n2016 to restore funding for the program.\n  However, I can't support an amendment that would cut the Army's \noperations, the maintenance accounts, to pay for it. This account \nprovides funding for critical training, operations, maintenance, and \nreadiness programs. After over a decade of war, restoring readiness is \none of the key objectives of our bill this year.\n  We need to have soldiers who are ready and able to respond to \ncontingency. It is a top priority in our bill for the Army and for us. \nWhile I appreciate the gentleman's intent, I cannot support his \namendment, reluctantly.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment with the \nintent of bolstering funds for a worthwhile program in the National \nGuard that assists with securing our southwest border.\n  In my State of Arizona, we are under attack. The Arizona border is a \nmain thoroughfare for the black market and trafficking. Guns, money, \ndrugs, and people are smuggled over the border at an alarming rate. \nOnce the smugglers make it to Interstate 10 in Tucson, they can make \neasier runs to Phoenix, Los Angeles, and beyond.\n  Let's be clear, the Guard's southwest border mission has bipartisan \nsupport. Even President Obama supported this program during his time in \nthe White House. In fact, since 1981, Congress has authorized military \nsupport to civilian law enforcement agencies.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will suspend.\n  For what purpose does the gentleman from Illinois seek recognition?\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I rise to ask which of the three amendments \nI have before me is the one that we are now considering in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. GOSAR. 107.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I have got it.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the Clerk will report the \namendment once again.\n  There was no objection.\n  The Clerk read the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. In fact, since 1981, Congress has authorized military \nsupport to civilian law enforcement agencies, and those narrow \nauthorizations are prescribed in title 10, chapter 18 of the United \nStates Code. In sum, they act to support law enforcement efforts, but \nthey do not direct them.\n  Finally, I will remind my colleagues that a similar amendment was \noffered last year by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), and the \namendment was accepted by voice vote. This amendment today seeks to \nachieve the same goal. The amendment is offset by a reduction to the \ndefensewide operations and maintenance account, $30.2 billion account.\n  Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas are all struggling. We are \nin desperate need of expertise and support at our southwestern border. \nIf you support efforts to secure the border and interdict illegal \ntrafficking in guns, money, drugs, and humans, including sex slaves, \nthen you should support this amendment.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their tireless \nefforts to prioritize resources in this bill.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time, but I am in \nsupport of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from New Jersey is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I understand the Representative from Arizona has \nfirsthand knowledge of the value of the southwest border mission, and I \nsupport his amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I thank the chairman for accepting my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Pascrell\n\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $5,500,000) (increased by $5,500,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and \nRanking Member Visclosky for providing $212 million for suicide \nprevention outreach programs, $20 million above the President's \nrequest.\n  I am offering this amendment with my colleagues, Representatives \nPallone, Smith, LoBiondo, Garrett, Lance, Sires, Payne, MacArthur, \nNorcross, and Watson Coleman, to continue support and funding for the \nsuccessful confidential peer-to-peer Vets4Warriors program, a Pentagon-\nfunded call center operated by Rutgers University Behavioral Health \nCare that provides troops struggling with depression and other \npsychological or emotional concerns support by veterans.\n  Despite the troubling increase in Active Duty military suicides after \n9/11, the Defense Department announced last month it would stop funding \nthe Vets4Warriors program, which has provided valuable assistance to \nreduce these incidents.\n  Through Vets4Warriors, servicemembers have been able to find \nconfidential assistance from peers who share lived experiences and who \ncan quickly connect and listen in highly effective ways. Since December \n2011, the program has had over 130,000 contacts.\n  The Defense Department's plan to integrate these services into the \nMilitary OneSource without a public process is concerning because we \nknow that many servicemembers are reluctant to contact superiors for \nassistance with mental health needs. Military OneSource is only billed \nas available to veterans and their families within 180 days after \nleaving the service.\n  Vets4Warriors provides a deep place for veterans to seek help outside \nthe Defense Department. We believe removing funding for this program is \nshortsighted. This move will also result in the layoff of approximately \n30 well-trained, talented veterans who have been providing support \nservices around the clock. We want the Defense Department to use this \nfunding to fully fund the Vets4Warriors program, ensuring our troops \nreceive the best mental health resources available.\n\n[[Page H4061]]\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. PASCRELL. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I rise to support your amendment.\n  I think all of us are particularly shocked that they would shut \nsomething down in our home State that actually serves the rest of the \nNation. They enjoy a good reputation. It sort of falls into the \ncategory of ``what were they thinking?''\n  We appreciate your standing for the Vets4Warriors.\n  Mr. LANCE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. PASCRELL. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Pascrell for his leadership on \nthis issue, as he has led on so many other issues. I also thank \nChairman Frelinghuysen. It is due to Chairman Frelinghuysen's \nleadership on this legislation that we stand well-equipped to keep our \nNation safe and secure.\n  The Vets4Warriors program has saved lives in New Jersey. It has made \na great difference during very challenging times for servicemen and \nservicewomen. Their peers offer support and a friendly ear at a time \nwhen it matters most. Their voices of encouragement, friendship, and \nsupport on the other end of the telephone remind our brave heroes of \ntheir great potential, the love of a grateful nation, and what they can \naccomplish in their lives.\n  The program has been proven effective. Thousands of veterans have \nreceived critical care and assistance. It works and it should be \nmaintained. The statistics on veterans' suicides are heartbreaking, but \nprograms like Vets4Warriors are the types of efforts that we can \nimplement to make a lasting difference.\n  I thank Lloyd Deans of Bridgewater, New Jersey, and the district I \nserve for his support and leadership in this area, and for fighting for \nthis program and for being a great friend and resource to other \nveterans.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR.

A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman from Arizona and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I too am offering an amendment to bolster \nsuicide prevention programs. I rise to offer an amendment which would \nprovide additional resources for mental health programs for our \nNation's servicemembers. Traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic \nstress disorder have been consistently contributing to behavioral \nissues with our veterans, and all too often these ongoing mental health \nissues result in suicide. With an average of 18 to 20 veteran suicides \nper day, more resources are desperately needed.\n  The DOD is already an expansive bureaucracy, and I appreciate the \nwork of the committee to prioritize resources and to provide \nappropriation levels for the defensewide operations and maintenance \nthat are actually lower than those in fiscal year 2015.\n  My amendment takes a relatively small amount from that account--$1.5 \nmillion out of a $30.2 billion budget. The nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office says the amendment would have no impact on budget \nauthority or outlays.\n  Too many of our men and women in uniform are struggling with \ntraumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result \nof serving in combat. If you support improved mental health for our \nservicemembers, you should support this amendment. Let's prevent future \nsuicides amongst our troops and ensure they are getting the help they \nneed. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the \nchairman and the ranking member for their time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I do insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman may state his point of order.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I strongly admire the advocacy on behalf of \nsuicide prevention by the gentleman from Arizona. It is very needed, \nbut I insist on my point of order because the amendment proposes to \namend portions of the bill not yet read.\n  The amendment may not be considered en bloc under clause 2(f) of rule \nXXI because the amendment proposes to increase the level of outlays in \nthe bill.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order? If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  To be considered en bloc pursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI, an \namendment must not propose to increase the level of budget authority or \noutlays in the bill.\n  Because the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona proposes \na net increase in the level of outlays in the bill, as argued by the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations, it may not avail itself \nof clause 2(f) to address portions of the bill not yet read.\n  The point of order is sustained. The amendment is not in order.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Delaney\n\n  Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(reduced by $7,463,000)''.\n       Page 88, line 16, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Maryland and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to start by thanking the chairman and the ranking member for \ntheir unwavering support of our national defense and our veterans.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment increases the funding for a program called \nFisher House from $5 million to $10 million, and it funds that increase \nby reducing the amount in the operation and maintenance account by $5 \nmillion.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Fisher House is a very successful and very well-\nregarded nonprofit with a single mission, which is to provide free \nhousing and lodging to families of veterans. The facilities are located \nnear veterans hospitals and military hospitals in VA facilities.\n  The purpose of this housing is to allow the families of veterans to \nbe with their loved ones, the servicemen or -women who have served our \ncountry and are receiving medical care at one of these facilities. Mr. \nChairman, we know how important that is for the families and for the \nloved ones, but we know in particular how important that is for our \nveterans when they are receiving care incurred in the service to our \ngreat Nation for them to have their families with them.\n  The Fisher House program has been in business for 25 years, and they \nhave been a proven and exceptional steward of taxpayer money. They \noperate 65 facilities all around the country. Again, these facilities \nare near military hospitals or a veterans facility.\n  They operate to a very high standard. They have a deep pipeline of \nnew facilities that they want to build. Unfortunately, there is a great \nneed for these facilities, which is why we are proposing to increase \ntheir funding from $5 million to $10 million.\n  I have introduced this amendment for the past 3 years. It has enjoyed \nbipartisan support. This year, it also has the support of the \ngentlewoman from Michigan.\n\n[[Page H4062]]\n\n  I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. \nDingell).\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for \nyielding and for his leadership on this critically important issue. I \nrise in very strong support of this amendment.\n  For many years, I have worked with hospitalized veterans and their \nfamilies who have often had to travel far from home to get treatment \nand have seen what the Fisher House has done. The Fisher House \nFoundation does wonders in being a home away from home during very \ndifficult times for our veterans and their families.\n  As Congress continues to address veterans issues, it is critical that \ntheir families also have support systems in place and a safe place to \nstay while the veterans are receiving treatment.\n  We should be building more Fisher House facilities across the \ncountry. We are currently trying to put one in Michigan and, as I \nexplored that public-private partnership, discovered that there is more \nthan a 5-year wait in that pipeline. This bill isn't a silver bullet, \nbut it would help reduce that timeline.\n  I want to thank my good friend Congressman Delaney for his leadership \non this issue, and I urge all Members to support this bipartisan \namendment that helps veterans and their families.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition and will use \nthat time to say that I support the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from New Jersey is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. The Fisher House Foundation does incredible work. \nBoth my predecessors, Mr. Murtha and Mr. Young, were strong supporters.\n  Just for the record, my bill already includes an additional $5 \nmillion for the Department as a grant to the Fisher House Foundation \nand allows each service to transfer up to $11 million for Fisher House \noperations, so each of our services recognizes the incredible private \ncontribution and also the U.S. taxpayer contribution.\n  I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for his \nsupport and, once again, thank him for his singular leadership and for \nhis insights into the importance of the Fisher House program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that we can build, \nas the gentlewoman from Michigan said, more Fisher House facilities to \nallow the family members of our veterans to be with them at this great \ntime of need.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment Offered by Mr. Franks of Arizona\n\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(reduced by $2,000,000) (increased by \n     $2,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for \nallowing me to offer this amendment to this year's Defense \nAppropriations bill to establish and reestablish the Commission to \nassess the threat to the United States from electromagnetic pulse \nattack, which was authorized in the House-passed FY16 NDAA.\n  Mr. Chairman, as your committee knows so very well, the United States \nfaces many threats and challenges today, perhaps more than ever before \nin her history. One of those threats is the reliance across all \ncritical infrastructure sectors on an aging and highly vulnerable \nelectric grid.\n  As the GAO reported, the Department of Defense relies upon that very \nsame electric grid for 99 percent of its electricity needs within the \ncontinental United States without which it cannot effect its mission.\n  The previous EMP Commission stated that a collapse of large portions \nof the electrical system will result in significant periods of power \noutage and loss of significant portions of that system.\n  Should the electrical power system be lost for any substantial period \nof time, the consequences are likely to be catastrophic to civilian \nsociety. They concluded that negative impacts on the electrical \ninfrastructure are certain in an EMP event unless practical steps are \ntaken to provide protection for critical elements of the electrical \nsystem.\n  The Commission must be established, Mr. Chairman, to ensure that \nresearch into addressing these vulnerabilities continues within the \nDepartment of Defense to enable practical steps to actually secure and \nharden the grid. The House Armed Services Committee has already acted \nthis year and authorized $2 million to reestablish the Commission.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure that \nthese funds are appropriated as well.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. The gentleman brings up a huge issue, EMP, \nelectromagnetic pulse. I accept the amendment.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentleman very much.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Nolan\n\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, my amendment would transfer \n$1 million from the Secretary's some $30 billion general operation and \nmaintenance fund to lung cancer research under the Defense Health \nProgram.\n  I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking \nMember Visclosky for the additional funds that have already been placed \ninto the legislation for cancer research. My amendment is presented out \nof the hope that we can still do better and get us back to a point \nwhere we were some years ago.\n  I know $1 million won't make but a dent in the Secretary's general \noperating fund, but it would make an enormous difference--an enormous \ndifference--in battling lung cancer, a disease that already affects \nmany of our military men and women and kills over 159,000 Americans \nevery year.\n  As many of you know, my daughter, Katherine, a young mother of four, \nages 9 to 16, was diagnosed with nonsmoking lung cancer earlier this \nyear. I would be remiss if I didn't thank my many colleagues for their \nprayers and their good will and all their expressions of hope and \nconcern and thank the committee for the money that they have provided \nhere for medical research because, make no mistake about it, the \ncombined prayers, good will, and medical research have provided \nKatherine and her family and her friends and many people throughout \nthis country with hope for their recovery.\n  We have come a long way, and we are getting very close to discovering \na cure for this and many of the other cancers that so tragically take \nthe lives of our loved ones.\n  It is my hope that with this amendment, we can do a little bit \nbetter, get us a little bit closer to that cure, and give people going \nforward the same hope that my daughter, Katherine, has been able to \nreceive as a result of these prayers and this research.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and ask for its support.\n\n[[Page H4063]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. McKinley\n\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $5,000,000) (increased by $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom West Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, formed in 1993, the Youth ChalleNGe is a \n17-month program run by individual State National Guards. Its mission \nis to give troubled youth a second chance and addresses our Nation's \ndropout rate by providing them the opportunity to obtain a high school \ndiploma.\n  Youth ChalleNGe has transformed the lives of over 120,000 young \npeople since 1993 and has expanded to 35 sites in 27 States, including \nthe District of Columbia and Puerto Rico--young people like Tatiana \nZambrano, a 2011 Puerto Rico ChalleNGe Academy graduate, who with the \nhelp of Youth ChalleNGe overcame much adversity to gain admission to \nValparaiso University from which she graduated last month. Society may \nhave given up on these young people, but Youth ChalleNGe hasn't.\n  Along with my colleague, Congresswoman Napolitano, we have written \nletters and offered amendments in support of Youth ChalleNGe and have \nbeen buoyed by its successful intervention over the last number of \nyears, the program seeks now to expand its help into California, \nGeorgia, North Carolina, and Texas, but that requires $25 million above \nthe funding level.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Our amendment doesn't go to that level. Instead, we hope that we can \nask for just a modest $5 million amount for Youth ChalleNGe to carry \nout its modest expansion of this program to reach at-risk children. It \nhas proven to be a cost-effective investment.\n  We thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and his staff for their efforts and \ntheir interest in this issue, and I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Mrs. Napolitano), my co-chair of the Youth ChalleNGe Caucus.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, my colleague \nwho is the co-chair on the Congressional National Guard Youth ChalleNGe \nCaucus--bipartisan, may I add--to help our throwaway kids. They are 16- \nto 18-year-olds who have fallen through the cracks, so we work in a \nbipartisan manner to ensure that some of these youngsters have a second \nchance.\n  We thank the Appropriations Committee for the funding increase over \nPresident Obama's 2016 request of $145 million.\n  The 2016 Defense Appropriations will fund the National Guard Youth \nChalleNGe Program at $150 million, with the current funding of $135 \nmillion. As my colleague has stated, this amendment increases by $5 \nmillion the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program to $155 million, and \nit reduces the operation and maintenance, defensewide account by the \nsame amount. It helps to start new programs in four States. Each new \nprogram is $4 million. The California third program will cost $10 \nmillion to $15 million due to the Superfund site.\n  It is critical for hundreds of youth who are dropouts to have the \nsame options to be able to have a second chance. The ChalleNGe program \nhas graduated, as was stated, over 120,000 nationally. It is voluntary, \nfree, with no cost to the child or to his or her family. It is a 22\\1/\n2\\-week residential boot camp program that is led by the National Guard \ncadre. It also prepares them to reenter society and to be successful, \nto build employment potential, and to return to school. A 2012 RAND \nstudy finds, for every dollar spent, it results in a return of $2.66 to \nthe taxpayer.\n  It is rated as the best youth program in the Nation. It effectively \naddresses part of our Nation's dropout epidemic on a small level. It is \nbeneficial to business, communities, and the Nation's ability to \ncompete in our future economy. We need more programs, not fewer. More \nthan 12,000 applicants are rejected due to no space, so we ask our \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, it is all about just trying to help these \nyoung kids get a second chance. By expanding this program as we are \ndoing, which is a modest expansion to reach into some other States, we \nknow we are going to reach some other lives that society has given up \non. I don't want to give up on them, and I don't think our Nation wants \nto give up on them. This is a chance to do it, and I thank the \ncommittee for its support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I will not take the full 5 minutes, but \nI would just point out to all of my colleagues that we are on page 9 of \na 163-page bill. This bill deals with the national security of this \ncountry. It contains $578,656,000,000, and we have already received two \namendments that have been offered on the floor that were not made \navailable to us. I would hope that this does not continue to be a \npractice during the coming debate on the remainder of the bill given \nthe gravity of the bill, the subject matter, and the amendments, \nthemselves.\n  I would ask all of the Members to have the courtesy to make sure both \nthe majority and the minority have their amendments in a timely fashion \nand, certainly, before we begin 5 minutes of debate on the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives. I would ask for that civility on behalf of \nall of the Members.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Sablan\n\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(reduced by $21,300,000)''.\n       Page 16, line 24, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(increased by $21,300,000)''.\n\n  Mr. SABLAN (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask that the amendment \nbe considered as read and printed in the Record.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom the Northern Mariana Islands?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom the Northern Mariana Islands and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chair, we all agree that the Department of Defense \nhas the responsibility to defend our Nation, but the Department also \nhas a responsibility to clean up after itself when it contaminates our \nenvironment or threatens public health, and we in Congress have a \nresponsibility to give the military the money it needs for that \ncleanup.\n  The amendment I offer adds $21.3 million to the Formerly Used Defense \nSites program.\n  I plan to withdraw the amendment out of respect for Chairman \nFrelinghuysen and his subcommittee, which actually added $25 million to \nthe FUDS program above the President's budget request. Yet I want to \nmake the point that we ought to keep the funding at the same level we \nappropriated in fiscal year 2015, which was $250 million, and that is \nwhat my amendment would do, because now is not the time for the \nmilitary to backslide on its cleanup.\n  There are 5,000 sites--in every State and territory--that we know are \ncontaminated, and these sites are not in someone else's backyard. There \nare 87 of the Formerly Used Defense Sites in Chairman Frelinghuysen's \nState of New Jersey, and there are 42 FUDS sites in Ranking Member \nVisclosky's State of Indiana.\n\n[[Page H4064]]\n\n  In the district I represent, which is the Northern Mariana Islands, \nthere are 24 contaminated areas, dating back to World War II, that are \nstill waiting to be cleaned up. For example, there are 17 rusted fuel \ntanks in the little village of Tanapag that have been leaking oil into \nthe ground since Harry Truman was President, and, every day, there are \nkids who are walking by on their way to school; there are fishermen in \nthe lagoon just a few feet away; and there are families who are living \nwith the smell of oil in their homes.\n  This is not just an environmental issue. This unfinished cleanup \ndamages our military's ability to defend our Nation. Let me explain.\n  In the Northern Mariana Islands today, the Defense Department wants \nto expand training activities--using live fire, running pipelines, \nbuilding more fuel tanks--doing the very things we know contaminate the \nenvironment and threaten public health. The people I represent are \nsaying ``no'' to this expanded military activity.\n  Now, restoring FUDS funding will not change anyone's mind about the \nmilitary's proposed buildup in my district, but at least the military \nwill have a little more credibility when it promises that it will clean \nup after itself because, if the people I represent see Congress cutting \nfunding for FUDS, then the military's promise has no credibility at \nall.\n  This is not just about the Northern Mariana Islands. This is a \nnational issue. We have 5,000 sites currently identified for cleanup \nnationwide and another 10,000 on the list of potentially contaminated \nsites. Even if we appropriate $250 million for 2016, it is not enough. \nThe Army Corps of Engineers estimates a full cleanup cost of $14 \nbillion. So, at $250 million a year, we will still be having this same \ndiscussion 50 years from now.\n  Again, I commend the chairman and his subcommittee for adding the $25 \nmillion to the Formerly Used Defense Sites program, but, ultimately, we \nall have to do better.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SABLAN. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the gentleman's statement before the \nfloor and for his bringing the issue to the Members' attention.\n  As you frankly point out, not only for the constituency you represent \nbut whether it was in any of our districts, as you also rightfully \npoint out, this is a national problem. It tends to be forgotten because \nit is not seen visually by the average constituent. It is a very \nserious health and environmental problem, and I do appreciate your \nraising it during this particular debate.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom the Northern Mariana Islands?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(reduced by $10,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 1, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 9, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is identical to an \namendment offered last year that passed this body by a voice vote.\n  Veterans of the first gulf war suffered from persistent symptoms, \nincluding chronic headaches, widespread pain, cognitive difficulties, \ndebilitating fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory symptoms, \nand other abnormalities that are not explained by traditional medicine \nor by psychiatric diagnoses.\n  Research shows that, as veterans from the first gulf war age, they \nare twice as likely to develop Lou Gehrig's disease as are their \nnondeployed peers. There also may be connections to multiple sclerosis \nand to Parkinson's disease. Sadly, there are no known treatments for \nthis lifelong pain and affliction that these veterans must endure \nthrough this disease.\n  For decades, the Veterans Health Administration has downplayed any \nneurological basis for the disease, but recent research has shown \nunequivocally that this disease is biological in nature. The time has \ncome for us to right the wrong that our servicemen and -women have had \nto live with now for over 20 years. In this Department of Defense \nAppropriations bill, we allocate more money for breast cancer, \northopaedic, and prostate cancer research than we do for finding a cure \nfor Gulf War Illness. Equivalent funds are appropriated for ovarian \ncancer research.\n  I think if we are going to spend money on medical research within the \nDepartment of Defense, which I am in favor of, the Department must \nadequately fund research on those diseases that originate in war and \nwholly affect our servicemen and -women. Over a quarter of a million \nveterans display symptoms of this disease, and the time has come to \nfind and to fund a cure for it.\n  The offset for my amendment today comes from the $30 billion \noperation and maintenance, defensewide account. Congress has a \nresponsibility to ensure that the gulf war veterans, who put it all on \nthe line and are paying for that with a lifetime of pain, are not left \nbehind. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help find a \ncure for the Gulf War Illness.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(reduced by $10,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 1, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 9, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chair, my amendment would increase funding for \nprostate cancer research by $10 million under the Defense Health \nProgram.\n  Prostate cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer in men \nand is the second-most common cause of a man's death. In 2015, \napproximately 220,800 men in the United States will be diagnosed with \nprostate cancer, and an estimated 27,540 will die from it.\n  The Prostate Cancer Research Program is a unique research program in \nthat it prioritizes research that will lead to the elimination of death \nfrom prostate cancer while enhancing the well-being of men who are \nexperiencing the impact of that disease.\n  To date, the Prostate Cancer Research Program has resulted in a total \nappropriation of over $1.3 billion, including $80 million last year. \nThis unique partnership among the military, prostate cancer survivors, \nclinicians, and scientists has changed the landscape of biomedical \nstudy, energizing the research community in conducting high-risk \ninvestigations that are more collaborative, innovative, and impactful \non prostate cancer.\n  This increase would result in a total funding level of $90 million, \nwhich is still $10 million below what this account was funded at in \n2001, more than a decade ago. The offset for my amendment comes from \nthe $30 billion operation and maintenance, defensewide account.\n  This amendment passed the House by a voice vote last year and as part \nof an en bloc amendment the year before. I hope that we will all agree \non its passage again this year.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GRAYSON. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I would like to thank the gentleman for his \nprevious amendment, which I supported,\n\n[[Page H4065]]\n\nand also for this amendment, which supports greater funds for prostate \ncancer research.\n  Mr. Chairman, as a matter of history, my predecessor died from \nprostate cancer, and, of course, around this room and around the \ncountry, we know too many men who haven't done what they should do to \nlook after their health and, therefore, the welfare of their families.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  I want to commend the gentleman for his advocacy in this area and \nalso remind those who are on the Hill that I think next week the House \nwill be sponsoring a screening for all men here. It is a good way not \nonly to look after yourself, but the people who love you. I want to \ncommend the gentleman for his advocacy on an annual basis and thank him \nfor yielding the time. I accept the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. I reclaim my time.\n  I want to thank the chairman for his kind and insightful words, and I \nwant to thank the chairman for his leadership in making sure that the \nhealthcare needs of those who serve are met.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Speier\n\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Alzheimer's disease is a threat to our country--not a direct threat \nlike ISIS or al Qaeda, but it is an insidious, persistent threat to the \nminds and bodies of our family members and to the fiscal health of our \ncountry.\n  The Alzheimer's Association estimates that the cost of caring for \npeople with Alzheimer's right now through the Medicare system is $226 \nbillion. By the year 2050, it will be $1.1 trillion. This is a genuine \nbudgetary threat. If it grows unchecked, the cost to Medicare from a \nsingle disease will zap our ability to pay for national security. \nInterestingly enough and timely enough, on the front page of USA Today \nis a story that reads how 15 percent of seniors account for nearly one-\nhalf of Medicare spending.\n  We also have an epidemic among our soldiers. It is called traumatic \nbrain injury, known as the signature wound of veterans from Afghanistan \nand Iraq. It affects our soldiers at a much higher rate than the \ncivilian population, and the VA projects its 10-year costs at $2.2 \nbillion.\n  TBI is also closely linked to Alzheimer's. For 30 years, we have \nknown about a clear correlation between TBI and the risk of developing \nAlzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. By researching the \nlink between TBI and Alzheimer's, we can help cure both.\n  I applaud the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nDefense of the Committee on Appropriations for increasing the funding \nfor the Peer Reviewed Alzheimer's Research Program from $12 million to \nits presequestration levels of $15 million, but the funding for \nAlzheimer's research in the United States is still underresourced.\n  Today, I am offering this amendment to increase the funding for the \nPeer Reviewed Program by $5 million, which would take it up to $20 \nmillion. This modest investment on the front end in research can \neventually yield billions in savings in the future on the cost of care. \nThat is why I urge my colleagues to support our servicemembers with TBI \nand Alzheimer's and vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Takai\n\n  Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(reduced by $25,000,000) (increased by \n     $25,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Hawaii and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Hawaii.\n  Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I \nwould first like to thank the chairman and the ranking member for this \nopportunity.\n  Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment with Mr. Jones of North \nCarolina. Our bipartisan amendment would increase DOD's supplemental \nimpact aid to $55 million, $25 million more than appropriated in the \nbill currently. This would benefit schools in almost every school \ndistrict that hold a military installation. Schools that had 20 percent \naverage daily attendance of military-dependent students in the \npreceding year as counted on their Federal impact aid application are \neligible to receive funding on an annual basis.\n  Congress has recognized the needs faced by many school districts \neducating a large number of military children and has consistently \nprovided increases in this aid; yet last year, in fiscal year 2015, \nthis funding was dropped from $45 million to $25 million. This is not \nenough. With the stress put on military kids throughout the past years, \nthis aid should be increasing, not decreasing.\n  The education of a military child is a military readiness issue. The \nmen and women serving in the military today have to rely on local \nschool districts to provide quality education and counseling programs \nfor their students and children.\n  Earlier this year, a letter signed by many Members of this Congress \nand endorsed by multiple organizations asking for this critical program \nto be fully supported at $50 million for DOD impact aid, with $5 \nmillion for children of military families with severe disabilities, was \nsent to the House Committee on Appropriations. As we know, we have to \noffset any funding increase for one program with another if we play by \nthe rules, and I have done so with this amendment.\n  Our amendment is fully offset by using funding from an Office of the \nSecretary of Defense servicewide administration account, O \ndefensewide. The children are our future, and many that grow up in our \nmilitary families today will be the military leaders of our future. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Takai).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Conyers\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $15,000,000)''.\n       Page 74, line 8, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n       Page 74, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this amendment is \ndesigned specifically to support the men and women of the United States \nArmed Forces and to dramatically improve their quality of life while \nthey are deployed.\n  On a daily basis, the United Service Organizations, USO, reaches \nUnited States military members in numerous ways. They provide calling \ncards at deployed locations for servicemembers to call their families. \nThey provide toiletries and necessities for deployed servicemembers and \nthose in austere locations. They are the first persons to\n\n[[Page H4066]]\n\nwelcome back redeploying servicemembers. They volunteer to run morale \nand welfare tents offering Internet connectivity for deployed \nlocations. Connecting troops to their families through calling cards \nand the Internet is just part of the USO's 40-plus program repertoire, \nbut it is incredibly important to our deployed men and women and to \ntheir spouses, parents, siblings, and children.\n  In an era where our servicemembers are fighting prolonged wars, \nconnecting them to their families and friends back home is a service to \nour military that we cannot afford to underfund. In fact, 93 percent of \ntroops surveyed in 2012 agreed that USO services boost morale, ease \nseparation from friends and family, and convey a feeling of support to \nthe servicemember. Unfortunately, however, our deployed servicemembers \ntoo often go to the USO tent only to find that USO provisions, \nincluding supplies and calling cards, have run out. Increasing funding \nto the USO will help alleviate this unacceptable problem.\n  In the proposed fiscal year 2016 Defense Appropriations bill, the USO \nis funded at just $20 million. This amendment will reduce the \noperations and maintenance defensewide account by less than one two-\nthousandths, while having an immeasurable impact on the quality of life \nof our servicemen and -women.\n  It is past time that we direct sufficient funds to the quality of \nlife of the men and women that sacrifice everything to defend our \nNation. I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support it.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I would like to salute the dean of the House for \nhis strong support of the USO. Over 40 years ago, I was one of those \nsoldiers, and it made a real difference in my life.\n  All of us want to thank the gentleman for his significant leadership \nhere over so many years and for choosing this incredibly wonderful \norganization to plus up.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the amendment. I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Keating\n\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 6, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(reduced by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 1, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 9, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 20, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order. We \nhaven't received a copy of the amendment. We would like to see a copy \nof the amendment if that would be possible. That is the reason for the \nreservation.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will distribute copies of the amendment.\n  A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman from Massachusetts \nand a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to add \nan additional $1 million for research and development for Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common \nlethal genetic disorder affecting American children today.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  It is a progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects approximately \n1 in every 3,500 boys or 200,000 babies born each year worldwide. Over \ntime, patients experience severe loss of muscle strength and control.\n  Most boys diagnosed with Duchenne lose their ability to walk by the \ntime they become teenagers. There is no known cure for Duchenne, and \nlife expectancies for individuals with this disease are significantly \nshortened. Many do not live past their 21st birthday.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have met with many Duchenne patients \nand their families and have seen the impact this disease has and what \nit imparts on their daily lives.\n  There have been very promising advances in recent years, including \ndevelopment of a new drug which has achieved success in early clinical \ntrials. I have had one child in my district confined to a wheelchair \nwho, under this clinical trial, is able to walk by himself currently. \nHowever, much more work needs to be done to find a cure for this \ndisease and to better understand what causes Duchenne in the first \nplace.\n  This amendment will directly benefit the thousands of Duchenne \npatients throughout the United States, as well as their countless loved \nones who care for them every day. By increasing funding for peer-\nreviewed research, institutions across the country will have additional \nresources necessary to make progress on eliminating this devastating \ndisease.\n  We as a nation are on the cusp of historic progress in advancing \ncritical research. Now is the time to recommit to robust support of our \ncountry's biomedical research for this disease.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the countless physicians, \nresearchers, and scientists who work tirelessly to find a cure for \nDuchenne. I would also like to thank the Jett Foundation, which has \nlong been a national leader in increasing awareness and providing \nsupport for patients and their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I thank the chair \nand ranking member for their consideration.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve my point of \norder. We are doing a little more homework on the amendment. Certainly, \nI am supportive of it.\n  I claim the time in opposition, although I support the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from New Jersey is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I understand the gentleman's concern is the lack of \nthe copy of the amendment?\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I think we wanted to make sure we have the figures \nthat go with what it is set against.\n  Mr. Chairman, we want to make sure it comports to the rule of the \nHouse. We are not against it. We just want to make sure it is in order.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I apologize. We had moved this with a \nlater change to the defensewide operations and maintenance fund for the \npay-for for this; that probably explains this balance, but it is coming \nfrom that portion. The $1 million, I think, is in excess, if my memory \nis correct, of the $3.5 million that is already there.\n  We are able to leverage this for a greater opportunity to move \nquickly on this. That is the rationale. That is where it came from.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. While I check the figures to make sure that it is \nproperly offset, I continue to reserve my point of order.\n  Mr. KEATING. I would just like to ask the gentleman from New Jersey \n(Mr. Frelinghuysen), the chairman, if that information is currently \nbeing analyzed now.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. If the gentleman will yield, there is some \nconsultation going on at the desk. At the conclusion of those \nconsultations with the Parliamentarian, I will have a better \nopportunity to respond in, hopefully, a more positive fashion.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KEATING. I thank the chairman for the effort he is going through \nand the consideration he is giving with this.\n  Many times, we have the opportunity to talk to families and deal with \nissues. In this particular instance, we have an opportunity. As I \nmentioned, we are right on the cusp of very significant research. \nLeveraging a small additional\n\n[[Page H4067]]\n\namount now would have tremendous ramifications.\n  I was just completely struck by the fact that I saw a person--a young \nboy in his teens, confined to a wheelchair, like so many of those \nafflicted with this terrible disease have had to suffer through, and as \na result of those clinical trials, to see that person no longer in a \nwheelchair and up and ambulatory and walking, those are the type of \ndramatic improvements we are on the cusp of right now.\n  That is why this amendment just seeks to get an incremental increase \nwith that because I think it would be leveraged and have enormous \nsignificance as a result.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. While I continue to reserve, let me compliment the \ngentleman on his amendment, as we do further investigation on the \noffsets.\n  Medical research for diseases that affect our military members and \ntheir families are a priority of our committee; you can be sure of \nthat. That is why our bill includes $3.2 million, again, this year for \nthe Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Research Program.\n  The committee has provided, which I think would be of interest, more \nthan $43 million for this research area since fiscal year 2003, and you \nhave alluded to it, but research breakthroughs in this area will only \nhelp those suffering from this debilitating disease, but will also help \nresearch in other various muscular and motor neuron diseases.\n  I think the research is absolutely essential, and I think we are \ncloser to a resolution of the issue that would allow me to withdraw my \nreservation. I thank the gentleman for his indulgence.\n  I would be happy to withdraw my reservation of the point of order and \nsupport the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The reservation is withdrawn.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his indulgence \nand patience and the good work he has done in this respect, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 13, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Again, I want to begin by thanking the chairman of \nthe subcommittee and the ranking member of the subcommittee and their \nstaff because I have worked on this in past appropriations and had the \nprivilege of receiving the support of both the chair and the ranking \nmember on the question of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  I heard the chairman mention both Chairman Young and Chairman Murtha. \nOver the years, I have had the privilege of working with them on this \nquestion of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  I just want to use a little anecdote, particularly as it relates to \nVietnam vets. Many of us remember Vietnam vets coming back and, some \nlong years later, getting a better understanding of Agent Orange. I \nremember a Vietnam vet telling me about it, but as he indicated, they \nmentioned it or spoke about it or tried to explain it when they came \nback directly from Vietnam.\n  It was a long time before the understanding came about Agent Orange, \nand in years going forward, there was great medical care needed, \nmedical costs needed, because those veterans had been suffering for a \nlong time.\n  We now understand post-traumatic stress disorder; and, as I look over \nthe landscape of the last years of war, Operation Iraqi Freedom and \nOperation Enduring Freedom, about 11 to 20 out of every 100 veterans, \nor 11 to 20 percent, who served have post-traumatic stress disorder in \nany given year.\n  In the Gulf war, Operation Desert Storm, about 12 out of every 100 \nGulf\n\n[[Page H4068]]\n\nwar veterans who still live have PTSD in any given year. In the Vietnam \nwar, about 15 out of every 100 Vietnam vets, or 15 percent, are \ncurrently diagnosed with PTSD. In a recent study in the late 1980s, the \nNational Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study stated that it is \nestimated about 30 out of every 100.\n  Other factors contribute to it, and, if you listen to individuals who \nhave PTSD, they seek to be part of a normal life and to work and \nsurvive and provide for their families.\n  My amendment is simple. It adds an extra $1 million to increase \nfunding for PTSD. These funds will be used to outreach activities \ntargeting hard-to-reach veterans, especially those who are homeless and \nreside in underserved urban and rural areas who suffer from post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.\n  I had the privilege a couple of years ago to provide a PTSD facility \nthat was offsite of a veterans hospital in a small, community-based \nhospital. Mr. Chairman, the response from veterans was amazing because \nthey were able to come to an offsite location for counseling in PTSD.\n  We know that the tragedies of war last with men and women for a very \nlong time. I am hoping that my colleagues will support this amendment \nagain to ease the trauma of the thoughts that these men and women have, \nthe nightmares when they sleep, because they really want to be--as they \nare--contributing members of society.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Let me commend the gentlewoman for your strong \nadvocacy.\n  Just for the record, our bill does provide $155 million, including a \nplus up of $1 million above the request level of $55 million, for \ntraumatic brain injury and psychological health research.\n  Additionally, our bill includes $676 million in operation and \nmaintenance funding within the Department of Health program to care for \nservicemembers affected by TBI and psychological health injuries.\n  We welcome the additional money; we accept your amendment, and I \ncommend you for your efforts.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Reclaiming my time, I applaud the compassion that \nthe chairman and the ranking member have had in the writing of this \nlegislation, highlighting several very important points needed for our \nservicemen and -women, and I am grateful for the support of the \nadditional resources, continuing the advocacy for them.\n  In closing, let me thank this Congress for the wounded warrior that I \nhave in my office. He is someone who suffers from PTSD. He has been an \nexcellent staff person in reaching out to the veterans throughout my \ncommunity.\n  He is an example of the fact that, when you have treatment, you can \nbe part of contributing to society, as they all want to be, even with \nsome of the challenges they have.\n  Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member \nVisclosky for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their \ndevotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives \nto keep our nation safe.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, \nwhich is virtually identical to an amendment that I offered and was \nadopted in last year's Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 2685).\n  My amendment increases funding for the PTSD by $1,000,000. These \nfunds should be used toward outreach activities targeting hard to reach \nveterans, especially those who are homeless or reside in underserved \nurban and rural areas, who suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD).\n  Mr. Chair, along with traumatic brain injury, PTSD is the signature \nwound suffered by the brave men and women fighting in Afghanistan, \nIraq, and far off lands to defend the values and freedom we hold dear.\n  For those of us whose daily existence is not lived in harm's way, it \nis difficult to imagine the horrific images that American servicemen \nand women deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters of war see \non a daily basis.\n  In an instant a suicide bomber, an IED, or an insurgent can \nobliterate your best friend and right in front of your face. Yet, you \nare trained and expected to continue on with the mission, and you do, \neven though you may not even have reached your 20th birthday.\n  But there always comes a reckoning. And it usually comes after the \nstress and trauma of battle is over and you are alone with your \nthoughts and memories.\n  And the horror of those desperate and dangerous encounters with the \nenemy and your own mortality come flooding back.\n  PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war \nveterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such \nas torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural \ndisasters such as floods or earthquakes.\n  People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb \n(especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close), \nlose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling \naffectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become \nviolent.\n  They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident, and \nanniversaries of the incident are often very difficult.\n  Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts \nduring the day and in nightmares when they sleep. These are called \nflashbacks. A person having a flashback may lose touch with reality and \nbelieve that the traumatic incident is happening all over again.\n  Mr. Chair, the fact of the matter is that most veterans with PTSD \nalso have other psychiatric disorders, which are a consequence of PTSD. \nThese veterans have co-occurring disorders, which include depression, \nalcohol and/or drug abuse problems, panic, and/or other anxiety \ndisorders.\n  My amendment recognizes that these soldiers are first and foremost, \nhuman. They carry their experiences with them.\n  Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of \nnightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the \nArmed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad.\n  My amendment will help ensure that ``no soldier is left behind'' by \naddressing the urgent need for more outreach toward hard to reach \nveterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are homeless or \nreside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of the amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                    Environmental Restoration, Navy\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For the Department of the Navy, $300,000,000, to remain \n     available until transferred: Provided, That the Secretary of \n     the Navy shall, upon determining that such funds are required \n     for environmental restoration, reduction and recycling of \n     hazardous waste, removal of unsafe buildings and debris of \n     the Department of the Navy, or for similar purposes, transfer \n     the funds made available by this appropriation to other \n     appropriations made available to the Department of the Navy, \n     to be merged with and to be available for the same purposes \n     and for the same time period as the appropriations to which \n     transferred: Provided further, That upon a determination that \n     all or part of the funds transferred from this appropriation \n     are not necessary for the purposes provided herein, such \n     amounts may be transferred back to this appropriation: \n     Provided further, That the transfer authority provided under \n     this heading is in addition to any other transfer authority \n     provided elsewhere in this Act.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Lamborn\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 14, line 13, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(reduced by $10,290,000)''.\n       Page 33, line 3, after the dollar amount insert the \n     following: ``(increased by $10,290,000)''.\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman from Colorado and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nI will be offering and then withdrawing this amendment because of a \npoint of order on the timing of the budget outlays that we are not able \nto reconcile at this point in time.\n\n[[Page H4069]]\n\n  But I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Chairman \nFrelinghuysen, and Ranking Member Visclosky, for their leadership.\n  Now, this is an important amendment though. My amendment would \nprotect from possible cancellation an innovative program that promises \nto provide a breakthrough capability for a very small amount of money.\n  Right now, if Iran or North Korea launches a ballistic missile attack \non our homeland, we, unfortunately, have no enhanced way of knowing \nwhether or not our defensive missiles actually hit the target or not.\n  That is why the Missile Defense Agency is executing a promising and \ngroundbreaking space sensor system called Space-Based Kill Assessment.\n  The U.S. desperately needs improved sensors in space to provide \ntracking, discrimination, and more. A robust, multimission space sensor \nnetwork will be vital to ensuring a strong missile defense program. \nWithout this, we might otherwise waste extremely expensive ground-based \ninterceptors, costing the taxpayer more money, and depleting our \nlimited number of interceptors.\n  The Space-based Kill Assessment program cannot survive a 50 percent \ncut. Program cancellation may result, and it would waste taxpayer \ndollars already invested and would also fail to meet congressional \nintent to have an initial operating kill assessment capability by 2019.\n  This experiment, up until today, has had zero scheduling delays since \nit was conceived in fiscal year 2014.\n  Finally, this program is a great example of the cost savings and \nother benefits the government can leverage through commercially-hosted \nsatellite payloads. This program, and other similar efforts, are \ncritical to ensuring that the United States stays ahead of future \nballistic missile threats.\n  I would hope that this amendment would have been adopted because it \nwould take money from a lower priority fund and put it into critical \nballistic missile defense against our homeland.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Allow me to commend the gentleman from Colorado \nfor pointing up the value of what he talks about here. And let me \npromise to him that I am sure I will be working very closely with Mr. \nVisclosky to see what we can do to elevate our investment and our \nknowledge and support for this program.\n  I do appreciate your willingness to withdraw the amendment and regret \nthat the outlay issue somewhat has complicated matters on the floor \nthis evening.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate the subcommittee \nchairman's words, and I will certainly work with him on that effort.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 20, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $100,000,000) (increased by $100,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Nevada and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.\n  Mr. HECK of Nevada. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would direct the Army \nto prioritize the modernization of the oldest Bradley Fighting Vehicles \nin the fleet.\n  The Army maintains a program to modify and standardize its Bradley \nFleet to two digital configurations, the M2A3 and the M2A2 ODS-SA. \nThese two variants are the most advanced versions of the Bradley \nFighting Vehicle and provide our soldiers significant improvements in \nsurvivability and force protection.\n  These upgrades feature advanced digitized electronics to provide \ntroops with optimal situational awareness, network connectivity, and \nenhanced communication hardware within the heavy brigade combat team.\n  Almost all units within the Active Army components and prepositioned \nstocks are fielded with these digital configurations. Unfortunately, \nthere are still National Guard units that have not yet received these \nupgrades and are fielded with obsolete, nonstandard, nondigital M2A2 \nOperation Desert Storm variants.\n  Maintaining these outdated vehicles within the National Guard will \nseverely restrict our servicemembers' ability to maintain proficiency \nin the technical requirements necessary to operate the advanced digital \nBradleys utilized in combat operations.\n  This will result in significant degradation of combat effectiveness \nof these units and poses a significant risk to units who deploy with \nthe older Bradley variant, or train on the older variant but fall in on \nthe newer models in theater.\n  Furthermore, servicemembers within these units will face significant \nand unnecessary challenges in maintaining their Military Occupational \nSpecialty qualifications.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Army has an existing program of record for the \nremanufacturing of Bradley vehicles to attain updated digital \nconfigurations. It exists within the President's budget under \nProcurement of Weapons and Tracked Vehicles: Bradley Modifications.\n  This year's budget request includes $225 million for Bradley \nmodifications. Unfortunately, none of these funds were designated for \nthe Bradley Fighting Vehicles digital upgrades. In fact, the \nPresident's budget does not provide funding for these upgrades over the \nentire FYDP.\n  So it is unclear whether or not these Operation Desert Storm-era \nBradley vehicles will ever receive the upgrades necessary to make them \ncombat effective or adequate training platforms. It is for this reason \nI am offering this amendment.\n  My amendment would designate and fence off $100 million of the $1.8 \nbillion under the Army's procurement of weapons and tracked combat \nvehicles accounts to prioritize and upgrade the oldest Bradley Fighting \nVehicles in the fleet. This is 0.005 percent of the total \nappropriation.\n  The $100 million is less than half of what is necessary to upgrade \nthe remaining nondigital, nonstandard variants, but it is an important \nstep to ensuring that the combat formations within our National Guard \nmaintain the combat effectiveness and readiness they have attained over \nthe last decade.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I very much regret that I must rise \nin opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I very much regret that I rise in opposition to \nthe amendment, knowing what a strong supporter of our national defense \nthe gentleman from Nevada is and what a strong supporter he is of the \nNational Guard, not only across the Nation, but in his own State. And I \nregret even more so since we have been talking about this for several \nweeks. I feel badly that I have to rise.\n  The amendment, as the gentleman has stated, directs the Secretary of \nthe Army to repurpose approximately one-half of the $225 million in the \nbudget request that was requested and included for the Bradley Fighting \nVehicle Upgrade Program.\n  The amendment would direct the Army to revise the schedule for the \nBradley Upgrade Program by accelerating the schedule for providing more \nmodern Bradley Fighting Vehicles to the 1st Squadron of the 221st \nArmored Cavalry of the Nevada National Guard, which I am sure is most \ndeserving because, as he said, they have the oldest of the oldest.\n  Having said that, the schedule change would disrupt, as I am advised, \na carefully synchronized plan for Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting \nVehicle modernization and would cause production breaks at both \nmanufacturing lines.\n  The production break would also add significant startup costs to the \nBradley Engineering Change Proposal 2. In other words, this amendment \nwould throw out of balance the Army-wide armor modernization plans and \ndrive up costs in order for one squadron of one State's Guard forces to \nreceive more modern vehicles.\n  As you can tell, Mr. Chairman, from my rather convoluted response, I \nam prepared to work with the gentleman from Nevada to assist him, but \nat this point, I need to regretfully oppose his amendment.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the chairman's offer to work with the \ngentleman as we proceed but would associate myself with the chairman's \nconcerns relative to the amendment that has been offered and, \nparticularly, with an emphasis to the break in production, which I \nthink is a very serious issue.\n  So I do want to associate myself with the chairman's concerns and \nobjection that he has raised, but again, his willingness to work with \nthe gentleman in the future.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Reclaiming my time, I do recommend a ``no'' vote, \nbut I certainly make a, I hope, valid offer to work with the gentleman \nbecause I know that he is going to be working on me to make sure that \nthis occurs, and I want to be helpful to him. I thank the gentleman.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HECK of Nevada. Thank you both, Mr. Chairman and ranking member, \nfor your offer to work with me to try to rectify the situation where we \nhave an important National Guard unit that is dealing with and working \nwith Desert Storm-era Bradley Fighting Vehicles and, yet, expected to \nbe ready to deploy on to the newer materiel in theater should they ever \nbe called.\n  With your assurance to work with me on this effort, I appreciate \nthat.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Nevada?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 30, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $35,000,000)''.\n       Page 33, line 3, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $49,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman from Ohio and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment, and I \nwill later withdraw that amendment.\n  The amendment I am offering today is a simple, commonsense amendment \nthat fulfills a critical need for our Air National Guard, who stand \nwatch while performing the 24/7 Aerospace Control Alert mission as \ndiligently today as they have after the attacks on 9/11. This mission \nis carried out by several Guard units across the country, including the \n180th Fighter Wing in Toledo, Ohio, whom I have the great honor to \nrepresent, and by the D.C. Air National Guard, who are less than 15 \nmiles away from this Capitol. These servicemen and -women also serve in \ncombat theater operations overseas when they are called upon and play a \nvital role in fighting foreign threats.\n  This amendment would provide funding for an additional ARC-210 or \nequivalent radio in the Air National Guard's F-16s. These radios have a \ncapability for secure line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight \ncommunication, providing the ability to securely communicate with \nground forces and command and control. However, one radio in the \naircraft does not allow for the simultaneous contact with them.\n  Currently, Air National Guard F-16s only have one ARC-210 radio that \nworks on an ultrahigh frequency band, and it is this band that most \ncommand and control and air traffic control agencies use. An additional \nsecond radio will simultaneously allow Air National Guard F-16s to \ncommunicate with command and control agencies and coalition troops on \nthe ground in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and dense threat \nenvironments.\n  Members of the Air National Guard, along with fulfilling their duties \nof protecting our borders against those who wish to do us harm, also \ndeploy with our Active Duty military, side by side, on the front lines \nin overseas conflicts. In fact, the request to have these additional \nradios comes from the combat commanders in such theaters around the \nworld. So not only is this needed at home, but also abroad. The Air \nNational Guard designates the need to have this capability as \n``critical.''\n  My offset for this amendment is the Defense Rapid Innovation program, \na program intended to take off-the-shelf technology and put it in the \nhands of the warfighter as soon as possible. My amendment would do just \nthat. It takes low-cost existing technology and puts it to work for our \nwarfighters today.\n  As I said, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, but I want to say \nI want to commend the gentleman from New Jersey and his committee staff \nand all the members of the committee for their hard work on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to speak on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to thank the gentleman from \nOhio for his strong support of national defense, his incredible \ndedication to the National Guard, and his great service to the State of \nOhio.\n  His amendment, while it will be withdrawn, as he said, is intended to \nprovide radio equipment for the Air National Guard F-16s but was only \nrecently brought to our committee's attention. Should the Air Guard \nchoose to purchase the ARC-210 radios with NGREA funding, which the \ncommittee has provided quite a lot of money for, the committee would \nsupport their decision.\n  We are sensitive to the need of the Air Guard, yet the committee \nneeds to do its due diligence. Ranking Member Visclosky and I look \nforward to working with you and your staff on this important issue, as \nwe have already been doing, and appreciate your indulgence and \nwillingness to withdraw the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LATTA. I thank the gentleman for his willingness and especially \nfor his dedication and support for our Air National Guard.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Bridenstine\n\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 30, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $25,000,000)''.\n       Page 33, line 3, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $25,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for bringing this bill to the \nfloor.\n  The Bridenstine-Rogers-Turner-Poe amendment is not a reflection of \nconcern with what is a good bill under the circumstances. The \nBridenstine-Rogers-Turner-Poe amendment would appropriate $25 million \nto fund military responses to Russia's continuing violation of the 1987 \nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the INF Treaty. This is the \nexact same amount that the House Armed Services Committee, the HASC, \nauthorized recently in a bipartisan and noncontroversial provision in \nH.R. 1735, which passed the House Armed Services Committee on a 60-2 \nvote.\n  Senior DOD officials, from the Secretary of Defense to lesser Senate-\nconfirmed officials, have testified that the United States is \nconsidering a range of military options to respond to Russia's \nviolation of the INF Treaty. DOD defines these as countervailing and \ncounterforce options. What do these include?\n  Number one, extending the range of the Army's current Army Tactical \nMissile System, ATacMS; land-basing Tomahawk or otherwise modifying \nsimilar capabilities; and also other capabilities per classified DOD \nreporting.\n  The emphasis should be on modifying current systems as opposed to \ndeveloping brand-new capabilities, which would take longer and cost far \nmore.\n  This amendment is imperative to ensuring that another year isn't \nallowed to go by before Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, is made to \nunderstand that he cannot profit by his violation of the INF Treaty.\n\n[[Page H4073]]\n\n  As The New York Times reported on June 5, following the submission of \nthe most recent State Department annual report on arms control \ncompliance: ``American officials have made no discernible headway in \npersuading the Russians to acknowledge the compliance problem, let \nalone resolve it. . . . In December, the Pentagon told Congress that it \nhad developed a range of military options to pressure Russia to remedy \nthe violation or neutralize any advantages it might gain if diplomatic \nefforts fail. Brian P. McKeon, a senior Pentagon official, told \nCongress that . . . if a diplomatic solution was not found, `This \nviolation will not go unanswered.' ''\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge the support of all Members for the Bridenstine-\nRogers-Turner-Poe amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's concern \nrelative to Russia and his desire to make sure that they do abide by \nthe existing treaty.\n  Certainly, I would acknowledge that they have invaded the country of \nUkraine. They control a quarter of that country's industrial \nproduction, and as the gentleman has indicated, are very concerned \nabout their violation potentially of the treaty that exists.\n  My concern is that the gentleman's amendment is premature. He is \nabsolutely correct that the authorizing committee in this body did pass \nlegislation that you are trying to address with your amendment. The \nother body has not yet acted.\n  Additionally, I would point out--and again, I think the gentleman is \nabsolutely correct--that DOD is considering a range of options. You \nhave enumerated at least three of them, I think, very correctly.\n  Again, I think it is premature, given the fact that we are still, as \na country, considering what options should be utilized to deal with \nthis very serious question that the gentleman raises. Given the fact \nthat we don't have direct authorization and we are considering options, \nwhile I agree with the intent, I would have to object to the timing of \nthe gentleman's amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Chair, I would just argue that, while it is true \nthat the other body has not acted on this yet, it is also true that \nthis body has already acted in the Defense Authorization bill. It came \nthrough committee, and certainly it had overwhelming support in \ncommittee and overwhelming support on the floor of the House.\n  I think that the will of this body ought to be done by all of my \ncolleagues supporting this very important amendment and to make sure \nthat Russia understands that they cannot go unchecked when they violate \na treaty of this magnitude.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I will simply conclude by again expressing \nsympathy for the aim of the gentleman but pointing out that to \nappropriate money, we need authority. We do not yet have that, given \nthe absence of action by the Senate and signature of the authorization \ninto law by the President. I would ask my colleagues to oppose the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Mooney of West Virginia). The question is on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows.\n\n                       Procurement, Defense-Wide\n\n       For expenses of activities and agencies of the Department \n     of Defense (other than the military departments) necessary \n     for procurement, production, and modification of equipment, \n     supplies, materials, and spare parts therefor, not otherwise \n     provided for; the purchase of passenger motor vehicles for \n     replacement only; expansion of public and private plants, \n     equipment, and installation thereof in such plants, erection \n     of structures, and acquisition of land for the foregoing \n     purposes, and such lands and interests therein, may be \n     acquired, and construction prosecuted thereon prior to \n     approval of title; reserve plant and Government and \n     contractor-owned equipment layaway, $5,143,095,000, to remain \n     available for obligation until September 30, 2018.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 31, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $10,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $10,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the staff, \nfirst, for working with Members and getting Members in order to be able \nto present their amendments; and then I want to thank the chairman and \nthe ranking member for their understanding of this amendment and, \nagain, make the point that this amendment that I am offering at this \ntime I have been able to work on with the appropriators over the years.\n  I am a breast cancer survivor, and as I, myself, was going through \nthat period, I met women who were experiencing triple negative, which \nis a very deadly aspect of breast cancer.\n  My amendment increases funding for Defense Health Program's research \nand development by $10 million, and these funds will address the \nquestion of breast cancer in the United States military.\n  Just the fact, to take note of the point, that more than 800 women \nhave been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the Army Times, \n874 military women were diagnosed with breast cancer just between 2000 \nand 2001.\n  My amendment will add additional research dealing with this question. \nAnd the good news is that, when the military research component works \non this, there is a great possibility of moving forward.\n  Breast cancer strikes relatively young military women at an alarming \nrate, but male servicemembers, veterans, and their dependents are at \nrisk as well.\n  `` `Military people in general, and in some cases very specifically, \nare at a significantly greater risk for contracting breast cancer,' \nsays Dr. Richard Clapp, a top cancer expert at Boston University. \nClapp, who works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on \nmilitary breast cancer issues, says life in the military can mean \nexposure to a witch's brew of risk factors directly linked to greater \nchances of getting breast cancer.''\n  Just a moment about the triple-negative breast cancer, when I saw \nfirsthand a very wonderful professional in my community go very \nquickly, first at the diagnosis and then the short-term survival that \nshe experienced.\n  It is a term used to describe breast cancer whose cells do not have \nestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors and do not have an excess \nof the HER2 protein on their cell membrane of tumor cells.\n  So what does that mean? TNBC accounts for between 13 and 25 percent \nof all breast cancer in the United States. It is a higher grade, onset \nis younger, is more aggressive, and is likely to metastasize.\n  Currently, 70 percent of women with metastatic triple-negative breast \ncancer do not live more than 5 years after being diagnosed, and it \nimpacts various ethnicities and ethnic groups in a far different way.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  We find that African American women are more likely to be diagnosed \nwith large tumors, but it impacts women of all backgrounds, racial \nbackgrounds as well.\n  So I ask my colleagues to consider this amendment that I have had the \nprivilege of offering in years past. Might they also take note of the \nfact that the amendment would not change the overall level of budget \nauthority, and it would lower the overall level of outlays.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  I add this article into the Record, ``A New Drug for Triple Negative \nBreast Cancers Seems Promising,'' dated June 5, 2015.\n\n[[Page H4074]]\n\n  Again, the research that the United States military can do under the \nresearch development test and evaluation is powerful. There are many \nwomen and men in the military and many women throughout the Nation and \naround the world who would benefit greatly from the additional focus on \nthis very deadly disease, deadly form of breast cancer.\n  Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member \nVisclosky for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their \ndevotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives \nto keep our nation safe.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, \nwhich is identical to an amendment that I offered and was adopted in \nlast year's Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 4870).\n  My amendment increases funding for the Defense Health Program's \nresearch and development by $10 million. These funds will address the \nquestion of breast cancer in the United States military.\n  Women in the military have had to fight battles against Triple \nNegative Breast cancer and far too many of them are losing the battle.\n  My amendment is designed to advance the study of triple negative \nbreast cancer which is an aggressive and deadly type of breast cancer.\n  Currently, 70% of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer \ndo not live more than five years after being diagnosed. TNBC accounts \nfor between 13% and 25% of all breast cancer in the United States.\n  It is essential to support research to identify multifaceted targeted \ntreatments for this type of breast cancer.\n  TNBC is an extremely deadly form of breast cancer.\n  Unlike traditional forms of breast cancer there are no targeted \ntreatments for TNBC.\n  Additional research is necessary to find the molecular cause for TNBC \nin order to develop an effective treatment regime.\n  It is only in the last few years that professionals studying breast \ncancer have concluded that breast cancer is not one disease, but many \ndifferent forms of cancer all originating in the breast.\n\n       Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a term used to \n     describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen \n     receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an \n     excess of the HER2 protein on their cell membrane of tumor \n     cells\n       Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells: TNBC accounts \n     for between 13% and 25% of all breast cancer in the United \n     States; usually of a higher grade and size; onset at a \n     younger age; are more aggressive; and are more likely to \n     metastasize.\n       Currently, 70% of women with metastatic triple negative \n     breast cancer do not live more than five years after being \n     diagnosed.\n       African American women are 3 times more likely to develop \n     triple-negative breast cancer than White women.\n       African-American women have prevalence TNBC of 26% vs. 16% \n     in non-African Americans women.\n       The survival rate for breast cancer has increased to 90% \n     for White women but only 78% for African American Women.\n       African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with \n     larger tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer.\n       Currently no targeted treatment for TNBC exists.\n       Breast cancers with specific, targeted treatment methods, \n     such as hormone and gene based strains, have higher survival \n     rates than the triple negative subtype, highlighting the need \n     for a targeted treatment.\n       There continues to be a need for research funding for \n     biomarker selection, drug discovery, and clinical trial \n     designs that will lead to the early detection of TNBC and to \n     the development of multiple targeted therapies to treat this \n     awful disease.\n\n  Depending on its stage of diagnosis, triple negative breast cancer \ncan be extremely aggressive and more likely to recur and metastasize \nthan other subtypes of breast cancer.\n  It typically is responsive to chemotherapy, although it can be more \ndifficult to treat because it is unresponsive to the most effective \nreceptor targeted treatments.\n  There is no question that researchers are increasingly recognizing \nthe importance of TNBC as an entity and focusing their efforts on \nseveral key areas.\n  On June 5, 2015, it was reported that ``A New Drug For Triple \nNegative Breast Cancer Seems Promising--Enzalutamide.''\n  Research on effective treatment options for triple negative breast \ncancer is critically need to improve the survival rates of women who \nare diagnosed with the disease.\n  We must also improve upon tests that can detect triple negative \nbreast cancer while it is in its early stages, which could increase \nsurvival rates.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment.\n\n                   [From The Inquisitr, June 7, 2015]\n\n     A New Drug For Triple Negative Breast Cancer Seems Promising--\n                              Enzalutamide\n\n       Breast cancer. The two words strike fear in nearly \n     everyone's heart, as, by far, it is the most common cancer \n     that women can get. In fact, one-out-of-eight women will be \n     diagnosed at some point in their lives. Early detection \n     remains the most important tool we have against fighting \n     breast cancer, but it's only one tool. Not at all tests \n     reliably show all breast cancers in their early stages, and \n     many breast cancers are not detected until they begin to \n     metastasize, or spread to remote locations in the body, which \n     makes them incurable. They can be treated, but it is \n     medically deemed impossible to cure at that point in time, \n     with various metastatic lesions having to be handled as they \n     appear--which means more chemo, more radiation, more lost \n     quality of life.\n       What many people don't realize is that there are actually \n     several kinds of breast cancer--not all are the same or are \n     treated the same. Many breast cancers have hormone receptors \n     which are considered easier to treat the other types, because \n     when biological therapy denies the tumor of the particular \n     hormone that feeds it, the tumor dies.\n       Triple-negative breast cancer, however, does not respond to \n     hormone or biological therapies--that's because the tumor \n     does not have those receptors. It also is a particularly \n     aggressive cancer that usually strikes women in their \n     childbearing years and moves quickly to the brain and bones. \n     Lumpectomies, Mastectomies, chemotherapy, and radiation have \n     been the medical standard, but often with dismal results--the \n     five year prognosis for triple-negative breast cancer is not \n     good.\n       However, a new drug on the market seems promising in the \n     fight against this disease that takes far too many young \n     women. A drug used to treat prostate cancer in men seems \n     promising--called Enzalutamide--shows promise in a subset of \n     women with advanced triple-negative breast cancer. For women \n     whose tumors express the androgen receptor (approximately 40 \n     percent) the drug shrank or stopped tumor activity.\n       Tiffany Traina, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan \n     Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who specializes in \n     breast cancer, spoke about the trial which included 118 \n     women, 47 percent of which had triple-negative breast cancer \n     with androgen receptors.\n       ``Enzalutamide is an oral therapy and extremely well \n     tolerated. We are seeing impressive improvements in \n     progression-free survival [PFS] and in the clinical benefit \n     rate. AR by immunohistochemistry is not perfect in predicting \n     who is going to respond. This is not the whole story. We \n     found that even those with really low AR expression level \n     have had great responses [on trial. Combining AR expression \n     with the gene signature has allowed us to enrich for the \n     population that appears to truly benefit from enzalutamide. \n     This is the most exciting data we have had in triple-negative \n     breast cancer and certainly supports moving this therapy \n     forward in development.''\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee \namendment.

I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 3, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $3,543,000) (increased by $3,543,000 )''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman \nfrom New Mexico and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico.\n  Ms. MICHELE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, at a time when \nthe United States is facing constantly evolving global threats from a \nwide range of enemies, our military urgently needs the technology to \nmonitor and respond to these threats.\n  Our military does not have the time to wait decades or even years for \nthe development and launch of surveillance or communications \nsatellites.\n  Operationally Responsive Space, or ORS, allows the U.S. to quickly \nrespond to the emerging and often unanticipated needs of the \nwarfighter. The program rapidly develops new capabilities, giving our \nmilitary the ability to launch field-ready satellites extremely \nquickly.\n  These cost-effective satellites provide transformational advantages \non the battlefield. They provide surveillance, tactical communications, \ncountercommunications, space protection, space situational awareness, \nand weather data from around the world to assist our military in \ncombating our enemies.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Air Force leadership has \nconsistently praised the program as an effective national security \ntool. General Schwartz, the former Chief of Staff of the Air Force, \nsaid: ``ORS is exactly what we need. Innovation and greater efficiency \nas we contend with ongoing fiscal constraints and changing space \nposture.''\n  General Welch, current Chief of Staff of the Air Force, recently said \nthat we ``have to look at space now as a warfighting domain,'' and he \nwent on to say that doing so requires us to ``look at different ways of \nbuilding, maintaining, and improving the assets we currently have in \nspace and the capabilities they provide in new and different ways than \nthe very functionally developed, large program, large investment over \nlong periods of time that have dominated the space architecture up \nuntil this point.''\n  ORS plays a critical role beyond immediate response to our needs on \nthe battlefield.\n  The U.S. also needs to have the ability to relaunch crucial military \ncommunication and even weather satellites that are lost to \ncountermeasures by other countries. In 2007, China used a ground-based \nmissile to destroy a satellite orbiting more than 500 miles in space, \ndemonstrating their capacity to target our national security satellites \nand space defense systems.\n  The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission's 2014 report \nto Congress notes that ``China, in 2014, continued to pursue a broad \ncounterspace program to challenge U.S. information superiority in a \nconflict and disrupt or destroy U.S. satellites if necessary . . . \nChina likely will be able to hold at risk U.S. national security \nsatellites in every orbital regime in the next 5 to 10 years.''\n  Currently, Russia is developing a sea-based missile and space defense \nsystem capable of destroying satellites. As other countries modernize \ntheir military, the threat level to our communications, navigation, and \nguided munitions satellites intensifies.\n  I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for including some \nfunding for ORS in this year's bills, but I do not believe that it is \nfully adequate to fund this vital program. Without sufficient funds, \nORS cannot produce the space systems that give our military an \nadvantage on the battlefield. It is not in our best interest to solely \nfocus on building satellites that take decades to develop, build, and \nlaunch, and cost billions of dollars.\n  While I believe that ORS is integral to maintaining our advantage in \nspace and bringing much-needed capabilities to our warfighters, I \nunderstand the committee is not at this time able to reallocate \nadditional funds to this very important program. I hope to continue to \nwork with the committee as the appropriations process moves forward.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Mexico?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Pascrell\n\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 33, line 3, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $25,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $25,000,000)''.\n       Page 36, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $25,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer this amendment with \nCongressman Rooney, my co-chair of the Congressional Brain Injury Task \nForce.\n  Traumatic brain injury continues to be the signature injury among our \nNation's servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. More than \n300,000 troops have been diagnosed with mild TBI since 2000. This \nnumber continues to increase as identification and detection methods \nbecome more accurate. Despite these staggering figures, there was a \ndecrease of 20 percent from last year's funding level. Our amendment \nwould restore the same funding level to the TBI program.\n  The program supports the DOD's Psychological Health and TBI Center of \nExcellence in its efforts to educate servicemembers and their families, \nenhance clinical and management approaches, and facilitate other vital \nservices to best serve the needs of our servicemembers impacted by TBI \nand psychological health problems.\n  In recent years, the DOD has made significant strides in improving \nboth in-theater and post-incident assessment and diagnosis, but still \nmore needs to be done in evaluating troops' ability to return to duty. \nAs it is, we are not living up to our responsibility in caring for \nservicemembers who have already been diagnosed with TBI. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition, although \nI do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from New Jersey is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to use this time to heap \ncompliments upon my colleague from New Jersey who heads up the \nCongressional Brain Injury Task Force and has been providing that \nleadership and support, and it is certainly bipartisan.\n  Just for the record, our committee has been very active in supporting \nthis type of work and research. And for the\n\n[[Page H4076]]\n\nrecord, our bill provides $155 million, which includes a plus up of \n$100 million above the request level of $55 million for traumatic brain \ninjury and psychological health research.\n  In addition, our bill provides $676 million in operation and \nmaintenance funding within the Defense Health Program to care for \nservicemembers affected by traumatic brain injuries and psychological \nmaladies.\n  There has been an issue about the slow spend down of some of the \nmoney. Of course, if we are here on the floor advocating, as we should, \nfor such an important program, we need to ensure that the bureaucracy \ngets the money spent. I am sure my colleague from New Jersey would \nagree that if we are going to put money on the table, let's make sure \nthey spend it rapidly to address this ever-growing problem which \naffects so many people who come off the battlefield. I commend the \ngentleman and support his amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer this amendment that would \nset aside $1 million for studying a neglected segment of suicides \nwithin our Armed Forces. Our brave men and women in uniform risk their \nlives every day to keep us safe and free, yet they often don't get the \ncare that they deserve.\n  While attention has been given to the subject in the past, we have \nrecently seen a need for research that deals with high suicide rates \namong our female servicemembers and veterans. This week, the Los \nAngeles Times reported on a recently released study which found female \nmilitary veterans commit suicide at nearly six times the rate of other \nwomen.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  This new government research released in the journal of Psychiatric \nServices went even further, reporting that female veterans between the \nages of 18 and 29 are nearly twelve times more likely to commit suicide \nthan nonmilitary women. We need to do better by the women who risk \ntheir lives to protect our Nation. We cannot sit idly by while our \nfemale servicemembers and veterans suffer in silence.\n  My amendment would set aside $1 million to study the possible causes \nfor this level of suicides among our women in uniform. Service-related \ncauses like traumatic brain injuries and PTSD, in addition to \nnonservice related factors such as adverse childhood experiences, \nfinancial troubles, and other external stressors, must be investigated \nif we hope to seriously confront this travesty head on.\n  In addition, according to the VA, the suicide gap between men and \nwomen is shrinking. Men typically have higher suicide rates than women. \nWhen military service is incorporated, the gap between the two shrinks \nsignificantly.\n  This is a serious problem and one that we don't know enough about to \nconfront. Until we understand why we are seeing this horrific trend, we \ncannot help the women who bravely serve.\n  When we are faced with rising generations where female veterans are \ntwelve times more likely than nonmilitary women to commit suicide, we \nneed to take action.

Mr. Chairman, I have amendment No. 4 that is printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 8053.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Each year, the Department of Defense ships coal from Tamaqua, \nPennsylvania, about 3,000 miles away to an Air Force base in Germany, \ncosting taxpayers millions of dollars more than if we simply treated \nthis particular base like every other military base in the world.\n  Why do we do this?\n  Since 1972, each Defense Appropriations act has included an earmark \nrequiring that the Pentagon purchase anthracite coal from Pennsylvania \nto heat this base in Kaiserslautern, Germany. This is wasteful \nspending, pure and simple.\n  My bipartisan amendment, which I am offering with my colleague Tom \nMcClintock, would finally remove this zombie earmark and save taxpayers \nmillions of dollars each year.\n  At its peak, this earmark mandated that the government purchase more \nthan a million tons of anthracite coal each year to power overseas \nbases and installations, but today, the Department of Defense purchases \nonly about 5,000 to 9,000 tons of coal annually, and it is to meet the \nrequirements of this specific base in Kaiserslautern. It costs \ntaxpayers millions of dollars each time. According to the last study we \ndid on this, which was way back in 1989, the Department of Defense, the \nState Department, and the Department of Commerce jointly concluded that \nthese mandates had cost U.S. taxpayers $1.1 billion, and that was 26 \nyears ago, so it is a lot more since then.\n  For decades, the Pentagon has urged Congress to remove this wasteful \nearmark and allow the use of cheaper fuel\n\n[[Page H4082]]\n\nto power our military base in Germany. President after President has \nurged the removal of this earmark--both Republicans and Democrats--\nevery President since Jimmy Carter and including President Ronald \nReagan. Today, we have an opportunity to finally achieve that goal.\n  I want to thank Mr. McClintock for his leadership in introducing this \namendment with me.\n  The passage of this amendment would be proof positive, I think, to \nAmericans back home that Republicans and Democrats can work together to \ncut wasteful spending. I urge my colleagues to support the Huffman-\nMcClintock amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcClintock).\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I don't support the war on coal that is waged by some \nof my friends on the left, but I do support the war on waste, and I \nsupport this amendment based upon that fiscal imperative.\n  Just a few weeks ago, so-called defense hawks demanded spending well \nin excess of budget caps because, they said, our defense spending had \nbeen stretched to the breaking point. In light of those warnings, I \nfind it inexcusable that these scarce defense dollars would be so \nrecklessly squandered to continue to fund a corrupt earmark from a \ndisgraced and deceased Pennsylvania Congressman, an earmark that dates \nback more than 40 years.\n  That earmark, as my friend has just said, requires that one--and only \none--American Air Force base must purchase 9,000 tons of Pennsylvania \nanthracite coal a year at the grossly inflated price that is estimated \nto be about $20 million. That is about 80 percent more expensive than \ncommonly used coal, and that doesn't include the cost of transporting \nthis overpriced coal across the Atlantic Ocean and halfway across the \nEuropean continent--a cost that is absorbed elsewhere in the Air Force \nbudget. The excuse is that we would otherwise be dependent on Putin, \nbut that doesn't hold water. No other U.S. military base in all of \nEurope is required to buy this coal, only Kaiserslautern.\n  The Pentagon and successive Presidents have consistently protested \nthis waste, but these protests have fallen on deaf ears in Congress \neven while we are told our defense spending has been cut to the bone.\n  If we don't change the spending trajectory of this government, the \nCongressional Budget Office warns, in the next 10 years, just paying \nthe interest on the national debt will greatly exceed our entire \nDefense budget. That makes rooting out waste like this a national \ndefense imperative.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am not an expert in coal, and I am \nnot an expert in what these men describe as an earmark, but I do know \nthat coal is reliable, that it is cost-effective, that it is \ndomestically produced, and that it has been used at this Air Force base \nfor a long time. This provision both promotes domestic resources of \nenergy and ensures that our bases and that particular base have a \nreliable, continuous source of energy for their daily operations.\n  I don't think we ought to dismiss the notion that Germany is under \nattack by Russian aggression, and Russia would at any time cut off fuel \nsupplies, as they have done to other countries in Eastern Europe. \nEurope, as an area, as a continent, remains heavily reliant on Russia \nfor its energy, and Russia uses its leverage on an annual basis to \nquiet potential opposition to that aggression in Ukraine and other \nparts of the region. This is a stark reminder of how important it is to \nensure that our military has a reliable domestic source of energy \nwherever it is in the world. This may be an unusual circumstance, but I \nsee no reason to change it. I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, we have well over 30 other defense \ninstallations in Germany and hundreds of others across the globe. To my \nknowledge--and I have made inquiries on this subject--not a single one \nof those installations operates with a congressionally mandated fuel \nsource like the one we are talking about here. The Kaiserslautern \nfacility is, truly, one of a kind.\n  This is a commonsense amendment that provides the Pentagon the \nflexibility to ensure that our military installations continue to have \nreliable, cheaper, and cleaner energy sources in the years ahead. The \ncongressional mandate in question was added to the Defense \nAppropriations bill over 40 years ago to an accumulated cost of well \nover $1 billion to the taxpayers.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is not about our national security. This is not a \nweapons system. This is not funding to support or protect our troops. \nThis isn't doing anything for our country or our national security \nexcept wasting taxpayer dollars and making one particular coal company \nin eastern Pennsylvania a little bit richer.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' and support this bipartisan \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       Sec. 8054.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hardy). The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 8100.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Indiana and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, the amendment that I have offered deals \nwith the detainees at Guantanamo Bay. I would suggest to my colleagues \nthat the continued operation of the facility at Guantanamo Bay reduces \nour Nation's credibility and weakens our national security by providing \nterrorist organizations with recruitment material.\n  I do regret that the bill and other relevant appropriations acts \ncontinue this or any attempts to close Guantanamo by prohibiting viable \nalternatives. Also, as we are debating an appropriation bill, and this \ncommittee has to pay for things, I think it is appropriate to discuss \nthe cost of the detention facility at Guantanamo. We are now spending \napproximately $2.7 million annually per inmate, which is about 35 times \nthe cost per inmate in a supermaximum Federal prison in the United \nStates.\n  The United States Government has transferred approximately 620 \ndetainees from Guantanamo since May of 2002, with 532 transfers \noccurring during President Bush's administration and slightly in excess \nof 88 transfers occurring during the current administration.\n  Nearly 500 defendants charged with crimes related to international \nterrorism have been--and I would emphasize this to my colleagues--\nsuccessfully convicted in the United States since 2001. It includes one \nformer GTMO detainee who was tried in New York City, the Times Square \nbomber; Richard Reid, the shoe bomber; and others. All of them are \nincarcerated in our Federal prisons throughout the United States, and \nthere have been no security incidents. Further, there are six Defense \nDepartment facilities where Guantanamo Bay detainees could be held in \nthe United States that are currently only at 48 percent of their end \ncapacity.\n  I would ask my colleagues to adopt this amendment so we could move \nforward.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nWittman), who is a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nThese important provisions that are already included in the law have \nbeen included in the past several appropriations bills for several \nyears running, and there is a reason that they are there. This wording \nrepresents a strong and enduring consensus in Congress that Guantanamo \nshould remain open and that detainees should not be transferred to the \nUnited States for any reason. This is debated back and forth in \nagreement on both sides of the aisle.\n  Striking these provisions would have unknown consequences for a \nnumber of U.S. communities, and it is impossible for any of us to know \nhow many detainees might be brought there, where they might be held, \nand the impacts on communities and facilities that are holding them. It \nis also impossible to know what the cost might be, so we are asking for \nthis unknown to be pursued without knowing the risks or knowing the \ncosts.\n  Putting detainees in U.S. prisons, as the administration originally \nproposed, would be disruptive and potentially disastrous. We know \nformer FBI Director Mueller had stated: To transfer detainees to local \njails could affect or infect other prisoners or have the capability of \naffecting events outside the prison system.\n  The last thing we need today in the face of ISIS is to convert more \nfolks to extremism. The idea of bringing detainees for trials in the \nUnited States quickly collapsed as local jurisdictions voiced their \nstrong opposition. We heard that across the United States.\n  As everyone here is aware, several detainees that have been released \nfrom Guantanamo have gone back to the fight and killed and wounded \nAmericans. The threat is real, and Guantanamo is already equipped to \nhandle the detention and military trial of these individuals as \nappropriate. Any proposal that results in these detainees being sent to \nthe United States for any reason is simply the wrong policy. We have \ntread this ground time and time and time again.\n  I therefore oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Reclaiming my time, let me thank the gentleman for \nhis comments, and may I add emphasis to what he said.\n  The thought that people that have been released from Guantanamo have \ngone back to the fight and been involved in the killing of Americans in \nthe Middle East is repugnant and makes all of us angry. That is \nliterally what has happened. We read about it in open sources, and we \ncan speculate because I think sometimes these things are not reported, \nthat a lot of these people that have been released have gone back and \nactually headed up efforts to ambush our soldiers and kill our soldiers \nand seek vengeance. In reality, I am glad these people continue to be \nlocked away.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I would simply say that the gentleman from \nVirginia noted that there is supposition and unknown in the future, and \nthat is certainly correct. What is known is that we are a nation of \nlaws, and our military protects this country so that we can continue to \nbe governed by those laws. I, for one, happen to think that the \nindefinite detention of any human being without a trial is violative of \nthose laws, and that that is a foundational principle of our Nation, \nand we ought to conduct ourselves accordingly. I would ask my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will \nbe postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sec. 8101. (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available in this or any other Act may be used to \n     construct, acquire, or modify any facility in the United \n     States, its territories, or possessions to house any \n     individual described in subsection (c) for the purposes of \n     detention or imprisonment in the custody or under the \n     effective control of the Department of Defense.\n       (b) The prohibition in subsection (a) shall not apply to \n     any modification of facilities at United States Naval \n     Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       (c) An individual described in this subsection is any \n     individual who, as of June 24, 2009, is located at United \n     States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and who--\n       (1) is not a citizen of the United States or a member of \n     the Armed Forces of the United States; and\n       (2) is--\n       (A) in the custody or under the effective control of the \n     Department of Defense; or\n       (B) otherwise under detention at United States Naval \n     Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Nadler\n\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 8101.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H4087]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. NADLER. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment which would strike the \nsection of the bill restricting the use of funds for building and \nmodifying facilities in the United States to house prisoners presently \nat Guantanamo Bay.\n  The argument for why we should strike this section is \nstraightforward. The detainees at Guantanamo Bay must be brought to \njustice. Those who are guilty of terrorism need to be tried and \npunished in a swift and judicious manner. Any detainee who is innocent \nshould, with equal speed and sincerity, be released.\n  Two cases exemplify this argument and underline the importance of \nthis amendment. The first is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind \nbehind the attack on the United States on 9/11. Since 2006, Mr. \nMohammed has been detained at Guantanamo, where he has yet to be tried, \nconvicted, or appropriately punished for his heinous actions. Justice \nfor the victims, for the families who lost loved ones at the World \nTrade Center, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania must be carried out. \nSo far, this has not happened.\n  At the same time, while they haven't managed to try and convict \nanyone at Guantanamo, more than 400 terrorists, including the 9/11 \nconspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, have been tried, convicted, and \nsentenced in the Federal courts in the United States without incident \nand in a manner befitting the American justice system. No convicted \nterrorist has ever escaped from a U.S. prison, and no prison has ever \nbeen compromised or been subject to an attack because of the dangerous \npersons being held within.\n  The second case I want to mention is of Mr. Shaker Aamer, which came \nto my attention in a recent New York Times editorial or op-ed piece \nauthored by a bipartisan group of British members of Parliament. In \nNovember 2001, Mr. Aamer, a British permanent resident, was doing \ncharity work in Afghanistan when he was picked up by the Northern \nAlliance, sold to Americans for a bounty, and taken to Bagram prison \nbefore being moved to Guantanamo in February 2002. He was cleared for \nrelease by President Bush in 2007 and cleared again by President Obama \nin 2010. Six different U.S. agencies agreed, including the CIA, the \nFBI, the Departments of State and Defense, while Prime Minister David \nCameron and the House of Commons unanimously have called for Mr. \nAamer's immediate release and transfer to Britain.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  So far, this has not happened. Mr. Aamer has never been charged with \nanything and has twice been cleared for transfer. Every American agency \nthat has looked at this says that he has not been a terrorist and did \nnot fight against the United States. There is no reason for him to \nremain in this custodial purgatory; yet he remains a detainee at the \nGuantanamo Bay facility.\n  As long as this provision remains in the bill, people like Mr. Aamer, \nguilty of nothing--not terrorists, not fighters against the United \nStates--will be unjustly imprisoned, and people like Khalid Sheikh \nMohammed who are guilty--probably, we think--of terrorism will not be \ntried.\n  For too long, the terrible people in Guantanamo have avoided facing \nthe consequences of answering to a U.S. court for their horrendous \nactions, while innocent detainees are denied recourse for continuing \ntheir detention.\n  The United States must not keep people in prison indefinitely for no \nreason, with no trial. The opponents of this amendment must not share \nmy faith in America's courts to deliver justice. For hundreds of years, \nour legal system has kept Americans safe by imprisoning dangerous \nindividuals while protecting those who are innocent of any charges.\n  Time and time again, Federal courts have successfully proven their \nability to convict criminals and terrorists without violating the \nrights of due process. This amendment represents a return to our \nfounding principles, that no person may be deprived of liberty without \ndue process of law.\n  Without this amendment, we will continue to hold terrorists and \ninnocents alike, indefinitely and without charge, contrary to every \ntradition this country stands for.\n  We must close this facility, try these people, release the innocent, \nand restore our national honor.\n  I urge support of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Wittman).\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise again in opposition to this \namendment.\n  We see that today, Guantanamo is equipped to hold these detainees. \nThe military tribunals there, if allowed to do so, are able to try \nthese detainees. Again, they were captured under the rules of \nengagement as enemy combatants. Let's make sure that we are putting \nthem in that situation to be tried as such.\n  Another element, too, is localities have spoken vocally to say, No, \nwe do not want these detainees here, for a variety reasons. One is they \nare worried about security there. I know the argument is, Well, the \nfacilities here in the United States can hold them. That is not the \nsingle issue. The issue is the communities' concern about what the \noutcomes of the movement of these detainees will be here today.\n  We see today radicalization across the United States from outside the \nUnited States by forces like ISIS. Think about the opportunity as those \ndetainees are moved here and the notoriety that they will attain and \nhow the press will cover it and that being used in addition to \nradicalize folks on the side of extremism. That is another issue that I \nbelieve needs to be addressed.\n  Again, GTMO is working. It is detaining these individuals, enemy \ncombatants that have been picked up on the battlefield. It has been, I \nbelieve, the determination of this body through extensive debate that \nwe shouldn't build facilities here specifically for that purpose and \nthat GTMO is well suited to do the job.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to vote in opposition to this amendment.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NADLER. The continued repetition of untruths does not make them \ntrue.\n  Not all these people were captured on the battlefield. Mr. Aamer, \nwhom I referenced, for example, was picked up doing charity work in \nAfghanistan. He was picked up by a faction of the Northern Alliance, \nwhich then sold him for a bounty to the United States. He was not a \nfighter. He was not on the battlefield. He was a victim of a kidnapping \nby a foreign faction.\n  Everyone who has looked at this--President Bush, President Obama, the \nFBI, the CIA, the NSA, the British Parliament--agrees on the facts with \nhim; yet we hear that everybody was a fighter. No, they weren't. Some \nwere; probably most were.\n  We are told that military tribunals will try these people. Well, Mr. \nAamer has been in Guantanamo for 9 years. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has \nbeen in Guantanamo for 15 years. They can't get their act together. \nEvery time they try to hold military tribunals, there is another legal \nobjection. Federal courts have tried, convicted, and imprisoned 400 \nterrorists.\n  We have to do justice. Keeping people in jail indefinitely because we \nrepeat that they were caught on the battlefield, when some were not, \nhoping for a military tribunal that doesn't occur, is not American. It \nis un-American.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sec. 8102.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available in this Act may be used to transfer any \n     individual detained at United States Naval Station Guantanamo\n\n[[Page H4088]]\n\n     Bay, Cuba, to the custody or control of the individual's \n     country of origin, any other foreign country, or any other \n     foreign entity except in accordance with section 1035 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Nadler\n\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 8102.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is the third of the three amendments that have the \nsame purpose. This one would strike the section of the bill that makes \nit more difficult to transfer Guantanamo detainees to other countries.\n  I find it surrealistic. We have now debated two amendments tonight, \nand all we hear in opposition are repeated statements that everyone at \nGuantanamo is a terrorist--not true--and that everyone in Guantanamo is \npicked up on the foreign battlefield, fighting--not true. It is \ndemonstrably not true.\n  These are not debatable propositions. Some of the people in \nGuantanamo are terrorists. Some of the people in Guantanamo are picked \nup on the battlefield. Some were not.\n  I gave you the example of Mr. Aamer, who was picked up by a foreign \nfaction in the Northern Alliance and sold for a bounty because the \nUnited States offered a bounty for people who someone claimed was a \nterrorist. Everyone looked into it and said he wasn't a terrorist, he \nwasn't a combatant; yet he stays in Guantanamo.\n  It costs us $3 million per prisoner, per year. There are communities \nin the United States which can handle these trials. I can think of no \nhonest reason why we would not want the terrorists to be tried.\n  The terrorists cannot be tried by military tribunal; let them try it, \nbut the fact is they haven't been able to. They have been trying the \nmilitary tribunals for 10 years now, and they haven't succeeded in \nconvicting one person. They have had three plea bargains, no \nconvictions, and no trials in the last 8 or 9 years.\n  The Federal courts are functioning. Why not save money, try the \npeople we think are guilty, get a guilty verdict, put them in maximum \nsecurity prisons, and not hold people indefinitely without charge and \nwithout trial? That is simply un-American.\n  Finally, we are engaged in an ideological war. Someone referenced \nradicalizing people. What radicalizes people more, what gives more \nevidence of the American bad faith and of anti-Islamic sentiments of \nterrible behavior than Guantanamo? It is a symbol worldwide. It is a \nradicalizing influence. Our own generals have said that nothing has \nrecruited more enemy soldiers than Guantanamo.\n  Let's close it, take care of the people who are there one way or the \nother, and do justice.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield to the distinguished gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Forbes).\n  Mr. FORBES. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  The gentleman from New York raised a good question. He said:\n\n       I can think of no honest reason why these terrorists have \n     not been prosecuted in a military tribunal.\n\n  I can give him the answer to that. I don't know if my friend from New \nYork has actually been to Guantanamo Bay, but in 2010, I went there. As \nthe administration came into office, if the gentleman met with the \nprosecutor at that time, he had assembled a team that had worked for \nover 2 years trying and prosecuting the terrorists of the World Trade \nCenter attack.\n  That prosecutor had gone through a stack of hearings this tall that \nhe had prevailed on. His life had been threatened. His team's life had \nbeen threatened. He told all of us, Democrats and Republicans who went \ndown there, that he would have guilty pleas on all those terrorists \nwithin 6 months.\n  To answer the gentleman as to why that didn't happen, it is because, \nwhen the administration came into office, they canceled that \nprosecution, took him off the case, disbanded that whole prosecution; \nand to this day, they have not allowed that prosecution to go forward.\n  If you want to ask the real, honest question of why we haven't \nprosecuted them in the military tribunals--the gentleman from Virginia \nsaid the facilities are there, the will was there, the hearings were \nthere. The reason is because this administration has refused to \nprosecute them.\n  I hope we will defeat these amendments, keep those terrorists there, \nor let this administration prosecute them.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, what is really surrealistic around \nhere, to use the gentleman's word, is that we spend more time on these \nGuantanamo detainees than we do on Americans locked up in Iranian \nprisons and jails--that is unconscionable--or with Americans detained \nin North Korea.\n  Let's focus on liberty for some of the people in those countries that \nwe are trying to work with on the nuclear deal, such as the Iranians \nholding Americans prisoners.\n  You have the right to focus on these detainees. Ninety-nine percent \nof them are guilty as hell, but we seem to be doing little in the \npublic way to release Americans held in prisons in various parts of the \nworld.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, we all obviously want to free Americans \nunjustly held by North Korea or Iran or anybody else. I suspect the \nreason that we don't spend a lot of time on the floor is because we all \nagree. There is nothing to debate. We obviously want them freed.\n  I hope our government behind the scenes is doing whatever we can to \ndo it; we should do whatever we can publicly, but that has nothing to \ndo with Guantanamo.\n  The fact of the matter is it isn't that the administration decided \nnot to prosecute people by military tribunals. That is not the case. It \nis that every time the Bush administration or the Obama administration \ntried to prosecute--and they have continued to try--another legal \nobstacle comes up. They have never worked it out.\n  Appeal after appeal has shut the process down. I should say judicial \ndecision after judicial decision as a result of appeal after appeal has \nshut the process down because they haven't managed to find a military \ntribunal procedure that gives enough constitutional rights to pass \njudicial muster, but is short of a Federal article III court. That is \nwhy 400 terrorists have been convicted in article III Federal courts--\nand no terrorists--let them be tried properly, and let the innocent be \nfreed.\n  We can't simply stand here and say they are all guilty. How do we \nknow that? How do we know that every single one of them is guilty? We \nknow that some are not. By what right do we hold those who are guilty \nof nothing forever? It is a blot on American justice; it is a blot on \nour country's representation, and we should stop it.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sec. 8103.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 115, line 2, strike ``in fiscal year 2016'' and insert \n     ``prior to June 30, 2016''.\n       Page 115, beginning line 7, strike the proviso.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, since its establishment, the National \nGuard has answered the call to defend our Nation and respond in times \nof crises. They have fought bravely with the Active Component, while \ncontinuing to achieve their mission here at home.\n  At the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly 50 percent \nof the Army's total force was a mix of Reservists and members of the \nNational Guard. The Pennsylvania National Guard alone contributed more \nthan 42,000 individual deployments.\n  Unfortunately, the Army's Aviation Restructuring Initiative, or ARI, \nwill have devastating impacts on all that the National Guard has \nachieved. ARI will result in the transfer of all National Guard Apache \nhelicopters to the Active Component, leaving the National Guard less \ncombat-ready.\n  It will also deprive our Nation of an operational reserve for these \naircraft, which is essential to the retention of talented aircrews. ARI \nrepresents a fundamental shift in the nature and role of the National \nGuard.\n  Last year, Congress wisely created the National Commission on the \nFuture of the Army to offer a deliberate approach to addressing force \nstructure issues such as ARI. Yet, as it stands now, many of these \ntransfers will be long done before the Commission has\n\n[[Page H4090]]\n\nexamined the proposal and reported its recommendations.\n  Mr. Chairman, once these transfers begin, it will be all but \nimpossible to reverse them. We need to allow the Commission time to do \nits work before the Army takes any harmful and irreversible actions.\n  In the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, the House \nadopted an amendment to delay some Apache transfers until June 30, \n2016. This amendment extends that responsible limitation to all \nNational Guard Apaches, while also taking important steps to ensure \ncontinued readiness of the Apache fleet.\n  Together, these provisions strike a proper balance between \nsafeguarding our national security and preventing any premature Apache \ntransfers. Only this can truly ensure that the irreparable harm is not \ndone to the National Guard.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I have a number of colleagues who want \nto speak, so I will be brief.\n  But I would point out that this amendment, if adopted, will undo last \nyear's compromise legislation that supported the Army's critically \nimportant Aviation Restructuring Initiative. Part of that compromise \nwas to establish a commission to study the force structure of the \nUnited States Army. I believe we should await that report.\n  The Army has indicated that if they are restricted under the \ngentleman's amendment, they would have to inactivate--and I would \nrepeat this--they would have to inactivate one or more of the \nbattalions in States such as New York, Kansas, and Hawaii, as well as \ndrastically reduce the work going on into the remanufacture plant in \n2016.\n  Each battalion inactivation will result in the unplanned transfer of \napproximately 500 soldiers and 1,000 family members, driven by the \nabsence of the aircraft needed to train the unit.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my good friend, who is also an Apache pilot.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Rothfus for the amendment.\n  Without this amendment, as he said, we will see the transfer of all \nNational Guard Apache helicopters to the Active Component while, just \nlast year, this Congress created the National Commission on the Future \nof the Army to deliberate this change in force, this restructuring \nissue.\n  You say, why should we care? I mean, isn't this a squabble between \none big brother and a little brother? And it kind of is.\n  But we should care because the taxpayers have invested billions and \nbillions of dollars over years to create the infrastructure within the \nGuard.\n  But more importantly, this imposes on and weakens our national \nsecurity because the Guard and the Reserve component is the repository \nfor experience in Apache pilots.\n  When you get tired of flying the Apache on deployment over and over \nagain on Active Duty but want to continue to serve your country, what \ndo you do? You join the Reserve component. You come to the Guard.\n  And those pilots have the most experience because they have flown on \nActive Duty and they have flown in the Guard for years and years and \nyears. So when they deploy, that is who you want to fly with. That is \nwho units want to fly with because they have the experience.\n  The operational depth is in the Guard.\n  It is not that Governors need the Apache; it is that the United \nStates needs the Apache. And should we transfer the Apache because the \nArmy wants to pick on its little brother and can? And that is exactly \nwhat is happening here.\n  I have heard the arguments. I have listened to all the arguments. I \nhave spent 34 years in uniform. None of them make any sense, and they \ncan't justify any of them. They talk big around this place in all kinds \nof acronyms that most people don't understand, but none of it is \njustified.\n  I don't understand why we would do this, why we wouldn't wait just \ntill February to get the report from a Commission that we sponsored, \nthat we authorized in this body. Why wouldn't we wait till then?\n  Why would we transfer the aircraft, and when the Commission comes \nback and says don't transfer the aircraft, oh, well, sorry, we already \ndid that. Won't we look foolish.\n  But more importantly, isn't this important for national security to \nhave the experience there when called upon to go fight--and as the \ngentleman said, make up 50 percent of the force in the fight.\n  Let's not do this for all the wrong reasons.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Ms. Stefanik).\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment to \nprohibit funding for any transfer of Apaches from the National Guard to \nthe Active Army.\n  In committee, Chairman Wilson and I worked very closely to authorize \na congressional review no less than 60 days following the Commission's \nreport release.\n  And on the House floor, as an amendment to the NDAA, Mr. Palazzo and \nI thoroughly examined and determined a fixed transfer date of Apaches \nno later than June 30.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is being used as a backdoor scheme and a \ndelay tactic. This ploy places devastating impacts and potential \ndeactivation of the Army's Combat Aviation Brigades in States like New \nYork, Kansas, Hawaii, Arizona, and overall Black Hawk modernization in \nCalifornia.\n\n  As the Representative of Fort Drum, home of the 10th Mountain \nDivision, any delay would cause this high operational tempo unit to be \nleft without an Aviation Brigade.\n  Let me be abundantly clear. Any Apache delay will have grave \nconsequences on our Army's readiness, deployment schedule, and our \nsoldiers' dwell time. A delay would severely limit the Army's ability \nto meet expected operational requirements and place an even greater \nburden on our Nation's brave servicemembers.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, where I think some may be confused I want to \nclarify. In exchange for Apaches, the National Guard is set to receive \nfully modernized Black Hawks, which are essential to lift-and-rescue \noperations and remain critical to a State's emergency response. \nDerailing, delaying, or limiting Apache transfers would, therefore, \nhalt this Black Hawk modernization.\n  This is merely a ploy to prevent our soldiers from receiving the \nequipment they need to protect American lives overseas, and it is \nunconscionable. I am appalled that this is even being discussed and \nwill continue to fight for an ontime transfer of the Apaches from the \nNational Guard to the Active Army.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 1 minute \nremaining, and the gentleman from Indiana has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I only have one more speaker left, and \nit is my understanding that, as a member of the committee, I have the \nright to close.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is correct.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I reserve the balance of my time until the gentleman \nconcludes his remarks.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, I would just urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important amendment to prevent the \npremature transfer of Apaches out of the National Guard until the \nCommission has had the opportunity to do its work.\n  This Congress created the National Commission for the very purpose of \nstudying the impact of transfers such as Apaches out of the Guard after \nspending billions of dollars, as my colleague from Pennsylvania has \nsaid.\n  This was an investment on the part of the taxpayers to build an \noperational reserve. We should not take this step until the Commission \nhas completed its work.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield my remaining \ntime to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby), my colleague from\n\n[[Page H4091]]\n\nthe Appropriations Committee, to close the debate.\n  Mrs. ROBY. I thank the gentleman.\n  I, too, rise in opposition to this amendment. I will enter into the \nRecord a letter from General Odierno that I received, as well as \nothers. It references the FY15 NDAA, which expressly allows for the \ntransfer of Apaches with no restrictions on additional moves \nthereafter.\n  And it says: ``If we are restricted from transferring any portion of \nthe 72 Apaches, or must count aircraft inducted into the remanufacture \nline as part of that 72, we will have to inactivate one or more of the \nbattalions in New York, Kansas, or Hawaii, as well as drastically \nreduce the work going in the remanufacture plant in 2016.''\n\n                                       Department of the Army,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2015.\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       We are writing to inform you that pending legislation may \n     cause great damage to the readiness of the United States \n     Army, create enormous disruption to the lives of thousands of \n     military family members, harm our industrial base, and \n     require us to send Soldiers into combat who may not be fully \n     trained. Specifically, provisions in both the House and \n     Senate versions of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 National Defense \n     Authorization Act (NDAA), and the House version of the \n     Defense Appropriations Act will, if enacted, undo last year's \n     compromise legislation that supported the Army's critically \n     important Aviation Restructuring Initiative (ARI). The \n     proposals drastically alter the statutorily permitted \n     movement of AH-64 Apache helicopters between the Army \n     National Guard (ARNG) and the Regular Army in 2016--a \n     transfer authorized in the FY15 NDAA. Accordingly, as \n     discussed below, to protect our Soldiers and their Families, \n     we request that you continue to support our comprehensive ARI \n     plan.\n       The FY15 NDAA provisions were based on the following \n     factors, none of which has changed:\n       The National Guard Bureau's (NGB) alternative to ARI \n     proposed the transfer of 72 AH-64 Apaches to the Regular \n     Army;\n       The decision to transfer the remaining AH-64 Apaches from \n     the ARNG to the Regular Army would be resolved based on \n     recommendations by the National Commission on the Future of \n     the Army; and\n       The GAO and the Office of the Secretary of Defense CAPE \n     would conduct independent reviews of both ARI and the NGB \n     alternative, both of which have since confirmed that the ARI \n     plan is less costly and provides greater warfighting capacity \n     than the NGB alternative.\n       With these principles in mind, the FY15 NDAA allowed the \n     Army, with the certification of the Secretary of Defense, to \n     transfer 48 AH-64 Apaches between October 2015 and March \n     2016, with no restrictions on additional moves thereafter. \n     Nevertheless, recognizing Congressional concern, the Army \n     specifically committed to transferring no more than 24 \n     additional Apaches in FY16 for a total of 72, which precisely \n     matched the number in the National Guard's alternative \n     proposal. Our FY16 plan provided Congress with time to act \n     upon the results the Commission's report (to be delivered in \n     February 2016); allowed for the normal induction of aircraft \n     into the AH-64 remanufacture line in Arizona; and preserved \n     the Army's ability to deploy trained and equipped Soldiers \n     and units into combat. We strictly adhered to FY15 NDAA and \n     made critical programmatic and operational decisions based \n     upon it.\n       The key points of the Army plan for FY16, which is based on \n     the FY15 NDAA, are below:\n       Transferring 24 AH-64 Apaches from the ARNG to the 25th \n     Infantry Division (ID) in Hawaii;\n       Transferring 24 AH-1-64 Apaches from the ARNG to the 1st ID \n     in Kansas;\n       Transferring 24 AH-64 Apaches from the ARNG to the 10th \n     Mountain Division in New York after 31 March 2016; and\n       Inducting 24 ARNG and 32 Regular Army AH-64 Apaches for \n     remanufacture in Arizona.\n       Should Congress now dismantle this carefully crafted plan, \n     it would not only be disruptive, but also dangerous for our \n     Soldiers. As you know, several proposed legislative changes \n     either prohibit our ability to transfer any or part of the 72 \n     aircraft or require us to count airframes, which were \n     inducted into the remanufacture process in 2014, against the \n     permitted transfers in FY16. The potential impacts of these \n     provisions are stark.\n       If we are restricted from transferring any portion of the \n     72 Apaches (24 in October 2015, 24 in February 2016, and 24 \n     in July 2016), or must count aircraft inducted into the \n     remanufacture line as part of that 72, we will have to \n     inactivate one or more of the battalions in New York, Kansas, \n     or Hawaii, as well as drastically reduce the work going into \n     the remanufacture plant in 2016:\n       Each battalion inactivation will result in the unplanned \n     transfer of approximately 500 Soldiers and 1,000 family \n     members, driven by the absence of the aircraft needed to \n     train the unit;\n       Up to three Combat Aviation Brigades (CAB) of 2,500 \n     Soldiers each, will become combat ineffective, because they \n     will be missing their reconnaissance units, which is half of \n     their attack capability, thus depriving the entire brigade \n     this crucial capability;\n       Nearly 30% of the entire Regular Army combat aviation force \n     could be rendered ineffective, leaving only eight fully ready \n     CABs in 2016--compared to the 13 Regular Army CABs that \n     existed prior to the inactivation of two in FY15; it should \n     be noted that the ARNG has not reduced a single aircraft or \n     unit in this same time frame;\n       We will not be able to meet PACOM requirements for a ``no-\n     notice'' Korea warfight;\n       We will have to send Soldiers into combat in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan without the proper training in Joint Combined \n     Arms maneuver from the 25th ID, 1st ID, and 10th Mountain \n     Division; additionally, the remaining Apache Battalions would \n     have to extend the amount of time they are deployed (note, \n     they are already operating at a 1:1.5 deploy to dwell ratio); \n     and\n       We may have to stop inductions into the AH-64E \n     remanufacture line, because we could not, under certain \n     provisions, process 24 Apaches from the ARNG. Additionally, \n     the risk of losing 32 Regular Army AH-64's for a year, which \n     are planned for induction, without the backfill transfer of \n     the 72 Apaches from the ARNG could be too high. This stoppage \n     could jeopardize a workforce of 4,100 employees in 22 states, \n     including 2,200 in Arizona, 360 in Alabama, 350 in Florida, \n     285 in California, and lesser numbers in WA, TX, MO, IL, MS, \n     OH, WV, PA, NY, VT, NH, CT, NC, SC, and GA.\n       We face an unprecedented and unpredictable global \n     environment that continues to morph in dangerous and \n     unforeseen ways. Now more than ever, we need a force that \n     provides the capabilities necessary to execute the missions \n     that we know are coming, as well as the versatility, agility \n     and depth to handle contingencies we cannot predict. An \n     absolutely critical component of our force is our aviation \n     formations, and we must be able to effectively restructure \n     them to meet current and future demands. Accordingly, we need \n     your support to ensure that the framework created by the FY15 \n     NDAA remains in place. We owe this to our Soldiers, their \n     Families, our industry partners and, most importantly, the \n     American people. Simply put, delaying or derailing ARI \n     jeopardizes your Army, and our Nation's security.\n       We appreciate your time and thoughtful consideration of \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Raymond T. Odierno,\n       General, United States Army Chief of Staff.\n     John M. McHugh,\n       Secretary of the Army.\n\n  Mrs. ROBY. Look, friends and colleagues, we have heard from several \nMembers about the devastating impacts that any delay in ARI would have \non our Army.\n  But let's take time to revisit why we are here in the first place. We \nare here because this Congress put the Army in the position to have to \nmake these difficult decisions in the first place. We are here because \nof a thing called sequestration. And if there has ever been a time for \na stronger argument to revisit this so that we can properly fund all of \nour military across all branches so that they are not put in this box \nwhere the Army has to make these tough decisions, now is the time.\n  We have got to properly fund the United States military. So here we \nhave a letter from a highly respected Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army \nto Congress saying, If you do this, if you delay these helicopter \ntransfers, you will create a domino affect that will result in the \nUnited States of America sending our soldiers to Afghanistan and Iraq \nwho are neither fully trained or in fully equipped.\n  We have to do better. We have to do better. And this is the case. \nAgain, I oppose this amendment, and I call on my colleagues to revisit \nfully funding our military and repealing the sequester.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sec. 8117.  None of the funds made available in this Act \n     may be obligated for activities authorized under section 1208 \n     of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2005 (Public Law 112-81; 125 Stat. 1621) to \n     initiate support for, or expand support to, foreign forces, \n     irregular forces, groups, or individuals unless the \n     congressional defense committees are notified in\n\n[[Page H4092]]\n\n     accordance with the direction contained in the classified \n     annex accompanying this Act, not less than 15 days before \n     initiating such support: Provided, That none of the funds \n     made available in this Act may be used under such section \n     1208 for any activity that is not in support of an ongoing \n     military operation being conducted by United States Special \n     Operations Forces to combat terrorism:  Provided further, \n     That the Secretary of Defense may waive the prohibitions in \n     this section if the Secretary determines that such waiver is \n     required by extraordinary circumstances and, by not later \n     than 72 hours after making such waiver, notifies the \n     congressional defense committees of such waiver.\n       Sec. 8118. (a) Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit a report to the \n     congressional defense committees to assess whether the \n     justification and approval requirements under section 811 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 \n     (Public Law 111-84; 123 Stat. 2405) have, inconsistent with \n     the intent of Congress--\n       (1) negatively impacted the ability of covered entities to \n     be awarded sole-source contracts with the Department of \n     Defense greater than $20,000,000;\n       (2) discouraged agencies from awarding contracts greater \n     than $20,000,000 to covered entities; and\n       (3) been misconstrued and/or inconsistently implemented.\n       (b) The Comptroller General shall analyze and report to the \n     congressional defense committees on the sufficiency of the \n     Department's report in addressing the requirements; review \n     the extent to which section 811 has negatively impacted the \n     ability of covered entities to be awarded sole-source \n     contracts with the Department, discouraged agencies from \n     awarding contracts, or been misconstrued and/or \n     inconsistently implemented.\n       Sec. 8119.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used with respect to Iraq in contravention of the War \n     Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.), including for the \n     introduction of United States armed forces into hostilities \n     in Iraq, into situations in Iraq where imminent involvement \n     in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, or \n     into Iraqi territory, airspace, or waters while equipped for \n     combat, in contravention of the congressional consultation \n     and reporting requirements of sections 3 and 4 of such \n     Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1542 and 1543).\n       Sec. 8120.

None of the funds provided in this or any other \n     Act may be transferred to the National Sea Based Deterrent \n     Fund established by section 2218a of title 10, United States \n     Code.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Forbes\n\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 8122.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is rare to find an amendment to an appropriation \nbill that has already been supported by 375 Members of this House; yet \nthis amendment has, 90 percent of the House. It is rare to find an \namendment to an appropriation bill that has such bipartisan support; \nyet this amendment has.\n  This is an amendment not put in by just me, but by my good friend Mr. \nCourtney, by Mr. Wittman, by Mr. Langevin, by Mr. Rogers, by Ms. \nDeLauro--three HASC subcommittee chairmen, two HASC ranking members, \nand a Defense appropriator. It is an amendment that is supported by the \nchairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the ranking member \nof the House Armed Services Committee.\n  It is rare to find such different groups in support, the Navy League, \nthe United Auto Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, \nAFL-CIO; yet this amendment has that support.\n  The reason these planets are all aligning in this rare configuration \nis because it is also rare--in fact, once every other generation--that \nwe have to build something like the Ohio class submarine; yet it falls \nupon this generation.\n  In 4 years, we will begin the procurement. In 6 years, we will start \nconstruction of 12 ships--they call boats--that will carry 70 percent \nof the nuclear deterrence of this country--$92 billion.\n  The national sea-based deterrence fund we formed last year helps us \nprepare for that in advance, instead of waiting until the night before \nto come up with $92 billion. It transfers $1.4 billion into a fund and \nallows the Department of Defense to find other moneys, a rare thing for \nthe government to actually prepare in advance, instead of waiting until \nthe last minute to prepare. It will help to purchase in bulk and save \nperhaps millions, maybe even billions of dollars.\n  Now, I know there are voices that say in this world, with all the \nthreats we see and all the demands we have for national defense, we \ncannot find creative solutions, and we have to do everything the way we \nhave always done it.\n  We disagree because, if we are not creative, if we don't find other \nsolutions, CRS says we could lose--32 other ships, including as many as \n8 Virginia class subs, 8 destroyers, and 16 combatant ships.\n  Those same voices will say, We can't set up a fund like that; yet \nthey have already set up four different funds very similar to that.\n  We ask for your support for this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, our committee strongly supports the \nOhio class submarine. We have done it for years.\n  Both the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky) and I not only serve \non the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and provide its leadership, \nbut we have also supported this program on Energy and Water, which is \nthe other part of the package.\n  With respect, the gentleman from Virginia's amendment proposes to \nstrike a provision of the bill, prohibits the transfer of funds to the \nnational sea-based deterrence fund, a reserve established but not \nfunded last year in the NDAA.\n  We recognize this submarine will be expensive; however, the national \nsea-based deterrence fund will not make the submarine any less \nexpensive, and it will not increase resources available to the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  This Congress has an important responsibility to provide resources to \nall of our military services and the intelligence community. Under the \nstructure of this special fund, the Secretary of Defense has the \nauthority to divert dollars into this new fund from the Army, Marines, \nAir Force, Special Forces, missile defense, ISR, and other types of \nessential programs. This is the wrong approach. It removes, \nfurthermore, congressional oversight from the Secretary of Defense.\n  Secondly, if the President determines the Ohio class replacement is a \nmust-fund platform, then the Navy should buy it, just as it has every \nother submarine in its inventory that our committee has supported. \nEstablishing a special fund to pay for the submarine is an attempt to \nhave other military services pay for what is a Navy responsibility.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, could I ask how much time I have left?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I do not doubt for a second the sincerity \nof the chairman and the ranking member and their support for the Ohio \nreplacement program.\n  This chart, which the Navy produced, showing the 30-year shipbuilding \nplan, if we fully fund the Ohio class program,\n\n[[Page H4093]]\n\nas well as a 300-ship Navy, demonstrates exactly the problem that \nconfronts us today.\n  It shows, again, a red line across, which shows the modern era of \nshipbuilding at about $15 billion a year; and, with the yellow portion \nof the chart, it shows how, for 13 years, Congress, starting in the \n2020s, is going to be asked to raise unprecedented amounts of money for \nthe shipbuilding account.\n  The fact of the matter is this is an asset that is not just the \nNavy's; it is the country's. Under New START, 70 percent of the nuclear \ntriad will be borne by the Navy through its submarine program, far \ngreater than in the past.\n  The Air Force and their long-range bombers and the Army, with their \nground-based systems, are not going to be bearing the same burden as a \nresult of the Ohio class' planned burden under New START.\n  We have an opportunity to do something sensible, which is based in \nclear precedent, as the gentleman from Virginia indicated.\n  The sealift fund was funded out of the shipbuilding account. The \nmissile-based system was funded on a separate account because these are \nnational assets that provided assistance and national security across \nthe board for the Pentagon.\n  Support this amendment if you support a strong shipbuilding account \nand protect the shipbuilding industrial base of this country.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Wittman), the chairman of the House Armed Services \nSubcommittee on Readiness.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this \ncritical amendment to restore the national sea-based deterrence fund. \nThis amendment is critical to maintaining our Nation's nuclear \ndeterrence and ensure a robust Navy shipbuilding budget.\n\n  It makes sense now to set aside funding for the Ohio class submarine \nreplacement program. This makes sure that, down the road, we are not \nforced to choose between building a replacement ballistic missile \nsubmarine or a destroyer or an aircraft carrier.\n  The Navy already faces challenges in building enough warships to meet \nthe global threats our Nation faces. Funding the national sea-based \ndeterrence fund is the best solution to maintaining national strategic \ndeterrence without hollowing out the Navy's shipbuilding budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I will continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the distinguished \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), who is the ranking member \nof the Emerging Threats Subcommittee for the House Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, the national sea-based deterrence fund is critical to \nthe future of our national security. It provides space outside the \nshipbuilding fund for the most survivable piece of our national \ndeterrence, a bill that last came due in the 1980s in the Reagan \ndefense buildup.\n  Mr. Chairman, these boats are absolutely essential. This is not just \na Navy issue, as Secretary of Defense Connor has said. This is a \nnational priority. The deterrence fund allows us to treat it \naccordingly and avoid pressuring the Navy out of badly needed \ninvestments in other ships and capabilities.\n  Unless Congress acts, these boats will consume half of the projected \nshipbuilding funding for a decade, causing crippling shortages that \nwould echo in our fleet for decades after.\n  We and many of our colleagues have worked on a bipartisan basis to \nrise to this challenge, and the result is this sea-based deterrence \nfund.\n  Earlier this year, this body spoke loudly and clearly in overwhelming \nsupport of the fund and its purposes.\n  I urge my colleagues to reaffirm that position with this amendment.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is where reality comes into play. We talked about \nthis earlier. Having a fund that is set up does not evade the \nresponsibility of providing the long-term funding.\n  All of these things in the Department of Defense are priorities, and \nour friends on the Appropriations Committee have the difficult job of \ntrying to balance these priorities and have the big picture available \nto them.\n  I think they have done exactly the right thing. I think this needs to \nbe subsumed within the overall budget. There is no magic money. Having \nsomething that subverts the hard work that we ask the Appropriations \nCommittee to do, I think, is the wrong thing to do.\n  It is not easy to stand up and make this argument, but I appreciate \nwhat they have done. They did it last year, and it was appropriate. \nThey have done it this year, and it is appropriate. We have to be able \nto deal with this in a comprehensive way and not use sleight of hand.\n  I appreciate what the chair and ranking member have done.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to \nthe gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking member.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to join in opposition to the amendment in the \nstrongest possible terms. I certainly respect the position of my \ncolleagues on the other side of this argument, but I do remind my \ncolleagues that the CBO estimates that this program is going to cost \nsomewhere between $102 and $107 billion.\n  You are absolutely correct. This is a very expensive program, and we \nought to be very, very careful. Given the tremendous financial \nresources that we will be required to modernize or replace the U.S. \nnuclear delivery systems and weapons over the next two decades, it is \nimperative that Congress begin to make tough decisions now and not set \nup segregated funds.\n  Unfortunately, this fund is a means to avoid those tough decisions. \nFirstly, the fund in no way solves the problem of where are we going to \nget the money. It is not going to make the next generation of ballistic \nmissile submarines any cheaper. It simply shifts the burden for paying \nfor their construction from the Department of the Navy to the entire \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I categorically disagree with the amendment's sponsor relative to \nthis replacement program and the suggestion that it should exist \noutside the existing Navy shipbuilding account.\n  The sponsors are correct that the funding for that shipbuilding \naccount has been relatively flat in recent years. However, if the Ohio \nclass replacement and the 300-ship Navy are priorities of this Nation \nand consistent with our national defense strategy, then we ought to pay \nfor both in a transparent manner by increasing the resources in the \nshipbuilding account and not resort to setting up independent funds.\n  Further, the sponsors indicate that this is a national priority, and \nI would not argue that point. These systems play a very important role \nin our nuclear deterrence, so do our long-range bombers and the weapons \nthat they carry.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, long-range bombers also provide \nprotection for this country as well as the weapons they carry. I think \nthey qualify as national asset distinctions. Should we then set up \nfunds for these programs?\n  Let's think about other priorities within the Department. Should we \nset up a fund for the Army's 82nd Airborne? Should we set up a fund for \nthe Air Force combat rescue officers? They are very deserving. Should \nwe set up a fund for the special Marine Air-Ground Task Force? They are \nvery deserving.\n  Another concern that I have is it really expands and transfers \nauthority to the Secretary of Defense. The last time I looked, we have \na constitutional responsibility to make decisions ourselves.\n\n[[Page H4094]]\n\n  The fact is we already have a segregated fund that has drawn a lot of \nattention to this bill that is called the overseas contingency \noperations fund. Should we start picking between services now as to \nwhich one should receive special treatment? Should we then pick \nprograms within particular services? I think not.\n  Again, I strongly oppose the amendment and am pleased to join with \nthe chairman in opposition.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Mr. FORBES. Can I request how much time I have left?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Carter of Georgia). The gentleman from Virginia \nhas 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, the last two speakers have made my point \nfor me. Mr. Blumenauer made the same arguments 4 weeks ago. It was \ndefeated by 375 votes.\n  The last gentleman that spoke said it is $102 billion. The question \nis whether we wait until the night before to come up with $102 billion \nor whether we start now and make sure we have it. This is a national \npriority. I hope we will pass this amendment and build these ships.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sec. 8123.  None of the funds provided in this Act for the \n     T-AO(X) program shall be used to award a new contract that \n     provides for the acquisition of the following components \n     unless those components are manufactured in the United \n     States: Auxiliary equipment (including pumps) for shipboard \n     services; propulsion equipment (including engines, reduction \n     gears, and propellers); shipboard cranes; and spreaders for \n     shipboard cranes.\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       Sec. 8124.  In addition to amounts provided elsewhere in \n     this Act for military personnel pay, including active duty, \n     reserve and National Guard personnel, $700,000,000 is hereby \n     appropriated to the Department of Defense and made available \n     for transfer only to military personnel accounts: Provided, \n     That the transfer authority provided under this heading is in \n     addition to any other transfer authority provided elsewhere \n     in this Act.\n       Sec. 8125.  The amounts appropriated in title II of this \n     Act are hereby reduced by $359,000,000 to reflect excess cash \n     balances in Department of Defense Working Capital Funds, as \n     follows:\n       (1) From ``Operation and Maintenance, Army'', $138,000,000;\n       (2) From ``Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide'', \n     $221,000,000.\n       Sec. 8126.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 123, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $80,000,000)''.\n       Page 123, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $80,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman \nfrom Minnesota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Minnesota.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering with my \ncolleague from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) uses the global war on terrorism \nfunds for the Army operations and maintenance to provide $80 million in \nthe same account for hard body armor for the Soldier Protection System \nVital Torso Protection equipment program.\n  Now, every warfighter deployed or scheduled to be deployed deserves \nto be provided with the most advanced and the lightest hard body armor. \nThe amendment will ensure that the deployed soldiers are protected with \nthe modern body armor they need. Presently, this bill provides no funds \nfor the Army hard body armor.\n  This amendment will also help to ensure that the industrial base \nproducing the specialized boron carbide powder, fabricating ceramic \nplates, and producing finished hard body armor can stay in business and \nsustain production of the lifesaving soldier protection equipment.\n  The body armor industry is in crisis, and that puts our troops at \nrisk.\n  Last year, the House and Senate appropriated $80 million to the Army \nfor industrial preparedness body armor.\n\n[[Page H4095]]\n\nAll four congressional defense committees explicitly directed the Army \nto ensure that the industrial base is able to continue the development \nand manufacture of more advanced body armor.\n  Despite this clear and explicit direction, the Army has completely \nignored Congress. The Army's failure to sustain the body armor \nindustrial base has put a vital industry at risk and is causing layoffs \namong very specialized employees, which puts the entire industry at \nrisk.\n  There is no doubt that our troops deserve modern, lightweight body \narmor that requires a strong, reliable, and fully capable industrial \nbase.\n  Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky \n(Mr. Barr), my good friend, my colleague on this issue.\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota \nfor her leadership on this issue and partnership in supporting this \nimportant and critical mission of our military to make sure that the \nUnited States warfighter in combat has the most advanced, lightweight \nbody armor available to protect that soldier in the field against the \nenemy, and we must act now to make sure that the U.S. Army does what is \nthe intent of the Congress.\n  As the gentlewoman pointed out, despite the fact that Congress has \nbeen clear on this matter, despite the fact that report language for \nboth the FY15 and FY16 Defense Appropriations measures recognize the \nimportance of lightweight body armor protecting soldiers in combat, we \nencouraged the Secretary of the Army to ensure that the body armor \nindustrial base was able to continue the development and manufacture of \nmore advanced body armor by implementing the body armor modernization \nthrough a replenishment program.\n  Despite all of that, despite the articulation of the clear will of \nthis body, the Army has not used and deployed the funds appropriated \nproperly, and the Department of Defense was at odds because the Army \ndid not deploy the resources appropriated until, or expressed the \nintent of not deploying those resources until the end of the fiscal \nyear.\n  What this amendment will do is make sure that congressional intent is \nhonored, make sure that the armor industrial base is properly \nmaintained, and most importantly and most critically, when our men and \nwomen are called into combat to defend liberty and freedom, that we \ngive them the tools that they need to keep them safe and carry out \ntheir mission with victory and honor.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, once again, this $80 million is to \nprovide body armor for the Soldier Protection System Vital Torso \nProtection equipment program. I ask for Members' support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, but, in fact, \nI support the amendment put forward by a member of our committee.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from New Jersey is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota for her \namendment, as well as the gentleman from Kentucky for his strong \nadvocacy.\n  Supporting our industrial base is a strong priority of mine and our \ncommittee's. We think this amendment is a good idea. It sends another \nmessage to the bureaucracy that we mean what we say.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                    Operation and Maintenance, Navy\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Operation and Maintenance, \n     Navy'', $6,747,313,000: of which up to $160,002,000 may be \n     transferred to the Coast Guard ``Operating Expenses'' \n     account, notwithstanding the provisions of section 2215 of \n     title 10, United States Code: Provided, That such amount is \n     designated by the Congress for Overseas Contingency \n     Operations/Global War on Terrorism pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n\n                Operation and Maintenance, Marine Corps\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Operation and Maintenance, \n     Marine Corps'', $1,871,834,000: Provided, That such amount is \n     designated by the Congress for Overseas Contingency \n     Operations/Global War on Terrorism pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n\n                  Operation and Maintenance, Air Force\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Operation and Maintenance, \n     Air Force'', $10,799,220,000: Provided, That such amount is \n     designated by the Congress for Overseas Contingency \n     Operations/Global War on Terrorism pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.\n\n                Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Operation and Maintenance, \n     Defense-Wide'', $7,559,131,000: Provided, That of the funds \n     provided under this heading, not to exceed $1,260,000,000, to \n     remain available until September 30, 2017, shall be for \n     payments to reimburse key cooperating nations for logistical, \n     military, and other support, including access, provided to \n     United States military and stability operations in \n     Afghanistan and to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the \n     Levant: Provided further, That such reimbursement payments \n     may be made in such amounts as the Secretary of Defense, with \n     the concurrence of the Secretary of State, and in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget, may determine, based on documentation determined \n     by the Secretary of Defense to adequately account for the \n     support provided, and such determination is final and \n     conclusive upon the accounting officers of the United States, \n     and 15 days following notification to the appropriate \n     congressional committees: Provided further, That these funds \n     may be used for the purpose of providing specialized training \n     and procuring supplies and specialized equipment and \n     providing such supplies and loaning such equipment on a non-\n     reimbursable basis to coalition forces supporting United \n     States military and stability operations in Afghanistan and \n     to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and 15 \n     days following notification to the appropriate congressional \n     committees: Provided further, That these funds may be used to \n     support the Government of Jordan, in such amounts as the \n     Secretary of Defense may determine, to maintain the ability \n     of the Jordanian armed forces to maintain security along the \n     border between Jordan and Syria, upon 15 days prior written \n     notification to the congressional defense committees \n     outlining the amounts reimbursed and the nature of the \n     expenses to be reimbursed: Provided further, That not to \n     exceed $15,000,000 can be used for emergencies and \n     extraordinary expenses, to be expended on the approval or \n     authority of the Secretary of Defense, and payments may be \n     made on his certificate of necessity for confidential \n     military purposes: Provided further, That the authority in \n     the preceding proviso may only be used for emergency and \n     extraordinary expenses associated with activities to counter \n     the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant: Provided further, \n     That of the funds provided under this heading, up to \n     $30,000,000 shall be for Operation Observant Compass: \n     Provided further, That the Secretary of Defense shall provide \n     quarterly reports to the congressional defense committees on \n     the use of funds provided in this paragraph: Provided \n     further, That such amount is designated by the Congress for \n     Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism \n     pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n\n                 Amendment Offered by Mr. Poe of Texas\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 124, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $430,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment cuts aid to Pakistan in half. Pakistan is \nthe Benedict Arnold nation in the list of countries that we call our \nallies.\n  Before Osama bin Laden met his maker in 2011 in one of the greatest \nU.S. military raids ever conducted, bin Laden was living in plain sight \nin a bustling military town. To think that the most senior levels of \nthe Pakistani Government did not know that he was there requires, as \nSecretary Clinton said, ``the willing suspension of disbelief.''\n\n[[Page H4096]]\n\n  This February, the former head of Pakistan's version of the CIA, \ncalled the ISI, said that Pakistan most likely sheltered Osama bin \nLaden. And just last month, three U.S. intelligence sources told NBC \nNews that Pakistan knew where Osama bin Laden was hiding all the time. \nNot only did Pakistan not help us get Osama bin Laden, Pakistan threw \nthe doctor who did help us under the bus and put him in jail for 33 \nyears for cooperating with America.\n  Pakistan did not help us because Pakistan was working with Osama bin \nLaden. Newly released documents retrieved from bin Laden's compound \nshow that Pakistan's intelligence service was in contact with bin Laden \nand was working with him to convince U.S. leaders to negotiate with al \nQaeda.\n  There are some who say we need Pakistan to help us fight the war in \nAfghanistan, but Pakistan is on the wrong side. Pakistan is helping the \nterrorists, not us. Pakistan's intelligence service gives safe haven, \nresources, and training to terrorist groups, like the Haqqani network \nthat has killed dozens of Americans.\n  On September 22, 2011, Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee: \n``With ISI support, Haqqani operatives planned and conducted the truck \nbomb attack, as well as the assault on our Embassy.''\n  The truck bombing he mentions wounded more than 70 U.S. and NATO \ntroops. Admiral Mullen went on to say: ``The Haqqani network acts as a \nveritable arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency.''\n  Throughout 2011, Pakistan tried to cheat the United States by filling \nout bogus reimbursement claims for allegedly going after terrorists \nwhen they weren't even doing that. That is the same account this money \nfunds.\n  There are others who say we need Pakistan's southern supply route to \nhelp our troops in Afghanistan. But for 7 months in 2012, Pakistan \nclosed off the supply route, and we did just fine. What we really need \naccess to is Pakistan's tribal areas. Terrorists that kill our troops \nin Afghanistan run back and forth across the Pakistan border and hide \nin these tribal areas, but Pakistan won't let our troops chase them \nthere. And so the terrorists kill Americans, and they get away with it.\n  Pakistan did do some military operations in the tribal areas last \nyear, but they tipped off the Haqqani network before they got there \nthat they were coming. Pakistan tipping off terrorists is nothing new. \nLast fall, Leon Panetta, Secretary of Defense at the time of the bin \nLaden raid, says of the Pakistanis, ``We just can't trust them.'' I \nagree. We can't trust Pakistan.\n  My amendment does not cut money to protect Pakistan's nuclear \nweapons. The amendment does recognize the U.S.-Pakistan relationship \nfor what it is. We don't need to pay Pakistan to be our enemy; they \nwill do it for free. Pakistan has already received over $30 billion of \nour money since 2002. After 13 years of giving Pakistan more and more \nmoney, it is time to do something different. My amendment simply cuts \nthe money we give Pakistan in half.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  I certainly understand the gentleman's passion, and at times, I share \nsome of the same concerns he stated in his remarks.\n  Just to put a little perspective on it, the coalition support fund \nallows the Secretary of Defense to reimburse any key cooperating nation \nfor logistical and military support, including access, specialized \ntraining to personnel, procurement and provision of supplies and \nequipment provided by that nation in connection with the U.S. military \noperations in Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Receipts for reimbursements are submitted by cooperating nations and \nare fully vetted by the Pentagon and follow strict criteria to meet the \nstandard for reimbursement, and all payments are made in arrears and \nfollow a notification to Congress, so there is a notification to \nCongress.\n  Regarding Pakistan, the coalition support fund remains a critical \ntool to enable Pakistan to effectively deal with future challenges \nemerging from the U.S. drawdown. At times, I wonder whether we are \nwithdrawing.\n  It is also a cost-effective tool, some would say, for the U.S. to \nremain engaged in the region. I know all too well that our relationship \nwith Pakistan is an uncomfortable one; I feel it, but these funds are \nsent to reimburse Pakistan for actions to protect our interests.\n  These reimbursements are made to maintain some 186 Pakistani forces \nalong 1,600 miles of border between Pakistan and Afghanistan to deter \ncross-border conflict, movement, and counterterrorism-counterinsurgency \noperations throughout the FATA, the Federally Administered Tribal \nAreas.\n  The focus of this core level is against TTP, an al Qaeda-allied \norganization that conducts regional terrorist and insurgent attacks. \nNearly 28,000 militants were killed, injured, or arrested due to these \noperations. Pakistan itself--and this doesn't get much press--has \nsuffered a lot of casualties themselves, about 5,000, while attempting \nto secure this treacherous border.\n  Continued support of the deployment of the Pakistan Armed Forces in \nFATA and other areas in the future is needed for the long-term \nstability of the area.\n  I must oppose the amendment, although I understand the passion with \nwhich the gentleman has made his argument because I think it is in our \nlong-term interest to have this relationship.\n  I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nVisclosky), my ranking member.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding and \nwould acknowledge the gentleman from Texas' legitimate concern.\n  I would associate myself with the chairman's remark, but make one \nimportant addition, and that is the chairman has been adamant that we \nbe very, very careful about our relationship with Pakistan, and the \nbill recognizes difficulties we face.\n  I would draw the Member's attention to section 9015 that prohibits \nfunds to Pakistan if the government is engaged in activities that \npresent a concern to the government of the United States.\n  I appreciate that the chairman insisted on that language. That is \nincluded in the bill.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member and the \nchairman of the committee.\n  Pakistan cannot be trusted. They lie about the reimbursements. They \nhave not met the criteria that the ranking member has talked about the \nlast 4 years, and they got the money anyway. They are playing us, Mr. \nChairman, and we pay them; and they use that money to hurt us, to hurt \nAmericans.\n  This amendment says: we are cutting the money in half because of your \nprior conduct that shows you can't be trusted.\n  That is all this amendment does.\n  I would hope Members of Congress would send a message to Pakistan: we \nare not going to pay you to hate us and pay you to kill us; we are \ngoing to cut the money off.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n

Mr. Walberg\n\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 130, beginning line 2, strike ``Provided'' and all \n     that follows through line 17.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise to offer a bipartisan amendment with Ms. Esty of Connecticut, \nMr. Cohen of Tennessee, Mr. Jones of North Carolina, and Mr. Cicilline \nof Rhode Island that works to assure the appropriate use of American \ntaxpayer dollars in Afghanistan.\n  This amendment is in keeping with the clear position of the House, as \nwe have voted numerous times in bipartisan fashion to limit funds for \nthe Afghanistan infrastructure fund, a program which has been poorly \nrun and is lacking in oversight.\n  This amendment would specifically strike the language which allows \n$50 million in funds for the Afghanistan security forces fund to be \nredirected toward the Afghanistan infrastructure fund account.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have spent billions of dollars toward rebuilding the \ninfrastructure of Afghanistan, and Congress has provided $1.3 billion \nto the Afghanistan infrastructure fund since it was created in 2011. \nHowever, funds have been slow to be spent; and, as of March 31, 2015, \nmore than 55 percent of AIF funds remain to be expended.\n  Additionally, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \nReconstruction, SIGAR, has repeatedly found that DOD has experienced \nchallenges in executing large infrastructure projects and that many \nprojects underway are behind schedule and face serious cost overruns.\n  SIGAR's audits have also found that we have inadequate sustainment \nplans and that projects lack an identifiable counterinsurgency benefit. \nSIGAR has also expressed reservations about the Afghans' ability to \neven operate and maintain these energy projects upon completion.\n  Now, it is my understanding that DOD requested this repurposing of \nfunds because the budget authority on previously authorized funds is \nabout to expire. I know we all look to our commanders in the field for \nguidance on what they need to finish the job in Afghanistan, but with \nover half of existing funds remaining to be expended, I ask: Mr. \nChairman, why should we take away from other programs and give to this \none?\n  I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H4098]]\n\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I share the gentleman's deep concern \nover the tax dollars that have been, if you would, wasted--is probably \nthe most polite term I can think of--in some of the infrastructure \ninvestment in Afghanistan and would not in any way argue that point.\n  The gentleman mentions the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \nReconstruction. He and his office have been in mine, the chairman's, \nthe committee, and there is no question that the gentleman makes a \nvery, very important point about making sure that those funds we are \nspending, despite the best of intentions, be spent carefully.\n  I would note to my colleagues that we do have within somewhat recent \ntime, the last year or so since August, a new government in place in \nAfghanistan. The administration has made a decision to maintain troop \nlevels at their current position given that change of government and, \nif you would, after all of the loss of life, the suffering, and loss of \ntreasury for the last 14 years, to give that nation one last good \nchance.\n  I rise in opposition, essentially, to do that for Afghanistan and to \ngive them that last good chance for these few remaining significant \nprojects.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, let me echo some of the sentiments \nof Mr. Visclosky about some of the concerns and some of the reports \nthat have been issued by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \nReconstruction. It should be worrisome. A hell of a lot of money has \nbeen wasted.\n  I do think there are some projects that need to be completed. One \nthat comes to mind is the Kandahar bridging solution, the plan to bring \nelectric power to Kandahar. It ends in 3 months. We need to continue \nthat investment. This was a top counterinsurgency priority. Most road \nprojects are completed. The second is the Kajaki Dam has less than a \nyear's work remaining and will supply renewable electric power to the \ngrid.\n  These are elements of stability that sometimes get lost in reports of \nempty buildings where there are no occupants and no electricity. I \nthink we need to continue to give a helping hand to the Afghan people \nbecause, if they don't have an economy, then they are not going to have \nany national security. They need a stable economy, and some of these \nprojects near completion need to be continued.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I would simply suggest, again, we have a \nnew government. I certainly think their concern for ethics, as well as \ncare in investment, is worth taking that last good chance to give them \na last good chance.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the words, the sentiments, \nthe compassion of both my colleagues; but this is an issue that we have \naddressed for quite some time. It is not new.\n  I am as concerned about our administration of the funds, our \nDepartment of Defense encouragement of Afghans to use the funds, and to \nmake sure that contractual arrangements are in place so completion will \ntake place. We have not seen that.\n  I think it is time that reality strikes home. While I understand the \nneed to encourage a new government, sometimes, the best way is tough \nlove and a clear indication that comes through finances as well.\n  I, again, encourage my colleagues to adopt my amendment, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan \nwill be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       Iraq Train and Equip Fund\n\n       For the ``Iraq Train and Equip Fund'', $715,000,000, to \n     remain available until September 30, 2017: Provided, That \n     such funds shall be available to the Secretary of Defense, in \n     coordination with the Secretary of State, pursuant to section \n     1236 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law \n     113-291; 128 Stat. 3558), to provide assistance, including \n     training, equipment, logistics support, supplies, and \n     services, stipends, infrastructure repair, renovation, and \n     sustainment to military and other security forces of or \n     associated with the Government of Iraq, including Kurdish and \n     tribal security forces or other local security forces, with a \n     national security mission, to counter the Islamic State of \n     Iraq and the Levant: Provided further, That the Secretary of \n     Defense shall ensure that prior to providing assistance to \n     elements of any forces such elements are appropriately \n     vetted, including at a minimum, assessing such elements for \n     associations with terrorist groups or groups associated with \n     the Government of Iran; and receiving commitments from such \n     elements to promote respect for human rights and the rule of \n     law: Provided further, That the Secretary of Defense may \n     accept and retain contributions, including assistance in-\n     kind, from foreign governments, including the Government of \n     Iraq, and other entities, to carry out assistance authorized \n     under this heading: Provided further, That contributions of \n     funds for the purposes provided herein from any foreign \n     government or other entities, may be credited to this Fund, \n     to remain available until expended, and used for such \n     purposes: Provided further, That not more than 25 percent of \n     the funds appropriated under this heading may be obligated or \n     expended until not fewer than 15 days after (1) the Secretary \n     of Defense submits a report to the appropriate congressional \n     committees, describing the plan for the provision of such \n     training and assistance and the forces designated to receive \n     such assistance, and (2) the President submits a report to \n     the appropriate congressional committees on how assistance \n     provided under this heading supports a larger regional \n     strategy: Provided further, That of the amount provided under \n     this heading, not more than 60 percent may be obligated or \n     expended until not less than 15 days after the date on which \n     the Secretary of Defense certifies to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that an amount equal to not less \n     than 40 percent of the amount provided under this heading has \n     been contributed by other countries and entities for the \n     purposes for which funds are provided under this heading, of \n     which at least 50 percent shall have been contributed or \n     provided by the Government of Iraq: Provided further, That \n     the limitation in the preceding proviso shall not apply if \n     the Secretary of Defense determines, in writing, that the \n     national security objectives of the United States will be \n     compromised by the application of the limitation to such \n     assistance, and notifies the appropriate congressional \n     committees not less than 15 days in advance of the exemption \n     taking effect, including a justification for the Secretary's \n     determination and a description of the assistance to be \n     exempted from the application of such limitation: Provided \n     further, That the Secretary of Defense may waive a provision \n     of law relating to the acquisition of items and support \n     services or sections 40 and 40A of the Arms Export Control \n     Act (22 U.S.C. 2780 and 2785) if the Secretary determines \n     such provisions of law would prohibit, restrict, delay or \n     otherwise limit the provision of such assistance and a notice \n     of and justification for such waiver is submitted to the \n     appropriate congressional committees: Provided further, That \n     the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' under this \n     heading means the congressional defense committees, the \n     Committees on Appropriations and Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate and the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives: Provided further, \n     That amounts made available under this heading are designated \n     by the Congress for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global \n     War on Terrorism pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Nolan\n\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 132, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced to $0)''.\n       Page 162, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $715,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to begin by taking a moment to thank Chairman \nFrelinghuysen and Ranking Member Visclosky. As one who served a long \ntime ago when everything came up under an open rule, we don't see as \nmuch of that. I can't commend both of the gentlemen\n\n[[Page H4099]]\n\nand their committees enough. I wish everybody in America could see how \nhard they have worked in their committees and here on the House floor. \nThe country should know that there are no two more highly regarded \npeople who are serving in this Chamber than our chairman and our \nranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment that will save us a lot of money \nand, quite frankly, end a sad chapter in American history. My amendment \neliminates funding for the Iraq Train and Equip Program and applies \nthat money to reducing the deficit. The administration, as we all know, \nis now urging strategic patience with Iraq. The truth is we have had a \nfailed strategy there from the very beginning. The fact is that this is \na century-old conflict. The fact is that we have no friends in this \nconflict. The history of it is clear.\n  I happened to be up in Tora Bora back in the seventies, and I learned \nthat we were funding and training and equipping the Mujahedeen to fight \nagainst the Russians under the notion that the enemy of our enemy is \nour friend. We were wrong. They morphed into al Qaeda, and they were \nthe people who bombed the World Trade Center. Then we supported Saddam \nHussein in the war against Iran. We knew he had used chemical weapons, \nbecause we had the sales receipts. We had supplied them. After that, we \ndeposed him. Then we put the Shiites in power, and the Shiites \nproceeded to tell all of the Christians and the Jews and the Catholics, \n``Get out of town, or we will kill you.'' They shut down all of the \nsynagogues and the Catholic churches. Then we decided we would have a \nSunni awakening. That was supplying arms and weapons to the Sunnis \nbecause the Shiites were persecuting them. They ultimately morphed into \nwhat we now have as ISIL. Now here we are. We find ourselves fighting \nthe Shiites in Yemen, and we are supporting the Shiites in Iraq. We are \nnot sure if we are for them or against them in Syria.\n  The simple truth is that we have been on every side of this conflict. \nWe really have no friends in this conflict. Inevitably, our goodwill, \nour good intentions have resulted in the arms and the weapons, as Judge \nPoe just said, ending up in the hands of our enemies, and they use them \nagainst us.\n  The fact is we have spent $3 trillion on this conflict. Think about \nthat--$3 trillion. For $1 trillion of that, we could have graduated \ndebt free every kid in America from college and vocational school. Just \nthink about it. We could have rebuilt our transportation and \ninfrastructure system in this country. For another $1 trillion, we \ncould have given the Americans a tax break.\n  Mr. Chairman, instead of 13 years of war, the administration now \nadmits that we have no strategy. The Secretary of Defense admits that \nthe Iraqi Army has no will to fight ISIL. When they took over Ramadi, \nall they did was growl at them, and they ran like rabbits. They left \ntheir Humvees, and they left their tanks, and they left all of their \nweapons, and we resupplied ISIL, once again, to use those weapons \nagainst us. The weapons we have supplied and the people we have trained \nhave ended up in enemy hands time and time again and have been used \nagainst us.\n  Mr. Chairman and colleagues, you know the old definition of insanity \nis repeating the same behavior, is repeating the same behavior, is \nrepeating the same behavior over and over and expecting some different \nresult. To paraphrase the old Serenity Prayer, let me say, Mr. \nPresident and colleagues: Let us change what we have the power, the \nwisdom, and the courage to do before we bankrupt this country.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, may I say that I share quite a lot \nof the gentleman's sentiments.\n  I have said on a number of occasions, when you put the Defense bill \nforward, sometimes you have to support things that the Commander in \nChief and the President want that you are highly dubious about. I have \nbeen very conflicted about this Train and Equip. At times, I think the \nenemy is doing a better job of training and equipping their own than we \nare, and, at times, it has been pretty deplorable. I want the gentleman \nto know I do support this effort. Let me just put some meat on the \nbones to, maybe, even make his point but, in reality, tell a little \ntruth about the program.\n  The Iraq Train and Equip Program provides about $715 million in both \nfunding and authority to assist military and other forces associated \nwith the Government of Iraq, including Kurdish and tribal security \nforces, with a national security mission to counter ISIL. We do know in \nthe overall mix--and the gentleman from Minnesota knows it--there are \nsome good guys over there. Of course, a lot of the good guys have been \ntaken over by the Quds Force and the Iranians to the south, but, in \nreality, we do have some good allies in the north with the Kurds, so I \nhaven't given up on all parts of Iraq.\n  I think we need to continue to support the program. Evidently, our \nPresident does as well. We are sending 400 more advisers over to, shall \nwe say, set up a new base camp in Ramadi in Anbar province to sort of \nrespond to a huge crisis there when that city was taken over. I would \nhate to abandon the people of Iraq without giving it one more try.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), my ranking member.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's motivation in offering \nthis. In a sense, the three of us are agreed given the skepticism that \nhas been expressed here today.\n  I would also add that I do believe this institution needs to have a \nresolution that defines with some specificity what our projection of \nforce should be as to the disposition of our military personnel and \nassets. Certainly, I am grievously disappointed for those countries in \nthat region in their lack of clarity and purpose. Also, in using, if \nyou would, a religious theme, I was taught that we should have hope in \nthe future, and my concern is, if we cease this training program for \nthose who want a change in government, for those who want to do the \nright thing in Syria, they will lose what shred of hope still exists.\n  Principally, for that reason, I join with the chairman in opposition \nto the gentleman's amendment, but I do appreciate the gentleman's \nmotivation.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. In reclaiming my time, I have a few other \ncomments.\n  Mr. Chairman, I said I do work on behalf of the President of the \nUnited States and our Commander in Chief, and I have to say I have \nconcerns about our continued investment in Pakistan. We debated that. \nWe have had talk about the Afghan infrastructure fund, which has been \ntroubled with projects, and this is an ongoing area which has not been \ntrouble free. Yet it is interesting that nobody from the White House, \nsince the budget was introduced, has reached out to me relative to \ndefending these programs.\n  I think the people of these countries deserve protection and support, \nbut it is interesting that we carry the water on these issues and on \nmany other issues on this committee. Do we get any reinforcements? \nActually, our entire bill has been put together for all of our military \nservices without any assistance from those military services to get us \nacross the finish line. I think it is remarkable. The standoffishness--\nthe ambivalence--about working with us, I think, is a total disgrace.\n  I have to oppose the gentleman's amendment, and he certainly knows \nmore about my sentiments publicly that I have expressed in the past.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by\n\n[[Page H4100]]\n\nthe gentleman from Minnesota will be postponed.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 135, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced to $0)''.\n       Page 162, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $600,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I would like to start tonight by saying that my mother is gravely ill \nin Florida this evening, and I can't be with her, but I want her to \nknow that I am with her right now, and I am always with her.\n  We all want to end U.S. involvement in conflicts where there is no \nlong-term strategy, no vision of success in the end, and the \ndisproportional sacrifice of our brave military forces, Mr. Chairman. \nU.S. involvement against ISIS in Syria fits this characterization. The \nadministration even admits that there is no comprehensive strategy in \nplace. Therefore, by amendment, we are proposing to defund U.S. support \nfor the Syrian rebels and move the funds to the spending reduction \naccount.\n  Last September, Congress allocated $500 million to train and arm \nSyrian rebels. This program, however, is fraught with uncertainties and \ndoubts, and the launch of the program has been less than impressive. Of \nthe 15,000 Syrian rebels we planned to train and equip over a 3-year \nperiod, so far, only about 400 have been vetted and deemed ready. \nMeanwhile, other Syrian rebels have either disappeared from the \nbattlefield or have defected to extremist factions, and ISIS has \nexpanded its ground forces, its operations, and its territories. Other \njihadist factions in Syria are also gaining strength, and the Assad \nregime continues its atrocities.\n  The civil war in Syria has now resulted in 220,000 Syrian deaths and \nin 11.5 million people--over half the population--displaced within \nSyria. The U.S. continues to provide, by far, the bulk of the military \nmight, most of it air power. It is hard to imagine defeating ISIS \nwithout substantial ground forces to combat it at this point. The \nDefense Appropriations bill includes $600 million to train and arm \nSyrian rebels as part of this needed boots-on-the-ground.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  But whatever the number of Syrian rebels we ultimately introduce into \nthe battlefield, they alone, I believe, are unlikely to turn the tide. \nNor are these rebels expected to end the Assad government, even though \nthat, too, is one of our stated goals.\n  History has shown that when we arm untested and difficult-to-vet \nrebel forces, the weapons we provide too often wind up being aimed at \nour U.S. troops. I am told that the last time our country funded a \nforeign war through vicarious fighters was the Taliban fighting against \nthe Russians in the 1970s.\n  Please join us in saying ``no'' to additional funding for these \nuntested Syrian rebels unless and until Congress receives clear answers \nto the following questions: Where is the accounting for the first $500 \nmillion? I don't have it. Why isn't the second $600 million, if \nappropriate, funded by other folks in the coalition? What is the \nobjective? What does success look like in the Syrian civil war? Does \nvictory require the end of the Assad government? What is the \ncomprehensive strategy for defeating ISIS in Iraq and beyond?\n  In our view, without the answers to these questions, it makes no \nsense to proceed. It is our job to review and assess. I ask that \ndefunding of the Syrian train and equip fund be accomplished by this \namendment to H.R. 2685.\n  I acknowledge my deep admiration for the chairman and ranking member \nand what they have accomplished in this bill and acknowledge so many \ngood things in the bill, but it is hard for me to accept this war that \nis going nowhere.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I am glad to join my colleague. I have \nenormous respect for the chairman and the ranking member's good and \nnoble intentions, but, again, the fact is we have no friends in these \nconflicts. The weapons that we send inevitably are being used against \nus. I was here during the Vietnam war conflict, and the arguments that \nwe hear today for continuing this involvement is to somehow make \nsomething good out of what hasn't been quite so good, and we finally \nended that conflict by cutting off the funds for it. That is how we are \ngoing to end our wars of choice in the Middle East, wars of choice that \nare bankrupting this country and costly in blood and treasury.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am sure, on behalf of everybody on \nthe floor, we extend to Mr. Clawson our sympathy and hope that his \nmother will recover. I am sure if she has the ability to be watching \nthe television tonight, she is already very proud of his courageous \nremarks on the floor.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Heartfelt. Thanks.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, while I appreciate the sentiment of \nthe amendment, this is a complicated issue--that is an understatement--\nwith multifaceted policy ramifications that really can't be fully \ndebated in 5 or 10 minutes. The situation in Syria remains highly \ncomplicated and complex and poses imminent threats to the United States \nand allied interests, particularly Israel, Jordan, and Iraq.\n  Recognizing congressional concerns regarding potential U.S. military \ninvolvement in Syria, our bill appropriates funds in the GWOT account, \nthe title IX that I talked about several hours ago to train and equip \nSyrians. It also further prohibits the introduction\n\n[[Page H4101]]\n\nof U.S. military forces into hostilities in Syria except in accordance \nwith the War Powers Act.\n  However, this amendment, in my judgment, goes too far, for it \nattempts to tie the U.S. Government's hands in navigating the \ncomplicated situation we--or, more importantly, our allies Israel and \nJordan--face related to threats emanating from ISIL in Iraq and Syria \nevery day. We have to be realistic. There are many countries, including \nour allies, as well as other groups already involved in Syria.\n  This amendment would do nothing to stop the arming of the Syrian \nopposition. What this amendment would do is remove the possibility of \nthe U.S. engaging under any circumstances, even if such engagement \nwould be in the best interests of the United States or allies. Even at \nthis rate, the U.S. is paying just a portion of the costs.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking \nmember, for any comments he may wish to make.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also want to \nexpress my best wishes for the gentleman's mother. It is hard to oppose \na gentleman who went to Purdue University. I know he is a very smart \nindividual. I have my other colleague here from Minnesota.\n  I have spoken to our colleagues on the previous amendment. I think \npeople understand my position. I simply would add my voice to the \nchairman and emphasize, this is a very tough problem, and we ought to \nmaintain as large a degree of flexibility as we can.\n  I appreciate the chairman's remarks and associate myself with them.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, but I \ncertainly understand the sentiments behind it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike subsection (b) of section 9015.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This amendment is very simple. It makes it so the Secretary of \nDefense cannot waive the conditions that are in the bill on giving \nmoney to Pakistan.\n  Since 2010, Congress has put conditions on our aid to Pakistan \nbecause Pakistan, frankly, can't be trusted. In 2011, Pakistan tipped \noff terrorists who had IED factories that the U.S. Government knew \nwhere they were. Pakistan tipped off the Haqqani network before the \nPakistan military went to the tribal areas last year.\n  We didn't tell Pakistan before we launched the raid that killed Osama \nbin Laden because, according to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, ``We \njust can't trust them.''\n  This bill puts seven conditions on our aid to Pakistan. They are good \nconditions. Earlier this evening, about an hour ago, the ranking member \nmentioned these conditions for aid to Pakistan. They are commonsense \nthings like, if Pakistan wants our money, it shouldn't support \nterrorist activity against the United States--imagine that--or the \nPakistan Government should dismantle the IED factories run by \nterrorists in Pakistan. These IED factories have killed many of our \ntroops.\n  Here is the problem. Each year, we put conditions on our aid. The \nbill also gives the Secretary of Defense the authority to give the \nmoney to Pakistan even if Pakistan doesn't meet those conditions, and \nthis year is no exception. Once again, in this bill, we give the \nSecretary of Defense the authority to waive the conditions Congress \nputs in the bill.\n  Four of the last 5 years, Pakistan has failed to meet the conditions \nCongress has imposed on this type of legislation, and then the \nSecretary of Defense went ahead and gave the waiver, thus giving the \nmoney to Pakistan anyway.\n  The administration has never not given Pakistan money because it \nfailed to meet our conditions--conditions set by Congress--normal, \ncommonsense conditions like: you don't get this money unless you meet \nthese conditions.\n  This amendment does one simple thing. It says: you meet the \nconditions, or you get no money from the United States; you don't give \nmoney to terrorists, or you get no money from the United States.\n  It does not allow the Secretary of Defense to waive Congress' \nconditions and give the money anyway.\n  That is what this legislation does. I would ask that the House \nsupport this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe gentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment. This \namendment would strike, as he said, the waiver that is used by the \nSecretary of Defense and also the Secretary of State. I think it would \naffect our national security.\n  We need the cooperation of the Pakistanis. If we don't have any, we \nlose insight into the actions of those who would do our country harm.\n  I oppose this amendment as potentially damaging to our national \nsecurity, and I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), \nthe ranking member.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I thank the chair for yielding, and I associate myself \nwith his remarks.\n  Again, I am not unsympathetic to the position the gentleman has \nraised, but I do not think we are in a very difficult relationship, \nthat we restrain our flexibility to meet the moment.\n  For that reason, I join the chairman in his opposition to the \namendment.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank both the ranking member and the chairman \nfor their comments and their work on this legislation.\n  My amendment says, to quote the chairman earlier, ``We mean what we \nsay.'' We say as a Congress that, if we are going to give American \nmoney to Pakistan to help us, they can't do certain things with that \nmoney. They can't support terrorism. They can't allow IEDs to be built \nthat are used to kill Americans. These conditions are commonsense, good \nideas.\n  In the past, we have done this before. If we mean what we say, then \nwe should require these conditions before we give Pakistan American \nmoney; but the law has allowed that Secretary of Defense to waive \nCongress' conditions and give them our money anyway.\n  Pakistan has proven they didn't meet the conditions in 4 years of the \nlast 5. They got the money anyway because the Secretary waived the rule \nof law or waived our conditions.\n  This bill does something very simple. It says: Congress says there \nare certain rules to get American money; you follow the rules, or you \ndon't get the money. Nobody can waive the condition and give you a pass \nand give you American money anyway.\n  I would ask that this amendment be adopted, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n Vacating Demand for Recorded Vote on Amendment Offered by Mr. Rothfus\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I commend Chairman Frelinghuysen for the \nwork that he has done on this.\n  I understand that I had an amendment earlier today. There had been \nongoing discussions about that amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my request for a \nrecorded vote on my amendment to the end that the amendment stands \ndisposed of by the voice vote thereon.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the request for a recorded vote \nis withdrawn. Accordingly, the noes have it and the amendment is not \nadopted.\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       Sec. 9016.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I have an amendment regarding the KC-10 air-to-air refueling tanker.\n  Air superiority is critical if we are going to protect our men and \nwomen on the ground and our interests, and that requires that we have \nfighters in the air. It is of vital importance. It is why the Air \nMobility Command is so important. It may not be as exciting as fighters \nand close air support, but it is every bit as essential. The KC-10 air-\nto-air refueler is the larger, newer of the tankers, and the KC-135 is \nthe smaller, older version.\n  This is the problem. The KC-46 is a new tanker that the Air Force is \nintroducing. It has had development problems, and it is not ready for \nprime time. General Welch of the Air Force confirmed that the new \ntanker was not intended to replace the KC-10 but that it is at risk of \nbeing replaced due to budget cuts, and he has confirmed that it would \ncost more in the midterm to replace the KC-10.\n  Just to put the difference in capabilities in perspective, the KC-10 \ncan carry 350,000 pounds of fuel. The other tanker--the older KC-135--\nand the new KC-46 can only carry 200,000. It is 200,000 versus 350,000. \nThe KC-10 carries double the payload, and it carries more passengers. \nThe long and the short is that this tanker is essential for our ability \nto project force, and in this world of increased global threats, we \ncannot afford to deteriorate our capabilities.\n  The answer, I believe, is to prohibit the early retirement of the KC-\n10 tanker. We did that in the National Defense Authorization Act. There \nis no provision in the budget to replace the KC-10. I am simply looking \nto close the loop tonight and prohibit in the Defense Appropriations \nbill any funding for the early retirement of the KC-10.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Let me congratulate the gentleman from New Jersey, \nmy colleague, for his advocacy on behalf of the KC-10.\n  Mr. Chairman, none of the good work we have done in the Middle East \ncould have been done without the remarkable history of the men and \nwomen who work on those KC-10s and these tankers, allowing so many \nflights to go without any problems, any issues. That is a remarkable \nplane. I support the gentleman's amendment, and I congratulate him for \nintroducing it.\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman and my colleagues from New Jersey, I stand \nin support of this amendment, and I appreciate the fact that \nCongressman MacArthur has kept in the forefront how important this is, \nnot just for New Jersey but for our Nation as a whole.\n  We are strategically located in that one area that makes it extremely \nefficient to refuel. More importantly, we have two ways of getting the \nfuel to those planes, which is so strategically important. It is over \nland and it is underground. That has been why McGuire-Fort Dix has been \nthe place for this command to be joined together for years and years. I \nthink this is not only strategically smart for our country, but this is \nan efficient way of spending the taxpayers' money to make sure that we \nget the best bang for the buck.\n  Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Schiff\n\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used after March 31, 2016, for Operation Inherent Resolve \n     in the absence of a law enacted by Congress before such date \n     that specifically authorizes the use of military force \n     against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman\n\n[[Page H4114]]\n\nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, 10 months ago, we entered into the war \nagainst ISIS. During the course of that war, we have put our pilots and \nother servicemembers at considerable risk, and we have suffered \ncasualties. We have expended hundreds of millions, if not billions, of \ndollars, and, as yet, there is no end in sight to this conflict.\n  In the beginning of the conflict and our participation in it, the \nadministration took the position that it didn't need an authorization \nfrom Congress although it desired one. The administration relied on the \nauthorities that were passed in 2001 and 2002. The authority in 2001, \npassed in the hours after 9/11, authorized the use of force against \nthose responsible for 9/11. That is al Qaeda. He also relied on the \nauthorization passed in 2002, which authorized the use of force against \nIraq. In fact, neither of those authorities is on point. The use of \nforce that we are employing now against ISIL is being used against an \norganization that didn't exist on 9/11 and, in fact, is often at war \nwith the organization that was responsible for 9/11. That is al Qaeda.\n  Nonetheless, the administration has asserted that it can rely on \nthese authorities, and it asked Congress to pass a new authorization \nbecause it felt that was the preferential course. At the time and \nbefore the midterm elections, the leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives took the position that a lame duck Congress should not \nbe voting on a new war and that a vote must wait until after the \nelections. So the Congress abdicated its constitutional responsibility \nto have a debate and a war declaration, and, instead, we awaited the \nelections.\n  The elections came and the elections went, and those of us who raised \nthe cry that it was time for Congress to do its job were met with a new \nresponse: we couldn't vote on an authorization now because the \nadministration had not sent us one, even though there is nothing in the \nConstitution that provides that Congress shall declare war only when \nasked by the Executive or only when asked politely by the Executive. \nNonetheless, we sat, once again, derelict until the administration sent \nus a draft authorization.\n\n                              {time}  2300\n\n  Then there was a new explanation for inaction. We couldn't act on \nthis new authorization because we didn't like the terms of it. This was \nirrespective of the fact that the Congress has all the power it needs \nto change that draft or operate under a completely new draft \nauthorization, and still we did nothing.\n  Then the explanation was given we couldn't act on a war authorization \nbecause we had to have a vote on the negotiations with Iran, even \nthough those negotiations were not yet complete. So we had a vote on \nthe negotiations with Iran, in fact, a vote to later have a vote.\n  Now we are here once again with a series of shifting rationales for \nwhy we don't have a debate on this war ongoing now for 10 months. This \nmust come to an end. The amendment that I have offered this evening \nwould provide that no funds shall be expended for the war against ISIS \nafter a certain date in March of next year unless Congress authorizes a \nwar against ISIS. If this is worth fighting--and I believe it is; I \nbelieve this ought to be authorized--it is worth having Congress do its \njob. If we are going to ask our servicemembers to risk their lives, we \nought to have the courage ourselves to make a vote on this war.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, currently, U.S. forces are \nconducting multiple airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. Without \nthis authority, these campaigns would stop immediately.\n  Should this Authorization for Use of Military Force be replaced? \nPerhaps it should. On May 19, Speaker Boehner urged President Obama to \nstart from scratch on a measure to legally authorize the Islamic State \nconflict, declaring, ``We don't have a strategy.'' I agree with the \nSpeaker, we have no strategy with regard to ISIL.\n  Recently, President Obama stated he still does not have a complete \nstrategy for defeating the Islamic State. A sad commentary--shifting \nrationale, shifting strategy, no strategy. At a time when sectarian \ntensions are at their highest levels since the end of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom in December of 2001, the terrorists have once again succeeded \nin capturing control of major cities in Iraq, killing innocent \ncitizens, causing thousands of families to flee.\n  What kind of message are we sending with this amendment to both the \nIraqi people, to our soldiers and marines who have valiantly served and \nsacrificed, and even now the President suggesting sending another 400 \nadvisers to advise and to train and equip Iraqis to recapture Ramadi?\n  This amendment is not about substance; it is about symbolism. \nUnfortunately, its effect would be much more than symbolism. Acceptance \nof this amendment would rob our Nation of one of the key authorities \nour Commander-in-Chief relies on to keep us safe. I strongly urge \nrejection of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. May I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nVisclosky), my colleague.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, if I could make a comment. As the \nchairman indicated, this is a very complicated situation. Because lives \nare at stake, it is all the more reason, I think, to support the \ngentleman's amendment to force this body, if you would, to very \ncarefully define what our purpose is, what our policy is, and how we \nshould go about its implementation. I do support the gentleman's \namendment and thank him for yielding time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman and would like to respond to my \ncolleague's points.\n  First of all, the effect of this is not to end funding immediately. \nThe effect of this would end funding in 9 months if we fail to take up \nand pass an authorization. Certainly, 10 months into the war and 9 \nmonths from now ought to be ample time for the Congress to do its \nconstitutional duty.\n  Second, my colleague makes the point that he doesn't agree with the \nPresident's strategy. We may take issue with the President's strategy, \nand we all have our opinions about how this war ought to be waged, but \none thing is clear: it is not going to impact the strategy if Congress \ndoes its job or not. That impacts our institution; that doesn't impact \nthe Presidency. It is our institutional interest in having a voice in \nthe war-making authority that is at stake here.\n  Finally, the gentleman asked: What kind of a message are we sending \nwith an amendment like this? I would say the message we are sending is \nthat we value our Constitution; we respect the requirements of our \nConstitution. Our Constitution says that Congress--not the Executive, \nbut Congress--shall have the power to declare war.\n  My colleague says this is merely a symbolic act. I suppose that is \ntrue if you think that the constitutional clause that gives the \nCongress the power to declare war is only symbolic, but I think it is \nfar more than symbolic and key to the balance of power.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    amendment offered by mr. walberg\n\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 10003.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used to promulgate Directive 293, issued December 16, \n     2010, by\n\n[[Page H4115]]\n\n     the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment that \nwould reiterate Congress' objection to a proposed policy change by the \nDepartment of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, \nOFCCP, that would treat healthcare providers as Federal contractors.\n  In December of 2010, OFCCP quietly issued directive 293, asserting \nthat contractual arrangements under Medicare, TRICARE, and the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program will trigger OFCCP jurisdiction. This \nis absurd. This directive would reclassify a majority of hospitals in \nthe United States as Federal contractors, subjecting hospitals in your \ndistrict and mine to OFCCP's often crushing regulatory burden.\n  With respect to TRICARE, the agency aggressively asserted its \njurisdiction in a 2009 administrative case, OFCCP v. Florida Hospital \nof Orlando. OFCCP argued the hospital was a Federal subcontractor by \nvirtue of its participation as a provider of a TRICARE network of \nproviders. The agency took this troubling position despite the fact \nthat the Department of Defense, which regulates TRICARE, previously \nconcluded, Mr. Chairman: ``It would be impossible to achieve the \nTRICARE mission of providing affordable health care for our Nation's \nActive Duty and retired military members and their families if onerous \nFederal contracting rules were applied to the more than 500,000 TRICARE \nproviders in the United States.''\n  Unfortunately, the administrative law judge in the case did not heed \nDOD's warning and failed to see this policy change for what it is--an \nexpansion of government power over the healthcare sector. As such, \nCongress acted to oppose this outreach, and in 2012 the National \nDefense Authorization Act clarified that a TRICARE network healthcare \nprovider is not--is not--a Federal contractor or subcontractor.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, I am deeply \nconcerned by this attempt by OFCCP to expand its jurisdiction through \nexecutive fiat. In response, I introduced the Protecting Health Care \nProviders from Increased Administrative Burdens Act in the 113th \nCongress, which clarified that healthcare providers are not Federal \ncontractors subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor's \nOFCCP.\n  Our actions on the committee in bringing attention to this issue have \nbeen successful in prompting OFCCP to place a moratorium on the policy. \nHowever, as OFCCP has previously defied Congress and the Department of \nDefense, I believe this amendment is necessary. Therefore, I ask the \nHouse support my amendment that would prohibit funds to be used under \nthis act for implementing this overreaching policy and affirmatively \nshow the House will not support such actions by the Department of Labor \nand OFCCP.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan for a \ncolloquy.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. I thank the ranking member for yielding.\n  As you know, TRICARE provides coverage to over 9.5 million people \nworldwide, including Active Duty, activated Guard and Reserve members, \nretiree survivors, and their families. To ensure coverage, they must \nchoose between independently practicing TRICARE certified medical \nhealth counselors and/or supervised mental health counselors.\n  I entered my amendment and withdrew it, but it is important that we \nget this on the Record.\n  The independent providers must have a master's degree from a mental \nhealth counseling program accredited by the Council for Accreditation \nof Counseling and Related Educational Programs, which we call CACREP. \nThey must also pass the National Clinical Mental Health Counseling Exam \nby January 1, 2017.\n  But this rule unfortunately has unintended consequences that require \ncounselors to complete their education at an institution that only has \nbeen accredited by CACREP. This freezes out some of our most respected \ninstitutions, including Harvard, Columbia, and, in my home State of \nMichigan, the University of Michigan and Michigan State University.\n  I am extremely concerned about and would ask for the committee's \nsupport in addressing this issue. With more time, we can get this \nright, ensure our military members have as much access to care as \npossible.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Michigan \nfor bringing this issue to the committee's attention. I look forward to \nworking with her on it to address the unintended consequences of the \nexisting DOD rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Huizenga of Michigan\n\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 10003.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used by the Defense Logistics Agency to implement the \n     Small Business Administration interim final rule titled \n     ``Small Business Size Standards; Adoption of 2012 North \n     American Industry Classification System'' (published August \n     20, 2012, in the Federal Register) with respect to the \n     procurement of footwear.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise today to offer this amendment that will ensure a fair and open \nbidding process to supply our men and women on the front lines with one \nof the most indispensable pieces of equipment that they use every day--\ntheir boots.\n  My amendment would prohibit the use of funds by the Defense Logistics \nAgency to implement the 2012 Small Business Administration's rule in \nregard to footwear preventing the Defense Logistics Agency from bidding \nthe contract as a small business set-aside.\n  When SBA released this rule, there was significant concern that they \ndid not go through the normal rulemaking and public comment process, \nand more specifically did not perform due diligence on how the changes \nwould actually affect the footwear industry and military supply base, \nwhich the SBA has acknowledged.\n  This rule dramatically changed the competitive landscape amongst \ncompanies supplying very compliant footwear to the U.S. military. There \nare very few of these manufacturers here in the United States, and even \nfewer that manufacture Berry Compliant footwear. This amendment would \nensure that all businesses capable of supplying high-quality footwear \nto our warfighters are able to compete for that contract.\n\n                              {time}  2315\n\n  I might add, Mr. Chairman, that last year, we had been able to get \nlanguage inserted in that would call for a study. I just wanted to have \na quick quote from that on the impact of jobs. This is from the report \nthat was issued:\n\n       Although the overall impact on the industrial base is low, \n     the abrupt and drastic change in the small business size \n     standards is likely to have an impact. The DOD footwear \n     industry is highly capable, but also very dependent on DOD \n     orders. It's important to consider both the short-term and \n     long-term health of the industrial base.\n       The industry is also a critical element to the Nation's \n     national security because of the enduring need to meet \n     wartime footwear requirements.\n\n  The emphasis here is mine. Given the industry's sensitive and \ncritical position, such abrupt and drastic policy changes that impact \nthe competitive landscape should be executed with greater moderation.\n\n[[Page H4116]]\n\n  I think, Mr. Chairman, that is the concern here today, and that is \nwhy I would urge my colleagues to support this vital amendment.\n  I do appreciate the opportunity for dialogue that I have been having \nwith my colleague from Illinois and also with the Small Business \nCommittee on that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOST. Mr. Chairman, as you may know, the reason I stand in \nopposition is the Small Business Administration sets these standards. \nAs of 2012, this standard was set in place.\n  Though I am more than willing to work with the gentleman in the \nfuture on what might come forward actually through the Small Business \nCommittee, the concern I have is that those that do qualify under small \nbusiness inadvertently, through his language, would be removed from \nthat.\n  The concern I have also is that is located in my district, with a \ncompany that has already received a contract under that.\n  It is a process that we have in place. We know that there may be \nflaws in the process, and in the Small Business Committee, we are going \nto be working on those. I believe that the gentleman has sincere hopes \nto try to straighten this problem out for his district. I understand \nthat.\n  I believe that this is not the way to do this. I stand in opposition. \nI hope that others will join me in voting ``no'' on this, but I do give \nthe commitment that, if a ``no'' vote does occur, I will be working \nwith him.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. BOST. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I simply \nwould add my voice to his in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.\n  It is certainly my belief and understanding that the Defense \nLogistics Agency is executing an acquisition program that maximizes to \nevery extent possible long-term contracts and multiple award strategies \nthat limit variability to limit each vendor's economic risk.\n  The gentleman mentions small manufacturers. Some of the largest \ncompanies in the country are involved at the Department of Defense, \nwhich is fine. They do wonderful work for our country. We ought to make \nsure that we protect the prerogatives of small businesses to make sure \nthat they are on equal footing for these contracts so that you have \nthat limit on economic risk for all vendors, big and small.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's objection, and I would join him in it.\n  Mr. BOST. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I do appreciate \nmy colleague from Illinois and other members from the Small Business \nCommittee who are committed to working at this.\n  The concern, again, would be one of our capacity and our industrial \nbase and being able to supply that most vital of needs for our men and \nwomen in uniform, which is their footwear. When we talk about large, we \ntalk about small at the same time because 400 is the number of west \nMichigan jobs that are in the balance here; but we wouldn't be able to \nreach the full capacity if we needed to surge again in a very unstable \nworld, as we have been dealing with a number of crises around the \nworld.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment Offered by Ms. Lee\n\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be obligated or expended pursuant to the Authorization for \n     Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 \n     note) after December 31, 2015.\n\n  Ms. LEE (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to \ndispense with the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is really very simple. It is \ncosponsored by Representatives Grijalva and Ellison. It prohibits any \nfunding in this bill pursuant to the 2001 Authorization for the Use of \nMilitary Force after December 31, 2015.\n  This timeline gives the President and the Congress sufficient time--\nthat is 8 months after this is signed into law--to determine what if \nany authorization would be needed to replace the 2001 AUMF.\n  This amendment is not only timely, but it really is necessary. On \nSeptember 14, 2001, I could not vote for the 2001 AUMF. That was an \nauthorization that I knew would provide a blank check to wage war any \ntime, for any length, anywhere.\n  In the last 14 years, it has become increasingly clear that this \nauthorization has essentially provided the President--this is any \nPresident--President Bush, now President Obama--the authority to wage \nwar against anyone, anywhere, at any time, against any country, with no \nauthorization from Congress.\n  In fact, the Congressional Research Service has found that the 2001 \nAUMF has been used more than 30 times to justify military action and \nother activities, including warrantless surveillance and wiretapping, \nindefinite detention practices at GTMO, targeted killing operations \nusing lethal drones, and the open-ended expansion of military \noperations abroad, which have nothing to do with the original \ncongressional intent.\n  In addition to the activities I mentioned, the AUMF has reportedly \nbeen invoked to deploy troops in Afghanistan, Yemen, Djibouti, Kenya, \nEthiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. The 2001 AUMF is now being cited as the \nauthority for the now 10-month-long war against ISIL--and, yes, we are \nin a war.\n  We know that ISIL must be degraded and dismantled, but Congress must \ndo our job. We should debate and vote on the use of force. That is our \nconstitutional responsibility.\n  I know that, while many of us may not share a common position on how \nto deal with the 2001 authorization, many of us do agree that the \noverly broad authority is a major and concerning deterioration of \ncongressional oversight and warmaking authority.\n  I think many of us can agree that a robust debate and vote is \nnecessary, long overdue, and must take place, whatever we believe about \nhow we should vote. The American people deserve to have their \nRepresentatives speak for them on these grave matters which the \nConstitution requires.\n  Let me be clear. With the 2001 authorization still on the books in \nits current form, any administration can continue to rely on this blank \ncheck to wage endless war. That is why my amendment to prohibit funding \nfor the 2001 AUMF after December 31, 2015, is so important.\n  There was very little debate. I remember that very moment that we had \nthis debate on this resolution 12 years ago. I think the debate maybe \nwas about 1 hour--pro and con, 30 minutes. I probably was the only one \nwho voted and said ``no'' in terms of the debate, but it wasn't a very \nlong debate, and I am sure, if we had had more time to debate this, \nmore Members would have realized that this was a blank check.\n  Let's repeal this. I have introduced this legislation once again to \nget this off the books. Congress cannot continue to abdicate its \nconstitutional responsibility while the United States now is embroiled \nin yet another open-ended war in the Middle East.\n  We can begin to address this today by passing this amendment, \nproviding Congress and the President with plenty of time to decide what \nmeasures should replace this authorization before the end of the year.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), our ranking \nmember, and thank him for his leadership.\n\n[[Page H4117]]\n\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I join in \nsupport of her amendment.\n  As she indicated, more than 14 years have passed. The United States \nwithdrew their large troop presence and marked the end of combat \noperations in Iraq since then. Security operations for Afghanistan were \ntransferred to the Afghan National Security Forces in June of 2013. The \nbasic mission of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan has been to train \nthose forces, including the Afghan Army.\n  I think the gentlewoman made a very good point. She and I may not \nagree on what that resolution and authority should look like in the \nend, all the more reason for all of us collectively, both parties, to \nhave a fulsome debate on that issue.\n  Ms. LEE. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  In order to prosecute the global war on terrorism, one of our primary \ncurrent missions, the President, our Commander in Chief, relies on this \nAuthorization for the Use of Military Force, which he is trying and \nattempting to repeal.\n  This AUMF, better known as the 9/11 AUMF, is necessary for the \nDepartment of Defense and U.S. military forces to address conducting \ncampaigns against al Qaeda and al Qaeda-related affiliated forces \nworldwide by using this authority. It has been used by both this \nPresident and his predecessor since 2001.\n  Granted, this amendment was written to sunset on the last day of this \ncalendar year, but without a follow-on authority in place, killing the \n9/11 AUMF would tie our Nation's hands and our Commander in Chief's \nhands with regard to combating worldwide terrorism in 7 short months.\n  This amendment cripples our ability to conduct counterterrorism \noperations with partner nations and our allies against al Qaeda and \ntheir affiliates.\n  Once again, the gentlewoman attempts to put in place a major policy \nchange that does not belong in an appropriations bill, this Defense \nbill.\n  The terrorist threat today is no less real and, in many ways, far \nmore dangerous than it was when Congress overwhelmingly gave the \nPresident that authority in 2001 to protect us against those who want \nto do us harm.\n  These terrorist organizations pose a real threat to United States \npersons and interests. It is my judgment this amendment erroneously \nassumes that al Qaeda and its affiliates ended their terrorist acts \nonce major military operations ceased in Afghanistan. Obviously, they \nhaven't.\n  Recent disastrous events in Yemen and, most recently, frightening \ndevelopments in Iraq and Syria have shown its affiliates and new \nterrorist groups are on the rise.\n  This amendment would effectively eliminate the President's ability to \naddress that threat or other emerging threats from al Qaeda and like-\nminded groups in north Africa, the Horn of Africa, and elsewhere and \nleave our Nation and our allies more vulnerable to attacks.\n  Therefore, I strongly urge opposition to this amendment, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  2330\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now \nrise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nWoodall) having assumed the chair, Mr. Mooney of West Virginia, Acting \nChair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, \nreported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill \n(H.R. 2685) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes, had come \nto no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/house-section/article/H4117-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1295, TRADE PREFERENCES EXTENSION \n                              ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to divest, retire, transfer, or place in storage or \n     on backup aircraft inventory status, or prepare to divest, \n     retire, transfer, or place in storage or on backup aircraft \n     inventory status, any EC-130H aircraft.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for including \nfunds to support our fleet of EC-130H Compass Call aircraft in this \nbill. The underlying legislation restores $27.3 million to support 15 \nEC-130H aircraft next year.\n  My amendment today does not cost a dime. The chairman has already \nprovided full funding for our entire EC-130H fleet, and my amendment \nsimply ensures that the chairman's intentions are carried out, and that \nthe Air Force does not use backdoor means to try to retire these \nimportant aircraft.\n  The Compass Call is the only dedicated U.S. Air Force electronic \nwarfare\n\n[[Page H4118]]\n\naircraft. I can tell you in this unclassified setting that it can \nperform electronic warfare, suppression of enemy air defenses, and \noffensive counterinformation operations.\n  It was successfully employed during Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom, \nEnduring Freedom, and provided electronic warfare support in operations \nin Kosovo, in Haiti, Panama, Serbia, and Afghanistan. It was the most \nheavily-tasked special mission C-130 in operations in Afghanistan.\n  Despite plans to divest 50 percent of the fleet, the Air Force has \nnot identified a follow-on capability, and no other platform currently \nperforms this mission. In fact, Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff \nLieutenant General James Holmes confirmed there are things that only \nthe EC-130H does and does best.\n  Right now, the Compass Call is currently deployed both in Afghanistan \nand in the fight against ISIS. Divesting it without a replacement for \nthe unique capabilities it offers would be irresponsible, especially \ngiven its high rate of deployment.\n  I restate that my amendment would not cost a dime, simply ensures the \nchairman's decision to fund the fleet is carried out. This is a \ncritical capability, and we cannot afford to dispose it without a \nreplacement.\n  I want to thank the chair, and urge support of my amendment.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. McSALLY. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. We are pleased to accept your amendment. May I \nalso say, we are proud of your service to our Nation. Thank you for the \ntime.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                      Amendment Offered by Ms. Lee\n\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be obligated or expended pursuant to the Authorization for \n     Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public \n     Law 107-243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note).\n\n  Ms. LEE (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading be dispensed with.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit funding pursuant \nto the 2002 Iraq Authorization for Use of Military Force. And once \nagain I am proud to offer this amendment with my colleagues, \nRepresentative Ellison and Grijalva.\n  Now, why is this amendment necessary?\n  Three years ago, mind you, President Obama declared that the Iraq war \nwas over. Since then, the President has stated a number of times that \nthe 2002 AUMF is no longer necessary, and that Congress should work to \nrepeal it. Yet, Congress has allowed this war authorization to remain \non the books indefinitely.\n  Now, we all are familiar with the report, and we know what is taking \nplace in Iraq, Syria, and across the Middle East as it relates to ISIL. \nWe all agree that they must be degraded and dismantled.\n  But just as with the 2001 resolution, the 2002 AUMF is completely \ninappropriate to deal with this threat.\n  This is a new war, Mr. Chairman, not an old war. This is a new war, \nwhich the people of this country have a right to have their Members of \nCongress debate and vote on.\n  Even the President included a repeal of the 2002 AUMF in the proposed \nauthorization he sent to Congress in February. Yet, we can't even get \nthat authorization brought up for a debate and a vote.\n  So, simply put, the 2002 authorization is no longer necessary. We \nneed to come back to the drawing board and decide, based on what this \nbody wants to do, should we vote for a new authorization or not.\n  If we want to commit the United States to another war in Iraq, then \nCongress must have that debate and decide whether or not to authorize \nanother war.\n  I am pleased that my sense of Congress resolution--it was an \namendment actually--affirming this was passed on a bipartisan basis in \ncommittee and is included in this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is common sense, and we cannot continue \nto leave authorizations for the use of military force on the books \nindefinitely. It is time for us to reassert our constitutional \nprerogative to declare war or not, to debate and vote on any military \naction in Iraq.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. LEE. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I will just reiterate my comments in the gentlewoman's \nlast amendment and that is, after the passage of 13 years, things have \nchanged. And one of the changes we ought to make in this Chamber is to \nhave, again, that fulsome debate as to what the parameters of our \nmilitary involvement overseas is going forward from this point in time, \nnot the beginning of the previous decade. I appreciate the gentlewoman \noffering the amendment.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me just say with regard to this amendment, \nCongress has a constitutional responsibility. It is our prerogative to \ndeclare war or not. It is our prerogative to debate and vote on any \nmilitary action anywhere in the world. More than a prerogative, it is \nour constitutional responsibility.\n  We represent the American people. The American people deserve to have \na voice in such grave matters. That is why the Constitution required \nthat. And for us not to do our job and to continue to rely on old \nauthorizations from 13 and 14 years ago really is an abdication of our \nresponsibility.\n  People did not elect us to Congress to duck and dodge the hard \nquestions and the hard issues. Some of us agree that we need to go to \nwar. Some of us don't agree. But that is not the issue, and that is not \nwhat this amendment, nor my prior amendment, was about.\n  It was about doing our job here, laying out the pros and cons, making \nsome heavy-duty decisions--and that is what they are, but that is why \nwe are here--and then instructing our Commander in Chief what Congress \nbelieves should be the appropriate course of action.\n  Many would vote for it; many would vote against it, but, again, not \nto have this debate and vote when we are now 10 months into another war \nis downright wrong. It is almost lawless. It is something that it is \nhard to imagine getting away with this long.\n  So I hope that we get a good bipartisan vote on this. It is about \ntime that we do debate this again. If the Speaker did not like the \nPresident's authorization that he brought forward, then let's get \nanother authorization. Let's write one ourselves. I have one. I know \nother Members have one. Let's bring forth an authorization and debate \nwhat we want to do moving forward. That is the wise thing to do. That \nis the smart thing to\n\n[[Page H4119]]\n\ndo. That is the right thing to do. We have troops in harm's way. They \nneed to know what their Members of Congress believe, what the \nConstitution requires in terms of doing our job. They deserve us to do \nbetter.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, as I said a few minutes ago, \ncurrently U.S. forces are conducting multiple airstrikes against ISIL \nin Iraq and Syria. Without this authority, those campaigns would stop. \nAnd certainly, much has happened since the authority was first given. \nAs a matter of fact, things are getting far worse than they have been \nin the past.\n  Acceptance of this amendment would rob our country of one of the key \nauthorities our Commander in Chief needs and relies on to keep us safe \nand to address these types of crises, which seem to occur all over the \nMiddle East. Therefore, I strongly reject and oppose the amendment and \nurge others to do likewise.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Hunter\n\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of section 2483(b)(5) of title 10, \n     United States Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, first, I want to thank the chairman from \nNew Jersey and just thank him for the wonderful job he has done \nprotecting our troops and our people around world and making sure that \nthe world remains a safer place than it would be otherwise without the \nUnited States there.\n\n                              {time}  2345\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment that would prohibit the Department \nof Defense from increasing the prices paid by our troops and their \nfamilies, our veterans and their families at military commissaries, \nespecially overseas.\n  The commissary benefit is one of a number of benefits that our \nservicemembers receive upon joining the military, and it is one that \nour servicemembers and their families rely upon to maintain their \naccess to wholesome, affordable, and healthy food.\n  The Defense Commissary Agency, or DeCA, has embarked upon a poorly \nresearched plan to raise prices on commissary consumers as part of a \nmove towards what they call a ``commercial'' business model.\n  This amendment requires the Department of Defense to continue using \nthe existing model of produce sourcing for commissaries in Asia and the \nPacific unless and until the Secretary of Defense can certify that a \nnew sourcing model will not raise prices on the shelves. This maintains \nthe promised benefits that our warriors and their families expected to \nreceive when they raised their right hand and became a United States \nsailor, airman, soldier, or marine.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Sablan\n\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to establish any live-fire range, training course, or \n     maneuver area within the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands in contravention of section 801 of Public Law 94-241 \n     or section 2663 of title 10, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. SABLAN (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be considered as read and printed in the Record.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom the Northern Mariana Islands?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom the Northern Mariana Islands and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chairman, many of us in this Chamber share a concern \nthat the Federal Government has so much power and so many resources \nthat it can overwhelm and even intimidate smaller State and local \ngovernments.\n  The amendment I am offering responds to that concern. It requires, \nbefore any funds are expended in the Northern Mariana Islands for \nexpanded activities by the military, that the Secretary of Defense \nreach agreement with the government of the Northern Mariana Islands on \nthe nature and scope of those activities.\n  My amendment levels the playing field between the very powerful \nFederal Government and a very small territorial government.\n  A little history: in 1975, the people of the Northern Marianas \nelected to become a part of the United States, and 78 percent of the \npeople voted for the negotiated agreement that defined our political \nunion. Part of that agreement includes the lease of two-thirds of our \nisland of Tinian to the U.S. military for 100 years and the lease of \nthe entire island of Farallon de Medinilla. The cost to the United \nStates--$175,000 a year. That is a Manhattan Island deal.\n  The people of the Northern Marianas committed those lands for the \npurpose of national defense willingly because we understood that with \ncitizenship comes responsibility, and the United States recognized in \nthe agreement negotiated with us that we have very little land and that \nany future acquisition, therefore, would be ``only the minimum area \nnecessary.''\n  Today, however, the U.S. military is proposing the takeover of \nanother entire island. It is called Pagan. One more out of only 14 \nislands in the Northern Marianas, when we have already given up all of \nFarallon de Medinilla and two-thirds of Tinian--25 percent of our total \nland area of only 183 square miles. The military is proposing to use \nthese lands for live-fire ranges, training courses, and maneuver areas.\n  I should explain that these are public lands and that decisions about \nthe use of public lands in the Northern Marianas rests in the hands of \nthe Governor and our legislators.\n  To lease lands to the military or not, what the terms and conditions \nof any lease may be, those decisions are an exercise in local self-\ngovernment, and I will respect those local decisions. But as the \nofficial in Congress representing the people of the Northern Marianas, \nI want to be sure that the Federal Government also respects the \ndecisions of the government of the Northern Marianas.\n  Again, that is what my amendment would do. My amendment simply \nassures that none of the funds we appropriate today will be used for \nthe activities the military is proposing for public lands in the \nNorthern Marianas without first obtaining the consent and the agreement \nof the Northern Marianas government and actually obtaining an agreement \nfor the use of that land.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H4120]]\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman raising \nthe issue. Obviously, he is a wonderful representative of the Mariana \nIslands.\n  However, given the way this amendment is written, it is unclear to me \nthe impact that this may have on our military's future ability to \ntrain. So, regretfully, I must oppose this amendment, but I look \nforward to working with the gentleman to address his concerns.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands has \n2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SABLAN. I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen very much.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me put it this way. You have a piece of property, \nand it belongs to you in title. I come over; and without asking you if \nI could use your land, I come in with a yardstick. I bring surveyors. I \nbring architects and engineers to your land, and I start drawing up my \nplans.\n  Would any person alive allow that to happen in the United States of \nAmerica? They won't. Two-thirds of Tinian they already have. They are \nasking for an entirely new island, Mr. Chairman, and they would own 25 \npercent of the Northern Marianas.\n  They are going to fire howitzers in our community. They have claimed \nthat on this one island there are no inhabitants. I happen to live two \ndoors from these people. And that they are from Pagan. They live in \nPagan. They are residents of Pagan. Many of them are in Saipan for \nwork, just like many of us, 541 Members of Congress who come to \nWashington to work and go home every break--except for one, the \nDelegate from the District of Columbia. This is her home. All of us \ncome to D.C. to work. Some of us, even those who don't have homes in \nour districts, claim that we go back to our districts because that is \nour home.\n  Present Federal law says that the United States Government, the \nmilitary must first seek permission and obtain access to the property. \nThey don't have that access. And in the meantime, until they obtain \nthat access or an agreement for the use of that land, then they should \ncease and desist from any plans that they are making for the use of an \nisland that they don't own.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SABLAN. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the compassion and his \nconviction and would join in wanting to work with you, as the chairman \nhas indicated, to see if there is some resolution to your concern.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Chairman, I don't own the land. I am just bringing \nout facts here and bringing out the sentiments of my constituents.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SABLAN.

The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 10003.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be expended by the Department of the Navy to divest or \n     transfer, or prepare to divest or transfer, any search and \n     rescue units from the Marine Corps.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment which would \npreserve a very important component of the Marine Corps: its search and \nrescue units.\n  According to the most recent Marine aviation plan, the Corps had \nthese units slated for a divestiture by the end of the calendar year. I \nwas glad to see that, after some public backlash on that plan, the \nCorps decided to temporarily postpone those divestiture plans. But just \nas easily as the Marines postpone their decision, they could also \nrecommence.\n  I still believe such actions would be a bad decision, and I am not \nalone. That is why I am offering this bipartisan amendment with my \ncolleagues, Representatives Jones, Sinema, and Butterfield.\n  After many years, there were only two remaining search and rescue \nunits left: one at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona, and one at \nMCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina.\n  Marine Corps Air Station Yuma search and rescue unit performed 72 \nrescue missions to aid surrounding communities from 2010 to 2014. Last \nOctober, the Yuma unit facilitated the rescue of 28 Boy Scouts and four \nchaperones who were lost during a canoe trip.\n  MCAS Cherry Point's search and rescue unit, known as VMR-1, performs \nroughly 50 missions annually to help retrieve lost paddlers and hikers. \nJust this past March, VMR-1 rescued a man who was reported missing \nduring a kayaking trip near Cedar Island, North Carolina. This was not \nonly a nighttime mission, but there was a heavy fog as well, so much so \nthat the first rescue helicopter, known affectionately as Pedro, had to \nabort its first landing at a hospital in Morehead and ultimately travel \n75 miles to Greenville, where the man was finally admitted for \ntreatment.\n  But none of us have yet heard a viable alternative to sustain the \nmission of these search and rescue units. Law enforcement and first \nresponders do not have these capabilities, and, apparently, no \ncontractor does either. This proposed divestiture would literally cost \nlives.\n\n[[Page H4121]]\n\n  I ask: What would have happened to these Boy Scouts if these marines \ndidn't come to help? I ask my colleagues to support this amendment \nwhich was meant to save lives.\n  I thank the chair and ranking member.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, respectfully, I rise in opposition \nto the gentleman from Arizona's amendment.\n  The Marine Corps has an aviation plan calling for the orderly \ntransfer of this capability to other entities. The East Coast mission \nwill be assumed by the Coast Guard, while the West Coast mission will \nbe competitively contracted out, as I understand it, in fiscal year \n2017.\n  While we respect the gentleman's concerns, this amendment takes a \nrifle shot approach against the Department of Defense's force structure \nplan, and we believe that this is not good policy. Therefore, I urge \nopposition to the amendment and would appreciate the gentleman making \nthe case for his position.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), my ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I join with the chairman in expressing my \nopposition.\n  Again, I appreciate the gentleman's concern, but we have had a series \nof amendments like this brought to the debate limiting transfers, \nlimiting consideration of any movement or decisions or changes at the \nDepartment of Defense. At some point, we are going to have to allow the \nDepartment of Defense to run itself as well and not to second-guess \nthat maybe sometime they actually will make improvements because of a \ndecision they make, and for that reason, I do support my chairman in \nhis opposition.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0000\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, the idea that the East Coast may be absorbed \nmay be one thing; but accordingly, from what I have heard down in Yuma, \nthere is no viable option or contractor that has been and will be found \nfor Yuma.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available in this Act may be used to transfer a flash-bang \n     grenade under section 2576a of title 10, United States Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, on May 28, 2014, narcotics \nagents, assisted by members of the Habersham County, Georgia, Special \nResponse Team, executed a no-knock search warrant on a home on a quiet \nstreet. Officers terrified the sleeping family but did not find any \ndrugs when they entered the home.\n  During the raid, a 2-year-old child, baby Bou Bou, was badly burned \nwhen the officers tossed a flash-bang grenade into his playpen which \nwas located in a darkened room. The officers justified their actions by \nsaying that their intelligence indicated that there would be no \nchildren present.\n  Mr. Chairman, as an editorial in The Washington Post noted: ``A \nflash-bang grenade is an explosive device that emits a deafening boom \nand a blinding flash of light. It is designed to temporarily stun the \noccupants of a building so that the armed men who deployed it can clear \nthe building. It is an instrument of war.''\n  My amendment is simple. It would prohibit the transfer of flash-bang \ngrenades from the Department of Defense to local law enforcement. The \nDepartment of Defense's 1033 program has helped to sometimes distort \nthe relationship between the police and the communities they serve by \nallocating over $5 billion in surplus military equipment to local \npolice, including flash-bang grenades. Nothing in current law prevents \nthe military from giving police, including school and university police \ndepartments, flash-bang grenades. Allowing this loophole to exist puts \nour communities at risk of increasing militarization.\n  Mr. Chairman, while we have real tensions across the country, our \npolice and their communities are not at war. Funneling free military \nequipment to the police, however, helps to further deepen the divide in \nour communities. The same Washington Post article I mentioned earlier \ncited over a dozen incidents in recent years where police injured \nthemselves or others while using flash-bang grenades.\n  This amendment is not about regulating what types of equipment law \nenforcement agencies should or should not have. Instead, it is about \nwhether this Congress should purchase flash-bang grenades for fighting \nwars abroad and then allow these flash-bang grenades to be transferred \nby the Department of Defense back to local law enforcement agencies for \nuse here at home.\n  Local governments, in consultation with law enforcement agencies that \nthey oversee, should decide what types of equipment the law enforcement \nagencies can acquire. Law enforcement agencies should not unilaterally \nmake that decision independent of civilian authority. The local \ngovernment can purchase whatever equipment they deem necessary for use \nby the agencies under their control through the local budgeting \nprocess, and they can also seek financial assistance through Federal \ngrants.\n  This amendment doesn't touch grant money or State or local \ngovernments' freedom to purchase the equipment they need. The local \nbudget process and Federal grant programs involve making choices based \non need and funding. The 1033 program is an unregulated pipeline of \nfree equipment directly from the Pentagon to the law enforcement \nagency. When the equipment is free and is plentiful and civilian \nauthority is not involved, the calculus is very simple: why not accept \nfree gifts of military equipment. However, if acquiring this equipment \nmilitarizes our police departments beyond comprehension, what kind of \ncommunity policing are we actually performing? Or are we just simply \noccupying?\n  This amendment, Mr. Chairman, is very common sense. We should \nconsider whether or not we want our country to move in this direction \nof militarization, and we certainly need our civilian authorities to be \ninvolved in that process. So the consequences are too dangerous to keep \nproliferating this weaponry on our streets, and I would ask that my \ncolleagues support this amendment.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the gentleman's amendment and rise in \nsupport of it. There is no question that every law enforcement officer \nin our country is in possession of a very dangerous job.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Bost). The time of the gentleman from Georgia \nhas expired.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana \n(Mr. Visclosky) to finish his remarks.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the chairman yielding, and I do recognize \nthe very tough and dangerous job that\n\n[[Page H4122]]\n\nlocal enforcement officers have, every last one of them, and what an \nimportant job they do. I certainly have been active over my career in \nCongress working with the Department of Defense to transfer necessary \nequipment to law enforcement agencies.\n  But I would agree with the assertion of the gentleman that we do have \nto make a distinction with some of these types of materials between \ncivil law enforcement and military action.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment. The Department of Defense excess property \nprogram does provide valuable surplus equipment to State and local law \nenforcement agencies for its use in counternarcotics and \ncounterterrorism operations and to enhance officer safety.\n  It has, on occasion, provided aircraft, including helicopters and \nsmall planes, four-wheel-drive vehicles, pickup trucks, ambulances, and \nmobile command vehicles. It has provided vests and helmets to protect \nofficers, all sorts of important protection equipment, including \nbinoculars, radios, clothing, and information technology.\n  In a time of declining budgets, at the Federal level but also at the \nState and local level, this program is a good example of a Federal-\nlocal partnership that ensures that we get the most out of each tax \ndollar spent.\n  This amendment would restrict the Department's ability to put \nequipment they no longer need to use protecting our citizens within our \nlocal communities. We think it is a good program. It obviously ought to \nbe monitored, and things ought to be only put in proper hands.\n\n                              {time}  0010\n\n  On occasion, horrible incidents do occur, but all in all, this \nprogram has been a valuable thing to many communities across America.\n  I do rise in opposition to the amendment and urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to procure any Army Aircrew Combat Uniforms.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a cost-saving \namendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 2016.\n  Last year, it was brought to my attention by numerous sources in my \ndistrict that in 2009, the Department of Army fully phased out the CWU-\n27/P Army aviation flight uniform and moved to the Army aircrew combat \nuniform, also known as the A2CU.\n  Those constituents of mine--many of whom are Active Duty, retired, or \nare friends and family of military personnel--have expressed a desire \nfor the Army to go back to the CWU-27/P model uniform. There are \nmultiple reasons to switch back to the CWU model uniform. The most \nimportant reasons to switch back to the CWU model are safety and \nefficiency.\n  To sweeten the deal when making the pitch to me, my constituents \nexplained that moving back to the CWU model would also save the \nDepartment millions of dollars a year in procurement costs. All these \nfactors led me to offer this same commonsense amendment last Congress, \nand it passed this body by a voice vote.\n  The CWU model has a proven track record of safety and practicality. \nThe CWU model is still authorized for Army special operation aviators, \nall of the aviators in the other service branches of the U.S. military, \nand most air forces and navies around the world.\n  Yes, these points are a testament to the safety and efficiency of the \nCWU model, and the safety aspects are of paramount importance to our \nArmy aviators because the chances of a fire in an aviation crash are \nvery high.\n  The CWU model flight suits have an antistatic fiber woven into them \nto prevent sparks which, for obvious reasons, are not that desirable \nwhen operating an aircraft with thousands of pounds of highly volatile \njet fuel on board. The one-piece design of the CWU model is also \nextremely important as it does not, in the event of fire, leave any \nopportunities for exposed skin.\n  Speaking to the cost savings, the A2CU model costs an average of 56 \npercent more than the CWU model, and the A2CU was proven to wear out \nfaster than the CWU. Further, every time the Army decides to change the \ncamouflage pattern of the duty uniform, they have to spend millions \nmore purchasing the new flight uniform.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office stated that this \namendment does not score as it is written, but, being that the intent \nis to move back to the CWU model, the effects of the policy should \nactually net some cost savings. Conservative estimates show that the \nArmy could save around $5 million a year in procurement costs if it \nwere to move back to the CWU model.\n  Further, it should not cost anything to reintroduce the CWU model \nback into the supply system, as the rest of the service branches still \nuse them. In other words, there is no need to reboot the supply chain.\n  The cost savings are tantalizing for someone like me, who was sent to \nthis town to rein in spending, but more importantly, I listen to these \nArmy aviators and flight operators. They tell me it is safer. Being \nthat they are the ones doing the training and flying, I am going to \nhave to take them at their word.\n  Given the safety and practicality applications and given that the \nUnited States is not exactly running a budget surplus right now, saving \na few millions here and a few millions there in the name of safety and \npracticality is something we should all strive to achieve.\n  I urge my colleagues to once again support this commonsense amendment \nwhich cuts costs and improves safety.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, let me commend the gentleman from \nArizona on his interest in the safety of our Army aviation personnel.\n  This amendment would prohibit the Army from spending additional funds \nto purchase the Army aircrew combat uniform. As an alternative, the \nArmy could resume using a previous flight suit, the CWU-27/P that has \nnot been authorized since 2009, except for special operators.\n  I understand this amendment is based on discussions with flight crews \nduring visits with airfields and tactical training sites. The old model \nis a one-piece design. It is said to cost less and be more durable than \nthe current model Army aircrew combat uniform.\n  The committee is interested in providing our soldiers with the best \nequipment possible; however, conclusions based on what appear--and I \nwant to say this respectfully--on somewhat anecdotal information and \nbrief discussions rarely lead to wise spending decisions.\n  I reluctantly urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I am pleased \nto yield to Mr. Visclosky.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I would want to associate myself with \nthe chairman's remarks and again reiterate my previous comments that at \nsome point, we ought to trust some judgments being made down at the \nDepartment of Defense and not just say no to everything. We ought to be \nmaking some decisions.\n  I appreciate the chairman's explanation of the situation and join him \nin opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I would like to remind the two individuals \nthat\n\n[[Page H4123]]\n\nthe one-piece has been preferred by the aviators for the safety aspects \nbecause of the woven cloth. I think sometimes we have to have the \nadministration start looking to the people that are actually in harm's \nway in this regard.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Conyers\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to provide arms, training, or other assistance to the \n     Azov Battalion.\n\n  Mr. CONYERS (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous \nconsent the amendment be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I begin by thanking Mr. Frelinghuysen and \nMr. Visclosky in conducting the amendments around these important \nconsiderations.\n  This amendment that I propose this evening limits arms, training, and \nother assistance to the neo-Nazi Ukrainian militia, the Azov Battalion.\n  Foreign Policy magazine has characterized the 1,000-man Azov \nBattalion as ``openly neo-Nazi'' and ``fascist.'' Numerous other news \norganizations, including The New York Times, The Guardian, and the \nAssociated Press have corroborated the dominance of White supremacist \nand anti-Semitic views within the group; yet Ukraine's Interior \nMinister recently announced the Azov Battalion will be among the units \nto receive training and arms from Western allies, including the United \nStates.\n  Azov's founder, Andriy Biletsky, organized the neo-Nazi group the \nSocial-National Assembly in 2008. Azov men use neo-Nazi symbolism on \ntheir banner.\n\n                              {time}  0020\n\n  These groups run counter to American values, and once the fighting \nends, they pose a significant threat to the Ukrainian Government and to \nthe Ukrainian people. As we have seen many times, most notably within \nthe Mujahedeen in Afghanistan, these groups will not lay down their \narms once the conflict is over. They will turn their arms against their \nown people in order to enforce their hateful views.\n  I urge the support of my amendment and to make it U.S. law that we \nwill not equip this dangerous neo-Nazi militia.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I think I speak for the committee in \nsuggesting that we accept the gentleman's amendment and appreciate the \nfact that he wants to exercise care, as we do on the committee, to make \nsure whoever is trained is someone who is, if you would, a person of \ngood intent, as opposed to someone who is not. I appreciate the \ngentleman's concern and for his offering the amendment.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I thank the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, we accept the amendment.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available in this Act may be used to transfer a mine-\n     resistant ambush protected vehicle under section 2576a of \n     title 10, United States Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, sheriff's departments and local \npolice departments are local peace officers. They enforce the law and \nmaintain peace and order. Ideally, they are members of the communities \nin which they serve.\n  The Department of Defense's 1033 program has helped to sometimes \ndistort the relationship between police and their communities by \nproviding over $5 billion in surplus military equipment to local \npolice, including armored vehicles and military grade weapons. Police \nwho patrol the streets and neighborhoods in armored MRAPs, while armed \nto the hilt, can easily lose sight of their role, which is to protect \nand serve, and, instead, take on the mindset of a paramilitary \noccupation force. The routine showing of military authority on our \nstreets creates mistrust that only further deepens the divide between \nlaw enforcement and the people they are sworn to protect and serve.\n  My amendment is simple. It would prohibit the transfer of mine \nresistant ambush protected vehicles, or MRAPs--for free--straight from \nthe Department of Defense to local law enforcement agencies.\n  This amendment is not about regulating what types of equipment law \nenforcement agencies and police should not have. Instead, it is about \nwhether this Congress should purchase MRAPs for fighting wars abroad \nand then allow the Department of Defense to give that equipment away to \ncivilian law enforcement here at home, for free, to use on the streets \nof America.\n  Local governments, in consultation with the law enforcement agencies \nthey oversee, should decide what types of equipment their law \nenforcement agencies can acquire. Law enforcement agencies should not \nunilaterally make that decision independent of civilian authority. The \nlocal governments can purchase whatever equipment they deem necessary \nfor use by the agencies under their control through their local \nbudgeting process, and they can seek financial assistance to purchase \nnecessary equipment from Federal grant programs.\n  This amendment doesn't touch grant money or the State's or local \ngovernment's freedom to purchase the equipment it needs. The local \nbudget process and application for Federal grant programs involve \nmaking choices based on need and funding, while the 1033 program is an \nunregulated pipeline of free equipment directly from the Pentagon to \nthe law enforcement agency.\n  When the equipment is free and in plentiful supply and civilian \nauthority is not involved, the calculus is very simple: Why not accept \nfree equipment? Why not obtain equipment based on desire rather than \nneed? However, if acquiring the equipment required the use of local \nfunds or involved applying for grant money, the decision would be more \ndeliberative and inclusive of civilian authority. Other factors would \nbe considered, including whether there is a need for such equipment, \nhow the equipment would be used, and whether the community consents to \nbeing policed with such equipment.\n  This amendment simply shuts off the pipeline of military equipment \nfrom the battlefield to our main streets. This amendment forces us to \nconsider whether MRAPs, designed and purchased for battle in the Iraqi \ndesert, are suitable for our local police. It forces us to consider \nwhether an ordinary American citizen would truly feel\n\n[[Page H4124]]\n\ncomfortable in approaching an officer for help if the officer were \nbehind the wheel of a 15-ton armored vehicle that had just been \nreturned from combat in Afghanistan.\n  This amendment would end the transfer of these armored vehicles to \nschool systems and to universities across the country. Are our children \nso unruly that order can only be maintained with the use of an MRAP?\n  Unless this amendment passes, a vote for the underlying bill will \nultimately fund the purchase of MRAPs, which will, one day, be \ntransferred back home for use against our constituents. The \nconsequences are too dangerous to continue this indiscriminate flow of \nweaponry to the streets of this Nation. I urge support for this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Rather than repeat myself, I think the Department \nof Defense excess property program does provide some very valuable \nequipment to local law enforcement. Of course, it is invaluable if it \nis used properly and with care. As a consequence, I oppose the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.

Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to carry out a furlough (as defined in section \n     7511(a)(5) of title 5, United States Code) that--\n       (1) includes in the notice of the furlough made pursuant to \n     section 752.404(b) of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, \n     ``sequestration'' as the reason for the furlough; and\n       (2) is of a civilian employee of the Department of Defense \n     who is paid from amounts in a Working Capital Fund Account \n     pursuant to section 2208 of title 10, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. COLE (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to \ndispense with the reading of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am offering a bipartisan amendment which prohibits the furlough of \ncivilian employees while funds remain in the defense working capital \nfund. The services provided by working capital fund employees are \nalready fully funded apart from the appropriations process. In fact, \nimposing furloughs actually costs the taxpayers more through delayed \nproduction, overhead increases, and the need for overtime or the \ntransfer of workload to more expensive sources of work. The amendment \nwill prevent that from happening again as it did in 2013.\n\n                              {time}  0030\n\n  If working capital fund employees are furloughed, as they were in the \nlast government shutdown, there will be no direct savings. Indeed, it \nwill actually cost the taxpayers more money.\n  The furloughs delay production, increase the overhead, and in some \ncases transfer workload to more expensive sources of work. Indeed, \nsenior military officials have expressed publicly that working capital \nfund employees, such as depot and shipyard workers, should be \nconsidered for exemption from furloughs because the furloughs actually \nhurt readiness and increase costs associated with production delays.\n  It is important to note that under this provision, DOD still has the \nauthority to furlough working capital fund employees for disciplinary \npurposes. Further, working capital fund employees could be furloughed \nif funded workload dried up due to budget cuts or downsizing. \nTherefore, ending the threat of furloughs for these employees will save \nmoney, improve military readiness, and prevent needless delays and cost \noverruns from work that has already been funded.\n  I urge the support of the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), \nmy good friend and a member of our subcommittee, puts me in a very \ndifficult position.\n  I complained in my opening remarks that some of our colleagues in the \nCongress, as I said earlier in the day, delight every time a civilian \nemployee is furloughed. So I certainly appreciate the gist of the \ngentleman's amendment. We have a much larger problem that we and the \nadministration need to address, and I know he feels the same way.\n  My concern with the particular amendment is we have other departments \nas well, whether it be the Department of Labor, Internal Revenue \nService, EPA, Housing and Urban Development, and the list goes on, and \nought not to select one agency over the other. I don't think it is the \nproper way to go.\n  We ought to collectively understand that the government actually does \nmany good things to help the people of this country. We ought to value \nthe work of each of our Federal employees, and we ought to block the \nfurlough of any of them in any agency, not a particular one.\n  So I certainly do not disagree with the intent of the gentleman. I \nrealize we are talking about the Department of Defense, but do believe \nthat we ought to be looking at the broader question.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I just want to quickly respond to my friend. \nI share many of his sentiments. I certainly don't like to see anybody \nfurloughed. I was not in favor of previous government shutdowns. I \nthought they were quite counterproductive.\n  This is, however, a unique case. The funds are already in existence. \nThere is no savings. We are literally taking people out of work when we \nhave funds set aside outside the appropriations process for them to \ncontinue their work. So in this case they really deserve to be excepted \nif we happen to make a mistake and stumble into a process like this \nagain.\n  Again, I don't disagree with my friend's sentiments about the larger \nworkforce. I have never found these things to be particularly \nproductive. Indeed, as I recall, in every case we have always gone back \nand made everybody whole, so really the ultimate loser has usually been \nthe taxpayer because we paid for work, created uncertainty that our \nFederal employees didn't deserve, but ultimately compensated them.\n  In this case, the funds are available. We should just keep people at \nwork. They are doing an important job for the national security. So \nagain, I would urge the passage of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, this amendment is identical to an \namendment offered last year that passed the House by voice vote. The \namendment seeks to prohibit the intelligence community from subverting \nor interfering with the integrity of any cryptographic standard that is \nproposed, developed, or adopted by NIST. I urge continued support for \nthis amendment by both sides of the aisle.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment. Frankly, we don't know its full impact. It could \nhave some unintended consequences. This amendment could hamper \nlegitimate communications between the intelligence community and NIST \nregarding security standards. This amendment is very broadly drafted. \nIt could prevent NIST from consulting with other intelligence community \nagencies about that agency's internal computer system.\n  I know it was reported that the 2006 NIST cryptographic standard had \na NASA back door. I want to make it clear that NIST says they did not \ndeliberately weaken cryptographic standards at the behest of other \ngovernment agencies. They assure us they will not do so in the future. \nI urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, given that \nassurance.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding and \nwould associate myself again with his remarks and objection to the \nbill. We go to great pains on the subcommittee to protect the privacy \nof the American people, and I would agree with the assertions the \nchairman has made. I appreciate him yielding to me.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Reclaiming my time, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, let me see if I can try to allay some of \nthe concerns that have been expressed.\n  My amendment seeks to address a serious problem. A year-and-a-half \nago it was revealed that the National Security Agency deliberately \nsubverted American cryptographic standards. Cryptographic standards for \nthe national security community and the commercial software industry \nare developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nknown as NIST. These standards are intended to protect Americans from \nforeign intelligence agencies, from cyber criminals, from industrial \nespionage, and from privacy violations by those who wish us harm.\n\n                              {time}  0040\n\n  They are embedded in software products which are used and sold \nwidely--in fact, almost universally--in this country and elsewhere.\n  Unfortunately, media reports have confirmed that the National \nSecurity Agency successfully and deliberately weakened encryption \nstandards promulgated by NIST to further NSA surveillance goals at the \ncost of privacy of ordinary U.S. citizens. This is extremely dangerous. \nIt leaves users of those standards vulnerable to anybody who is \nfamiliar with those weaknesses, friend or foe.\n  As World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee put it:\n\n       It is naive to imagine that, if you deliberately introduce \n     a weakness into a system, you will be the only one to use it.\n\n  My amendment would seek to address this issue and resolve it once and \nfor all by prohibiting the intelligence community from subverting or \ninterfering with the integrity of any cryptographic standard that is \nproposed, developed, or adopted by NIST.\n  To be clear about it, the intelligence community can continue to \nprovide advice. What the intelligence community\n\n[[Page H4126]]\n\ncannot do is deliberately set out to weaken cryptographic standards \nbecause whatever it does in that regard will certainly be understood \nand exploited by our enemies, as we saw just last week when we \nwitnessed the decryption of information regarding classified \ninformation and U.S. employees.\n  It is only common sense that we should not want taxpayers' dollars \nthat are appropriated to one agency to be used to deliberately and \nactively subvert the work of another agency.\n  Therefore, I respectfully request support for this amendment on both \nsides of the aisle, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, this amendment forbids scarce defense \ndollars from being allocated to fund three executive orders and several \nother provisions of law that require our military to squander billions \nof dollars in so-called green energy. The House adopted this amendment \nby a voice vote last year.\n  I would again remind the House that, just a few weeks ago, the so-\ncalled defense hawks warned that our defense budget has been strangled \nby sequestration, that every dollar wasted long ago had been wrung out \nof the Pentagon budget, and that our national security was directly \nimperiled as a result.\n  That argument carried the day, even though it will add billions of \ndollars to the national debt; yet, although we were told we didn't have \nenough money to adequately pay and supply troops in the field, it seems \nthat we do have plenty of defense money to indulge the ``green energy'' \nmandates that are imposed on our Armed Forces.\n  What truly troubles me is that this was all aired during debate on \nthe DOD Appropriations bill last year. The limiting amendments were \nadopted by voice vote; yet we see the same waste being allowed in this \nyear's bill.\n  Let me refresh memories about the green energy mandates. The GAO \nreports that these mandates have cost the Navy as much as $150 per \ngallon for jet fuel. In 2012, the Navy was forced to purchase 450,000 \ngallons of biofuel for its so-called green fleet at the cost of $26.60 \nper gallon, when conventional petroleum cost just $2.50 per gallon.\n  These mandates forced the Air Force to pay $59 per gallon for 11,000 \ngallons of biofuel in 2012. That is 10 times more than regular jet fuel \ncosts.\n  It is not just biofuels. Last year, the Pentagon was required to \npurchase over 1,000 Chevy Volts at a subsidized price of $40,000 each. \nAs Senator Coburn's office pointed out: ``Each one of these $40,000 \nChevy Volts represents the choice not to provide an entire infantry \nplatoon with all new rifles or 50,000 rounds of ammunition that cannot \nbe used for realistic training.''\n  These green energy mandates have required the Army and Navy to \ninstall solar arrays at various facilities. At Naval Station Norfolk, \nfor example, the Navy spent $21 million to install a 10-acre solar \narray which will supply a grand total of 2 percent of the base \nelectricity.\n  According to the inspector general's office, this project will save \nenough money to pay for itself in just 447 years. It is too bad solar \npanels only last about 25 years.\n  We don't know exactly how much these mandates waste because, as the \nGAO reports: ``There is currently no comprehensive inventory of which \nFederal agencies are implementing renewable energy-related initiatives \nand the types of initiatives they are implementing.''\n  Outside estimates are as much as $7 billion for the Department of \nDefense last year, a figure that is expected to grow in the future.\n  We are told this program is necessary for flexibility. Really? \nShouldn't ``flexibility'' free us to get cheaper and more plentiful \nfuels, not more expensive and more exotic ones?\n  We are told the military should do its part for the environment as if \nit is possible to fight an environmentally sensitive war. That, I fear, \nis the real reason for this wasteful spending, to sacrifice our \nmilitary budget on the altar of climate change.\n  This is part of an ideological crusade imposed on our military that \nwill pointlessly consume billions of defense dollars mainly to keep \nmoney flowing to politically well-connected ``green energy'' companies \nthat can't get anyone else to buy their products.\n  There is a reason that Admiral Mullen warned us that, in his \nprofessional military judgment, the greatest threat to our national \nsecurity is our national debt. We just increased that debt because of \nassurances that we had stretched the defense budget to the breaking \npoint.\n  As long as this program continues to consume billions of our defense \ndollars, that claim cannot be taken seriously.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I would start my remarks by saying the gentleman from \nCalifornia has me at a disadvantage because we just received a copy of \nthe final amendment that was offered in the House. Lines 7 and 8 are \nnew to the amendment and refer to Executive Order No. 13963, which is \nin addition to other items that I am opposed to.\n  I am told that those sections in that executive order refer to \nplanning for sustainability, but I cannot confirm that to the Members \nof the House.\n  I do rise in strong opposition to the gentleman's amendment. He talks \nabout exotic items--exotic items. The Department of Defense would be \nblocked from purchasing recycled paper. Let's not buy recycled paper at \nthe Department of Defense. Now, there is a great idea.\n  The Department would be blocked from generating renewable energy that \nmight include using tents with photovoltaic materials that generate \nsolar power onsite for our troops in God-forsaken places on this planet \nwith no other access to energy sources.\n  The Department would be blocked from considering sites for new \nFederal facilities that are pedestrian friendly and accessible to, God \nforbid, public transit. Perhaps we should move the Pentagon because it \nis near a Metro stop.\n  The Department would be blocked from cooperating with the Department \nof Energy's efforts to maximize the use of alternative fuels for our \nFederal fleet.\n  The Department of Defense is the largest purchaser of energy in the \nUnited States of America. As a former member of the Congress, I have a \nprofound respect for Senator Dick Lugar from Indiana, as he \ncharacterized energy. It is not an energy problem so much as it is a \nnational security issue, given where and how much energy we import.\n  The Department would also be blocked from advancing sustainable \nacquisition by trying to procure either less toxic or more water-\nefficient alternatives. My sense is that, in some portions of the State \nof California and\n\n[[Page H4127]]\n\nother areas, they are desperate for a couple of extra drops of water, \nbut that might just be too exotic.\n\n                              {time}  0050\n\n  These are programs and initiatives that make sense, both for the \nenvironment and for fiscal responsibility. Moreover, the Department has \nbeen a leader in spurring new technologies, and I thought that is what \ndrives the economy in America.\n  This amendment is terribly ill-advised, and I would strongly urge all \nof my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is absolutely right. The \nmilitary is the largest purchaser of energy in our economy. That is \nexactly the point.\n  They should not be forced to purchase energy at vastly inflated \nprices to soothe the ideological itch of the environmental left.\n  No one in his right mind would pull into a gas station to pay $26.60 \nper gallon for fuel when the gas station next door is selling it for \n$2.50. That is exactly what these executive orders are requiring our \nmilitary to do. It is squandering billions of our dollars and making a \nmockery of any claim that we are stretching our defense dollars to the \nutmost.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.

Mr. Chairman, no hard-working American should ever have \nto worry that her employer will refuse to pay her when she works \novertime or takes money out of her paycheck, especially if she works \nfor a Federal contractor. This practice is known as wage theft.\n  Right now, Federal contractors who violate the Fair Labor Standards \nAct are allowed to apply for Federal contracts. This amendment will \nensure that funds may not be used to enter into a contract with a \ngovernment contractor that willfully, and this is important, Mr. \nChairman, willfully or repeatedly violates the Fair Labor Standards \nAct.\n  Other iterations of this amendment have simply identified any \nviolations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This one identifies only \nthose contracts wherein the violator has been found to have been \nwillfully or repeatedly in violation.\n  Now, I hope that both Republicans and Democrats can agree that \nwillful and repeated violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act are \nunacceptable; that we can find other contractors who do not violate the \nFair Labor Standards Act willfully and repeatedly. And this amendment \nensures that those in violation of the law do not get taxpayer support.\n  It also ensures that honest, good contractors who do not willfully \nand repeatedly violate the Fair Labor Standards Act can have contracts.\n  Why shouldn't the Federal Government work with contractors who have \nsome modicum of respect for their employees and who do not willfully \nand repeatedly violate the Fair Labor Standards Act?\n  This amendment relies upon the violations reported to the Federal \nAwardee Performance and Integrity Information System.\n  Again, when a contractor applies for a Federal contract, there is \ndocumentation they have to fill out, including the Federal Awardee \nPerformance and Integrity Information System, and that system looks \nback to look at the prior 5 years worth of criminal, civil, or \nadministrative agency actions which have a final disposition.\n  None of these things are pending. None of these things are under \nappeal. They have been decided.\n  And this amendment says that wherein violations of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act have been decided and determined conclusively, and only \nin the category of those that have been willful and/or repeated, then \nthose particular contractors are contractors whom the U.S. Government \nshouldn't be doing business with, at least for 5 years, until they \nclean their act up.\n  Now, I hope that no one in this body would want to stand on the side \nof the willful and repeated violators of the Fair Labor Standards Act. \nIt is impossible to me that any Member would want to do that, \nparticularly when we are trying to promote and do business with honest, \ndecent contractors, or at least average and mediocre contractors.\n  This one has gone to the, again, willful and repeated violators. Very \ndifficult to stand next to them, and I hope\n\n[[Page H4128]]\n\nno Member of this body would do such a thing.\n  The amendment would ensure that a single inadvertent violation would \nnot disqualify a contractor. And that is important. I have had some \npeople say, well, what if somebody just messes up one time?\n  Well, no, that particular individual wouldn't be hit by this \namendment. But the willful and repeated ones would.\n  So I think taxpayer money should be spent wisely. I think that as the \nlargest purchaser of goods and services, the Federal Government must \nfind a way to make sure funds are going to companies that treat their \nworkers fairly and give American families a chance to succeed.\n  This is a serious problem, Mr. Chairman. The Economic Policy \nInstitute found that ``In total, the average low-wage workers lose a \nstunning $2,634 per year in unpaid wages, representing as much as 15 \npercent of their earned income.''\n  A report by the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee of \nthe U.S. Senate revealed that 32 percent of the largest Department of \nLabor penalties for wage theft were levied against Federal contractors.\n  This is a problem. This is a situation that must be remedied.\n\n                              {time}  0100\n\n  Similarly, the National Employment Law Project study found that 21 \npercent of Federal contract workers were not paid overtime, and 11 \npercent have been forced to work ``off the clock.''\n  Upholding the rule of law is a bipartisan issue. I think that we may \ndisagree on many things; taxes, spending, we disagree on that. There \nhave even been people in this body who disagree that any violator of \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act should get a contract, but I certainly \nhope that those people who are repeated--let me repeat--repeated and \nwillful violators should be excluded at least for 5 years.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, we all agree that bad actors who \ndeny workers basic protections, including wage and overtime pay, \nshouldn't be rewarded with government contracts funded by taxpayer \ndollars, but this amendment is unnecessary.\n  There is a suspension and debarment process already in place under \nthe current law. If an employer has a history of bad behavior, \nincluding ``willful'' and ``repeated'' violations of FLSA, the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, Federal agencies know about it and have the \nauthority to deny that employer Federal contracts.\n  A report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found \nthat litigation stemming from such claims continues to be a significant \nproblem.\n  These aren't all bad actors. Often, they are employers trying to do \nthe right thing, but are simply tripped up by an overly complex \nregulatory system.\n  I may add, Mr. Chairman, this amendment was voted down in the \nTransportation-HUD, Commerce-Justice-State, and Military Construction \nand Veterans Affairs Subcommittees; and likewise, it should also be on \nthis floor.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote and yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment Offered by Mr. Smith of Missouri\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available in this Act may be used to provide for defense \n     counsel for any individual described in section 8101(c).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Missouri and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would prohibit \nfunds from being used to provide defense counsel to foreign terrorists \ndetained at Guantanamo Bay.\n  Simply put, Mr. Chairman, our tax dollars should not be going to \ndefend foreign terrorists. Hard-working taxpayers should not foot the \nlegal bill of noncitizen terrorists who plotted to kill innocent \nAmericans.\n  I recently visited Guantanamo Bay and learned firsthand of the \noutrageous amount of time these detainees spend with their taxpayer-\nfunded counsel. I have asked the Department of Defense to provide me \nwith the exact amount they have spent in legal defense services for \ndetainees, but I have received no response. Mr. Chairman, I am sure \nmillions of dollars have been spent defending these foreign terrorists.\n  Legal resources provided by the Department of Defense should be \nprioritized for American servicemembers. The pool of judge advocates \nthat represents detainees at Guantanamo is a stand-alone unit. They are \nonly assigned to act as defense attorneys for suspected terrorists. \nMeanwhile, there is another pool of military lawyers to represent all \nother American servicemembers.\n  Why should the DOD resources be assigned to defend foreign terrorists \nwhen they could, instead, be used to defend our own men and women in \nuniform? I am confident most Americans would agree that this money \ncould be better spent within the Department of Defense, perhaps by \nmaking sure that our servicemembers are provided their legal counsel \nahead of noncitizen terrorists.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  We have a Constitution in this country. It contains language talking \nabout the right to be assisted by counsel, and there are many other \nprovisions relative to the protection of individual human beings from \nthe State.\n  We are a very large country with approximately 2 million people in \nthe military. I think one of the great foundational issues in the \nUnited States is to protect any human being from that incredible amount \nof power so that you avoid abuse.\n  We have seen enough instances of abuse because of allegations of \nterrorists, many of whom are very real, mean, despicable people; but to \nnow say that no one should have protection to make sure that that \nincredible power of the state is used justly and wisely is absolutely \nwrong.\n  We have had any number of Members, our colleagues here yesterday and \ntoday on this bill, offering amendments because they believe the \nDepartment of Energy made a mistake on uniforms for airmen, the \nDepartment of Defense made mistakes as far as whether or not we should \nmove helicopters from one base to another, we have made mistakes as far \nas how we should have lifesaving rescue missions for various aspects of \nthe Department of Defense positioned throughout our great country.\n  What if, God forbid, all these allegations that the Department of \nState may make mistakes from time to time would actually have an impact \non a human being, whoever they are, and that in the last instance, we \ndon't give them one iota of protection that we give to murderers and \nrapists and burglar and arsonists in this country?\n  I think it is absolutely wrong for the gentleman to offer this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I want to make it simple.\n  This amendment is quite clear. If you don't want American tax dollars \nbeing spent to protect foreign terrorists who plotted to attack and \nkill innocent Americans, then vote ``yes.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4129]]\n\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I would just say that, if we are talking \nabout the protection of taxpayers dollars, we should be talking about \nthe protection of a human life and to make sure that that life, no \nmatter whose life it is, is protected from the arbitrary use of power.\n  I again strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment that I think is \njust contrary to the foundational principles of the United States of \nAmerica. We don't torture people. We protect people's lives in the \nUnited States, and now, to withdraw any protection for them is \nabsolutely wrong.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of the authority of the President \n     pursuant to Article II, section 2 of the Constitution.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, the responsibilities of the President \nand the responsibilities of the Defense Department continue in this new \nclimate to grow. This has been a long journey in the Defense \nAppropriations process and amendments on the floor, and I would like to \nat this hour thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee for their patience and their participation \nin the list of amendments that we have had the opportunity to present.\n  I am a member of the Homeland Security Committee. Therefore, I see a \nlot of the new approaches.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. I believe the committee would be delighted to accept \nyour amendment.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I am delighted, and I will finish up.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member. The amendment deals with \ncountering violent extremism. I look forward to working on this issue.\n  Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member \nVisclosky for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their \ndevotion to the security of our country and the world.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, \nwhich is simple and straightforward:\n\n       Sec.___. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \n     contravene the authority of the President under article II, \n     section 2 of the Constitution.\n\n  The purpose of Jackson Lee Amendment 177 is to affirm the President's \nauthority under the Constitution.\n  Countering violent extremism and preventing the recruitment of \nAmerican youth into violent extremism and preventing them from becoming \nforeign fighters for dangerous groups such as ISIL and other radical \ngroups around the globe is a national imperative.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the ``No Fly For Foreign Fighters \nAct,'' legislation that will help keep foreign fighters and terrorists \nout of our country.\n  In introducing this legislation, I was particularly concerned about \nterrorist groups recruiting our youth.\n  In fact, I was part of a special roundtable along with DHS Secretary \nJohnson, in Houston, Texas on ``Youth Engagement and Countering Violent \nExtremism''.\n  During the discussion, Secretary Johnson and I addressed the \nimportance of community engagement in preventing the recruitment of \nyoung Americans into terrorist groups.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment will help to prevent the recruitment of \nAmerican youth as foreign fighters, a phenomenon that is unfortunately \nalready taking root.\n  In March 2009, two-hundred schoolchildren in Britain (some as young \nas thirteen) had been identified and reported by community members--\nincluding parents, imams, and teachers--as being at risk of extremism \nor of being ``groomed by radicalisers.''\n  At least six boys between the ages of 13 and 16 were captured by U.S. \nForces in Afghanistan in the initial fighting there.\n  In Iraq, U.S. forces detained more than 100 juveniles in the first \nyear following the invasion, and more than 600 to date.\n  In the last few years a number of Somali-American young men have \ntraveled to Somalia, possibly to train and fight with al-Shabaab.\n  At least one of these young men was killed during a suicide bombing \nattack in northern Somalia in October 2008, which is the first known \ninstance of a U.S. citizen participating in a suicide attack.\n  Moreover, over 140 United States persons have traveled to Syria or \nIraq to fight alongside ISIL, the Nusra Front, and other terrorist \norganizations.\n  Although there are no known instances of a U.S. person attempting to \nreturn from the region after participating in conflict, we must be \nvigilant against this prospect.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment 177, seeks to protect youth and combat the \nactions of terrorist groups like Boko Haram and others who are using \nsocial media to bring them to their side.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment is important because data shows that \nindividuals recruited as foreign fighters from nations in Africa, \nEurope, and the Middle East have crossed borders and wreaked havoc and \ncommitted terroristic acts including kidnapping of youth similar to \nwhat Boko Haram has done.\n  Mr. Chair, the United States is committed to protecting our youth, \npreventing and combating violent extremism, protecting our borders and \nthe globe from the scourge of terrorism and violent extremism.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment will do just that.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment 177 prevents terrorism by ascertaining that \nAmerican youth are not seduced into becoming terrorists.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment promotes the United States military's \nunparalleled expertise and technological capability to combat and \ndefeat terrorists who hate our country and prey upon our children, \ninnocent persons, women and the elderly across the globe.\n  Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, ISIS/ISIL and other militant \nterrorists, including the Sinai's Ansar Beit al-Maqdis in the Sinai \nPeninsula are all global and national security threats that must be \nstopped.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment will support the Department of Defense's \nefforts to prevent the recruitment of American youth into terrorism and \nthe recovery of the still missing Chibok girls from Nigeria.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Guinta\n\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to propose, plan for, or execute a new or additional \n     Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my amendment to the \nDefense Appropriations bill to prevent any funds from being used to \nconduct a new round of military base closures through a process known \nas Base Realignment and Closure, also known as BRAC.\n  While President Obama continues to discuss the possibility of another \nround of BRAC as a way to reduce defense spending, we know all too well \nthe negative impacts closing military bases have on our communities, \nStates, national security, and military preparedness.\n  For more than 200 years, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has provided \nthousands of Granite Staters with jobs and contributed millions in \nrevenue and military equipment for the United States Navy.\n\n[[Page H4130]]\n\n  Today, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has roughly 100 naval officers and \nenlisted personnel assigned to the facility. In addition, the shipyard \nemploys roughly 4,700 civilian employees and offers an active \napprentice and engineer recruitment program in the communities \nsurrounding the facility. This base is more than just helpful to our \nlocal economy and our military readiness. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is \nabsolutely essential to New Hampshire. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is one \nof only four shipyards remaining in the country. Each of these \nfacilities has a mission to overhaul, repair, and modernize our \nNation's submarine fleet. These services are vital toward maintaining \nfleet readiness.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment to show our \nunwavering support for our men and women in arms.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, while I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment, I wouldn't express it, if you would, that I will oppose \nhis amendment, but I do want to express some very serious concerns.\n  The concern I have is that we do need to begin to think about future \nbudgets for the Department of Defense; and as I have mentioned \nrepeatedly tonight, we are going to have to start making some hard \ndecisions, and changes will have to be made and cuts will have to be \nmade. I am very concerned about Congress' continued failure to confront \nthe challenges that we face at the Department of Defense and simply \nsaying no, no, no, and that we shouldn't even consider any possible \nchanges.\n  The Department of Defense has continuously proposed significant \ninitiatives to provide for future flexibility to meet our national \nsecurity strategy, and Congress has said no, no, no. I simply do not \nthink we should foreclose any options to consider in order to possibly, \nGod forbid, save money in the outyears.\n  A BRAC round is a reasonable approach that provides Congress a chance \nto say yes or no, and I would make the observation again that we have \ngot to stop saying no to everything that the Department of Defense \nconsiders. In this case, I am not even aware there is a proposal for a \nBRAC, but let's say no anyway. I think we have to stop doing it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's \nconcerns. While I certainly hope that there is no BRAC round, there are \nconcerns expressed by Members relative to the President's comments in \nthis area as a method of reducing defense spending.\n  We have gone through sequestration. I have seen firsthand the \nconcerns expressed by the civilian employees at the Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard. They are the best and the brightest in the business, and I \nfeel very strongly that this is important to New Hampshire and \nimportant to the defense of our Nation.\n  I certainly share the concern and welcome the opportunity to look at \nthe Department of Defense to try to find efficiencies and effectiveness \nto make sure that our men and women are properly prepared, but I feel \nthat a BRAC realignment would be inappropriate at this time. I hope \nthat Members would support this amendment.\n  I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and the rest of the committee for \ntheir hard work on this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Massie\n\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following new section:\n       Sec.__. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), none of \n     the funds made available by this Act may be used by an \n     officer or employee of the United States to query a \n     collection of foreign intelligence information acquired under \n     section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 (50 U.S.C. 1881a) using a United States person \n     identifier.\n       (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply to queries for foreign \n     intelligence information authorized under section 105, 304, \n     703, 704, or 705 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n     of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1805; 1842; 1881b; 1881c; 1881d), or title \n     18, United States Code, regardless of under what Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act authority it was collected.\n       (c) Except as provided for in subsection (d), none of the \n     funds made available by this Act may be used by the National \n     Security Agency or the Central Intelligence Agency to mandate \n     or request that a person (as defined in section 101(m) of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. \n     1801(m))) alter its product or service to permit the \n     electronic surveillance (as defined in section 101(f) of such \n     Act (50 U.S.C. 1801(f))) of any user of such product or \n     service for such agencies.\n       (d) Subsection (c) shall not apply with respect to mandates \n     or requests authorized under the Communications Assistance \n     for Law Enforcement Act (47 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. MASSIE (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, the American people don't want to be spied \non by their own government. Our Founding Fathers included the Fourth \nAmendment for a reason: to require probable cause and a warrant before \nthe government and government agents can snoop on anyone.\n  During the 113th Congress, the House of Representatives passed the \nbipartisan amendment I am offering today by a 293-123 vote. This year, \nour bipartisan group is reuniting once again to shut down \nunconstitutional surveillance that does not meet the expectations of \nour constituents or the standards required by our Constitution.\n  Our amendment shuts one form of backdoor surveillance by prohibiting \nwarrantless searches of government databases for information that \npertains to U.S. citizens.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has confirmed that the \ngovernment searches vast amounts of data, including the content of \nemails and telephone calls without individual suspicion or probable \ncause.\n\n                              {time}  0120\n\n  At this time, I submit for the Record a letter from the Director of \nNational Intelligence, which confirms this warrantless spying.\n\n                            Director of National Intelligence,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 2014.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: During the January 29, 2014, Worldwide \n     Threat hearing, you cited declassified court documents from \n     2011 indicating that NSA sought and obtained the authority to \n     query information collected under Section 702 of the Foreign \n     Intelligence and Surveillance Act (FISA), using U.S. person \n     identifiers, and asked whether any such queries had been \n     conducted for the communications of specific Americans.\n       As reflected in the August 2013 Semiannual Assessment of \n     Compliance with Procedures and Guidelines issued Pursuant to \n     Section 702, which we declassified and released on August 21, \n     2013, there have been queries, using U.S. person identifiers, \n     of communicatons lawfully acquired to obtain foreign \n     intelligence by targeting non U.S. persons reasonably \n     believed to be located outside the U.S. pursuant to Section \n     702 of FISA. These queries were performed pursuant to \n     minimization procedures approved by the FISA Court as \n     consistent with the statute and the Fourth Amendment. As you \n     know, when Congress reauthorized Section 702, the proposal to \n     restrict such queries was specifically raised and ultimately \n     not adopted.\n       For further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact \n     Deirdre M. Walsh in the Office of Legislative Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James R. Clapper.\n\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, the Director of the FBI has also confirmed \nthat he uses the information to build criminal cases against U.S. \npersons, but the Director of National Intelligence and the FBI are not \nabove the Fourth Amendment, and this practice should end.\n  At this time, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lofgren), my colleague.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding in\n\n[[Page H4131]]\n\nsupport of the Massie-Lofgren amendment.\n  As mentioned, the declassified FISA court decision has indicated that \nsubstantially more warrantless communications are collected through 702 \nthan 215.\n  We had a bill up to recently, the USA FREEDOM Act, that alleged that \nwe were stopping bulk collection, but we didn't. During the markup of \nthat bill in the Judiciary Committee, we offered this amendment; and \neveryone on the committee, including the chairman of the committee, \nsaid they were for this provision, but it wasn't the right time. Well, \nthis is the right time.\n  That is why we have this broad support. It is the Massie-Lofgren-\nSensenbrenner-Conyers-Poe-Gabbard-Jordan-O'Rourke. It is broad; it is \nbipartisan. It is supported by groups like the American Civil Liberties \nUnion, as well as the Campaign for Liberty, Demand Progress, as well as \nFreedomWorks. This has broad bipartisan support.\n  The American people deserve this. When we have an interest in \nquerying the 702 database for American citizens, get a warrant. That is \nwhat the Fourth Amendment requires.\n  Finally, this closes the opportunity to require backdoors on \ntechnology. As has been mentioned earlier by technologists and \nscientists, to do that just opens a door wide open for the bad guys and \nthe hackers to break in.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, as my colleague stated, my amendment also \nprohibits NSA and the CIA from placing backdoors into commercial \nproducts.\n  This is important because, in December of 2013, it was reported that \na U.S. security company had received $10 million from the NSA to use a \nflawed encryption method. Our government should strengthen technology \nthat protects our privacy, not take advantage of it.\n  At this time, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment restricts the use of \nsection 702 of FISA, which is not currently up for reauthorization.\n  The law does not sunset until December of 2017. Any reform to this \nauthority should be fully vetted by the authorizing committees and not \ninappropriately attached to our spending bill.\n  This amendment would impose greater restrictions on the intelligence \ncommunity's ability to protect national security and create an \nimpediment to our government's ability to locate threat information \nalready in our government's possession. Such an impediment would \npotentially put American lives at risk of another terrorist attack.\n  Colleagues, the House recently passed H.R. 3361, the USA FREEDOM Act, \nwith overwhelmingly bipartisan support. It was signed into law last \nweek. This amendment seeks to relitigate an issue fully litigated in \nthe drafting of that legislation. A similar amendment was offered and \nrejected by the House Judiciary Committee during its markup of that \nbill.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act does include two reforms related to section 702 \ncollection. These were reforms properly considered during the \nauthorization process, not slapped on an appropriations bill without \nconsideration and deliberation.\n  The first limits the government's use of information about U.S. \npersons that is obtained under section 702 that the FISA court later \ndetermines to be unlawful. The second provision requires the Director \nof National Intelligence to report annually the number of U.S. person \nqueries under section 702.\n  Under current law, a U.S. person can only be the target of an \nintelligence gathering under FISA pursuant to an individualized court \norder based upon probable cause. The intelligence community is allowed \nto query communications it legally collects from foreigners for \ninformation about a U.S. person, so long as the query itself has \nforeign intelligence value.\n  This is no different from traditional criminal law. If the government \nhas a legal wiretap on a drug dealer's cell phone and records a \nconversation where a second drug dealer talks about committing a \nmurder, police can use that phone call as evidence against a second \ndrug dealer in a murder trial. What matters is that the initial \nwiretap--or, here, the initial targeting of the foreign terrorist--was \nlegal.\n  Colleagues, this is an issue critical to our national security, and \nit is complicated. Any changes to section 702 should be fully evaluated \nand voted on using the authorization committee process, which is the \nappropriate channel for considered review and debate on this critical \nissue.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment has not benefited from the work of the \nauthorization process and would potentially put American lives at \ngreater risk for another terrorist attack. That is not a risk many of \nus or certainly I am willing to take.\n  For this reason and many others, I strongly oppose this amendment, \nand I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MASSIE. At this time, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lofgren).\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  The unclassified FISA court reported that the 702 search had, in \nfact, scooped up vast amounts of wholly domestic information. How does \nthis work?\n  The upstream communications are tapped into by the NSA. In the \ndigital world, your digital information, your domestic information is \nstored throughout the world. It is scooped up, and it is used.\n  The FBI has indicated it is used and the DNI has indicated it is used \nfor wholly domestic purposes without a warrant routinely thousands, \ntens of thousands of times. It is in violation of the Fourth Amendment, \nand it must stop.\n  I would just say, on the Judiciary Committee, every member of the \ncommittee who declined to support this amendment said they were for the \namendment and said we should offer it to the DOD appropriations bill.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, now, it has been said here tonight that \nthis is not the time or the place to address these problems with 702, \nbut, look, we have a constitutional crisis, and this was the excuse we \nwere given in the Judiciary Committee when my colleague tried to get \nthe amendment allowed there.\n  It was the same excuse I was given in the Rules Committee when we had \nan opportunity to address this, and I would maintain that 2017, 2 years \nfrom now, is too long to go in this constitutional crisis situation \nwhere we recognize something that illegal and/or unconstitutional is \noccurring; yet we don't do anything about it. This is the time to do \nsomething about it; this is the place to do something about it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n          Amendment Offered by Mrs. Ellmers of North Carolina\n\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to deactivate the 440th \n     airlift wing, or to move the personnel or aircraft of the \n     440th airlift wing, or to otherwise degrade the capabilities \n     of the 440th airlift wing.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentlewoman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H4132]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina.\n\n                              {time}  0130\n\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to \ncontinue my fight against the Air Force's misguided decision to shutter \nthe 440th Airlift Wing.\n  As I have stated time and time again, the removal of the 440th \nAirlift Wing at Pope Army Airfield injects avoidable and unreasonable \nrisks to our military readiness. Given the instability and uncertainty \nin the Middle East and around the world, I find it baffling that the \nAir Force has chosen to close such an efficient airlift wing that \nprovides critical training to special operations forces and units such \nas the 82nd Airborne's Global Response Force.\n  I have failed to see the true cost savings and any benefits \nassociated with this shortsighted proposal, and I will continue working \nwith my colleagues to pursue every option possible in order to prevent \nthe closure of the wing. Furthermore, I find it troubling that the Air \nForce has made a concerted effort to hollow out this wing before \nallowing congressional efforts to come to fruition.\n  Mr. Chairman, I simply lack the confidence that there will be no \nnegative impacts to the training of Fort Bragg paratroopers and special \noperations forces. I will, therefore, continue to work with my North \nCarolina colleagues to prevent its closure.\n  I believe that this is a necessary effort to preserve the 440th \nAirlift Wing because of the vital and unique training mission that it \nhas at Fort Bragg with our paratroopers. Our paratroopers have to be \npacked and ready at any given moment for their Global Response Force. I \nhave paratroopers who simply live day-to-day, ready to leave at a \nmoment's notice--within hours--around the world.\n  I believe that this is, again, a shortsighted, myopic decision on the \nAir Force's part, and I believe we need to be protected.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the \namendment because it proposes to change existing law, and it \nconstitutes legislation on an appropriations bill. Therefore, it \nviolates clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part:\n  ``An amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order \nif changing existing law.''\n  The amendment requires a new determination.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  If not, the Chair will rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new \ndetermination by the relevant Federal official of which actions would \ndegrade given capabilities.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Rohrabacher\n\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the \n     following:\n       Sec. _.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to provide assistance to Pakistan.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to \nH.R. 2685, which would prevent any funds in this bill from being \nprovided to Pakistan.\n  Over the last 15 years, the United States has provided Pakistan with \nover $25 billion, the vast majority of which has gone to its military \nand security services. With this money, which we are giving them at a \ntime when we are borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars, Pakistan is \nusing it to subsidize terrorists, some of whom are targeting Americans.\n  Just as bad, our largess enables Pakistan to repress its own \ncitizens. Our military aid is being used to murder and brutalize the \nBaloch and Sindhi peoples, who are citizens of Pakistan. The Baloch \npeople are being slaughtered as part of a campaign by Pakistan, in \npartnership with China, to steal the natural resources of the Baloch \npeople. With our money, the Pakistanis are, in fact, murdering and \nrepressing their own people, and they are aggressing upon their \nneighbors in Afghanistan and in India.\n  They also have, as we have heard, a much hyped cooperation against \nterrorism. I would suggest to my colleagues that this is a charade. \nThis is the same Pakistan establishment that gave shelter to Osama bin \nLaden for years--Osama bin Laden, the mass murderer of Americans on 9/\n11. The establishment of Pakistan gave him shelter and gave him a place \nto hide all of those years, making a fool out of us as we provided them \nmoney.\n  In case there is any doubt that they knew about Osama bin Laden's \nhiding next-door, they rubbed our noses in their arrogance and \nhostility when they arrested Dr. Afridi, the Pakistani doctor who \nhelped us find Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice. As we talk \ntonight, Dr. Afridi still painfully languishes in a Pakistani dungeon. \nWhile Dr. Afridi is imprisoned, Pakistan should not get 1 cent of aid \nfrom our country. This is an insult to us, and it is an insult to the \nvictims of 9/11 that we are even considering giving money to the \ncountry which hid Osama bin Laden from us, much less giving them \nborrowed money, perhaps, from China.\n  Now we see we borrow money from China and give it to Pakistan, which \nthen gives it to China. In exchange, of course, China is getting the \nnatural resources of Pakistan, of the Baloch people, and they are, in \nfact, getting a pork facility in Qatar.\n  Our aid to Pakistan does not make us safer or the world more \npeaceful. The Pakistanis and other enemies of ours see it as a weakness \non our part. This payoff we hope, of course, will bring more peace and \nwill pay the Pakistanis off. No. It emboldens the Pakistani \nestablishment in their criminal violence against their own people and \nin their destabilizing violence against Afghanistan and India. Let us \nnote: if we want to have a peaceful situation in Afghanistan someday, \nwe cannot keep subsidizing the ISI and the military in Pakistan, which \nis primarily responsible for that mayhem that is going on in \nAfghanistan.\n\n                              {time}  0140\n\n  The people of Afghanistan know that, and our own specialists know \nthat. We are just hoping if we pay people off, things will settle down. \nIt hasn't accomplished that mission. We have emboldened our enemies by \nbeing stupid by giving money to a country like Pakistan, which \nobviously hates our guts, when they hide the man who murdered thousands \nof people on 9/11 and then suggest they didn't know it, and then arrest \nthe person who helped us find that murderer.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join me in prohibiting any more of our \nmoney--especially borrowed money, as we are borrowing it today--from \ngoing to these people in Pakistan, the leadership who are committing \ncrimes against us.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Nugent\n\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to retire conventionally armed air launched cruise \n     missiles (AGM-86 C/D).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n[[Page H4133]]\n\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Chairman, I offer a very simple amendment that would \nhelp keep America's strategic forces strong and robust. My amendment \nwould make sure that the U.S. Air Force keeps the air-launched cruise \nmissile in their arsenal. That is the AGM-86 and its variants C and D.\n  The replacement missile, which I agree needs to happen, the long-\nrange standoff weapon, has faced continuous delays. At this point, the \nreplacement missile still remains years and years away from fielding.\n  I would like to applaud Chairman Frelinghuysen and the committee for \ntaking action in light of the numerous setbacks and delays of this \nprogram by appropriately rephasing funds in the underlying bill.\n  With such development uncertainty, I am disappointed to say that \nfurther delays are almost guaranteed.\n  In this high-threat environment, with heightened Russian aggression, \ntheir violations of the INF Treaty, which are now public, and also \nhostile Chinese adventurism in the South Pacific, we need to ensure \nthat this Nation's defense is without a gap.\n  We simply can't afford to take these weapons out of the arsenal at \nthis current moment until a replacement is up and operational. It is \ncritically important that we maintain our existing inventory.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. NUGENT. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman \nfrom Florida for yielding.\n  Let me say, we admire his strong conviction and advocacy for this \nprogram. We are prepared to accept his amendment with the understanding \nthat we will need to study and discuss it with the Air Force to \nunderstand its full impact.\n  Mr. NUGENT. I absolutely appreciate the chairman doing that and would \nlove to work with him.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. NUGENT. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Nugent).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Forbes\n\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __ (a) Notwithstanding section 8005 and 9003, of the \n     unobligated funds authorized to be appropriated in fiscal \n     year 2016 and made available in this Act, $3,500,000,000 is \n     available to transfer to the National Sea-Based Deterrence \n     Fund established by section 2218a of title 10, United States \n     Code, as authorized by subsection (b) of section 1022 of \n     Public Law 113-291.\n\n  Mr. FORBES (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous \nconsent that we waive the reading of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 303, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, this is the second part of a two-part \namendment that deals with the sea-based deterrence fund. We began this \n4 weeks ago when the Armed Services Committee put in this fund. We, at \nthat particular point in time, transferred $1.4 billion to the fund. In \naddition to that, we gave authorities for additional moneys to be \ntransferred by the Department of Defense. Four weeks ago, we had 375 \nMembers who voted in favor of that provision. When it was challenged on \nthe floor a few hours ago, we had 321 Members who have supported that. \nAll of the same individuals are supporting this fund that did so \nearlier.\n  I could repeat all that, but we have already done that, so I would \njust say all of the arguments we had earlier and all of the people who \nsupported it then continue to support it now. I hope the will of the \nHouse will prevail and that the amendment will be accepted. If not, I \nhope it will be adopted by the House.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since its enactment, the African Growth and Opportunity \n     Act has been the centerpiece of trade relations between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa and has enhanced trade, \n     investment, job creation, and democratic institutions \n     throughout Africa.\n       (2) Trade and investment, as facilitated by the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act, promote economic growth, \n     development, poverty reduction, democracy, the rule of law, \n     and stability in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (3) Trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa \n     has more than tripled since the enactment of the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, and United States direct \n     investment in sub-Saharan Africa has grown almost six-fold.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the United States to engage \n     and compete in emerging markets in sub-Saharan African \n     countries, to boost trade and investment between the United \n     States and sub-Saharan African countries, and to renew and \n     strengthen the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n       (5) The long-term economic security of the United States is \n     enhanced by strong economic and political ties with the \n     fastest-growing economies in the world, many of which are in \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (6) It is a goal of the United States to further integrate \n     sub-Saharan African countries into the global economy, \n     stimulate economic development in Africa, and diversify \n     sources of growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (7) To that end, implementation of the Agreement on Trade \n     Facilitation of the World Trade Organization would strengthen \n     regional integration efforts in sub-Saharan Africa and \n     contribute to economic growth in the region.\n       (8) The elimination of barriers to trade and investment in \n     sub-Saharan Africa, including high tariffs, forced \n     localization requirements, restrictions on investment, and \n     customs barriers, will create opportunities for workers, \n     businesses, farmers, and ranchers in the United States and \n     sub-Saharan African countries.\n       (9) The elimination of such barriers will improve \n     utilization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \n     strengthen regional and global integration, accelerate \n     economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, and enhance the trade \n     relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103.
