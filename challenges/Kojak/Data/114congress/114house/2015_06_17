The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, you are in the presence of greatness. No, \nnot me, but I am flattered if that was your first thought. Rather, I \nspeak of my excellent grandson, who has come to Washington and to the \nfloor of the House of Representatives to see his grandpa at work.\n  Tonight, Luisito, who is 12, will be my escort, along with his \ngrandma, at the annual White House picnic for Members of Congress and \ntheir families. It would take way more than the allotted 5 minutes to \nenumerate all of the reasons for this grandfather's pride, so let me \njust say I am looking forward to showing him off at tonight's \ngathering.\n  But more than tonight's picnic, what I am really looking forward to \nis Father's Day. This Sunday, in Chicago, along with Luisito, my \ngrandson, I will be with his dad and my daughters, who always make the \nold man feel loved.\n  And this Father's Day, I will be especially thankful for being \nallowed to have my family around me, because on Monday, I will be \nvisiting with hundreds of children who cannot be with their dads.\n  On Monday, I will be joining seven of my colleagues in San Antonio to \nvisit the two largest family detention facilities in the country. \nKarnes and Dilley are where moms and their children are being kept \nbehind bars awaiting resolution of their immigration cases seeking \nasylum.\n  Remember a year ago when tens of thousands of children and young \npeople were fleeing violence in three countries in Central America? The \nRepublicans thought that these children would bring this country to its \nknees, and anti-immigration groups organized mobs to protest and keep \nchildren out of detention facilities in their communities. Do you \nremember that?\n  Well, many mothers with small children were also fleeing to the U.S. \nlast year, and they are still being held in detention facilities, which \nare operated by private prison companies in Texas and Pennsylvania. \nThey are detained for the completely lawful act of seeking asylum. My \ncolleagues and I are going to see firsthand what is going on.\n  The minority whip, Mr. Hoyer, and two of my closest allies on the \nfamily detention issue, Ms. Lofgren and Ms. Roybal-Allard, both of \nCalifornia, are going, and we will be hosted by our colleague from \nTexas, Mr. Castro, as we visit the two facilities.\n  I am sure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, and \neven private companies who are contracted to run the facilities and \nprofit from the incarceration of other people, are trying their best to \nmake the conditions of detention for these moms and kids as humane as \nthey can.\n  But, you see, that misses the point. We shouldn't be holding \nvulnerable women and children in detention. We have mothers and small \nchildren living in jail-like facilities with uncertain futures, limited \naccess to legal counsel, and this has been going on for some time, for \nalmost a year for some of them. Even with schools and laundry and TVs, \nthey are still being held behind fences.\n  Moms still have to explain to the youngest children that, no, in \nfact, they do not know when they can leave or whether they will be \ndeported back to the violent countries they fled after months in \ndetention.\n  Children who face trauma, gangs, murder, and sexual assault in their \nneighborhoods were forced to leave alone or in groups or with a parent. \nThey faced all sorts of dangers--smugglers and predators--on the \njourney to northern Mexico, where we know assault, robbery, and rape \nare commonplace. Then they crossed the U.S. border, often with the \nguidance of additional smugglers and criminals, and, following the \nprocess in the U.S. law, presented themselves to authorities to request \nasylum.\n  Now, because we have not put money into our immigration court system \nand, by the way, because we have not created ways for people to come \nhere with visas instead of smugglers, we are all paying a higher price \nto house and feed moms and kids when much cheaper monitoring and \nsupervision options are available. Why? The government feels that \nimprisoning these children\n\n[[Page H4436]]\n\nand moms, even in relatively humane conditions, will be a deterrent to \nothers.\n  But 136 House Democrats, including all 8 Members traveling to Texas \non Monday, have asked the Secretary of Homeland Security to end the \npractice of holding moms and children in detention when there are other \nways to get the job done.\n  The children are paying the highest cost. It doesn't take a \ndevelopmental expert to know that weeks and months in detention in \nprison-like conditions, having already lived through weeks and months \nand years of desperation, are not conducive to good child development.\n  But with my Republican friends, it is usually not the human cost that \nmatters. So let me break it down another way.\n  At $343 per person per day, we are spending $125,000 per detainee per \nyear--$125,000. But the alternatives to detention we could be using \ncost about $5.50 a day, or about $2,000 a year. That is cost savings \nlogic that even in Washington we can understand.\n  Mr. Speaker, regardless of how you feel about the funding and \nregardless of how you feel about immigration or policy issues, Central \nAmerica, or any other issues, you cannot lose sight of the fact that we \nare talking about children.\n  As a father, I will not be able to look at those children without \nseeing my grandson, and they are probably a lot like your children and \ngrandchildren, too. I am going to Texas for myself to see these women \nand children we are holding, and I encourage my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4436-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PAHRUMP VA CLINIC\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, we live in America, a nation conceived in \nliberty and consecrated by the service and sacrifice of our military \nmen and women.\n  Veterans throughout the country depend on our integrity to keep our \npromises. We promise to care for their health after they come home from \nbattle; and yet, too often, we delay making good on the promise.\n  Specifically, why have veterans of Pahrump, Nevada, had the promise \nof a new clinic dangled over their heads for years? Construction was \nfinally approved nearly 1 year ago, and the ground remains unbroken.\n  Later today, the VA is holding a town hall in Pahrump. My staff will \nbe there to hear the latest updates. I hope they will finally have \nsomething to tell the veterans there other than what they have shared \nwith me.\n  Something is very wrong with the VA right now. My advocacy for the \nveterans of my district, especially those who need better and more \naccessible health care now, will not cease.\n  Let's not leave our veterans with more unmet promises. We can do \nbetter for the more than 8,000 veterans of Nye County, Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4436-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            STOP MESSING AROUND WITH FAILED TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. DeFazio) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, 44 days--44 days--that is when the highway \ntrust fund runs dry.\n  Now, this isn't a surprise. We have been kicking the can down the \nroad for awhile. The Republicans have been in charge for 4\\1/2\\ years. \nAnd today, the Ways and Means Committee is, rather begrudgingly, \nholding its first hearing on the issue of the highway trust fund. \nHowever, they have already foreclosed the options.\n  The chairman and the Republican leadership have said: We can't do \nuser fees the way Dwight David Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan did. That \nis off the table. We are going to come up with some other creative or \nphony way to pay for these investments.\n  And they pretty much have said they are going to try to kick the can \ndown the road until the end of December.\n  Well, those sorts of patches won't deal with the massive pothole that \nwe have with our infrastructure in this country: 140,000 bridges need \nrepair or replacement; 40 percent of the service of the National \nHighway System is degraded to the point where you have to dig it up and \nput in a new roadbed, not just pave it over a little bit; $86 billion \nbacklog to bring our transit system just up to a state of good repair--\nnot to build out more options to get people out of congestion and \ntraffic, just to bring the existing system up to a state of repair. It \nis so bad that in the Nation's Capital they are unnecessarily killing \npeople because of a system that is outmoded, obsolete, and defective.\n  But we are the United States of America. We can't afford to invest, \naccording to Republicans. They don't distinguish between investment and \nspending, unless it is the Pentagon, where spending is good. But \nrebuilding American infrastructure, they can't find the money for that.\n  Luckily, there is furious, furious activity going on now. The \nPresident went to the baseball game last week for the first time in 7 \nyears. He showed up at the House baseball game. He came to the \nDemocratic Caucus last week. He sent three secretaries here. He is \ninviting groups down to the White House, bringing them down by \nmotorcade. He is on the phone with John Boehner, his former archenemy. \nThey are furiously, furiously at work.\n  Unfortunately, what they are scheming over is how to undo what we did \nlast week, blocking the last worst trade agreement that America will \never have, saying: We want a new paradigm on trade. No more failed \ntrade policies for this country. It is not working, to just rebuild or \nbuild upon the massive profits of multinational corporations, hoping \nsome of it might trickle down.\n  Actually, it has just led to job exports because they can get 30-\ncent-an-hour labor in Vietnam. They desperately want this agreement. \nAnd Malaysia, hey, the House stripped out the minor restrictions on \nhuman trafficking so that U.S. companies could feel free to go to \nMalaysia.\n  So they are furiously plotting what way they can trick us or somehow \novercome 85 percent of the Democrats in the House caucus here and a \nnumber of Republicans who have concerns about these failed trade deals.\n  Now, just think--just think--if Speaker Boehner, President Obama, and \ncorporate America assembled, were just working to help us find a \nsolution to our crumbling infrastructure, because it is certainly \nimportant to everybody in this country. If we found that solution, if \nwe moved forward with a long-term bill, we could, instead of having to \nargue over assistance for workers who are going to lose their jobs \nbecause of this trade agreement, we could be hiring hundreds of \nthousands of Americans, and not just construction workers. This would \ninvolve manufacturing. For transit, it involves high tech. It involves \nsmall business. It involves minority business enterprises. It involves \nfamily-wage jobs where people can make a living, not getting retrained \nto go to McDonald's because their job was sent to Asia or Mexico or \nsomeplace else.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity. Stop messing around with these \nfailed trade agreements, and let's put our heads together and figure \nout how to pay for a long-term transportation bill and get this country \nmoving again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4436-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4436-H4437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LGBT PRIDE MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. Esty) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, June is national LGBT Pride Month, and so I \nrise today to honor and recognize the determination, advocacy, \ncontributions, and talents of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \nAmericans.\n  I was 15 years old, a high school student in a small town, when I \ngave my first gay rights speech. I did not know in 1975 that I would \none day have the opportunity to be here on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives to support equal rights, but I did know that it is \nwrong to discriminate against fellow Americans because of who they \nlove.\n  And I think I knew on some level that my brother Jamie was gay. I \nwas, and still remain, committed to stand with those who fight bigotry, \ndiscrimination, and violence against those who love another.\n  And looking back, I am so deeply thankful to stand here today and to \ncelebrate the remarkable progress we have made in recent years. That \nprogress is due to the tireless determination and enduring struggle of\n\n[[Page H4437]]\n\nLGBT Americans and allies, like my brother Jamie and my mother, Mitzi \nHenderson.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Don't Ask, Don't Tell is a thing of the past, and it no longer forces \nour men and women in uniform to choose between serving this Nation and \nbeing open about who they are and who they love. Marriage equality is \nnow a reality in 37 States and in Washington, D.C. That covers 70 \npercent of all Americans. During LGBT Pride Month, we celebrate the \nprogress we have made, but we also recommit to the continued fight for \nfull equality.\n  Congress needs to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, ENDA, \nto ensure that no one is fired because of one's gender identity or \nsexual orientation. Congress needs to pass the SAME Act, which I had \nthe honor of helping to introduce, to ensure that all couples can \nreceive the Social Security benefits that they have earned. Congress \nneeds to pass the Respect for Marriage Act so that all couples are \ntreated with equality and fairness no matter where they live or who \nthey love.\n  At this very moment, the pursuit of national marriage equality \ncontinues. The Supreme Court is currently considering a case that \naffords the Court a rare opportunity, the opportunity to make history \nwhile advancing justice. The Court may and--I hope--will rule that the \nConstitution's guarantee of the right to marry extends to same-sex \ncouples throughout the United States.\n  No matter how the Court rules in the days ahead, I know we still have \na long road ahead to advance equal rights for all Americans, but I also \nknow we will prevail. We will prevail because we will continue to have \nthose courageous conversations one at a time. We will prevail because \nwe advocate for something far more powerful than politics; we advocate \nfor love.\n  I am honored to join with Americans across this great country to \ncelebrate national LGBT Pride Month and to stand with those who stand \nup every day to defend the right of all Americans to be proud of who \nthey are, to be proud of who they love, and to proudly work together \nfor the ongoing cause of true equality under the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4437-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 KIPP GENERATIONS COLLEGIATE GRADUATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker and Members, I rise today in \nhonor of the graduates from the KIPP Generations Collegiate High \nSchool, KGC, in Houston, Texas. KIPP is a charter school that partners \nwith our Houston area public school system.\n  Last Sunday, I was honored to speak at their commencement ceremony. I \nhave followed the success of KIPP students for 20 years. From their \nbeginnings in elementary school, Mike Feinberg and his excellent staff \nhave taught thousands of children in Texas. KGC's main focus is to \nbuild a rigorous learning environment to better equip its students for \ncollege.\n  This school has upheld its mission by empowering its graduates to \ntake ownership of their education by approaching learning with \ncuriosity, with a sense of responsibility, and by putting their \nknowledge into action in the service of others. Hailing under the motto \nof ``We Lift as We Climb,'' KGC is truly a model of success for the \nentire country.\n  KGC's values of hope, empowerment, grit, and citizenship are tools \nthat every student needs to succeed in the 21st century. Because of \nthis learning environment, every graduate from this program has been \naccepted into a college or a university. KGC continues to perform well \nabove the State in district averages.\n  I would like to congratulate the students, the parents, the teachers, \nand the administrators for their success now and in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4437-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4437-H4445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer), the distinguished Democratic whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. I was glad to be here with \nJim Walsh.\n  I looked at the list. As I look around--I am not sure this is \naccurate--but I saw in the list there are about, I would say, 30 names \non this list, and I think there are only two on the list, although that \nmay be not accurate, with whom I have not served. Ron, you are one of \nthem, and I think Lou Frey. Where is Lou?\n  Mr. FREY. Over here.\n  Mr. HOYER. The two of you, I think, are the only two former Members \nwith whom I have not served.\n  And, unfortunately, I never served with Speaker Michel. I served with \nMinority Leader Michel, but I wish I had served with Speaker Michel, \none of the great Americans with whom I have served.\n  I think Bob Michel is the quintessential example of what a Member of \nCongress ought to be: civil, committed to his party and to his \nprinciples, but committed above all to his country and to his family.\n  Bob, it was an honor to serve with you, and it is an honor to be your \nfriend. Thank you very much for your service.\n  To all of you who made this institution what it is today and those of \nus who are continuing to make it what it ought to be, we are not doing \nthat job very well, for the most part. Although, I will say this, that \nSpeaker Boehner is trying to make that happen and, to the extent that \nwe work together, we do. But it is harder and harder, as you know, \nbecause the ideological differences between the parties have become \nmore substantial than they were, certainly when I came here in 1981.\n  Jim Blanchard and I served on the Financial Services Committee \ntogether. It was then the Banking Committee. But we are trying to work \ntogether to do what is best for our country. I think the country \nbelieves its board of directors is not working nearly as well as it \nought to.\n  I want to thank all of you for staying engaged and for continuing to \nsend the message to your colleagues, your friends, your neighbors who \nhave great respect for you. And you have something that very few people \nhave. You know, there are only about a little short of 11,000 of us who \nhave served in this House of Representatives since the founding of the \nRepublic, which is an\n\n[[Page H4438]]\n\namazingly small number in a country that is now 320 million, give or \ntake, people.\n  So it was a wonderful, wonderful honor for us to be elected here. As \nyou know, we can't be appointed to the House of Representatives.\n  And as I look around this room on both sides of the aisle, \nRepublicans and Democrats, so many people with whom I worked very, very \nclosely, positively and productively in the Congress of the United \nStates, it is always a privilege to welcome you back. And, of course, \nso many of you--Ron Sarasin is a permanent fixture, of course. We see \nRon through his activity on the historic society working here on a very \nregular basis to make sure that Americans understand the history and \nthe importance of their Capitol. Ron, thank you very much for that \nservice and that leadership.\n  Mr. Chris Shays is coming into the Chamber. Hi, Chris. Good to see \nyou.\n  Mr. SHAYS. We haven't voted yet, have we?\n  Mr. HOYER. Now, there are some of you I need--and I am not sure that \nI would get all of you--but we haven't voted yet.\n  I want to thank all of you for staying involved, staying true to the \nresponsibility the people gave you; and when you no longer had that \nresponsibility, in terms of being an elected Member of this body, you \ncontinued your fidelity to what this body means, particularly this \nbody. I think all of us are very proud that we served, as we all say, \nin the people's House.\n  This was the House that was designed to be most responsive to the \npassions and the fears and the aspirations and the hopes, the good and \nthe bad, of the American people, where every 2 years we had to re-up. \nAnd I think that will never change. It will never change, first of all, \nbecause it was a good theory. And, secondly, it will never change \nbecause the Senators don't want to give us a free shot at them. So, you \nknow, you have got the principle and then the practical combined in \nthat way.\n  But I always enjoy being with you, saying hello to you. Certainly my \noffice, which is, as you know, just one floor down here in the Capitol, \nif we can do anything for any of you at any point of time, if you need \na place to hang your jacket or make a telephone call or we have got a \nconference room that is vacant from time to time, you can use that. It \nwas a privilege and an honor to serve with all of you and to continue \nto be your friends. God bless you. Thank you very much.\n  Let me pay special honor to my Maryland colleague, Bev Byron. Jim \nMoran, I think, and John may be the most recent new Members of the \nformer Members. Maybe some of the rest of you, I think. But Bev Byron \nand Mike McIntyre.\n  Bev Byron and I started out--well, she may have been there 1 or 2 \nyears before I was there. But in 1962, we started in the Young \nDemocrats together. Now, she wants me to sit down. She is saying ``now \nyou are going to meddling.'' We love you, Bev. I love you. Thank you.\n  Mr. WALSH. Mr. Whip, on behalf of all of my colleagues here in the \nU.S. Association of Former Members of Congress, let me say thank you \nfor your loyalty to this group. You always come year after year. You \nshare your wisdom. You give us a sense of what is happening, and you \nconnect we, the former Members, with the current. And it is a great \nvalue to all of us. Thank you.\n  I now call upon the distinguished president of the association, \nBarbara Kennelly, the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. KENNELLY. Thank you, Jim.\n  I was pleased to represent Connecticut for 17 years.\n  Mr. WALSH. Pardon me.\n  Ms. KENNELLY. All those little States up there.\n  And thank you, Leader Hoyer, for being with us this morning. I can \nalways know where your seniority is because I was one behind you, and \nyou were fortunate and you stayed.\n  Anyway, we begin this meeting, and I thank everybody who is here with \nus this morning as we begin this wonderful day of former Members.\n  We are back in this revered Chamber, which we all loved and worked in \nand had really such an honor to be here, and it is an honor to be here \nagain today to present the 45th annual report of the United States \nAssociation of Former Members of Congress.\n  I will be joined by some of our colleagues in reporting on the \nactivities and projects of our organization since our last report, \nwhich was last July. Wait until you see how far we have come even since \nlast year.\n  I first would like the Clerk to call the roll.\n  Mr. Blanchard of Michigan\n  Ms. Buerkle of New York\n  Mr. Bustamante of Texas\n  Ms. Byron of Maryland\n  Mr. Carnahan of Missouri\n  Mr. Carr of Michigan\n  Mr. Clement of Tennessee\n  Ms. Dahlkemper of Pennsylvania\n  Mr. Edwards of Texas\n  Mr. Frey of Florida\n  Mr. Frost of Texas\n  Mr. Gingrey of Georgia\n  Mr. Hertel of Michigan\n  Mr. Hughes of New Jersey\n  Ms. Kennelly of Connecticut\n  Mr. Kolbe of Arizona\n  Mr. Konnyu of California\n  Mr. Lancaster of North Carolina\n  Mr. Lungren of California\n  Mr. McIntyre of North Carolina\n  Mr. Mezvinsky of Iowa\n  Mr. Moore of Kansas\n  Mr. Moran of Virginia\n  Ms. Morella of Maryland\n  Mr. Sarasin of Connecticut\n  Mr. Sarpalius of Texas\n  Mr. Shays of Connecticut\n  Mr. Skaggs of Colorado\n  Mr. Stearns of Florida\n  Mr. Sundquist of Tennessee\n  Mr. Tanner of Tennessee\n  Mr. Tierney of Massachusetts\n  Mr. Turner of Texas\n  Mr. Walsh of New York.\n  Mr. WALSH. The Chair announces that 34 former Members of Congress \nhave responded to their names.\n  Ms. KENNELLY. Thank you all for joining us today.\n  Our association was chartered by Congress, and one requirement of \nthat charter is for us to report once a year to Congress about our \nactivities. Wait until you see how many activities that we have.\n  Many of you have joined us for several years on this occasion, and \nthere will be numerous programs and projects with which by now many of \nyou have become very familiar. This is a sign of our association's \nstability and purpose.\n  We are extremely proud of our 45-year history, of creating lasting \nand purposeful programs to teach about Congress and representative \ngovernment, and of our ability to take longstanding projects and to \nexpand them and to improve them. We will report on our program in just \na minute.\n  During our annual meeting today, we will honor two of our colleagues \nwith well-deserved recognition. In a few minutes, we will celebrate Lou \nFrey's accomplishments with our Lifetime Achievement Award. And later \ntoday, during a luncheon in his honor, we will bestow the 2015 \nDistinguished Service Award to our dear friend, Amo Houghton. I \ncertainly hope all of you in attendance and those coming later can join \nus for the luncheon since Amo has been an inspiration and a mentor to \nso many of us.\n  While the ceremony is not going to take place right now, I do want to \nread into the Record the inscription of the plaque Amo Houghton will \nreceive today:\n\n       The 2015 Distinguished Service Award is presented by the \n     U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress to Congressman \n     Amo Houghton.\n       Congressman Houghton of New York is known for his civility, \n     intellect, and compassion. Amo valiantly served our country \n     as a United States Marine and for 18 years as a Member of \n     Congress. While serving in Congress, Amo was relied upon by \n     both Republican and Democratic Members for his keen mind, \n     unassuming nature, and unquestioned integrity to help find \n     solutions when others only saw impasse.\n       He set the standard for good citizenship and a commitment \n     to the common good and continues to do so in his support of \n     educational and philanthropic endeavors. He is a voice of \n     reason that continues to resonate with all of those who care \n     deeply about Congress and the ideals of representative \n     democracy. His colleagues from both sides of the aisle salute \n     him as a distinguished and dedicated public servant.\n       Washington, D.C.\n\n  Please do join us this afternoon because I think the luncheon is \ngoing to be absolutely wonderful, and I hope you all can attend. I know \nthere are\n\n[[Page H4439]]\n\nothers that couldn't be with us this morning that will be with us this \nnoontime.\n  Now, back to our report. Our association is bipartisan. It was \nfounded in 1970 and chartered by Congress in 1983. The purpose of the \nUnited States Association of Former Members of Congress is to promote \npublic service and strengthen democracy, abroad and in the United \nStates.\n  About 600 former Members, Senators and Representatives, belong to \nthis association. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents are united \nin this organization in their desire to teach about Congress and the \nimportance of representative democracy.\n  We are proud to have been chartered by Congress, and we are just as \nproud to take no funding from Congress. All the activities which we are \nabout to describe are financed via membership dues, program-specific \ngrants, sponsors, or via our fundraising dinner that you are going to \nhear about very shortly.\n  Our finances are sound, our projects fully funded, and our most \nrecent audit by an outside accountant confirmed that we are running our \nassociation in a fiscally sound, responsible, and transparent manner.\n  It has been another successful, active, and rewarding year. We have \ncontinued our work of serving as a liaison between the current Congress \nand legislatures overseas. We have created partnerships with highly \nrespected institutions in the area of democracy building and election \nmonitoring. We have developed new projects and are expanding others. \nWe, again, have sent dozens of bipartisan teams of former Members of \nCongress to teach about public service and representative democracy at \nuniversities and high schools both in the United States and abroad.\n  Our most important domestic undertaking is teaching America's next \ngeneration about their government and responsibility of citizenship. \nAfter our report here in the Chamber this morning, we will inaugurate a \nnew association project aimed at bringing civic education back to \npublic school classrooms. The focus on civics has been ingrained in our \nassociation's DNA for over 30 years, most prominently as a part of our \nCongress to Campus program.\n  I will yield to my good friend, David Skaggs of Colorado, who for a \nnumber of years, when our association was not able to administer this \nprogram on its own, stepped up to the plate and not only kept Congress \nto Campus going, but expanded it significantly.\n  David.\n  Mr. SKAGGS. Thank you very much, Barbara.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to report on the Congress to Campus \nprogram. Although I have been affiliated with it for a long time, I \nwant to recognize the co-chairs of the program who couldn't be with us \nthis morning, Larry LaRocco of Idaho and Jack Buechner of Missouri. \nThey have done a terrific job over the years in moving this program \nalong.\n\n  This program, as many of us have participated in it well know, sends \nbipartisan teams of former Members to colleges and universities across \nthe country and around the world. It engages our Members from all over \nthe country in educating the next generation of leaders about the \ninstitution of Congress, the duties and responsibilities that we have \nas Members, and most importantly, the value of public service.\n  Since our visits always involve a bipartisan team, they demonstrate, \nI think, pretty well that political debate can and should be \nrespectful, dynamic, and courteous.\n  Former Members volunteer their time leading classes, meeting with \nstudent leaders, meeting with community organizations, joining with \nstudent government meetings--all manner of activities on campus. The \nschools are encouraged to offer the program to the entire campus \ncommunity to demonstrate how we do our work in the Congress.\n  I have gone on many of these trips, most recently this spring with \nour former colleague Pete Smith of Vermont, on a visit to Evergreen \nState College in Washington State. I was again reminded of how valuable \nthese programs are, and I learned a great deal from exchanges with Pete \nduring the course of that visit.\n  Speaking to the students renews our hope, I think, in the future of \nour country, and I hope and believe that Members will get as much out \nof this as the students do.\n  We are delighted to report this year that we added some new schools \nto the program, as well as returning to many of our old favorites. \nDuring the last academic year, we visited over 25 schools, including \nAbilene Christian, Boston University, Palm Beach State, Tufts \nUniversity, the U.S. Naval Academy, and Washington State University, to \nname just a few. Over 40 former Members participated, including several \nformer Members who just left office last January, so it is great to get \nthem involved very quickly.\n  I want to thank everyone who made a visit and, most of all, those \nthat have donated their time pro bono to this very important program of \nthe association. I think Members will tell you that it gives them an \nopportunity in a very meaningful way to continue their public service.\n  I hope all our colleagues, particularly those who may not yet have \nparticipated in the program, will consider making a visit. It is an \nopportunity to renew old friendships or make new ones. Maybe, if you \ncan't make a visit yourself, you can put us in touch with your former \nalma mater or a school in your old district so that we can take the \nprogram there. Sharon Witiw, who is seated to my left, runs the program \nfor the association and can provide all the information you may need.\n  We especially want to recognize our continued relationship with the \nStennis Center for Public Service and its associate director, Brother \nRoger. The folks at the Stennis Center have been a fantastic partner in \nkeeping the program on track, both logistically and financially.\n  We have expanded the program internationally. There were two \ndelegations to the U.K. in the past year for weeklong visits with \nhundreds of British students. Members participated even in townhall \nmeetings in Britain. I hate to think of how much more fun that is than \ntownhall meetings here.\n  It is reported that these visits have been one of the highlights of \nthe students' semesters, and we want to thank Philip Davies with the \nBritish Library in London for all he does to make the program work over \nthere.\n  We have also incorporated Congress-to-Campus-like activities in a \nnumber of other international programs, including the Congressional \nStudy Group on Germany. With the support of the German Embassy here in \nWashington, we were able to have a weeklong Congress and Bundestag to \nCampus program where former Members joined with members of the \nBundestag and met with students from dozens of universities in the \nnortheast.\n  Last fall, a new program was piloted using technology to reach a new \nconstituency. Thanks to an in-kind grant from iCohere, we had three 90-\nminute Congress to Campus webinar sessions to an audience of community \ncolleges across the Nation.\n  The webinar platform allowed students from all over the country to \nparticipate and ask questions of the bipartisan panels of former \nMembers. We are currently adapting the webinar platform to also serve \nhigh school government classes around the country and hope to have that \nprogram up and running this fall. Please consider participating in one \nof these programs that do not necessarily involve the 3-day commitment \nof a campus visit.\n  The association has also continued to support the People to People \nprogram, which brings hundreds of high school students to the Capitol \nto learn about leadership and American Government. Several times over \nthe past year, former Members have keynoted those sessions, and we have \nheard that many staffers on the Hill were first inspired into public \nservice through their People to People experience.\n  Thanks to everyone who has helped make this program the hallmark \nprogram of the association. An informed and engaged citizenry is \nabsolutely essential if our democracy is going to work, and this \nprogram really contributes to that end.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Ms. KENNELLY. Thank you, David. Thank you for all you have done for \none of our most successful programs.\n  I can remember I got excited when I heard about these programs, and I \nreally wanted to be part of it. At one time,\n\n[[Page H4440]]\n\nNancy Johnson and I went to Annapolis, and I wondered if Annapolis \nstudents would be so interested in two women of age spending 2\\1/2\\ \ndays with them.\n  We had the best times, absolutely; and I really urge you to go. Nancy \nand I were always friendly, but it really gives you a chance to spend \n2\\1/2\\ days with someone from the other party who you might have known \nor you might not have known, and you will enjoy it.\n  We have another new project, and the purpose of the Common Ground \nProject is to involve citizens in a dialogue about the issues of the \nday and have a vigorous debate that doesn't shy away from being \npartisan but, at the same time, manages to be productive.\n  To give you more background on this Common Ground Project, I invite \nmy colleague from New York, former Member Ann Marie Buerkle, to share \nher report.\n  Ann Marie.\n  Ms. BUERKLE. Thank you very much, Barbara, Mr. Speaker.\n  One of the many joys of being active with this remarkable, effective \nassociation is that it brings together Republicans and Democrats in our \nmany programs, whether it is a part of our board of directors, during \nour annual meeting and charitable government tournament, for panel \ndiscussions, as well as other presentations. All that this association \ndoes is bipartisan. Our board is divided evenly between Republicans and \nDemocrats, and our leadership rotates between the two parties.\n  Currently, our Congress, indeed, our country, is going through a \nperiod of polarization and partisanship. While we don't leave our \npolitical beliefs at the door when participating in association \nactivities, we pride ourselves in creating an environment where an \nacross-the-aisle dialogue is not only possible, but also the norm. We \nhave institutionalized this approach in a program that we call the \nCommon Ground Project.\n\n  The purpose of the Common Ground Project is to create venues and \nevents where a bipartisan approach can involve the public in a dialogue \non the issues of the day. Some of our longstanding programs, most \nimportantly the Congress to Campus program we just heard about, already \nfit neatly into the goals of the Common Ground Project. There are other \nadditional undertakings that were specifically created to further this \nproject.\n  We are extremely proud of our partnership with the National Archives, \nwhich, since 2010, has brought dozens of former Members--again, from \nboth sides of the aisle--together with the public for panel discussions \nfor a productive as well as a respectful dialogue. I have been \nprivileged to participate in a number of our Common Ground Project \nactivities, including Congress to Campus, as well as the National \nArchives panel series. I believe these dialogues are incredibly \nimportant.\n  Since our last report to Congress, we continue to offer the public a \nnumber of opportunities to participate in conversations about the \nissues that concern our Nation. At the National Archives, former \nMembers held discussions about the midterm elections, our current \nelectoral system, and some of the issues that have caused this current \npartisan divide. Other public forums included presentations on money in \npolitics, foreign affairs and international trade issues, the U.S. \nConstitution, and the accomplishments of women in leadership.\n  As David Skaggs reported earlier, the Congress to Campus program \nincluded, for the first time, a number of webinars that reached a very \nspecific audience, in this case, community college students, and gave \nthem an opportunity to interact online with our bipartisan panels of \nformer Members of Congress. After some introductory remarks, most of \nthe webinar time was committed to giving the students an opportunity to \nask questions online. We were thrilled with the positive response to \nthis new initiative and believe that this concept will translate into \nfurthering the goals of the Common Ground Project.\n  Using modern technology, we can effectively reach audiences all \nacross the United States of America to engage with them in a meaningful \ndialogue. This is a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate the great \nbenefit that comes from differing opinions being aired, discussed, and \ndissected in order to find that common ground.\n  We will explore, over the next year, additional ways to make use of \nwebinars as a means of bringing the public together with our former \nMember teams. Our initial plan includes reaching out to high school \naudiences, in addition to college students. The program could then be \nexpanded to include other constituencies who would be gathered in front \nof the computer, again, to participate in a webinar. This would allow \nus to include, among others, the VFW, chambers of commerce, and many \ngroups who may not have access to an in-person discussion.\n  There are quite a number of other activities that contribute to our \nCommon Ground Project. Unfortunately, the list is too long this morning \nto include them all here. It is our association's most important \nundertaking to reengage the public in a political discourse that is \nproductive, respectful, and yields solutions rather than sound bites.\n  We, as former Members, can contribute greatly towards a better \nunderstanding of how the important issues of our day play out on \nCapitol Hill, and I view it as one of the responsibilities that comes \nwith the privilege of having served in Congress. We have an opportunity \nto bridge the political gap and show the American people that we can \nhave deeply held convictions and still have discussions and debates \nthat find not only the common ground, but also seek solutions.\n  Thank you so much.\n  Ms. KENNELLY. Thank you, Ann Marie. And thank you very much for being \nwilling to be active in our association and do a number of things for \nus.\n  Ann Marie was on the panel. As you know, we have a very close \nrelationship with the Archives. And we, our organization and the \nArchives, had a panel 2 days after election. And this shows that we \nreally can be bipartisan. There were various views that came forth in \nthat discussion, but it was absolutely wonderful. We had a full \naudience. And it just shows that bipartisanship can work, even 2 days \nafter election. Some of us were happy, and some of us weren't.\n  Another example of how powerful and productive bipartisanship can be \nis our annual Congressional Golf Tournament. It is chaired by our past \npresident, Dennis Hertel of Michigan, and by fellow board member Ken \nKramer of Colorado.\n  I will now yield the floor to Dennis Hertel to give us a brief report \nabout our charitable golf tournament.\n  Dennis.\n  Mr. HERTEL. Thank you, Barbara. I am still more comfortable over \nhere.\n  Congratulations, Barbara, on this great turnout today. And the annual \ndinner, what a great success it was, better than ever. You and Jim \nWalsh have done just fantastic and what you have accomplished for the \nassociation.\n  Eight years ago, we took a 35-year-old tradition, our annual golf \ntournament, which pits Republicans against Democrats, and gave it a new \nand much bigger mission. We converted it into a charitable golf \ntournament to aid severely wounded vets returning from the battlefields \nof Iraq and Afghanistan. Our beneficiaries--Warfighter Sports, a \nprogram of Disabled Sports USA, and Tee It Up for the Troops--use golf \nand other sports to help our wounded veterans readjust to life after \nsustaining severe injuries. They involve the entire family in the \nsport, and they provide equipment and training.\n  Our seventh annual event was held last year on July 28 at the Army \nNavy Country Club. And we have had more Congressmen, active Members, \nattend our tournament than all of these other golf tournaments that you \nhear about in Washington, D.C. There might be more in Washington, D.C., \nthan any other place in the country as far as fundraisers, but we have \nmore Members turn out for our cause.\n  All together, these tournaments have raised over a half million \ndollars for these outstanding programs. During each of our past \ntournaments, we have had several dozen current and former Members from \nboth sides of the aisle come together to support our wounded troops \nthat day and throughout the year; and they have met with dozens of \nwounded warriors, many of whom play in our foursomes. Some double \namputees included in their numbers have hit\n\n[[Page H4441]]\n\nfurther and straighter than a lot of our members--certainly me. It is \nan incredibly humbling, rewarding, and memorable experience to spend a \nday in the presence of these inspiring men and women.\n  I want to thank everyone in the association, particularly Sharon \nWitiw, as well as Ken Kramer, our tournament's co-chair. Sharon just \ndoes a tremendous job week in and week out working on this all year \nlong, and Ken has just been the mainstay of the program.\n  Equally important, I am happy to report we have again secured the \nleadership of two of our most outstanding current Members who are co-\nchairs to help us lead this effort: Congressman Jimmy Duncan of \nTennessee and Congressman Gene Green of Texas. So some co-chairmen that \nmany of us have served with have just been tremendous in opening up \ntheir offices and staff and working with us all the time.\n  Gene replaces our past Democratic co-chair, Mike McIntyre of North \nCarolina.\n  Mike, please stand up. We want to thank you so much for your hard \nwork as co-chair.\n  Mike really put us up on the map and got us higher as far as Members' \nparticipation, and it has really made a great difference. And Jimmy \nDuncan and Gene Green, we just can't thank them enough for what they \nhave been doing and their constant encouragement of Members to come and \nplay with us.\n  That brings me to the point of our former Members. We are having, for \nthe first time in the last few tournaments, more current Members play \nin the golf tournament than former Members when we are sponsoring it. \nSo I hope that the great turnout today is an indication of having more \npeople come to our golf tournament. Even if you don't want to play \ngolf, just come and enjoy the day with our veterans. It is so \nconvenient. It is right here at Army Navy. Don't worry about your skill \nlevel, you know. It is an honor for us to help such an incredibly \ndeserving group in this small way.\n  The next tournament will be July 27. We call it ``The Members'' \ntournament. But unlike the Masters, you don't need to play at the pro \nlevel to have a successful and enjoyable day. All you have to do is \nshow up and help raise some money. I want to stress that, while this \nevent is called a tournament, no one should be worried about their \nscore or their skill level to participate. I am certainly an example of \nthat.\n  This event is 100 percent about helping wounded warriors. Nobody \ncares what your handicap is. Your individual score is not kept because \nwe have a scramble format, which I am very much in favor of; so, you \nknow, they don't really know how you did. But if you hit one good, they \ncan use it, including a putt.\n  So both current and former Members give it their time and attention. \nIf you only play golf once a year, this should be the day you do it.\n  So I want to thank all of you so much for all the help. And if you \ncan play or if you can bring us a new sponsor, please let us know.\n  Thanks very much.\n  Ms. KENNELLY. Thank you, Dennis, for this report.\n  We are so honored that we can play a small role in the rehabilitation \nof these amazing men and women. And as a golfer, I can tell you it \ndoesn't matter if your handicap is 10 or if your handicap is 27; and I \nhave been both places. And I promise you, in a scramble, no matter what \nMarty Russo does, he doesn't always win.\n  In addition to the domestic programs we have just described, our \nassociation also has a very active and far-reaching international \nfocus. We conduct programs focused on Europe and Asia; we bring current \nMembers of Congress together with their peers in legislatures overseas; \nand we work with the Department of State to talk about representative \ndemocracy in our office with audiences abroad. To me, this is becoming \none of the most important programs.\n  As I remember, when I first became active in Association of Former \nMembers, you really did not see many sitting Members of Congress. It \nwas our association. We have expanded this, and as a result, a number \nof Members take part in our organizations that do go abroad and do \nstudy things abroad.\n  The other day, the German Marshall Fund had put out a new report, and \nPete put together a get-together. I was so impressed. We had scholars \nabout Germany. We had a very interesting audience as well as the German \nMarshall Fund there.\n  But what really impressed me was the number of Members--and this was \none of the busiest days when they were doing the trade legislation--the \nMembers that were attending; and even when they had to go out, they \ncame back. My feeling is, if we get this new business of having present \nMembers be active in our association, that means they will know our \nassociation before they are former Members.\n  Psychologically, this is very good because they bring very new \ninformation, but not only that, we are not trying to get them to be \nMembers. After they have left or lost, they know about us. I think this \nwill be very healthy for the organization.\n  One of our most valued partners in these undertakings is the Canadian \nAssociation of Former Parliamentarians. Our friendship with our \ncolleagues in Ottawa goes back to 1987 when a group of former \nparliamentarians came and visited with us to learn about our \nassociation and our projects and used the lessons learned to create \ntheir own association in Canada.\n  For almost 30 years, we have been friends and partners and we are \nhonored to have as our guest today David Daubney, a former member of \nthe Canadian Parliament and an officer of our sister organization.\n  Welcome, David, if you are here this morning. Thank you, David. We \nare so pleased you can be with us.\n  I have not had the opportunity, and former Members have asked me to \ngo up to Ottawa to join in their big event, like our dinner, and I got \ninto the airport in Ottawa, and that is the day that they had a very \nsad bomb scare.\n  Very fortunately, I didn't get out of the airport because if I had, I \nwouldn't have gotten home for a couple of days because the airport was \nlocked down. I was sorry I couldn't be there. I thank you for the good \ntimes we have had in the past year with the Canadian delegation. You \nare going to hear more about that.\n  Via the former Members association, I have met with numerous groups \nof legislators from emerging democracies who have come to Washington \nfor a better understanding of our representative government and our \nform of democracy. These conversations and meetings are always two-way \nstreets. I have to say that I learn as much, if not more, from our \nvisitors than they do from me.\n  Just last month, our association hosted at our offices a large group \nof young professionals from ASEAN, countries including Vietnam and \nIndonesia, and we had a great dialogue about running for office and \nserving our constituency.\n  Our association also has a long-standing partnership with a great NGO \nLegacy International, bringing young professionals from the Middle East \nand north Africa to the United States. Our most recent group just \ncompleted their 6 weeks in Washington. They stay 6 weeks.\n  The group is composed of young professionals from Morocco and \nTunisia. Most of these visitors work in the NGO sector in their \ncountries, and they come to the United States to learn about the \ninteraction between government and nongovernmental sectors.\n  I would like to take this moment to thank former Congresswoman Bev \nByron because she has been very, very generous in opening up her house \nto students for dinner, and it is much appreciated by the association.\n  The goal of this program is to seek a better understanding between \ncultures and establish an avenue of dialogue between nations. It is a \nunique opportunity to create a constructive political and cultural \ndiscourse between the United States and north Africa. I am very proud \nthat our association is part of this vital dialogue.\n  In addition to hosting visiting delegations, our association \norganizes former Member delegations to travel overseas and engage \nstudents, government officials, NGOs, and corporate representatives. \nYou have already heard about the Congress to Campus programs and the \nvery international component that it has.\n  We brought the program to numerous universities in countries such as \nTurkey, the United Kingdom, other overseas delegations; we call them \nExDELs.\n\n[[Page H4442]]\n\nWe have traveled to countries where a dialogue is often difficult, but \nnonetheless incredibly important--for example, China, a country to \nwhich we have now sent seven ExDELs over the past 4 years.\n  In addition to these former Member international programs, our \nassociation supports Congress' international outreach in a meaningful, \nproductive, and bipartisan way via our congressional study groups. \nThese are all programs that involve current Members of Congress, and I \nnow invite my good friend and my predecessor, and I thank Connie for \nhelping me begin my presidency, and I enjoyed her presidency, Connie \nMorella.\n  Ms. MORELLA. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you very much, \nBarbara. I just want to say it has been great working side by side with \nyou for the 2 years when you were vice president, and you are doing a \ngreat job. It is nice to continue to be involved with all the wonderful \nprograms that the former Members offer.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to briefly speak to you about the work \nof Congressional Study Groups on Germany, Japan, Turkey, and Europe. \nThey are flagship international programs of the former Members of \nCongress for over three decades. The study groups are independent, \nbipartisan legislative exchanges for current Members of Congress and \ntheir senior staff, and they serve as educational forums and invaluable \ntools for international dialogue with the goal of creating better \nunderstanding and cooperation between the United States and its most \nimportant strategic and economic partners.\n  Each study group has a membership roster of between 75 and 125 \nMembers of Congress, current Members of Congress, and is led by a \nbipartisan, bicameral pair of co-chairs. I want to acknowledge the \nservice of all of our co-chairs for their hard work and dedication to \nthese critical programs, and I hope they are watching.\n  The Congressional Study Group on Germany is led by Senator Jeff \nSessions, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Representative Charlie Dent, and \nRepresentative Ted Deutch.\n  The Congressional Study Group on Japan is led by Senator Mazie \nHirono, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Representative Diana DeGette, and \nRepresentative Billy Long.\n  The Congressional Study Group on Turkey is led by Representative \nGerry Connolly and Representative Ed Whitfield.\n  The Congressional Study Group on Europe is led by Senator John \nBoozman, Senator Chris Murphy, Representative Jeff Fortenberry, and \nRepresentative Peter Welch.\n  Our co-chairs are true leaders, who not only serve in their role at \nofficial study group events, but are also called on by various \nembassies and countless outside organizations to speak on panels, \nattend roundtables, and meet with visiting delegations.\n  The study group model focuses on high-level dialogue on pressing \nissues surrounding security, energy, trade questions, and financial \nquestions that affect our key bilateral and multilateral relationships \nwith our partners abroad.\n  Programming celebrates active discussion among all participants, \navoiding lengthy speeches or formal presentations, in order to create \nthe kind of atmosphere that promotes personal connections. We believe \nthat the network of peers created via our programs have acted to renew \nand expand areas of mutual cooperation.\n  The congressional study groups are not the only program dedicated to \nthis mission, but they are unique in their year-round outreach to \nCapitol Hill. Unlike other formats, we provide long-lasting staff \nsupport and maintain a well-respected reputation as independent and \nnonadvocacy.\n  As a result, our network attracts a large, diverse groups of \nlegislators and policymakers who are committed to international \ndialogue more broadly and don't have to shy away from our programming \nlest they be asked to support a particular policy position. What is \nmost important for us is that they join the discussion.\n\n  A few highlights from the discussion in the last 12 months include \nthe 31st Annual Congress-Bundestag Seminar hosted by Representative \nCharlie Dent in Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District in September \n2014; the 32nd Annual Congress-Bundestag Seminar hosted by our German \ncounterparts in Berlin, Dresden, and Leipzig in May 2015; the 2nd \nAnnual Congressional Member Study Group tour to Japan in February 2015; \nthree senior congressional staff study tours to Germany in partnership \nwith the Embassy of Germany; one senior congressional staff study tour \nto Japan, which visited Tokyo, Fukushima, and Hiroshima; and 21 high-\nlevel roundtables here in Washington, D.C.\n  That is quite a list of very important meetings and study groups and \ntrips. The work of the congressional study groups is complemented by \nour diplomatic advisory council. Initially focused on European nations, \nthe diplomatic advisory council is now comprised of four dozen \nambassadors from six continents who advise and participate in our \nprogramming.\n  Their interest and commitment to multilateral dialogue is a valued \naddition to the congressional study groups and provides a valuable \noutreach beyond our four core study groups.\n  In the past year, we have also formed the congressional staff \nadvisory council. As former Members of Congress, we know the value of \ngood staff. I always say my rod and my staff, they comforted me and \nprepared the papers for me in the presence of my constituents.\n  The staff advisory council formally recognizes the mutually \nbeneficial relationships we have in offices across Capitol Hill. We are \nvery grateful for the staff who participate in and support our \nprogramming, as we are for the Members of Congress.\n  Finally, I want to thank the institutions, foundations, and companies \nwhich support our mission. We would like to give particular thanks to \nAdmiral Dennis Blair, Ms. Junko Chano of Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, \nand Dr. Karen Donfried and Ms. Maia Comeau of the German Marshall Fund \nfor their support as our international funders of the congressional \nstudy groups in 2015.\n  The congressional study groups are also grateful for the support of \nthe international business community here in Washington, D.C., \nrepresented by each study group's business advisory council. I am going \nto briefly mention the companies of the 2015 business advisory council \nbecause they are the supporters. We do not get any money from Congress, \nand so it is those people who care very much about the work of the \nformer Members' international programs.\n  They are Allianz, All Nippon Airways, Airbus Group, B. Braun Medical, \nCentral Japan Railway Company, Cheniere Energy, Daimler, Deutsche \nTelekom, DHL, Fresenius, Hitachi, Honda, Lufthansa German Airlines, \nMarubeni America Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui, \nRepresentative of German Industry and Trade, Sojitz, Toyota Motor North \nAmerica, United Parcel Service, and Volkswagen of America.\n  Because of their support, our activities not only help to build vital \nbilateral relationships between legislatures, but also build bipartisan \nrelationships within our own Congress. Mutual understanding and shared \nexperiences among legislators are crucial to solving pressing problems, \nwhether at home or abroad.\n  As former Members of Congress, we are proud to bring the important \nservices provided by the congressional study groups to our colleagues \nstill in office, and we are very proud to play an active role in our \ncontinued international outreach.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Ms. KENNELLY. Thank you, Connie.\n  In addition to these substantive and issue-specific international \nprojects, our association also offers its members the opportunity to \nparticipate in group travel where our staff puts together the logistics \nand participating members assume all the costs. These trips are unique \nbecause they combine a tourist experience with more formal meetings \nthat involve current and former government officials in the country we \nare visiting.\n  I will now yield to my good friend from North Carolina, Martin \nLancaster, to report on his combined delegation.\n  Mr. LANCASTER. Thank you, Barbara.\n  For the 2014 fall study group, a contingent of former Members visited \nthe beaches of Normandy, as well as World\n\n[[Page H4443]]\n\nWar I battlefields in northern France and Belgium. The trip was to \ncommemorate those troops who gave their lives during World War I and \nWorld War II on the 100th and 70th anniversaries of those horrible \nwars. The group of former Members and their spouses were privileged to \nshare this moving experience with a group of former members from the \nCanadian Parliament and their spouses. This was our first and what we \nhope will be many joint study tours with our friends to the north.\n  At the opening reception in Paris, the two groups of former \nlegislators first learned how their nations' sacrifices had a direct \nimpact on the lives of Europeans when a friend of a former Member \nrecounted her story of how her family was liberated by the Allies \nduring the war.\n  After gathering in Paris, the group traveled to Normandy, first to \nJuno Beach, where the Canadian military landed for the D-Day invasion. \nIt was an incredible experience to explore a German bunker and to walk \nthe beaches where young Canadian soldiers landed 70 years ago. The \nfollowing day the group spent a day on the Utah and Omaha beaches in \nthe sands where the U.S. military landed, and we were humbled by the \nstaggering number of losses reflected in the cemetery for the American \nsoldiers.\n  The former Members held a moving wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb \nof the Unknown Soldier and spent quite some time walking around the \ngrounds and reflecting on the sacrifices made by so many.\n  While in the Normandy region, our group was treated to the \nhospitality of Count Denis de Kergorlay of Canisy at his chateau, which \nhas been in his family's possession since the 11th century. The Count \nhas been a friend and partner of our association for over 10 years, and \nmany of you have had a chance to meet him during our Statesmanship \nAwards Dinners where, since 2004, he so generously has offered a four-\nnight stay at this magnificent chateau at auction for our fundraising. \nI certainly want to thank him on behalf of the association for his many \nyears of support and friendship.\n  Staying at Chateau de Canisy is like stepping back in time. This \nwelcoming and memorable location provided a warm atmosphere for the \nnational borders and the party affiliations within our international \ngroup to completely fade away. Each evening during dinner, \nconversations revealed our shared experiences as legislators and the \nmoving common history of World War I and World War II. One special \nnight, Count de Kergorlay treated us to a musical performance at the \nchateau thoroughly enjoyed by all who attended and hailed as one of the \nhighlights of the trip.\n  The final two days of the trip were spent in northern France and \nBelgium, and the focus pivoted toward World War I. En route, we stopped \nbriefly at the Normandy Museum in Cannes. A brief detour was made \nto Hallu, a small village in northern France where the recent discovery \nof the identity of several World War I soldiers in the backyard of a \nhome there revealed they were from the same regiment as the president \nof the Canadian Association of Former Parliamentarians, Leo Duguay, who \nwas traveling with us. The group gathered in the home's backyard for a \nmoving wreath-laying ceremony and flag presentation. Afterwards, the \ngroup was entertained at the mayor's office in Hallu.\n\n  Upon arriving in northern France, the group visited Vimy Ridge and \nthe Canadian National Vimy Ridge Memorial, where we toured the trenches \nand learned about the pivotal battle that occurred in 1917 when the \nCanadians lost more soldiers than any battle in their history.\n  We also spent a few hours visiting the interactive Flanders Field \nMuseum in Ypres, Belgium, which is an incredibly marvelous educational \nexperience. The last event of the trip was participating in a ceremony \nin the town of Ypres at the Menin Memorial Gate to the Missing, where \nevery night at 8 p.m. for the last 100 years, the road is closed and \nbuglers sound ``The Last Post'' in memory of those whose graves are \nunknown. This was followed by a wreath-laying ceremony by a number of \norganizations, including our own. What a breathtaking way to conclude \nour travels.\n  This fall we are planning to travel to Havana, Cuba, for our study \ntour. There is such interest by our membership in this destination that \nwe will offer a second trip in January. While our Canadian friends \ncannot join us in October, we would love to partner with them again \nmaybe for the one in January because it was a great pleasure to get to \nknow them and to form these friendships across the border.\n  Thank you, Barbara.\n  Ms. KENNELLY. Thank you, Martin.\n  The experience you had in Normandy with our friends from Canada \ncertainly was extraordinary, and I have heard all about it. I am sorry \nI had to miss it, but I am signed up for the Cuba trip.\n  All of the programs you have heard about clearly require funding, and \nwe have been very successful in growing our fundraising capabilities \nalong with our programming. The most impactful single fundraising \nmechanism we have created is the Annual Statesmanship Awards Dinner. In \nMarch of this year, we hosted our 18th dinner. And just like the \npreceding 17, it was chaired by our good friend, Lou Frey of Florida. \nLou was supported by a number of other co-chairs, including me, former \nMembers Dennis Hertel, Martin Frost, and our association CEO, Pete \nWeichlein. I would like to invite Lou Frey to report on the highly \nsuccessful 18th Statesmanship Awards Dinner, and I think you realize \nthat Lou has been chairman of all of the 18 dinners we have had.\n  Lou Frey.\n  Mr. FREY. Barbara, thank you for all of the hard work you have put \nin. We have had many, many people working on this. This is an absolute \ngreat way to explain to your kids in terms of doing something. If you \nare going to do it, make sure you are going to be able to carry it \nthrough because this started with an idea of raising maybe $100,000, if \nthat. We had no other source, we were going basically broke over a \nperiod of time. The idea, though, grew on its own. Not because of me. \nIt didn't grow because of me, but it grew because each and every one of \nyou, we are all winners. We are all people who succeeded in the \ntoughest market going, and it has been just a wonderful thing to see \nhow it has grown and how many people are now involved in it.\n  I just messed up someone's long, hard work in terms of what I said. \nBut, Pete, you never thought I would stick to the script. No, I knew \nyou wouldn't think that.\n  The last dinner, we had over 500 tickets sold. We raised more money \nthan any of the preceding 17 dinners. It was just incredible. We had \nwonderful people up on the stage. We have decided to go ahead and \npresent the next dinner under a theme of Salute to Service where we \nhave different people involved in this process like we did the last \ntime, like with Bob Dole's, and that will be the next one.\n  The highlight of the evening, I think, came when they had the debate \nor discussion, but the evening is a wonderful way to showcase our \nassociation and recognize outstanding public service. That is the whole \nbasis of the dinner. If it makes it, we are in great shape. If it blows \nit, we are in bad shape. It is pretty black and white. We have a good \nbase. I am looking forward to doing it. I would like to say and put it \non the record, this is not Federal money. This is not government money. \nThis is our money that we are using. It is money that is reaching out \nwhere nobody can criticize it. It came admittedly from an idea that I \nhad to start with, and it is an idea that has really worked.\n  I think I ought to give you a little information about next year's \ndinner. I know we are looking at the clock, but I have more information \nabout next year's dinner that you ought to know about. Again, it will \nbe at the Mellon Auditorium on Constitution Avenue. What a great place \nto have a meeting, and we are going to do it there again. The theme of \nthe 2016 dinner will be to honor individuals and entities who are \nactively supporting our men and women in uniform. Most all of us are \ninvolved in that. I am involved in Florida with a particular golf \ntournament that puts money back in through the program by playing golf. \nDennis Hertel was here and talked about the tremendous job he is doing. \nRemember, we are raising this money. It is our money. That is the money \nthat is going in.\n  The 19th dinner will be a different experience for me because it will \nbe the first one in 19 years where I can actually sit back and relax. \nIt has been my\n\n[[Page H4444]]\n\nspecial pleasure to work for the last 18 years to make this annual \ndinner the great success it has become. I have been able to enjoy a \nrecent event, taking the family to Montana for awhile and spending time \nwith kids whose names I now recognize, and one of them is here today. \nThe dinner is an important event, and obviously we are not going to let \nthe association down. I am not walking away, but 18 years, in all \nfairness, I have put some time in.\n  What we are doing in the event, and part of the event, is allowing \nthe association to get the money we need so the association can fill \nall these great programs. But again, let me say again just in case you \nhaven't heard me, if we don't raise the money with nongovernmental \nmoney, we are broke. Okay, just so we are all on the same page. Moving \nforward, I am going to do what I can while I am still able to do, and \nwe have a great team. We have a great bunch of people working on it. It \nis nice to think they need me, but they really don't need me. In one \nsense, we're all part of it, however. We are turning over a machine \nthat is really well oiled and can work well, a machine that knows how \nto do it, and it knows when to call out to people when something isn't \ngoing quite as well as it should. But that never happens with this.\n  Basically, I just want to also say that I can't tell you what an \nincredible feeling of involvement, of joy, of sorrow, continuing \nfeeling that my life is better because of each and every one of you who \nI have been able to work with and we all have been trying to work with. \nWe are doing God's work. We are putting back into what we have in this \ncountry. We will never put back 100 percent, but it really is part of \nit. So when we come to the 19th dinner, we have somebody rooting like \nheck for you on the sideline. But it is going to take people continuing \nto be involved. Thank you, thank you, thank you again.\n\n  Ms. KENNELLY. Thank you, Lou.\n  I can't even imagine chairing 18 dinners. But I will say I might not \nmiss Lou Frey's calls when he tells me I haven't done a good enough \njob.\n  But Lou, you are not leaving us. In recognition of your 18 years \nchairing the Statesmanship Awards Dinner, and in recognition of your \nservice on our board of directors for almost two decades, and in \nrecognition of the great contributions you made to the organization as \nits president, the board of directors and the members of the United \nStates Association of Former Members of Congress wish to bestow upon \nyou our Lifetime Achievement Award.\n  There is no plaque large enough to hold all of the accolades you \ndeserve based upon your service to this country, first in our military, \nthen in Congress, and currently leading the charge to restore civic \neducation in our Nation's classrooms. Your initiative on behalf of \ncivic education is the foundation upon which we are basing a new \nassociation program, the Lou Frey Forum on Civic Engagement, which will \ntranslate the tremendous strides you have achieved in Florida into a \nnationwide effort utilizing our former Members network across the \ncountry.\n  I, therefore, cannot overstate how appreciative the leadership and \nmembership of our organization are for all you have done for us, \nparticularly as chairman of the Statesmanship Awards Dinner for 18 \nyears. This Lifetime Achievement Award is one way we wish to recognize \nyour tremendous service.\n  Also, we want to tell you there is going to be a Lou Frey Civics \nScholarship, which will benefit a student at Winter Park High School, \njust a couple miles from your home. For the next 3 years, a graduating \nstudent who has taken AP civics and is accepted at a community college \nor university will receive a $1,000 scholarship in your name to help \ndefray his or her college costs.\n  Lou, this Lifetime Achievement Award is highly deserved, and the \nplaque reads as follows:\n\n       This Lifetime Achievement Award is bestowed upon the \n     Honorable Lou Frey, Jr., for his exemplary and inspiring \n     service to his country as well as to the United States \n     Association of Former Members of Congress. Lou Frey's public \n     service began in the United States Navy in 1955 and \n     culminated in a political career that spanned over three \n     decades. He represented his Florida constituents with \n     dedication, integrity, and dynamism. His optimism and can-do \n     attitude never diminished in his post-congressional career, \n     and transformed our association during his years as \n     president, board member, and Statesmanship Awards Dinner \n     chairman. For his lifetime of bringing about positive change, \n     his friends and colleagues from both sides of the political \n     aisle salute him.\n\n  Thank you, Lou.\n  Mr. FREY. Some of my family is here, and I want to thank them.\n  I am especially pleased to have my good friend and former chief of \nstaff, Oscar Juarez, and his wife, Nancy, here representing those who \nmade our congressional office a happy and productive place to work.\n  It really was. What a great opportunity.\n  Ms. KENNELLY. I also want to thank the many partners and supporters \nthat made this possible. We are truly lucky to have this assembled \ngroup of corporations and foundations that believe in our work.\n  Also, I would be remiss if I did not thank the other members of our \nassociation's executive board: our vice president, Jim Walsh; \ntreasurer, Martin Frost; secretary, Mary Bono; and our past president, \nConnie Morella. You have all made this association a stronger and \nbetter organization than it was ever before. I thank you for your time \nand energy. To administer all of these programs takes a staff of \ndedicated and enthusiastic professionals.\n  I am going to quickly mention them. They are wonderful.\n  Sean Pavlik is part of the international team and runs our \nCongressional Study Group on Japan. Unfortunately, we are losing Sean. \nHe is pursuing an MBA at the University of Michigan, and we wish him \nthe best.\n  Rachel Haas is our CEO's right-hand person, runs the entire office, \nmakes sure that our money is spent appropriately and wisely, and played \na huge role in making our Statesmanship Awards Dinner such a beautiful \nand memorable event.\n  Andrew Shoenig, our associate director of international programs, \nstarted out as an intern with us about 4 years ago and now is the \nlinchpin in our incredibly successful program focusing on Germany, the \nEU, and all of the Ambassadors who participate in our Diplomatic \nAdvisory Council.\n  Sharon Witiw, our domestic program director, oversees the smooth \noperations of projects such as the Congress to Campus program. She also \nis the one who keeps our membership updated through our Web site, email \nnotifications, and the year-end newsletter.\n  Sabine Schleidt is our managing director, who spends most of her time \non the current Member international programs, but also a lot of hours \non implementing the strategic vision and fundraising goals.\n  And Peter Weichlein.\n  Peter, you are, to me, the most outstanding chief executive officer.\n  Peter has been with our association for 16 years. I am old enough for \nanything, but I am old enough to remember before Peter, and this \norganization has come so, so far. He keeps his enthusiasm. His staff is \nnot that large. It is amazing that they can have all these programs and \nall these success. Peter is wonderful to work with.\n  Like many of you, I have been on many boards. In fact, for the last 9 \nyears, I ran a board and had to report to a board of directors. Peter \nis exceptional. He keeps the board happy; he keeps the staff happy; and \nhe never stops working. We are, indeed, fortunate to have Peter as our \nchief executive officer.\n  Also, every year at our annual meeting, we ask the membership to \nelect new officers and board members. I therefore will now read the \nnames of the candidates for board members and officers. They are all \nrunning unopposed. I ask for a single ``yea'' or ``nay'' as I present \nto you the list of candidates as a slate.\n  For the association's board of directors:\n  Dave Camp of Michigan\n  Jim Coyne of Pennsylvania\n  Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut\n  Ken Kramer of Colorado\n  Ray LaHood of Illinois\n  Jim Matheson of Utah\n  Jim Moran of Virginia\n  Jim Slattery of Kansas\n  Karen Thurman of Florida.\n  All in favor of electing these former Members to our board of \ndirectors, please say, ``aye.'' Any opposed? Hearing none, the board \nhas been elected.\n  Next, we will elect our executive committee. As president, I serve 2\n\n[[Page H4445]]\n\nyears. I have already done 1 and will end my term in 2016. However, the \nother three elected members of the executive board are up for \nreelection for a 1-year term.\n  The candidates are:\n  Jim Walsh of New York for vice president\n  Martin Frost of Texas for treasurer\n  Mary Bono of California for secretary.\n  All in favor of electing these three former Members of our executive \ncommittee, please say, ``yea.'' Any opposed? Hearing no opposition, the \nslate has been elected by this membership.\n  The executive board is completed by Connie Morella, who is an \nunelected officer in her capacity as immediate past president.\n  Now it is my sad duty to inform the Congress of those former and \ncurrent Members who have passed away since our last report in July. I \nask all of you, including the visitors in the gallery, to rise as I \nread the names. At the end of the list, we will pay our respect to \ntheir memory with a moment of silence. We honor these men and women for \ntheir service to our country. They are:\n  Donald Albosta of Michigan\n  Bruce Alger of Texas\n  Herman Badillo of New York\n  Edward Brooke of Massachusetts\n  M. Caldwell Butler of Virginia\n  Thomas Cass Ballenger of North Carolina\n  Don H. Clausen of California\n  Phil Crane of Illinois\n  Lane Evans of Illinois\n  Bill Frenzel of Minnesota\n  Robert Griffin of Michigan\n  George Hansen of Idaho\n  Herbert Harris of Virginia\n  Jim Jeffords of Vermont\n  Robert W. Kastenmeier of Wisconsin\n  John Krebs of California\n  Arch A. Moore, Jr., of West Virginia\n  John M. Murphy of New York\n  John T. Myers of Indiana\n  Alan Nunnelee of Mississippi\n  Peter Peyser of New York\n  Marge Roukema of New Jersey\n  Fernando J. St. Germain of Rhode Island\n  Robert Tiernan of Rhode Island\n  James A. Traficant of Ohio\n  Jim Wright of Texas\n  C.W. Bill Young of Florida\n  Please observe a moment of silence.\n  That concludes the 45th report to Congress by the United States \nAssociation of Former Members of Congress. We thank the Congress, the \nSpeaker, and the minority leader for giving us the opportunity to \nreturn to this revered Chamber and to report on our association's \nactivities. We look forward to another active and productive year.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. WALSH. The Chair again wishes to thank all former Members of the \nHouse for their presence and this continuing commitment to this high \ncalling of public service.\n  Before terminating the proceedings, the Chair would like to invite \nthose former Members who did not respond when the roll was called to \ngive their names to the Reading Clerk for inclusion on the roll.\n  This concludes our meeting today. We stand adjourned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4445-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1200\n                              AFTER RECESS\n\n  The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the \nSpeaker at noon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4445-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 PRAYER\n\n  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for \nbipartisan legislation before the House, the Protect Medical Innovation \nAct of 2015, to permanently repeal the onerous medical device tax.\n  This medical device tax has condemned our manufacturers of medical \ndevices in the United States to less competition and being less \ncompetitive throughout the world. These manufacturers are now competing \nwith one arm tied behind their backs because of this onerous tax.

Mr. Speaker, with the Supreme Court about to rule on the \nlegal definition of marriage, I rise in support of States like \nPennsylvania that have defined marriage as between a man and a woman.\n  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was founded on religious tolerance \nby William Penn. In Europe, whoever was most popular and powerful in a \ngiven place and time tried to force minorities to violate their \nbeliefs, and that was why so many different groups of people came to \nAmerica and particularly to Pennsylvania, religious minorities such as \nthe Quakers, the Amish, the Mennonites, the Moravians, and others.\n  Philadelphia has the most synagogues per capita of any city in the \nUnited States. Pittsburgh and Harrisburg also have significant Jewish \npopulations. Pennsylvania continues the tradition of respecting each \nother, even when they disagree.\n  We hear a lot of talk about diversity these days, but many of those \nsame people who tell us they want diversity are also trying to force \ntheir views on others by law. States that, through the democratic \nprocess, have defined marriage should not be overridden by five Federal \nunelected judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4446-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FUND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HIGGINS.

This budgetary reality has forced \nthe NIH to administer fewer competitive research grants, to admit fewer \nnew patients to its clinical trials, and to ultimately fall behind in \nscientific discoveries.\n  Mr. Speaker, America cannot afford to continue to underfund the \nNational Institutes of Health.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual from \nManchester, New Hampshire, who has been named Franco American of the \nYear.\n  Gerald Cardinal Lacroix was born in Quebec but moved to New Hampshire \nwhile still a young boy. Lacroix attended Catholic schools in \nManchester, and he continued his studies at Saint Anselm College before \nreceiving degrees in theology from Laval University in Quebec.\n  In 1975, he entered religious life by joining the Pius X Secular \nInstitute. Ordained a priest in 1988, Father Lacroix served as a \nmissionary in Colombia. He then returned to North America and was \nelected as director general of the institute.\n  Consecrated as a bishop in 2009, Lacroix began his service as an \nauxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Quebec. Two years later, he \nsucceeded as archbishop of Quebec and primate of Canada, receiving his \npallium from Pope Benedict XVI. Most recently, Pope Francis elevated \nLacroix to the College of Cardinals, appointing him a cardinal-priest \nin Rome.\n  This is a tremendous accomplishment. On behalf of the Granite State, \nwe are all proud of Cardinal Lacroix's accomplishments. He is truly \nworthy of the title ``Franco American of the Year.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4446-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REAUTHORIZATION OF THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE.

Mr. Speaker, this week, the House will consider \nlegislation to repeal another burdensome part of ObamaCare, the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board, also known as IPAB.\n  IPAB is tasked with finding ways to curb spending in Medicare, but in \nreality, it will ration care and cut services. While Medicare continues \nto eat up more of the budget and is in need of commonsense reforms, \nrelying on a group of unelected bureaucrats is the absolute wrong thing \nto do.\n  Any reforms we make to health care should focus on three core ideas. \nOne, strengthen the relationship between the doctor and the patient so \nthey can work together to make healthcare decisions--what we don't need \nis a bureaucrat from Washington creating a wall between a patient and \nhis physician; two, to drive down costs, we have to focus on market-\noriented reforms, like making coverage portable across State lines and \nremoving the individual and employer mandates; three, finally, we have \nto incentivize the use of health savings accounts to pay for routine \nand preventative care.\n  Repealing the IPAB is an important step in reining in an out-of-\ncontrol bureaucracy, controlling the ballooning costs of health care, \nand returning healthcare decisions to patients and their doctors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4447-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n             JUNE IS ALZHEIMER'S AND BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, the strength of our communities depends on \nthe health and well-being of our families. Unfortunately, millions of \nfamilies across our Nation, including thousands in Arizona, are \nimpacted by Alzheimer's and dementia.\n  June is Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month. It is my hope that we \ncan come together--Republicans and Democrats--and commit to give \nresearchers the resources they need to combat Alzheimer's and other \ndiseases, but also to make sure patients and families have the care and \nsupport they need.\n  Policies like paid leave, caregiver support, workforce training, and \nlong-term care options must be expanded if we truly want to make a \ndifference in the fight against Alzheimer's. These policies are \nespecially important for women and communities of color. Hispanics are \n1.5 times as likely to have Alzheimer's as their White counterparts, \nand African Americans are twice as likely.\n  Studies have also demonstrated that socioeconomic factors play a role \nin the disparities of Alzheimer's.

What this will do is \nrepeal the device tax.\n  Now, the device tax, the medical device tax, was a misplaced and \ndisastrous tax that was put in as an ObamaCare mandate. What it will do \nis tax the medical device industry and those who utilize those \ncomponents.\n  This is an industry that doesn't need to be taxed. It employs more \nthan 400,000 workers nationwide and generates $25 billion in payroll. \nIn my State of Tennessee, there are 10,000 individuals who work in this \nindustry, and the Manhattan Institute estimates that unless we repeal \nthis tax and get it off the books now, we will lose 1,000 of those \njobs.

All these aspiring Americans want is to be able to \ncontribute meaningfully to our society, and DACA has given them a \nlifeline to do that.\n  I want to mark this occasion by sharing two stories of DREAMers in my \ndistrict whose lives DACA has transformed. Johana Mejias is a young \nwoman who came to the U.S. from Venezuela. She grew up in Boulder and \nattended CU, where she was an exceptional student. During high school, \nshe wasn't able to participate in leadership conferences because of \ndifficulty traveling within the U.S., and after college her lack of \nstatus initially prevented her from sitting for the medical school exam \nand participating in medical internships.

DACA has provided a \nlifeline to Marco, enabling him to attend college and earn a degree in \nfinance.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great personal sadness that I \nrise today to pay my final tribute to San Francisco's much beloved \nLeRoy King, who died on June 12 at the age of 91. A distinguished labor \nand civil rights African American leader, King's passion for justice \nand commitment to equality improved the lives of working men and women \nin San Francisco and throughout the country. From inviting Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr. to speak in San Francisco in 1967 to his casting my \nelectoral college vote in 2008 for President Barack Obama as the first \nAfrican American President of the United States, LeRoy King was more \nthan a witness to historic progress; he made history.\n  During World War II, King served with courage and honor in the Army \nand dedicated his entire life to preserving and strengthening the great \ndemocracy he fought to protect. Even in his 80s, in the tradition of \ngreat American leaders, he was arrested for an act of civil \ndisobedience on behalf of hotel and restaurant workers.\n  King served as northern regional director of the International \nLongshore and Warehouse Union, ILWU, for more than 30 years. It was \nimportant to him to overturn a discriminatory system that elected only \nWhites to union office, and he helped create a fully inclusive, \nintegrated workforce. King organized with legendary labor leader Harry \nBridges, was a staunch supporter of civil rights champion Cesar Chavez, \nwas a supporter of Reverend Martin Luther King, and in 2009 he was \nhonored with the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Award for \npromoting peace and advancing social and economic justice by embodying \nDr. King's inclusive leadership and nonviolent participation.\n  Mr. King, whether it was for ending discrimination and promoting \naffordable housing to community development to jazz, he has been \nhonored. His accomplishments are memorialized in locations throughout \nSan Francisco. My revised remarks, for the Record, will go more into \nthat.\n  It has been a great privilege for me to know such a deeply principled \nand exemplary human being and to call him friend. I will miss him. My \nfamily, my husband and my daughter Christine, my entire family will \nmiss him terribly.\n  I hope it is a comfort to his daughters, Rebecca King Morrow and \nCarolyn King Samoa; his son, LeRoy King Jr.; his grandchildren, and \ngreat grandchildren that so many San Franciscans, indeed beyond San \nFrancisco, and other people loved and admired LeRoy King, and they \nshare their tremendous loss.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with great personal sadness that I rise to pay \nfinal tribute to San Francisco's much beloved LeRoy King, who died on \nJune 12th at the age of 91. A distinguished labor and civil rights \nleader, King's passion for justice and commitment to equality improved \nthe lives of working women and men in San Francisco and throughout the \ncountry.\n  From inviting Dr. Martin L. King, Jr. to speak in San Francisco in \n1967 to his casting my electoral college vote in 2008 for Barack Obama \nas the first African American President of the United States, LeRoy \nKing was more than a witness to historic progress, he made history.\n  During World War II, King served with courage and honor in the Army--\nand dedicated his entire life to preserving and strengthening the great \ndemocracy he fought to protect. Even in his 80s, in the tradition of \ngreat American leaders, he was arrested for an act of civil \ndisobedience on behalf of hotel and restaurant workers.\n  King served as Northern Regional Director of the International \nLongshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) for more than 30 years. King \nbecame a member of ILWU Local 6 in 1946, one of the first African \nAmericans to serve in the local leadership. In the 1950s he led a \ncoalition of members to overturn a discriminatory system that elected \nonly whites to union office and helped create a fully inclusive, \nintegrated workforce. Mr. King sought to create a world where others \ncould live free of discrimination, bigotry and injustice.\n  King organized with legendary labor leader Harry Bridges and was a \nstaunch supporter of civil rights champion Cesar Chavez. In 2009 the \nNational Education Association honored King with the Dr. Martin Luther \nKing Jr. Memorial Award for promoting peace and advancing social and \neconomic justice by embodying King's inclusive leadership and \nnonviolent philosophy.\n  Mr. King served on the San Francisco Redevelopment Commission for \nmore than 30 years where he fought to preserve the African American and \nJapanese American heritage of the Fillmore District. His efforts helped \nlay a foundation for a more inclusive, more welcoming home for all San \nFranciscans.\n  King was instrumental in the creation of the St. Francis Square \nCooperative Housing development, which opened in 1963 in the Fillmore \nDistrict and was a national model of racially integrated housing for \nworking families. King and his family lived there from the time it \nopened until he died.\n  King's accomplishments are memorialized in locations around San \nFrancisco. The City's 108-year old carousel at Yerba Buena Gardens was \nrenamed the LeRoy King Carousel, an homage to one of the many sites \nKing helped shape while serving on the Redevelopment Commission. A \nbronze bust of King at the Jazz Heritage Center in San Francisco's \nFillmore District honors his work preserving the neighborhood's African \nAmerican and Japanese American heritage.\n  It has been a great privilege for me to know such a deeply principled \nand exemplary human being and to call him my friend.\n  I hope it is a comfort to his daughters Rebecca King Morrow and \nCarolyn King Samoa, his son LeRoy King Jr. and his grandchildren and \ngreat grandchildren, that so many San Franciscans who loved and admired \nLeRoy share their tremendous loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4448-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4448-H4449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WE MUST DEFEAT BOKO HARAM\n\n  (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. WILSON of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 319 provides for a rule to \nconsider two separate bills, which will address two of the most flawed \nand ill-conceived provisions contained within the so-called Affordable \nCare Act.\n  The rule provides for 1 hour of debate on H.R. 160 dealing with the \nrepeal of the medical device tax, equally divided between the majority \nand minority on the Committee on Ways and Means, as well as the \nstandard motion to recommit provided for the minority.\n  The rule further provides for 1 hour of debate on H.R. 1190, which \nwould repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board. This is equally \ndivided between the majority and minority of both the Committee on Ways \nand Means and the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Further, the rule \nprovides that the Pitts amendment, which will cover the cost of \nrepealing the Independent Payment Advisory Board by using the \nAffordable Care Act's prevention fund, a slush fund for the Secretary, \nwhich has been used to pay for everything from urban gardening to \nlobbying for higher cigarette taxes, be added to the bill. As with H.R. \n160, the standard motion to recommit is also provided to the minority \non H.R. 1190.\n\n[[Page H4450]]\n\n  It is well documented that many provisions contained within the \nAffordable Care Act will have negative consequences on patients, both \nin access to care and in affordability. Yet two provisions have been so \nuniversally criticized that, on a large bipartisan nature, their repeal \nwas called for almost immediately after the passage of the Affordable \nCare Act in 2010. One such provision was the tax contained within the \nbill on medical device manufacturers.\n  It seems illogical that within a piece of legislation that was \npurported to make medical care more accessible to all Americans, the \nFederal Government would want to tax the very providers of medical \ninnovation that creates the devices to improve the delivery of health \ncare. Nevertheless, the President and then-Majority Leader Harry Reid \nin the Senate included this provision in order to pay for part of the \nastronomical price tag that accompanied this massive bill.\n  This tax is an unfair burden that actually increases the cost that \nconsumers will pay at the doctor's office. The tax has also been cited \nby dozens of medical device manufacturers who have or are considering \nmoving their operations overseas so that they can continue to innovate \nwithout the heavy burden of the Internal Revenue Service stifling their \ngrowth. This tax slows the creation of new techniques, slows the \ncreation of new devices, all of which could make the delivery of \nmedicine more efficient. It also puts at risk the jobs associated with \nthe creation of those devices.\n  And lest anyone think that we are merely talking about the largest \nand most expensive pieces of technology found within a hospital, such \nas the MRI or the CAT scanner and surgical equipment, let's be clear \nthat this tax covers every piece of medical equipment from those large \nmachines to the smallest of items, including the syringes that are used \nto deliver lifesaving antibiotics and vaccines. In my own district, I \nhave met with a number of constituents, including the owner of \nRetractable Technologies, which makes those very syringes, and have \nbeen shown firsthand how this tax is creating a burden on the growth of \nhis company.\n  The medical device tax has led to the elimination of thousands of \ngood-paying jobs, and repealing it would be the first step in bringing \nthose jobs back to stem the loss of future jobs within an industry that \nis vital to the country in helping to mitigate the rising cost of \nhealth care due to other burdensome provisions within the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, plain and simple, this is a tax on business, a tax on \nsmall business, a tax on consumers, a tax on innovation. To date, \n33,000 jobs have been lost in the medical device industry since the \npassage of the Affordable Care Act, and it is projected that well over \n100,000 additional jobs are on the chopping block.\n  Actually, who could be surprised about this? Excise taxes, which this \ntax is, are meant to lead to a reduction in the consumption of the good \nbeing taxed. We place an excise tax on cigarettes to discourage their \nuse, making it burdensome to afford a smoking habit. Did the President \nand Harry Reid intend to make it more burdensome to use more efficient \nmedical devices?\n  Of course, not only is this burdensome tax ill-conceived as a \nconcept, it was ill-conceived in a practical sense as well. Last year, \na Treasury inspector general audit found that the Internal Revenue \nService issued 217 erroneous penalties to device companies in a 6-month \nperiod. We have all seen how poorly much of the Affordable Care Act was \nwritten. One need only to look at the most recent Supreme Court cases \nfor that determination. But how difficult is it to write a clear-cut \ntax provision? Apparently, for Harry Reid, it is quite difficult.\n  H.R. 160 has bipartisan and bicameral support and currently has 282 \ncosponsors. In fact, 18 Democrats in this body sent a letter to Speaker \nJohn Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calling for the timely \npassage of this bill. Republican leadership in the House heard their \nrequests and the calls from many other Members of this body and is \nmoving this bill in a responsible way to put Americans back to work and \nlower the cost of health care for all.\n  The second bill contained in today's rule, H.R. 1190, repeals one of \nthe most poorly thought-out ideas ever to come out of Congress, and \nthat is really quite impressive considering the many disquieting ideas \nthat have originated in the Pelosi-led House of Representatives. The \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board is an unelected, unaccountable board \ndedicated to set up within the Affordable Care Act for the sole purpose \nto cut Medicare payments to providers if Medicare targets within the \nbill are not met.\n\n  Let's be very clear about this. President Obama, Majority Leader \nHarry Reid, Speaker Nancy Pelosi created a board of unelected officials \nin order to ration Medicare, to cut Medicare, and every Democrat who \nsupported the Affordable Care Act voted in favor of this Board.\n  The Independent Payment Advisory Board is a regulatory board composed \nof 15 health professionals appointed by the President. There is no \nrequirement that any of these professionals have ever actually \npracticed medicine a day in their lives, and we are well aware that \nthis President prefers academics to those who have real-world \nexperience.\n  The Board's stated responsibility is to develop proposals to reduce \nthe growth of Medicare spending. What does that mean? It means seniors \nwill face cuts to their health care with no recourse if they don't \nagree with what the Board proposes.\n  Former Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag, the \nPresident's top budget adviser, called the Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard the single biggest yielding of power to an independent entity \nsince the creation of the Federal Reserve. Think about that. Let that \nsink in. The Independent Payment Advisory Board has been given the \nauthority to do for Medicare policy what the Fed is able to do with \nmonetary policy. That should be terrifying to every American.\n  The Independent Payment Advisory Board is set to recommend cuts, \namounting to one-half of 1 percent of Medicare spending, and then the \nnumber rises until it hits 1\\1/2\\ percent. It makes these cuts by \nreducing the rates that Medicare pays for medical procedures and drugs, \nwhich means the Independent Payment Advisory Board can only make cuts \nto providers' reimbursements. Instead of being allowed to make real \nlasting structural reforms that could actually help the solvency of \nMedicare, this Board's approach to saving money is one of the \nclumsiest, most bureaucratic ways of achieving this goal.\n  The Independent Payment Advisory Board has massive structural and \nconstitutional defects in its design. If Congress fails to act on the \nBoard's recommendations, they automatically go into effect. And even if \nthe Congress did pass a bill countering the Board's cuts to Medicare, \nthe President can simply veto the bill. And the judiciary--and how this \npasses constitutional muster, I seriously question--specifically the \njudiciary, is forbidden to review the Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard's recommendations.\n  For these and many other reasons, over 500 organizations have urged \nCongress to get rid of this thing--repeal the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board--including the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican College of Surgeons, and the Veterans Health Council.\n  Repealing the Independent Payment Advisory Board would protect \nseniors' access to Medicare, encourage us to do real Medicare reforms, \nand put an end to the constitutionally questionable Board of unelected \nbureaucrats--right now under the President's healthcare law--the very \ndecisions that they are empowered to make changes to Medicare.\n  All Americans will benefit from the repeal of this draconian idea. It \nis a clumsy way that then-majority Democrats were able to buck their \nresponsibility at addressing cost concerns over entitlements. \nGovernment by bureaucrats instead of government by the people, \ngovernment by bureaucrats instead of government by representatives, it \nis no way to run this country. And yet that is how then-Majority Leader \nHarry Reid and then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi preferred that we operate.\n\n[[Page H4451]]\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  The Independent Payment Advisory Board's design undermines seniors' \naccess to Medicare and the health care that they need and have paid for \nthroughout their working lives.\n  This Board should have been repealed years ago, but so long as Harry \nReid was majority leader in the Senate, the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board continued to live. Last year's election created a sea \nchange over in the other body, changed the majority leader in the \nSenate, and now, the American people may finally see their government \nbegin to work for them yet once again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding \nme the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in opposition to the rule which, once \nagain, deprives Members of this body the opportunity to debate \namendments that will improve the underlying legislation.\n  I rise in opposition to this body's misguided priorities. Again, the \nAmerican people are seeing Congress rehash the same tired debates. How \nmany references were there to people that were Speakers of this House, \nthat were Senate majority leaders, to healthcare reform, which has \nalready withstood several elections and is the law of the land?\n  What we have before us today are two more bills that repeal part of \nthe Affordable Care Act. We have now considered over 60 bills to \nrepeal, defund, or dismantle the Affordable Care Act, rather than \nimprove and build upon it.\n  With all the work that remains to be done, we could be debating \nlegislation to renew our expiring highway trust fund and repair our \ncrumbling roads and bridges.\n  We could take up legislation to renew the charter of the Import-\nExport Bank, and we will be offering that soon on the previous \nquestion.\n  We could consider a bill to repair our broken immigration system or \nhelp the millions of Americans who are living below the poverty line, \neven though they work two jobs and it is increasingly hard to support \ntheir families; or we could take on the critical matter of climate \nchange and confront the fact that it has contributed to one of the \nworst droughts in our Nation's history.\n  But, oh, no, it is more important to have the 61st and 62nd repeal of \nparts of the Affordable Care Act, rather than move forward with a \nfuture-oriented agenda for the American people.\n  Now, let's get into some of the specifics of the underlying \nlegislation. The most recent estimate by the Congressional Budget \nOffice found that a total of 27 million people will gain access to \nhealthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act over the next 10 \nyears, who otherwise would not have had coverage.\n  That is to say nothing of the additional millions of Americans who \nbenefit from the Affordable Care Act by having coverage for preexisting \nconditions for the first time in their lives, are no longer subject to \nlifetime caps that could leave them bankrupt if they get a serious \nillness, or people that are able to stay as young adults up to age 26 \non their parents' plan.\n  Constituents from all areas of my district have shared stories of \ntheir success using our State's health exchange, Connect for Health \nColorado, and described how the Affordable Care Act's coverage provided \nby the ACA has improved their lives.\n  I have heard from constituents like Morgan, from Nederland, Colorado, \nwho used the exchange to enroll in the exact same plan she had before \nthe Affordable Care Act, but her premiums decreased, and the services \nthat were covered expanded--more value for her money.\n  Or Donna, who recently moved to Boulder, Colorado--Donna is an \noutdoor enthusiast, like so many in my district, but was afraid to make \nher way to the mountains until she had secured healthcare coverage.\n  Through Connect for Health Colorado and the premium tax credits she \nhas access to under the Affordable Care Act, she is now enrolled in a \ncomprehensive medical and dental plan that ensures she won't become \nbankrupt if she sustains an injury.\n  These are far from isolated cases. In my home State of Colorado, 16.5 \npercent of people lacked health insurance before ACA. According to a \nrecent study of the Kaiser Family Foundation, that figure has dropped \nto 9 percent by last year.\n  The success is not limited to my State. According to a Gallup poll \nreleased in April, the percentage of Americans lacking health care \nnationwide has dropped by more than a third since the marketplace \nopened at the end of 2013, from 18 percent to under 12 percent.\n  The Affordable Care Act is working; instead of continuing in that \nvein, once again, the Republican Congress is seeking to repeal various \nparts of that law, rather than move forward and improve it.\n  The first of today's two bills, the so-called Protecting Seniors' \nAccess to Medicare Act, doesn't protect anyone's access to anything. \nThe Advisory Board it seeks to repeal, which has been vilified and \ncompletely mischaracterized in the past, is actually something far more \nmundane and important to the processes of Medicare.\n  It is a board of advisers who make nonbinding recommendations to \nCongress about how we can reduce healthcare costs and strengthen \nMedicare solvency over the long term, without sacrificing the quality \nof care, something that all of us, as cost-conscious Members of \nCongress, should be interested in seeing.\n  Now, we can debate all day the exact composition of the Board or \nwhich committees in Congress should have jurisdiction over its \nrecommendations. Those are valid considerations--or, instead, we can \ndiscuss repealing the Board in its entirety, which is what we are \ntalking about here today. This Advisory Board will provide critical \nadvice to help Congress reduce the cost of providing health care.\n  Now, interestingly enough, this amendment pays for the $7 billion \ncost of eliminating this Board by slashing nearly $9 billion in funding \nfrom the prevention and public health fund. This fund is used for vital \npreventative health programs, like childhood vaccines, helping people \nquit smoking, stroke prevention, and maternal wellness. The cornerstone \nof health savings is preventative medicine.\n  In fact, I cosponsor a bill with my friend, Mr. Burgess, who is \nmanaging the bill on the other side, that would allow the Congressional \nBudget Office to account for the long-term savings of preventative \nhealth initiatives when it scores legislation.\n  If Mr. Burgess' own bill were to become law, and I hope it does, it \nwould show that the so-called way that we are paying for this repeal is \nillusory. Eliminating the preventative healthcare program actually can \ncost money in the long run. Under the congressional scoring model that \nwe both support, it would likely not even register as a cost saving, or \nif it did, it would be much less than the $9 billion.\n  The second bill being considered, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, \naims to do something that many of us on both sides support, repealing \nthe Affordable Care Act's excise tax on medical devices. The medical \ndevice tax is one of the measures originally included by the Senate in \nthe Affordable Care Act to fund the badly needed consumer protections \nand benefits that form the core of the bill.\n\n  Now, again, it is easy to support tax cuts. This body has put before \nus many, tax cut after tax cut after tax cut that are unfunded. The \nwhole discussion about how you can afford to cut taxes is how you pay \nfor it. What government waste do you cut? What other taxes or income do \nyou use to offset the cost of these tax cuts?\n  Of course, we don't want to slow the pace of progress with \nunnecessary costs and burdens, and we want to make sure that medical \ndevice manufacturers have every incentive to increase their research \nand development and not pass these costs along to consumers.\n  Unfortunately, even though I, along with Alma Adams from North \nCarolina and Matt Cartwright from Pennsylvania, offered an amendment in \nthe Rules Committee that would have paid for repealing the medical \ndevice tax using a commonsense approach that wouldn't suppress economic \ngrowth, our amendment was not allowed to even be discussed here on the \nfloor of the House.\n  Not only would our amendment to pay for the medical device repeal \nhave avoided adding nearly $30 billion to our\n\n[[Page H4452]]\n\ndeficit, as this bill would do before us today, but it also would have \nhelped bring balance to our Nation's energy sector by stopping the \ngovernment from choosing winners and losers in energy and lessen our \ndependence on fossil fuels.\n  Unfortunately, under this rule, we don't get a vote or debate on the \nfloor. We are left with two bad choices. We can, of course, leave in \nplace a tax that many of us want to remove; or we can add $25 billion \nto our deficit. Neither of those are the right answers for the American \npeople or for medical device companies or the consumers who use medical \ndevice products.\n  The American people deserve better. If we defeat this rule, an open \nprocess will allow Republicans and Democrats to offer real, \nconstructive, better ideas of how to improve upon these two pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Bucshon), a member of our Committee on Energy and \nCommerce.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, in Indiana, the medical device industry \nemploys over 20,000 Hoosiers in over 300 medical device companies. \nThese are good-paying jobs that pay 56 percent more than the average \nwage.\n  As Indiana Governor Mike Pence recently put it in a letter to our \ndelegation: ``This industry is vital to Indiana's economy and the \nhealth and well-being of people across the Nation and the world.''\n  Unfortunately, this critical industry is living under the shadow of a \njob-killing tax put in place to pay for the Affordable Care Act. In \nfact, companies in Indiana have already halted research projects and \nplans for expansion.\n  The medical device tax is crippling innovation of lifesaving products \nlike the ones I used as a surgeon, and it is putting patients and jobs \nat risk. This is about patients, at the end of the day, and their \naccess to health care.\n  We have had broad bipartisan support for repeal of the medical device \ntax in both Chambers before. It is time to put an end to this onerous \ntax once and for all.\n  I also support an IPAB repeal. As a physician, I urge my colleagues \nto support the rule and the underlying bills.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will \noffer an amendment to the rule to allow for the consideration of \nlegislation that would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank for 7 years.\n  To discuss our proposal, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters), the distinguished ranking member on the \nCommittee on Financial Services.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman \nfrom Colorado, as well as Leader Pelosi and Whip Hoyer, for their \nunyielding support for thousands of American jobs and businesses.\n  I rise to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question in order \nto force a vote on legislation sponsored by myself, Mr. Heck, Ms. \nMoore, Mr. Hoyer, and 186 other Democrats that will renew and reform \nthe Export-Import Bank's charter for the long term.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress has just 5 days to act before the Export-Import \nBank shuts down. We are in the eleventh hour, and despite a recent \nbipartisan vote in the Senate and broad support across the aisle in \nthis House, we are still fighting to keep this engine of job creation \nand economic growth alive.\n  It is interesting to note that, contrary to most of the disagreements \nthat take place in this Chamber, in the debate over the Export-Import \nBank, the facts remain undisputed.\n  Over the past 5 years, it is estimated that the Bank has created or \nsustained more than 1.3 million private sector jobs, 164,000 in the \npast year alone. In 2014, the Bank returned more than $674 million back \nto the American taxpayers, an amount totaling $6.9 billion over the \npast two decades.\n  Democrats, Republicans, business, and labor all understand the \nimportant role that the Export-Import Bank plays in our economy. \nPresidents, ranging from Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush to Bill \nClinton, have been outspoken in their support for the Bank's ability to \ncreate and sustain American jobs and keep our businesses competitive.\n  Ex-Im levels the playing field with countries like China, Russia, and \ncountless others, all of which have their own version of the Bank \nsupporting American competitors.\n  Mr. Speaker, Democrats are coming to the floor today to implore our \nnumerous Republican colleagues who support the Export-Import Bank, \nstarting with Speaker Boehner, to stand up for jobs, businesses, and \nAmerican competitiveness by standing up to the extremists who want to \nclose the Bank.\n  Let's send a strong message to America's manufacturers, businesses, \nand workers, that we are committed to preserving an institution that, \nfor decades, has helped this Nation create jobs and grow the economy.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a valued member of the Energy \nand Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for H.R. 160, the \nProtect Medical Innovation Act. Last August, I held two 21st Century \nCures roundtables in my district in the Tampa Bay area.\n  The second roundtable featured healthcare providers. One participant \nwas Lisa Novorska, CFO of Rochester Electro-Medical. Rochester Electro-\nMedical is a medical device manufacturer in my district, and it is a \nsmall business.\n  The medical device tax, originally included in the President's \nhealthcare law, is devastating to these small businesses. Eighty \npercent of the device manufacturers in Florida have less than 25 \nemployees. In total, Florida has 662 device manufacturers, and one-\nthird of them are in the Tampa Bay area, as I said, in the area that I \nrepresent in the Congress.\n  This bill has over 280 bipartisan cosponsors. Voting for this rule \nand bill should be easy, despite the administration's veto threat. \nLet's support device manufacturers and give them the flexibility to \ninnovate and help our constituents.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Heck), a leader in the effort to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous \nquestion so that we might, indeed, get to H.R. 1031, the Promoting U.S. \nJobs through Exports Act of 2015.\n  H.R. 1031--which, as it has been indicated, reauthorizes the Export-\nImport Bank--is a deficit-cutting, job-creating machine. And why is it \nimportant that we get to it? Because, indeed, the charter of the Bank \nexpires in 5 legislative days.\n  Last week, I was at home and had occasion to be channel surfing, and \nI came across, inarguably, one of the top 10 movies in all of the \nhistory of American cinema, ``Blazing Saddles.'' And there is this \nwonderful scene where the actor, Cleavon Little, rides into town, and \nhe is not met very favorably by the townsfolks. They all pull their \nguns on him. And in response, he pulls his revolver, and he puts it to \nhis head, and he says, Stop, stop, or I will shoot myself.\n  Well, of course, what he was doing, given the situation, was \ncompletely turning logic on its ear and confusing everybody in his \npresence. And that is how I feel about this.\n  Those who want to end the Export-Import Bank purport to be in favor \nof cutting the deficit. But the Export-Import Bank has reduced the \nFederal deficit by $6 billion over the last 20 years. Those who want to \nterminate the Export-Import Bank say they are in favor of faster \neconomic growth. But the Export-Import Bank supported 164,000 jobs just \nlast year alone in virtually every congressional district in this great \nland.\n  Make no mistake, if the Bank expires, we will lose jobs; and we will \nlose jobs immediately here and there and everywhere.\n  And stop and think about that. What is more important than a job? It \nis the means by which we provide for ourselves. We are self-sufficient.\n  Is anyone suggesting we have too many jobs? Is anybody suggesting \nthat work isn't worthwhile?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\n[[Page H4453]]\n\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. I will never forget when former Vice \nPresident Mondale once said, You want to know how important work is in \nthis society? Stop, ask yourself what is the first thing you ask \nsomebody when you meet them. ``What do you do?''\n  Work is important. Jobs are important. The Export-Import Bank creates \njobs. Vote ``no'' on the previous question. Reauthorize the Export-\nImport Bank. We have 5 legislative days to go.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the vice chairman of the Committee on Rules.\n  Ms. FOXX. I thank my colleague on the Rules Committee, who handles \nour rules and legislation so effectively on the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying \nbills. When the Democrat-controlled Congress rammed the so-called \nAffordable Care Act through this Chamber, I joined my Republican \ncolleagues in expressing our grave concerns over the effects of the \nlaw's tax increases. Specifically, we warned that the excise tax on \nmedical devices would hinder innovation as well as restrict growth and \njob creation in an industry that has improved the quality of life for \nmillions around the world.\n  And just as we cautioned, this tax on devices that restore mobility, \nkeep hearts in rhythm, and help doctors diagnose life-threatening \ndiseases earlier than ever before has cost us local jobs and reduced \nresearch capabilities.\n  Cook Medical is a privately owned company, with facilities around the \nworld. It employs about 500 people in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, \nwhere the company focuses on endoscopic and urological medicine.\n  Since the medical device tax was levied in 2013, Cook Medical has \npaid roughly $13 million annually. As a result, the company has pulled \nback on capital improvements as well as research and development \ninvestments. They have also considered moving manufacturing capacity \noutside the United States.\n  Scott Sewell, vice president of technology acquisition and \ndevelopment for the company's Winston-Salem office, recently told the \nTriad Business Journal that if the medical tax device is repealed, they \nwould look at expanding operations in North Carolina with a new plant \nin Winston-Salem.\n  I would like to submit for the Record this May 1 article from the \nTriad Business Journal.\n\n               [From Triad Business Journal, May 1, 2015]\n\n             Device Tax Thwarts Expansion in Winston-Salem\n\n                          (By Owen Covington)\n\n       The push to repeal an Affordable Care Act tax on the sale \n     of medical devices appears to be gaining steam with a \n     prominent device manufacturer with a strong Triad presence \n     recently lobbying Congress for action.\n       In written testimony to a Senate committee this month, Cook \n     Medical Board Chairman Stephen Ferguson said the company has \n     had to pull back on capital improvements and R investments \n     because of the tax. Cook is also considering moving \n     manufacturing capacity outside the country.\n       ``Make no mistake about it: We want to develop and \n     manufacture our devices in the U.S., but this tax is \n     preventing this growth in this country,'' Ferguson wrote.\n       I caught up with Scott Sewell, vice president of technology \n     acquisition and development at Cook Medical's Winston-Salem \n     operation, where the focus is on endoscopy and urological \n     medicine.\n       Just for further explanation, the tax is a 2.3 percent levy \n     on the sale of many medical devices that's expected to \n     generate $29 billion during its first 10 years.\n       Proponents have argued that increased health insurance \n     coverage will mean more sales for these companies, which also \n     have the option of passing that increase along to consumers \n     rather than absorbing it themselves.\n       Sewell said that since the tax was levied in 2013, Cook \n     Medical has paid roughly $13 million annually. That accounts \n     for only a portion of Cook's overall sales, since it isn't \n     paid on the roughly 60 percent of Cook's products that are \n     sold abroad.\n       Both Sewell and Ferguson said that uptick in sales hasn't \n     occurred, and the company has generally been unable to pass \n     along the cost of the tax to consumers, which are typically \n     very cost-conscious hospitals. That's meant pulling back on \n     plans to expand in Winston-Salem and elsewhere, Sewell said.\n       ``I think if the device tax were repealed, in the next \n     couple of years, we would probably be looking at a new plant \n     in Winston-Salem,'' he said.\n       Cook's arguments are grabbing the attention of more in \n     Congress. That said, advocates of the tax say claims like \n     those of Cook are overblown.\n       ``A manufacturer can't avoid the tax by shifting production \n     abroad, doesn't pay the tax for devices it produces here but \n     sells abroad, and suffers no competitive disadvantage from \n     foreign producers, who also have to pay the tax for devices \n     that they sell here,'' wrote Chad Stone, chief economist of \n     the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in \n     U.S. News & World Report.\n\n  Ms. FOXX. It is clear that ObamaCare's medical device tax has \ndirectly and negatively impacted the people who live in North \nCarolina's Fifth District, as well as people around the country and \naround the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, this tax must be repealed, and its harmful effects \nundone.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank my friend from Colorado for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to the previous \nquestion in order to make in order a vote to reauthorize the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  For Americans, the Export-Import Bank means jobs. It means economic \ngrowth. Failing to reauthorize Ex-Im threatens American jobs, threatens \nAmerican businesses, threatens our economy.\n  Supporting Ex-Im used to be a bipartisan issue. Just read a little \nhistory: Dwight Eisenhower supported it. Ronald Reagan supported it. If \nyou want a more recent example, George W. Bush supported it.\n  This never has been a partisan issue until just recently, where even \nthe House leadership--the Speaker, I think, supports it--has now been \ncaptured by a small group of very far right-leaning ideologues to whom, \napparently, much is owed because we can't get a floor vote on a piece \nof legislation supported by a majority of the House of Representatives \nthat helps American business and helps American workers. What is wrong \nwith this picture? This makes no sense whatsoever.\n  The Export-Import Bank is an essential part of a growing economy, and \nparticularly in supporting American businesses to grow their exports \nand put Americans to work.\n  In my home State alone, 228 companies, $11 billion in export value, \nare at risk if we don't reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, and we have \n5 days to do it. But we could do it in 5 minutes if we defeat the \nprevious question, bring to the floor of the House legislation, H.R. \n1031, that would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank through 2022.\n  Let's let the will of the American people and, frankly, the will of a \nmajority of the United States Congress, be manifest in our policy. A \nmajority of Congress supports the reauthorization of the Export-Import \nBank. Bring a vote to the floor of the House. Let's put America to \nwork, support American business, support American workers, and support \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Speaker, previously it was brought up about the prevention fund, \nwhich was being used as one of the offsets for the repeal of the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board. And I just wanted to give the \nCongress a sense of some of the activities that have been funded under \nthe Secretary's so-called prevention fund.\n  How about pickle ball? I didn't even know what that was. I had to \nGoogle it after that came to light in our committee. Massage therapy, \nkickboxing, kayaking, and Zumba--a separate grant was given for that. A \ngrant for signage for bike lanes. A grant to promote free pet \nneutering. A grant for urban gardening. A grant to lobby for a soda tax \nin New York, block construction of job-creating fast food small \nbusinesses, and another grant to boost bike clubs.\n  These are the types of activities that are being funded in the \nprevention fund, not actual activities that would result in the \nprevention of disease. This is a good use of these dollars, and I urge \nadoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. \nMoore), the ranking member on the Financial Services Subcommittee on \nMonetary Policy and Trade.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, the clock is ticking on the global \ncompetitiveness of U.S. workers, and the GOP has yet--has yet--has yet \nto put to a vote the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n\n[[Page H4454]]\n\n  The Export-Import Bank levels the playing field globally for U.S. \nbusinesses to compete with subsidized foreign competitors. Our U.S. \nexporters and workers will pay the price if this majority, this \nRepublican Congress fails to reauthorize the Bank. My Milwaukee \nexporters will pay the price if this Republican Congress fails to \nreauthorize the Bank.\n  Yes, deals will still be made with the other 60 or so credit agencies \naround the world, but they will be done without U.S.-made goods and \nservices.\n  You know, it is so ironic that we have all kinds of deals being cut \nto get partnership trade agreements with these 12 different Pacific \ncountries so we could export jobs to other places in the world. But \nthere are no deals being made so that we can export U.S.-made goods and \nservices to other parts of the world. That is probably why we have such \na huge trade deficit.\n  With the leadership of Ranking Member Waters, Representatives Heck of \nWashington, Hoyer, and I, we have introduced H.R. 1031, the Promoting \nU.S. Jobs Through Exports Act. It makes targeted and prudent reforms to \nthe Bank that enhance its mission, including promoting additional small \nbusiness participation, greater transparency, and improved governance.\n  Defeat the previous question. Bring the Export-Import Bank deal to \nthe floor. The American people deserve an opportunity to work.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 13 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Colorado has 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  First, with regard to the comments of the gentleman from Texas on the \npreventative health fund, I want to give a few examples of the \nimportant ways that fund helps reduce health care costs. For instance, \nexpenditures on hospitals promoting breast-feeding, on breast and \ncervical cancer early awareness and diagnosis.\n  So, I mean, again, the fund community initiative that support breast-\nfeeding mothers has a demonstrable effect in reducing the incidence of \ndisease in infants and promotes better health.\n  With regard to early identification: breast cancer screenings, \noutreach through State, territorial, and tribal health organizations, \nchronic disease self-management--again, making sure that people have \nbetter compliance with their regime that can reduce health care costs.\n  So there are a lot of items in there that I am confident, if our bill \nwere to pass--the bill that I cosponsor with the gentleman from Texas--\nclearly that $9 billion in savings is illusory. Now whether that will \ncome back as a net-positive program or not, under the new CBO scoring, \nwe will just need to pass our bill to see. But it wouldn't be $9 \nbillion. Again, maybe it would be $3 billion in savings. Maybe it would \nbe $1 billion. Again, maybe it would be a negative amount because these \npreventative expenditures could very well save more than they cost \nbecause if you can get an early diagnosis around breast and cervical \ncancer, not only does it lead to a better outcome for the patient but \nsaves a lot more money, as does making sure that people are able to \nsuccessfully manage their chronic diseases and not wind up in emergency \nrooms at a very high cost.\n  We have before us--no bones about it--two more partial repeals of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  So far this year, the Republicans have brought to the floor $586 \nbillion in unpaid-for tax extenders and special interest tax \nexpenditures. Those bills have blown through the sequestration caps, \nall while continuing to cut funding for education programs, violence \nprevention initiatives, and medical research.\n  This bill adds another $25 billion to that $586 billion. Again, \neverybody likes to have their cake and eat it too. But unfortunately \nbudgets have to work, and numbers have to add up.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  That is why I was particularly disappointed that the Rules Committee \ndidn't allow my amendment that would have simply paid for the medical \ndevice tax repeal to come forward. Instead, the Republicans are \ninsisting on adding $25 billion on top of the $586 billion in \nexpenditures that they are blowing through the deficit with and \nincreasing the size of the deficit by half a trillion dollars.\n  This bill also provides for consideration of a bill that cuts $9 \nbillion from the preventative health initiatives to repeal an advisory \nboard. Again, I would argue that we won't know if that is truly paid \nfor or not until our other bill passes, and I hope that we can bring \nforward the bill I share with Mr. Burgess to allow for the proper \nscoring of that.\n  So I am ready to say that I don't know if it is paid for or not. I \nsuspect it is not. I suspect that it might cost us more money in the \nlong run to repeal the important expenditures around breast and \ncervical cancer early diagnosis and chronic disease self-management, \nbut the only way to know that for sure would be to change the way that \nthe CBO scores the bills to allow for preventative measures to show the \nsavings that are reasonably estimated by experts absent any particular \nbias.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think there is a lot of interest in reforming the \nAdvisory Board, and I think that is a valid conversation to have: What \nshould its priorities be? What should the reporting process be? What \nshould the membership be composed of? But repealing it and adding costs \nand preventing simple, cost-saving recommendations from even coming to \nCongress, how does that make sense? And how does that further the goal \nof providing high-quality health care to the American people at the \nlowest cost possible?\n  We also shouldn't be taking funding away for programs that help \nAmericans prevent injuries or illness in order to pay for the repeal of \nan advisory board that makes nonbinding recommendations to Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, a vote for this rule is yet another vote for misplaced \npriorities, for increasing the Federal deficit, and for passing \npolicies that are at odds with the needs of the American people and \nconstitute the 62nd time that this body has chosen to repeal part of \nthe Affordable Care Act rather than move forward with a future-oriented \nagenda to help the American people. This is a vote to add billions of \ndollars to our deficit at the expense of the basic healthcare needs of \nthe American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, this body can do better. If we defeat this \nrule, we might have an opportunity to do something about the deficit, \nto do something about it by going back and getting a rule that if this \nbody chooses to proceed with repealing the medical device tax allows a \ncommonsense way for that to be paid for. If we repeal this rule, we can \ngo back and look at improving the advisory panel rather than repealing \nit in its entirety, making sure that, if there are costs associated \nwith that, that they are paid for in a real way rather than a way that \nis illusory.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we repeal this rule, we can go back and bring forward \nMr. Burgess' and my bill that would allow proper scoring around \npreventative health care. That would allow a proper discussion on \nwhether this way of paying for a repeal of the advisory panel is even a \nreal way of paying for anything or not.\n  For those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' and defeat the previous question.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have talked a lot about the Affordable Care Act here \non the floor of this House, and one of the reasons we have talked a lot \nabout it is because, very famously, it was passed before we read it. We \nhad to pass it to find out what was in it. Let me just talk about a \ncouple of those things because I think they are germane to our \ndiscussion today.\n  This is June 17. Around the country, many Members' offices are being \ncontacted by groups asking why Congress\n\n[[Page H4455]]\n\nitself isn't following the law that Congress passed. I am referring \nspecifically to section 1312(d) in the bill. It says:\n\n       Members of Congress in the exchange requirement \n     notwithstanding any other provision in law, after the \n     effective date of this subtitle, the only health plans that \n     the Federal Government may make available to Members of \n     Congress shall be health plans that are, number one, created \n     under this act, or two, offered through an exchange \n     established unto this act. The term ``Member of Congress'' \n     means any Member of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate.\n\n  The fact of the matter is most people don't follow the law. I did, \nMr. Speaker, and I think it was important to follow the law. I bought \nmy health care in the individual market, in healthcare.gov, started \nOctober 1 of 2013. You may remember that night. That was the night the \nfiscal year ended and the famous government shutdown began. I began \nearly that morning in trying to sign up for the Affordable Care Act \nbecause I knew, as a Member of Congress, we were supposed to sign up \nthrough healthcare.gov, an unsubsidized policy in the individual \nmarket. So I performed as indicated.\n  It took 3\\1/2\\ months for the check to clear the bank. It was one of \nthe most uncomfortable, god-awful experiences I have ever been through \nin my life. What is the final result? I have a bronze plan in the \nindividual market in healthcare.gov, the Federal fallback provision in \nthe State of Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, that plan cost $560 a month the first year that I was \nenrolled, and then it went up 24 percent the next year. It is now up to \n$700 a month for me for an individual. These are after-tax dollars. Do \nyou know the worst part, Mr. Speaker? The worst part is that the \ndeductible is $6,000.\n  Now, some people have asked me, they say: Well, gee, are you worried \nabout the fact that the networks are so narrow on these plans that you \ncan't see your doctor?\n  I honestly don't know. I don't know if my doctor is included on the \nplan. I haven't looked because I ain't going. At a $6,000 deductible, \nsomeone will have to drag me in the backdoor by the time I am dying.\n  What has happened, Mr. Speaker, is we have created a whole subset of \nindividuals in this country who are functionally uninsured because the \ncost of their care is so high. Had Members of Congress followed the \nlaw, they would be as aware of that as our constituents are.\n  Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of two bills \nthat begin to right some of the many wrongs included in the Affordable \nCare Act: H.R. 160, repealing the Independent Payment Advisory Board \ncharged with cutting Medicare; and H.R. 1190, repealing the medical \ndevice tax. These are two steps that the House can take this week to \nhelp lower the rising costs of health care created under the \nPresident's healthcare law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the rule before us and the \npassage of the two important pieces of legislation.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 319 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1031) to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United \n     States, and for other purposes. General debate shall be \n     confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally \n     divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Financial Services. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1031.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . . When \n     the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of \n     the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to \n     ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then \n     controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or \n     yield for the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4455-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4455-H4471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       REMOVAL OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM IRAQ AND SYRIA\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of the House of \nTuesday, June 16, 2015, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. \nRes. 55) directing the President, pursuant to section 5(c) of the War \nPowers Resolution, to remove United States Armed Forces deployed to \nIraq or Syria on or after August 7, 2014, other than Armed Forces \nrequired to protect United States diplomatic facilities and personnel, \nfrom Iraq and Syria, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of \nTuesday, June 16, 2015, the concurrent resolution is considered read.\n  The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 55\n\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring),\n\n[[Page H4456]]\n\n     SECTION 1. REMOVAL OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM IRAQ \n                   AND SYRIA.\n\n       Pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution (50 \n     U.S.C. 1544(c)), Congress directs the President to remove \n     United States Armed Forces deployed to Iraq or Syria on or \n     after August 7, 2014, other than Armed Forces required to \n     protect United States diplomatic facilities and personnel, \n     from Iraq and Syria--\n       (1) by no later than the end of the period of 30 days \n     beginning on the day on which this concurrent resolution is \n     adopted; or\n       (2) if the President determines that it is not safe to \n     remove such United States Armed Forces before the end of that \n     period, by no later than December 31, 2015, or such earlier \n     date as the President determines that the Armed Forces can \n     safely be removed.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to submit statements or extraneous materials \nfor the Record on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 55. But while I am \nopposed to this resolution, I do want to commend its author, Mr. \nMcGovern, for his constant and principled attention to the issue of \nU.S. military engagement in Iraq and Syria and the role of Congress in \nmaking this decision. These are some of the most important and \nchallenging issues that we face and that we struggle with as an \ninstitution.\n  I know the gentleman from Massachusetts is frustrated. I have \nlistened to him on the floor of the House. In many ways, I share his \nfrustrations. ISIS is making too many gains. Critical cities have \nfallen. But this resolution, I believe, would take us in the opposite \ndirection of where U.S. policy should be.\n  If the United States were to remove all of our forces from the \ntheater, as this resolution calls for, ISIS would surely grow stronger. \nISIS would surely accelerate on a process of decimating all in its \npath, placing women under brutal oppression and, I have no doubt, \nfurther strengthening their position and further threatening our \nEuropean allies and even the U.S. homeland. More battlefield victories \nwould support ISIS propaganda, which would support its recruitment, \nwhich would make it more deadly by the day.\n  Mr. Speaker, no one is eager for this commitment, but ISIS is on the \nmarch; and this radical jihadist group is taking more territory, more \nweapons, and more resources, threatening the government in Baghdad and, \nindeed, threatening to destabilize this entire critical region.\n  Now, H. Con. Res. 55 calls for the unilateral withdrawal of U.S. \nforces from the fight against ISIS, halting all U.S. strikes against \nthe terrorist group in Iraq and Syria. It would also leave ISIS \nunchecked--not only unchecked by U.S. airpower, but it would allow this \nbrutal terrorist group, as I say, to gain strength, to destabilize the \ncritical region, and to create a safe haven from which ISIS can plot \nattacks against the United States.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  H. Con. Res. 55 has nothing to do with authorizing the use of \nmilitary force against ISIS but would unilaterally withdraw U.S. forces \nfrom the fight.\n  Last year, debating another Iraq measure offered by Mr. McGovern, I \nsaid: ``Never has a terrorist organization itself controlled such a \nlarge, resource-rich safe haven as ISIS does today. Never has a \nterrorist organization possessed the heavy weaponry, the cash, the \npersonnel that ISIS does today, which includes thousands of Western \npassport holders.''\n  Well, unfortunately, it is worse today. Just weeks ago, Ramadi, a \ncity only 75 miles from Iraq's capital, was overrun by ISIS and by its \nsuicide bombers who led that first wave.\n  ISIS's goals are very clear: wreck every person opposing it, \nestablish a caliphate, and then fight to expand it. ISIS has unleashed \na campaign of brutal and depraved violence, not only against Shia \nMuslims and fellow Sunnis who do not share their radical beliefs, but \nagainst vulnerable religious and ethnic minorities. As one witnessed \ntestified to the Foreign Affairs Committee the other day: ``We cherish \nethnic and religious diversity. ISIS hates it.'' And they hate in some \nof the most brutal ways possible.\n  Mr. Speaker, many Americans may not realize that Iraq and Syria are \nhome to dozens of ethnic and religious minorities, with ancient \ncultures with very deep roots. These communities--Assyrian and Chaldean \nChristians, Yazidis, Alawites, and many others--are under mortal threat \nin their ancestral homelands.\n  The mass execution of men, the enslavement of women and young girls \nas concubines, and the destruction of religious sites is part of the \nISIS effort to destroy these communities. Their plan is to make it as \nif those societies never existed, those religions in that area never \nexisted. In fact, ISIS maintains a special battalion--they call it the \n``demolition battalion''--charged with obliterating religious and \nhistoric sites and artifacts that it considers heretical.\n  And ISIS has used the ``virtual caliphate'' on the Internet to \nrecruit foreign fighters at an unprecedented rate. Some 20,000 of their \nfighters are, in fact, from offshore, are foreign fighters drawn to the \narea from some 90 countries. Those are the numbers that now are \nswelling its ranks. According to intelligence estimates, this includes \nat least 150 Americans that we know of.\n  Yet over the last 10 or so months, the administration has put forth a \nreluctant and half-hearted and ineffective effort to assist our \npartners there on the ground. I think we all recognize that this is up \nto the Iraqi Government to fight to win this. We understand that. They \nare in the lead. But they desperately need help. And I am not prepared \nto say that we shouldn't be providing any military support to the Kurds \nstrung along a 180-mile, or several hundred mile, front, with 180,000 \nsoldiers. Thirty percent of those Kurdish soldiers are female. And \nthose young women are down there with small arms trying to hold off \nISIS fighters along that line. I am not prepared to say that we should \nnot be providing any military support for those Kurds or for the Iraqi \nforces and any air support whatsoever. That is what this resolution \ndoes.\n  It didn't have to be this dire. Well over a year ago, when ISIS was \nbuilding its force in the desert in Syria, it wasn't bombed and \ndevastated when it could have been. It should have been. Many called \nfor an effort at that point to have an air campaign by the U.S. and our \npartners to pummel ISIS as it moved across the desert in these long \ncolumns and begin the process to take city after city. It came out of \nSyria. First it headed to Fallujah, and there was a call to use air \npower to suppress and use ISIS then. That step was not taken. And for \n14 separate cities, city after city, all the way to Mosul, we watched \nevery time the request be made for air power, and that was turned down.\n  Well, we are where we are now. And, frankly, the air campaign by the \nU.S. and our partners isn't pummeling the enemy now, as it should. \nDaily airstrikes against the Islamic State are one-sixth of what they \nwere in the first campaign against the Taliban back in 2001. U.S. \nSpecial Forces should be authorized to call in airstrikes. Most \nAmericans would be puzzled to learn that Canadian Special Forces are \ndoing this, but we are not.\n  Pilots complain of having their hands tied. It has been estimated \nthat three-quarters of U.S. aircraft return to base without discharging \ntheir weapons because of overly restrictive rules of engagement that \ndon't allow them to engage ISIS. As one observer notes, with just \n``piecemeal attacks, the Obama administration has been systematically \nsquandering our air power advantage.'' I think that is right.\n  Adding to the problem, the regional forces on the ground that these \nairstrikes are supposed to be supporting\n\n[[Page H4457]]\n\nare badly undersupplied. After 10 months of fighting, there are still \ntoo many reports that the Kurdish Peshmerga, our allies, are outgunned \non the front lines against ISIS. I have met with their foreign minister \nthree times now as he has made this case. Again, 30 percent of his \nbattalions, Kurdish battalions, are female battalions, and they can't \nobtain the antitank weapons, the artillery, the mortars to use against \nISIS in this battle.\n  While U.S. forces have been training some Iraqis, that has been done \nway behind the front lines. Rather than pairing up with smaller units \nand deploying with them to push them to the front--and that is, by the \nway, a technique that has proven effective in Afghanistan and Iraq in \nthe past--this has not been done. U.S. advisers are unable to bolster \nIraqi units when they come under attack or to call in airstrikes by \nU.S. planes. We don't have the capacity to do that. And that limitation \ntragically helped Ramadi fall.\n  Mr. Speaker, our friends and allies and partners in this region of \nthe world are in serious trouble from the threat of ISIS. They need our \nhelp. Employing our air power like we should, getting those weapons to \nthe front lines that are needed by the Kurds, putting more U.S. Special \nForces into place, would help turn this around.\n  But that is not at all what this measure calls for. As I say, it is \nquite the opposite. It calls for the President to remove United States \nArmed Forces deployed to Iraq or Syria on August 7 or after.\n  The Foreign Affairs Committee has held many hearings on ISIS and \ninstability in the region. We haven't heard any witnesses make the case \nthat complete withdrawal is what is needed.\n  What would happen to Iraq, what would happen to Jordan, what would \nhappen to civilians in the theater? I think we can all agree that \nsituation would compound.\n  This is the question in front of us today: Do we pull the modest \nnumber of our modest presence out of this theater and see ISIS run wild \nacross the Iraqi desert with no help from the United States? I don't \nthink so.\n  There is no military-only answer to the ISIS challenge. The Iraqi \nGovernment must do far more to reconcile with Sunnis, building \nconfidence and empowering them to take on ISIS. ISIS must be attacked \nfinancially, and its propaganda must be relentlessly challenged. And \nArab leaders need to lead. But just as there is no military-only \nanswer, there is no answer without a military component of helping the \nKurds and helping those who are fighting ISIS. And, right now, the U.S. \nrole, as much as we may regret it, is needed desperately.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, in the national security interest of the United States, \nI ask all Members to oppose H. Con. Res. 55.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 55.\n  Let me first say that I believe Congress needs to do its job and pass \nan AUMF, which is the Authorization for Use of Military Force. We \nshould have acted on this months ago. So this is the right message. \nBut, with only the highest respect to my colleague from Massachusetts, \nI believe that withdrawal by a date certain at this time is the wrong \npolicy.\n  This measure would direct the President to remove all U.S. Armed \nForces deployed to Iraq or Syria since August 7, 2014, except those \nneeded to protect American diplomatic facilities and personnel. That is \nno way to defeat ISIS or to help the people of Iraq and Syria. I cannot \nvote for a policy I do not support. However, I share the frustration \nvoiced by Mr. McGovern, Ms. Lee, and many others.\n  I have said time and time again that Congress should pass a new AUMF. \nWe owe it to the American people, we should do our job, and we owe it \nto our men and women in uniform. Congressional inaction on an AUMF is \ninexcusable. Congress has had months to consider the President's \nlanguage, and it is well past time we act.\n  Right now, the administration is using the resolution we passed after \nSeptember 11, 2001, as the legal justification to fight ISIS. This is \ndeeply problematic.\n  First of all, the 2001 AUMF has none of the limits many of us are \nseeking. The American people have no stomach for another large-scale, \nopen-ended commitment of American troops in the Middle East. It was our \ndisastrous intervention in Iraq last decade that set the stage for the \nrise of ISIS in the first place. This is a new challenge, and we need \nnew parameters to define our mission and our goals.\n  At the same time, using a 2001 authorization for a 2015 conflict sets \na terrible precedent. What happens in 5 years when the next \nadministration does the same thing and 5 years after that and 5 years \nafter that? We didn't vote for perpetual war, and we need a new AUMF.\n  We cannot allow that outcome. With a new AUMF, I hope it will be a \nbipartisan effort. I hope it will be the hallmark of our work on the \nForeign Affairs Committee.\n  I commend my friend, Mr. McGovern, for taking a stand on this issue, \nand we are in agreement that the United States must avoid another \nfailed open-ended war in the Middle East. But there is a role for the \nUnited States in this region, and we should not just vote to withdraw. \nI believe that would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\n  The United States has already made a difference by supporting the \nIraqis and the Syrians who are fighting ISIS. It is a difficult fight, \nbut I don't think we can walk away.\n  With American leadership, we were able to prevent a wholesale \nslaughter of Yazidi people. With American help, our Iraqi partners were \nable to maintain control of the Mosul Dam, which, if breached by ISIS, \ncould have resulted in the death and displacement of up to 2 million \npeople. With American assistance, the Iraqi Security Forces and the \nmoderate Syrian opposition are taking back territory, too slowly, but \nthey are taking back territory, particularly in the south.\n  The Foreign Affairs Committee just had a hearing earlier this morning \nand we saw horrific situations of children being gassed in Syria. There \nis no good side in Syria. We have got to somehow let the Free Syrian \nArmy or the rebels, the well-vetted moderate rebels, we have got to \nhelp them, and that is why I believe there is still a role for us to \nplay. A precipitous withdrawal by turning our heads away because we are \nfed up and disgusted, I think, is not the right move.\n  So this fight is far from over, and the United States has a critical \nrole to play. We need an authorization that defines a role for the \nUnited States, a limited role, and that is the measure I will support.\n  I, again, do want to thank Mr. McGovern for bringing this issue to \nthe floor. He is a thoughtful, effective colleague. And while I \nappreciate his resolution, I commend him for focusing this Congress on \nthis important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 55, which comes before the \nHouse today under the provisions of the War Powers resolution. Along \nwith my colleagues Walter Jones and Barbara Lee, we introduced this \nbipartisan bill to force a debate on how Congress has failed to carry \nout its constitutional duty to authorize our military engagement in \nIraq and Syria.\n  Last August, the President authorized airstrikes against the Islamic \nState in Iraq and Syria. For over 10 months, the United States has been \nengaged in hostilities in Iraq and Syria without debating an \nauthorization for this war.\n  On February 11 of this year, over 4 months ago, the President sent to \nCongress the text for an Authorization for Use of Military Force on \ncombating the Islamic State in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere; yet Congress \nhas failed to act on that AUMF or to bring an alternative to the House \nfloor, even though we continue to authorize and appropriate money for \nsustained military operations in those countries.\n  This is unacceptable. This House appears to have no problem sending \nour uniformed men and women into harm's way. It appears to have no \nproblem spending billions of dollars for the arms, equipment, and \nairpower to carry out these wars, but it just can't bring itself to \nstep up to the plate and take responsibility for these wars.\n\n[[Page H4458]]\n\n  Our servicemen and -women are brave and dedicated. Congress, however, \nis guilty of moral cowardice. The Republican leadership of this House \nwhines and complains from the sidelines, and all the while, it shirks \nits constitutional duties to bring an AUMF to the floor of this House, \ndebate it, and vote on it.\n  This resolution requires the President to withdraw U.S. troops from \nIraq and Syria within 30 days or no later than the end of this year, \nDecember 31, 2015. If this House approves this resolution, Congress \nwould still have 6 months in which to do the right thing and bring an \nAUMF before the House and Senate for debate and action--6 months.\n  Either Congress needs to live up to its responsibilities and \nauthorize this war, or by its continuing neglect and indifference, our \ntroops should be withdrawn and should come home. It is that simple.\n  Two weeks ago, General John Allen, the U.S. envoy for the U.S.-led \ncoalition that is fighting ISIL, said that this fight may take ``a \ngeneration or more.'' According to the Pentagon, we have spent more \nthan $2.74 billion in the fight against the Islamic State. That is \nroughly $9.1 million each and every day. We have approximately 3,500 \nboots on the ground, and that number is rising.\n  If we are going to invest a generation or more of our blood and our \ntreasure in this war and if we are going to continue to tell our Armed \nForces that we expect them to fight and die in these wars, it seems to \nme the least we can do is stand up and vote to authorize these wars or \nwe should end them.\n  We owe that to the American people. We owe that to our troops and \ntheir families. We owe that to the oath of office that each of us took \nto uphold the Constitution of the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are going to hear all kinds of crazy today about this \nresolution. Some Members will say that it demands the withdrawal of our \ntroops in 30 days. That is true if you only read half of a sentence in \nthe bill. The other half makes clear that the President has until the \nend of the year to withdraw our troops.\n  Some Members will claim that this resolution will undercut our troops \nwhile they are carrying out bombing campaigns and training Iraqi and \nSyrian soldiers under dangerous conditions. They will claim it will \ndeny the Iraqis and the Kurds our critical support in the fight against \nthe brutal terror and threat of ISIS. They will claim that it will \nleave ISIS unchecked by U.S. airpower and allow them to overrun the \nregion.\n  Mr. Speaker, the truth is that it is precisely these threats and \nthese challenges that make this debate so urgent. With such compelling \nissues at hand, how can Congress stand by and do nothing? How can \nCongress not have this debate and vote on an authorization for this \nwar?\n  By setting a clear deadline Congress cannot ignore, this resolution \nprovides a strong guarantee that Congress will finally do its job, that \nCongress will honor its duty to our troops and to all Americans by \ndebating and voting on an authorization for this war. Our troops \ndeserve a Congress that has the courage to stand with them.\n  I see the courage and sacrifice of our uniformed men and women, but I \nsee nothing but cowardice from the leadership in this House. If they \nbelieve we should send our military forces to Iraq and Syria to fight \nISIS and possibly die over there, then, for heaven's sake, we should do \nour duty--we should do our job--and bring an AUMF to the House floor, \ndebate it, and take some responsibility for this war.\n  That is all this resolution is trying to do. Give the leadership of \nthis House a deadline that even it can't ignore. Either enact an AUMF \nover the next 6 months or withdraw our forces from Iraq and Syria, one \nor the other.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Again, the resolution before us today has nothing to do with an \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force; it is a withdrawal resolution. \nI don't want to leave some of the oversimplified Authorization for Use \nof Military Force rhetoric here unaddressed.\n  The real question that the proponents are begging is: What should the \nUnited States be doing to combat ISIS? The answer with regard to \ntoday's resolution would be nothing and that we should withdraw from \ncombating the ISIS threat. That would be irresponsible and dangerous.\n  I don't disagree that the current state of the legal authorities the \nPresident is using against ISIS is less than ideal from our \ninstitution's perspective, but that does not equal illegal and \nunconstitutional. I say this as someone who is deeply concerned about \nthe President's weak and unstrategic response to the ISIS threat.\n  The President has short-circuited this debate by claiming complete \nauthority under prior statutes to use our Armed Forces against ISIS. \nHis administration has made the case that ISIS, which was previously \nknown as al Qaeda in Iraq, ``has been an enemy of the United States \nwithin the scope of the 2001 authorization--continuously--since at \nleast 2004.'' He has made the case that ISIS grew out of al Qaeda in \nIraq and, in point of fact, that that is where ISIS came from.\n  No AUMF we could draft could give the President more operational \nauthority than he already claims. Indeed, the draft text he sent asks \nus to constrain the authority that he already has and complicating, by \nthe way, the effort to reach consensus.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, just last week, this body considered a Defense \nAppropriations amendment that would have used Congress' constitutional \npower of the purse to force the AUMF issue, cutting off funding if \nCongress does not enact an ISIS-specific AUMF within the next year. \nThat proposal failed in this institution.\n\n  The reality is that Congress has made decisions that amount to, in a \npractical view, disagreeing with the authors of this resolution. \nAllowing the President to use current force authorities against ISIS is \npreferable to refusing to confront the threat ISIS poses to our \nnational security altogether.\n  Now, I will continue to work with Ranking Member Eliot Engel and all \nof our colleagues to see if we can find a way forward on a revised and \nupdated authorization that is focused on the vicious and growing threat \nposed by ISIS. That is what we need to be working on together.\n  Merely acting without a credible way forward is foolhardy. It is not \nbrave. A divisive and unsuccessful AUMF process would be perceived by \nour allies, our partners, and our enemies as a vote of no confidence in \nthe fight against ISIS, resulting in a significant blow to the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. \nHartzler), who chairs the Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and \nInvestigations.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, while I respect my colleague who offered this amendment, \nI oppose this resolution and urge my colleagues to vote in opposition.\n  This unwise resolution would call for the unilateral withdrawal of \nU.S. forces from the fight against ISIL and leave this growing evil to \ncontinue to expand, terrorizing millions.\n  This resolution would do more than halt all U.S. strikes against the \nterrorist group in Iraq and Syria, removing the approximately 3,500 \nU.S. trainers from Iraq; it would unwisely deny the Kurdish Peshmerga \ncritical support to fight against the brutal and barbaric terrorist \ngroup, leaving them alone to stop this threat.\n  This resolution would leave ISIL unchecked by U.S. airpower and allow \nthe vicious terrorist group to gain strength as it would further \ndestabilize the region by threatening allies, such as Jordan, and \ncreate a largely uncontested safe haven from which ISIL could plot \nattacks against the United States.\n  It would allow the continued brutality of a group that beheads \ninnocents, including Americans, that forces women and children into \nsexual slavery, that destroys religious heritage sites, and that \ntargets Christians and others.\n  This resolution has nothing to do with authorizing the use of \nmilitary force against ISIL; instead, this resolution simply \nunilaterally withdraws our U.S. forces from fighting back against this \nevil.\n\n[[Page H4459]]\n\n  I urge opposition to this resolution.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, again, let me say that what we have here, as \nwell-intentioned as I know it is, is a unilateral withdrawal, clean and \nsimple. I understand the frustration, but this is like cutting off your \nnose to spite your face. I think we need to be very, very careful \nbefore we do these things unilaterally.\n  It is now my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank my good friend Eliot Engel from New York, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the full committee of the House Foreign \nAffairs Committee, and I thank my friend Ed Royce, the chairman of the \nfull committee. They are both distinguished men, and I echo their \nsentiments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in reluctant opposition to the measure \noffered by my friend from my home State of Massachusetts, Mr. McGovern, \nwhose sincerity can never be questioned in this body.\n  I understand the purpose underlying this legislation, and I identify \nwith the frustration that it expresses as, I think, do all of us.\n  Proponents of the measure want Congress to debate and vote on the use \nof military force in Iraq and Syria, and so do I. Proponents of this \nmeasure believe that Congress has failed to perform its constitutional \nduty by not taking up the Authorization for Use of Military Force \nagainst the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and so do I.\n  In fact, I believe the failure to debate an AUMF against ISIL is a \ncontinuation of a sad but 60-year pattern of Congress' abrogating one \nof its most fundamental constitutional roles and responsibilities. For \nan institution that constantly laments its subjugation at the hands of \nthe executive branch, the retreat from its constitutional \nresponsibility on this matter, frankly, is jaw-dropping.\n  It is time Congress makes crystal clear to the administration, to our \nallies, to our constituents, and to our military families the \ncircumstances and parameters under which we would, once again, \nauthorize engagement for our and by our men and women in uniform in \nthis tumultuous region of the world or, for that matter, anywhere; but \none cannot endorse the tactic of this measure.\n  This is constructed to be a sort of sword of Damocles that threatens \nus, Congress, with the automatic withdrawal of our forces in the region \nin order to force congressional action with an AUMF.\n  Congress should not heed such a message, nor should it cater to such \na sword hanging over its head in order to do its job. An ill-defined \nmission with no clear mandate and conflicting objectives is hardly a \nformula for a military or a political victory.\n  We should welcome a robust and transparent debate on the matter of an \nAUMF but not at any cost on the battlefield itself--a withdrawal, as \nthis resolution proposes, mandated irrespective of battlefield reality, \nof battlefield progress lately against ISIS, a withdrawal mandated \nirrespective of our commitments to the Kurds or, for that matter, to \nthe Iraqi Government itself.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  That would be irresponsible and unworthy of a great power, however \nnoble the underlying cause is. We have responsibilities on the ground.\n  This resolution was drafted, as they say in Latin, ceteris paribus--\nall other things being equal. That is to say, in a perfect world. We \ndon't live in a perfect world. Our engagements are what they are. Our \ncommitments are what they are.\n  I don't share the distinguished chairman's criticism of this \nadministration. It is a murky region to begin with. Our leverage is \nlimited; our choices are dark and complicated. But we are making \nprogress in the region as we speak. To simply ignore all of that and \ninsist we withdraw, in my view, would be irresponsible and unworthy of \nthis great Nation.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me just say to my colleagues, while I appreciate their thoughtful \nstatements, this resolution that we are debating here today would have \nno standing if there were an AUMF. We wouldn't even be allowed to bring \nthis to the floor.\n  I guess my question is: What do we have to do? What do Members of \nthis House, both Democrats and Republicans, have to do to force the \nleadership here to bring to the floor an AUMF so we can do our job? \nThat is all we are asking for. And, yes, this is a blunt instrument to \ndo it, but I don't know what else it will take to force this issue. I \nthink we owe it to our servicemen and -women to have this debate and to \nhave this vote.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones), a \ncosponsor of this resolution.\n  Mr. JONES. I thank Mr. McGovern for the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as many people have said today, even those who are for \nthe resolution and against the resolution, we have a constitutional \nduty. That duty is to debate. I want to quote James Madison, to put the \ncontext on what we are trying to say today: ``The power to declare war, \nincluding the power of judging the causes of war, is fully and \nexclusively vested in the legislature.'' Not the executive branch, but \nthe legislature.\n  The frustration that we have felt goes back to August of 2014, when \nJim McGovern and Barbara Lee and Walter Jones wrote asking the Speaker \nof the House to allow us to have a debate. That is why Mr. McGovern, \nBarbara Lee, and I have put this resolution in today, to force a \ndebate. We wouldn't be talking about the Middle East if it weren't for \nthis resolution.\n  In September, I sent my own letter to Speaker Boehner and asked for a \nfull debate on an Authorization for Use of Military Force in the \nregion. None of these letters have been answered. None of them. Last \nSeptember, Speaker Boehner told The New York Times that he wanted to \nwait until 2015 to bring an AUMF to the floor of the House for a debate \nand a vote to avoid bringing it up during a lame duck session. Okay, I \ncan accept that, that makes good sense. It does.\n  In December, Speaker Boehner said the House Republicans would work \nwith the President to get an AUMF request approved if the President \nsent one to Congress. As Mr. McGovern just said, he did send us one in \nFebruary. Most people--Democrat and Republican--didn't particularly \nlike what was in the AUMF, but at least it was the vehicle for the \ndebate. But then in February when the Speaker of the House received it, \nhe didn't do anything with it. Nothing has happened.\n  As has been said by speakers before me, last month Jim McGovern, \nBarbara Lee, and I sent another letter to the Speaker of the House \nasking for a debate. Nothing happened. That is the reason this \nresolution is on the floor. It is because, as Madison said: House, do \nyour job. He didn't say: Executive branch, do your job. He said the \nlegislative branch. That is us. We need to do this on behalf of the \nConstitution and on behalf of our young men and women in uniform who \nwill give their life for this country.\n  As has been said before me, it has been 314 days since President \nObama started launching airstrikes and putting troops in Iraq and Syria \nwithout receiving the authorization by Congress. According to the \nPentagon, we have spent over $9 million a day fighting ISIS, for a \ntotal of $2.7 billion. Isn't this another reason that we should be \ndebating the Middle East and our role in the Middle East? I think so.\n  Let me repeat James Madison: ``The power to declare war, including \nthe power of judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested \nin the legislature.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of New York). The time of the \ngentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mr. JONES. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that I bring \nthese pictures to the floor of those who give their life for this \ncountry. This is a flag-draped coffin being pulled off a transport \nplane in Dover, Delaware, and it is time that we meet our obligation \nand debate this issue of war because we are not doing our job. We owe \nit to the American people, to the Constitution, and to those who wear \nthe uniform.\n  I thank Mr. McGovern for the time.\n\n\n[[Page H4460]]\n\n\n\n\n                                     The Constitution Project,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2015.\n     Hon. Jim McGovern,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Hon. Walter Jones,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Hon. Barbara Lee,\n     House of Representatives,\n       Dear Representatives McGovern, Jones and Lee: We write to \n     applaud you for your efforts to compel Congress to exercise \n     its constitutional responsibility to decide on war. For ten \n     months President Obama has prosecuted the war against the \n     Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) under a specious \n     legal claim that Congress authorized it fourteen years ago. \n     Congress has done no such thing. It is high time that Members \n     weighed in.\n       We take no position on grave policy choices about whether \n     to continue to use military force against ISIL, and if so \n     how. But Congress must. The Framers vested the war power in \n     the legislative branch precisely because they believed that \n     young Americans should only be put in harm's way when the \n     people, through their representatives' collective judgment, \n     approved it.\n       We know this is the most difficult issue that Members face. \n     It is also your most important responsibility. If Congress \n     agrees that U.S. service men and women should be engaged in \n     battle, it is Members' constitutional duty to say so. If \n     Congress disagrees, those men and women should come home. \n     What Congress cannot do is continue to avoid the question. We \n     support H. Con. Res. 55 because it would force this long-\n     overdue debate and vote.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact us, via Scott Roehm at \n     The Constitution Project, with any questions or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mickey Edwards,\n       Vice President, Aspen Institute; former Member of Congress \n     (R-OK) and Chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee; \n     co-chair The Constitution Project War Powers Committee\n     Louis Fisher,\n       Specialist in Constitutional Law, Law Library of Congress \n     (ret.); Scholar in Residence, The Constitution Project\n     Virginia Sloan,\n       President, The Constitution Project.\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Wilson), a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I thank Chairman Royce for his \nleadership, along with Ranking Member Eliot Engel.\n  I am in opposition to H. Con. Res. 55, which would withdraw U.S. \nforces currently deployed to Iraq and Syria, which are providing \nregional stability to protect American families. Sadly, this resolution \nwill undermine America's current campaign to fight terrorists overseas. \nIt would end our air campaign in Iraq and Syria, stop our training and \nequipping of Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga and Sunni tribal forces, as well \nas moderate Syrian opposition forces, and abandon our commitment to our \npartners in the region.\n  The resolution would promote ISIS/Daesh's momentum, create safe \nhavens for terrorists to attack American families, and increase the \nTehran regime's influence of a murderous ideology that declares: Death \nto America, death to Israel. It would allow Daesh to become an even \nbigger threat to American families, as we have seen with attacks from \nNew York to Boston. Retreating will create safe havens to enable more \nattacks on American families. We must remember September the 11th in \nthe global war on terrorism. Unilateral withdrawal will not stop the \nwar, as our enemies will continue their attacks.\n  The resolution does not consider the situation on the ground in Iraq \nor Syria or the recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Indeed, \nthis morning, Chairman Martin Dempsey said that withdrawing the troops \nwould be a mistake and put America at greater risk.\n  As the grateful dad of two sons who have served in Iraq, I would \nprefer a clear strategy of victory for our mission in Iraq and Syria. \nWe should not abandon the efforts of peace through strength. I want to \nwork with Members across the aisle to develop a better approach. It is \nmy hope we will take steps to accomplish this.\n  While Operation Inherent Resolve has shortcomings, it is the only \ncourse of action that takes steps toward stopping jihadist extremists \noverseas. I am opposed to House Concurrent Resolution 55 and urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it as well.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a rising star on the Committee on \nForeign Affairs.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. I thank the ranking member and \nalso the chair of our committee. I also want to thank the sponsor and \nauthor of this resolution, Mr. McGovern. Thanks to him, we finally have \na chance to discuss and debate this issue right here on the House \nfloor.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I entered this body, when I was a State \nlegislator and a candidate, I noticed back last August-September, as \nthe ISIS/Daesh movement was growing in Iraq and Syria and other parts \nof the Middle East, the British Parliament rushed back to London to \ndebate a war resolution. I was deeply disappointed, as an American \ncitizen, and, quite frankly, shocked that the United States Congress \ndid not do exactly the same thing; to come here and outline and debate \nthe parameters by which we would authorize the President to wage war \nagainst this evil and barbaric threat. Unfortunately, that did not \nhappen.\n  Several months ago--I think it might have been back in January--\nPresident Obama did submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, of \nwhich I am proudly a member, an Authorization for Use of Military \nForce. Unfortunately, that AUMF, somewhat predictably, got attacked by \nsome on the right as insufficient in some areas; and, frankly, got \nattacked by some on the left as insufficient in other areas. Both sides \nhad legitimate discussions and concerns.\n  What went wrong after that is that we didn't actually have that \ndiscussion or debate right here on the House floor. It was too easy for \nMembers of this body to just say: This is too difficult; we are going \nto let the President handle it, and we are going to shirk our \nresponsibility. That is wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. I do not support the resolution that is \nin front of us and will not be voting for it. I think an outright \nwithdrawal of troops within the next 6 weeks would be a terrible \nmistake and is not the approach that we should take, but I do believe \nit is about time we do our duty and responsibility and have this \ndiscussion and debate. It is about time we, the Congress of the United \nStates, on a bipartisan basis, come up with an actionable plan to fight \nand defeat ISIS, one that is consistent with our values and at the same \ntime one that does not inadvertently commit us to 5 and 10 years down \nthe road responsibilities that we do not envision today.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Rangel), who believes Congress ought to do its job and \npass an AUMF.\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. McGovern, Mr. Jones, Ms. Lee, I thought the House \nwould be screaming at the opportunity to justify sending young men and \nwomen to a part of the world that we believe is of danger to the entire \ncommunity.\n  I am so amazed that people are saying that this resolution calls for \nthe immediate withdrawal of our troops. I don't read it that way \nbecause I don't know of anything that justifies them being there, and \nthis could be screaming for a reason why the administration and Members \nof Congress want these troops there.\n  I have no clue as to why people believe that these people, who have \nbeen fighting each other for thousands of years, are a threat to my \nNation's national security. I don't know of any of my constituents that \ngo to sleep at night worried about ISIS invading their jobless \ncommunity.\n  I do know--because I am old enough to remember--that when the \nJapanese struck Pearl Harbor, immediately President Roosevelt called \nthe Congress to declare war, and America, with pride, came out to \nsupport our Nation and our President.\n  Now, I don't see the connection between ISIS and being struck by \nJapanese and Germans, but I know one thing: When an American dies, when\n\n[[Page H4461]]\n\nthey lose their lives, when we send them overseas, when they come back \nwounded or deranged, we have an obligation in this body to justify why \nwe have done it.\n  I may be wrong, but the reason I think we run away from this \nresponsibility is because we don't really feel the pain of the people \nwe are sending all over the world and exposing them to losing their \nlives. Why don't we feel it? Don't we say, ``Thank you for your \nservice''? Do we thank the people who don't come back? Do we explain \nand go to the funerals that I go to as to why they were there? Do we \nexplain that the President of the United States and the Members of this \nHouse believe it is important for them to be there? All you have to do \nis come here, declare war, or justify why the security of the United \nStates is being threatened, and I then will be prepared to send \nsomebody else's kids to fight this war to protect the rest of our \ncountry. We don't have a draft. We don't pay for the war.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nNew York.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Mr. RANGEL. I conclude by saying that, when issues are serious enough \nfor us to draft other people's kids, when they are serious enough for \nus to say that we are not going to borrow money from Communist China to \npay for these wars, then I can be convinced, even if I disagree, that \nwhen this Congress and this President believes my country is being \nthreatened, you count me in.\n  Until such time, we are waiting to hear about the threat to our \nnational security so that we can make up our minds.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, only in Congress do you have a resolution \npresented to deauthorize the use of force because you want to authorize \nthe use of force.\n  It is, quite frankly, pretty insulting that you would present a \nproposal to this body to withdraw troops and then accuse the other side \nof having moral cowardice for opposing the resolution.\n  There needs to be more mention of the President's strategy to defeat \nISIS--or lack thereof. We have a duty here in Congress to set our \ntroops up to succeed, not to fail.\n  There has been a lot of debate with regard to the Authorization for \nUse of Military Force. I am proud to serve on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. Chairman Royce has had multiple hearings discussing the \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force.\n  Secretary Kerry was before the committee. He was asked: ``Does this \nauthorization authorize offensive action?''\n  He said: ``No.''\n  There was a five-paragraph letter since--with the authorization \nrequest--talking about the need to use Special Forces. We can't get a \nstraight answer from this administration as to whether or not he is \nreferring to ours.\n  Yes, we have a duty to set our troops up to succeed, and not fail. We \nhad a Marine general in front of the Foreign Affairs Committee. When \nasked whether or not the general in charge of our troops overseas in \nIraq has the ability to authorize the mission to take out Abu Bakr al-\nBaghdadi or capture actionable intelligence, he read a paragraph that \nsimply said that that general can make a recommendation.\n  What is further insulting is just how many people don't even know the \nname of that two-star general. Not only does he not have the \nflexibility and resources he needs to accomplish the mission from the \nadministration that is in charge right now, led by the Commander in \nChief, my constituents--Americans--don't even know that gentleman's \nname.\n  Yes, there has been a lot of debate. We have a need to protect our \ntroops. That is why I oppose this resolution.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me just reiterate that I agree that Congress should do its job \nand pass a new AUMF. The question is: Is this the best way to do it? We \nought to pass the right AUMF, not just any AUMF, and we are told we \nshould force the issue.\n  I had a friend who used to say: ``Be careful what you wish for.'' If \nwe pass this resolution, it is more than possible the Republican \nleadership will force through language that we on this side of the \naisle cannot accept, something that does not have the limits the \nDemocrats are seeking, or worse, just ratify the administration's \nargument that the 2001 AUMF applies to ISIL.\n  We need to pass an AUMF, I agree, but we need to pass the right AUMF, \neven if that means we can't do it within 6 months. I hope we can get \ntogether and do that--and we should--and that is why I think this \ndebate is good; but I think passing any AUMF is like buying a pig in a \npoke, and I am not ready to go down that line.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we should have passed an AUMF before we \ngot into this latest war. We have been at it for 10 months. We are \nasking Congress to do its job in the next 6 months. How much longer do \nwe want?\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).\n  Mr. MASSIE. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding.\n  I think some words from James Madison are instructive to this debate. \nHe said:\n\n       In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found \n     than in the clause which confides the question of war and \n     peace to the legislature, and not to the executive \n     department. Beside the objection to such a mixture of \n     heterogeneous powers, the trust and the temptation would be \n     too great for any one man . . . War is in fact the true nurse \n     of executive aggrandizement. In war, a physical force is to \n     be created; and it is the executive which is to direct it. In \n     war, the public treasures are to be unlocked; and it is the \n     executive hand which is to dispense them.\n       Hence, it has grown into an axiom that the executive is the \n     department of power most distinguished by its propensity to \n     war; hence, it is the practice of all States, in proportion \n     as they are free, to disarm this propensity of its influence.\n\n  That was a warning that he gave us. Unfortunately, after being in \nthis conflict for several years without an authorization from Congress, \nwe have devolved into the dystopian condition that he warned us about.\n  I don't think anybody in this body seeks to weaken our powers or give \nthem to the President. What we are debating here is when to have the \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force or a declaration of war. The \ntime to have that was 2 years ago. It was years ago, before the \nPresident acted.\n  To the people who are against this resolution, I say you could be \nright. You might be right. If this resolution fails, I hope you are \nright, that this resolution wasn't necessary, and we do assert our \nconstitutional prerogative, our responsibility, and have that debate \nand therefore instruct the President on the reasons for this engagement \nand what his directives are.\n  I just want to remind my colleagues this is a strategy, this is a \nparliamentary tactic that is necessary to force the debate, and let's \nhave the debate.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas, Judge Poe, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nTerrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I, like the author of this resolution, am concerned \nabout our troops that have been in Iraq and Afghanistan for a long \ntime.\n  In my office, I have photographs of the 37 Texans with connections to \nmy district who have been killed in Iraq or Afghanistan, of all races, \nboth sexes, and all branches of the service. Here we are, years later, \nand we are still there.\n  I am also concerned about this group ISIS. The question is: Is ISIS a \nnational security threat to the United States? I believe that it is. \nThey are doing things to other people that we haven't seen in world \nhistory since the barbarians, and they are doing things much worse than \neven the barbarians did.\n  ISIS wants to establish a caliphate in the Middle East. It wants to \nkill us in the United States. They have made that clear.\n  If ISIS is a national security threat to the U.S., which I believe it \nis, then let's have a plan to defeat them, a plan now. Why are we \nwaiting years to make this decision? Have the debate on the House \nfloor: Are they a national security threat? If yes, go after them; if\n\n[[Page H4462]]\n\nnot, then do something else. Meanwhile, people of all nations are \ndying.\n  I believe that ISIS will continue as long as there is not someone to \nstop them. It is in our national security interest to defeat them. The \nUnited States needs to have a plan. People of all nations are dying. We \nneed to make a decision.\n  We need to make a decision as soon as possible, and we need to pick a \nhorse and ride it, and we need to do it now. This bill is not the \nanswer to doing that. Passing this legislation weakens us and weakens \nour national security. I oppose it.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Frankel).\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this debate is personal to me. I \nwatched my son Ben, then a proud United States marine, being sent off \nto two wars, Afghanistan and Iraq. My family was blessed; he returned \nsafely.\n  Both sides of the aisle know the price of the battle: too many \nkilled, too many deeply scarred, too many lives of loved ones \ndisrupted, trillions of dollars spent, and the reputation of our \ncountry at stake--sometimes for good reasons and sometimes in tragic \nerror.\n  I will agree with those who say that, when terror strikes in the \nworld, it is our concern and it does require our leadership. There are \ntimes when we must risk brave lives to save many more. With that said, \nwhen I came to Washington, I vowed not to send anyone else's son or \ndaughter in harm's way unless I understood the mission and the end \ngame, too.\n  We owe this to all our children. That is why I urge my colleagues to \ntake the time to deliberate and debate on the use of force against the \nterrorists who threaten the security of our country and our allies. \nCongress has no greater responsibility.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Garamendi).\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, article I, section 8 of the United States \nConstitution is clear: Congress, and Congress alone, shall have the \npower to declare war.\n  Make no mistake, the current campaign against ISIS is a war.\n  Mr. Speaker, our esteemed colleague from Texas made a very cogent \nargument about why we need clarity. The inability to have a clear plan \nis based upon the fact that Congress has not yet articulated an \nauthorization to use force that would lay out the parameters and the \nextent of what we would expect the President to do.\n  The President says he has the authorization under the 2001 and 2002 \nauthorizations. Ambiguity, clearly, is present. I disagree with the \nPresident on those as an authorization. I have argued for more than 10 \nmonths that our military operations against ISIS need their own \nauthorization.\n  The President did his part. He submitted a draft to us in February. \nSince then, we have had a few committee hearings, but no real action. \nLeadership in both Houses has refused to schedule votes on this issue, \neither in committee or on the floor. That is unacceptable.\n  We have already run up significant costs, $2.7 billion on operations \nto continue the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. We have begun \ndelivering $1.7 billion of weapons. More importantly, we have lost 7 \nservicemembers already.\n  This has to change. This resolution is to force us, the Congress, to \nuphold our constitutional duty to debate and vote on the authorization \nfor the use of force in Iraq and Syria. I have no doubt that if this \nresolution passes, an appropriate authorization to use force will be \npassed, and we will have clarity as to the scope and conduct of this \nwar.\n  I thank my colleagues for introducing this legislation.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Holding).\n  Mr. HOLDING. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the resolution in front of us today.\n  If passed, the pressure we the United States have been able to apply \nagainst ISIS would be stopped, and our allies in the region would be \nleft out in the cold.\n  There is no doubt about the true wickedness of ISIS in both Iraq and \nSyria. Their twisted views and thirst for blood have spread instability \nin the Middle East, leaving a wake of destruction.\n  The United States, along with our partners, has struggled to beat \nback ISIS' advances, and the adoption of this resolution would \neffectively end our operations against ISIS, thus creating a direct \nthreat to our national security and our interests.\n  Mr. Speaker, this resolution is misguided and unwise, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution brought to the \nfloor by my colleague, Mr. McGovern.\n  No one disputes the horrific nature of the activities being described \ntoday and the sickening violence in this region of the world. No one \ndisputes they must be defeated. The question is: What is the best \nstrategy to defeat them and what authorization is required to \naccomplish this objective?\n  This is exactly the purpose of a full, thoughtful debate on the use \nof military force.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  My constituents expect Congress to do its job, and we have failed for \n4 months to act on the President's draft for the Authorization for Use \nof Military Force.\n  There is no more serious duty that we have than the declaration of \nwar, and I thank my friend from Massachusetts for taking an action \nintended to force the House to perform its constitutional \nresponsibility and debate the use of military force in Iraq and Syria. \nThis resolution is our only vehicle to force the House to do what it \nhas failed to do.\n  Over the past 14 years, the United States has lost more than 6,000 \nheroes who served our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, I am \ndeeply concerned about the possibility that we could continue to commit \nmore brave American men and women in uniform to a conflict without \ncarefully considering, seriously debating, and properly authorizing \nthat use of military force.\n  Allowing this military action to continue without a real public \ndebate is failing our most solemn responsibility as Members of \nCongress. This is the only way that we will ultimately develop and \nimplement a successful strategy--a rigorous debate in full public view.\n  We absolutely must ensure that any additional involvement in any way \nhas clearly defined goals and objectives, is properly limited in scope, \nand is fully explained to and supported by the American people. That is \nwhat Mr. McGovern's resolution attempts to do, to force this House over \nthe next several months to undertake its constitutional responsibility \nto debate, to carefully consider, and to ultimately authorize the use \nof military force. We should not shirk this responsibility.\n  I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for giving us the \nopportunity to make our voices heard. I thank the gentleman from New \nYork.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this hour, this minute, this second is \nactually a gift to the American people. I thank the proponents of this \nresolution because it recognizes, first and above all, that this little \ndocument, the Constitution, albeit small, creates mountains of \nresponsibility on behalf of the American people.\n  This moment, this minute, this second we are giving the American \npeople their due and their respect, and that is to acknowledge that \nthere must be a full debate on sending our treasure continuously to \nIraq and Syria. There is no divide between us on the vileness of ISIS \nand all of the terrorist groups and the willingness of the American \npeople to be empathetic, sympathetic, and helping the Iraqis and \nSyrians and those who are suffering and those who are bleeding.\n  But the question has to be, after 6,000 wounded, hundreds who have \nbeen killed particularly in my State, and thousands more across the \nNation, we have to find the pathway where all of us know what we are \ndoing.\n\n[[Page H4463]]\n\n  This is an important resolution. We need the debate, and we need to \nunderstand that our soldiers need to be protected and ultimately \nbrought home.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 55, directing \nthe President, pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution, \nto remove United States Armed Forces deployed to Iraq or Syria on or \nafter August 7, 2014, other than Armed Forces required to protect \nUnited States diplomatic facilities and personnel, from Iraq and Syria.\n  This resolution provides a procedural mechanism for Congress to do \nits job.\n  Specifically, the resolution gives the House leadership 6 months to \ntake up an AUMF, debate it and vote up or voted down.\n  This time frame allows the President the opportunity to revise the \nAUMF to state his objectives and goals for consideration by Congress.\n  As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and the Ranking \nMember of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland \nSecurity and Investigations, I stand in strong support of our country's \narmed forces' might and our valiant soldiers and armed personnel who \nhave fought to protect our country.\n  I also stand with the American people and taxpayers, who have placed \ntheir trust in the President and his Administration through war and \npeace.\n  After all, not too long ago, he was one of us grappling with the war \nlogic we were presented by the prior administration.\n  President Obama inherited this war, along with a problematic economy \nand we applaud all his good faith efforts to do ``damage control'' to \nfix a problem he did not create as it relates to ending war and \nfacilitating a better economy for the American people.\n  I recognize that it is not an easy feat to fix our problematic war \npolicies under enormous pressure from both sides of the aisle.\n  We recognize that the President has been thoughtful, deliberative and \njudicious about our presence in Iraq and Syria.\n  We appreciate the threat to the United States posed by the current \ninstability in the Middle East, especially with events in the recent \npast: the Arab Spring, ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n  We have spent nearly trillions of dollars in wars against ISIS in \nIraq and Syria.\n  Let me be clear the threat of ISIS and terrorism is clear.\n  That is why we need to have a full clear and comprehensive debate on \nwhat the plan is.\n  We have six months to do it and thus we can be thoughtful and \ndeliberate about it.\n  To keep our homeland safe, we must be able to defeat and destroy \nISIS.\n  Over 7,000 fallen heroes have sacrificed their lives to protect our \ncountry and help facilitate democracy in Iraq and Syria.\n  Their devotion to our country is remarkable and inspiring.\n  The Islamic State, also known as ISIS is gobbling up land in Iraq and \nSyria.\n  In 2007, I introduced H.R. 930, the ``Military Success in Iraq and \nDiplomatic Surge for Political and National Reconciliation in Iraq Act \nof 2007'' (MSIA).\n  Among other things, H.R. 930, would require a diplomatic full-court \npress designed to engage all six of Iraq's neighbors--Iran, Turkey, \nSyria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait--more constructively in \nstabilizing Iraq. These countries are already involved in a bilateral, \nself-interested and disorganized way.\n  The MSIA Act would ensure that never again will the American people \nor the Congress be bamboozled into rubber-stamping an ill-advised, ill-\nplanned, preemptive war.\n  In the Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas alone, more than \n300 Texans have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\n  Indeed, more than 3,000 Texans have been wounded.\n  The cost of war is brutal on our communities.\n  In my state, of the over 3,000 lives that have been lost, I can \nassure you that thousands more lives are affected.\n  To date, the war in Iraq alone has claimed the lives of over 4,000 \nbrave servicemen and women. More than 30,000 Americans have been \nwounded, many suffering the most horrific injuries.\n  The mothers, fathers, wives, brothers, sisters, children, cousins, \naunts, uncles and friends of those of our fallen soldiers are affected.\n  How do they manage?\n  How do they cope after losing their loved ones?\n  How does a mother deal with the reality of burying her son or \ndaughter?\n  How does a father mourn the loss of his adult child, whose bright \nfuture carried a lot of his aspirations for a better and safer America?\n  That is just the human cost.\n  We are grateful to various U.S. agencies and non-profit organizations \nlike the wounded warriors organizations that are helping these brave \nmen and women attempt to put the pieces together.\n  We made the point that it was essential for this and prior \nAdministrations to develop ``a plan'' for any war we sought to embark \nupon.\n  Yes, we understand that the Armed Forces of the United States is \nunparalleled on the battlefield and would decisively defeat Iraq's \nforces and remove Saddam Hussein, which in fact we did.\n  But the existential question was what do we do next?\n  This resolution allows time for the President to come up with a plan \nfor Congress to look at and consider.\n  Just consider these facts. Since the war began in Iraq and Syria:\n  In addition to our American causalities, hundreds of thousands of \nIraqi and Syrian civilians have been killed.\n  About 13.6 million people, equivalent to the population of London, \nhave been displaced by the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and many are \nwithout food or shelter according to the UNHCR.\n  More than a trillion dollars has been expended on both wars;\n  On the operations against ISIS, it is estimated that we are spending \nas much as $22 billion a year.\n  Could this money be put to better use? Well, consider the following:\n  How about fully funding the last week's Trade Adjustment Bill we \nvoted on to protect over 280,000 American workers displaced by U.S. \ninvolvement in global trade;\n  A well funded TAA is designed to help train American workers \ndisplaced into new career paths so that they are able to make a living \nand support their families;\n  Programs funded by the TAA provide a path for employment growth and \nopportunity through aid to U.S. workers who have lost their jobs as a \nresult of foreign trade;\n  The TAA provide our trade-affected workers with opportunities to \nobtain the skills, resources, and support they need to become \nreemployed;\n  According to the DOL, over 5 percent of Americans are still looking \nfor work and are unemployed or underemployed;\n  That means 1.5 million Americans are struggling financially;\n  This translates to millions of families.\n  Should we not be working to improve the livelihood of Americans?\n  Mr. Speaker, opponents of the resolution before us contend that it \ngives comfort to the enemy and undermines the President's strategy for \nsuccess in war in Iraq and Syria.\n  What we need is a solid strategy that is supported by the \nAdministration, Congress and the American people.\n  This starts with a plan put forth by the President and debated and \napproved by the Congress.\n  This is why we should afford the President the opportunity to come up \nwith this plan.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, exiles and militia leaders have \nfound their way into Iraq and Syria in the likes of ISIS and are now a \nmenace to peace loving people everywhere.\n  Peace, security, and the protection of lives is and should be our \npriority.\n  That is why I strongly and proudly support our magnificent, heroic, \nand selfless service men and women.\n  That is why I strongly support H. Con. Res. 55 which provides a \nprocedural mechanism for Congress to do its job, by giving House \nleadership 6 months to take up an AUMF, debate it and vote up or voted \ndown.\n  I urge all members to support the resolution before the House.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Kinzinger), a member of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce, who also served in the U.S. Air Force in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand was one of the earliest voices calling for airstrikes against ISIS.\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his \nleadership on this issue for, unfortunately, the long time that we have \nbeen having to deal with this.\n  I am surprised. We watch the news. We see what is happening overseas \nand from afar, and we see the human tragedy occurring; yet we are here \ndebating an isolationism resolution to withdraw all military actions \nfrom the Middle East at a time when we see utter human tragedies. This \nis not the time, in fact, to halt military operations.\n  I would like to speak out quickly on an issue that I think underlines \nthis whole debate. There are some that believe that if our foreign \npolicy were simply nicer, if our foreign policy were more accommodating \nor less focused on military power, then the world and, more \nimportantly, our enemies would suddenly view America in a much \ndifferent light, or that the problems that we are facing today, we \nwouldn't be facing them at all. This is a view of pacificism or \ndisengagement in the world,\n\n[[Page H4464]]\n\nand it represents at best a naive world view, and I think it is \ncertainly an illusion.\n  Ironically, as we debate the merits of this resolution, we have a \ncase study in the illusion of pacifism or disengagement. The President \nlaid down a red line against Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and, in fact, \nthe Russians supposedly gave the President an off-ramp in which he was \nable to exit and allow Bashar al-Assad to simply give up his chemical \nweapons.\n  When we saw that nicer new engagement by the United States, we did \nnot see a peaceful Bashar al-Assad emerge realizing that he had simply \nmisunderstood the United States. We saw the same brutal dictator that \nmurdered his own people continued to be brutal and murderous.\n  Before we withdrew troops completely from Iraq, many implored the \nPresident to leave a residual force. We didn't do it, and we have now \nthe next iteration of al Qaeda, named ISIS. Now, that may be a bit of \nan oversimplification, but it is, in essence, what we see.\n  I think it is fine to have a debate about AUMF in this Chamber, and \nwe should. What the President gave us was an AUMF that not only limited \nhis ability to fight ISIS, but limited the ability of the next \nPresident of the United States to fight and destroy ISIS. I personally \nwon't be a party to tying the President's hands.\n  Mr. Speaker, I was in Iraq just a few months ago, and I saw the human \ntragedy that occurred. I stood in the U.N. refugee camp and had a \nlittle girl come up to me and explain through a translator how her \nparents were killed by ISIS and how she ran away fleeing for security, \nand I realized the important role that the United States of America \nplays, the unfortunate burden that we must bear for world security.\n  Mr. Speaker, we either stand up and fight ISIS now, or we sit on our \nknees and cower before them later.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nSherman), a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is unacceptable that we have not debated \nin committee and on the floor of this House an AUMF and a foreign \npolicy designed to fit current circumstances, designed to fit an Assad \nregime that has killed nearly 200,000 of his own people, designed to \nfit ISIS, which either is or isn't a part or a former part of al Qaeda. \nInstead, we operate under a resolution passed in the wake of the \nattacks in 2001.\n  The resolution before us I do not think is the answer to the fact \nthat Congress has not debated a new AUMF.\n  The reason I rise to oppose it is because I urge Members to read it. \nIt says that all forces must be withdrawn in 30 days unless there is \nsome threat to their security. It says that it ends all deployment, but \nit is not clear how it applies to Air Force operations or Naval air \noperations. Presumably, we would stop all bombing under all \ncircumstances.\n  How does it apply to the rights of the President under current law to \ndeploy our forces for 60 to 90 days if there would be some further \noutrage from the Assad regime?\n  We need a new resolution that does Congress' best job to deal with \nthe current circumstances. What we don't need is the idea that blaming \nObama for everything constitutes a foreign policy strategy.\n  The fact is that it was the Bush administration that installed and \nleft al-Maliki in power. It is al-Maliki that expelled all our forces \nand would not allow a residual force. Would we have gone to war with \nthe Iraqi Army under al-Maliki if he expelled our forces? I have yet to \nhear that suggested by the blame Obama side.\n  The fact is that we cannot leave our forces in a country that will \nnot sign a status of forces agreement with us.\n  The great problem with Iraq today is what al-Maliki did to that \ncountry, and the person who installed al-Maliki was the former \nPresident of the United States, President George W. Bush.\n  So I look forward, first, to the defeat of this resolution but, \nsecond, to consideration of a new AUMF that focuses on whether we will \ndo anything about Assad or only go after ISIS, whether we will use \nground forces, which I oppose, or just use our Air Forces. That debate \nneeds to start in our committee, but this resolution is not an answer.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I don't appreciate this resolution being \nmischaracterized. The troops don't have to be withdrawn for 6 months, \nand the point of this resolution is to force this House to do its job \nand pass an AUMF. If my colleagues are so upset that we haven't debated \nand voted on an AUMF, they ought to support this resolution because it \nis the only way we are going to force the leadership in this House to \ndo its job.\n  With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nO'Rourke).\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, this is the best way I can think of of \nsupporting our servicemembers and their families in this time of war, \nbecause I can think of no greater way to support them, to ensure that \nwe have a strategy with defined, achievable goals when we are going to \nput their lives on the line. Today, I don't know that we have that.\n  Do we have a partner in Iraq that has the will to fight? Do we have \nthe resources necessary across two different battlefields in Iraq and \nSyria to achieve the President's goal of degrading, defeating, and \ndestroying ISIS? Do we have a strategy that is worthy of the loss of \neven one American servicemember's life?\n  I think all of those questions are worthy of discussion and debate, a \ndebate that would hopefully lead to an intelligent use of military \nforce with that defined strategy.\n  This, Mr. Speaker, I believe, is our way of supporting soldiers and \ntheir families. It is also a way that the American people can hold us \naccountable by making the most important, awesome decision that a \nMember of Congress can, which is to put an American servicemember in \nharm's way.\n  I want to make sure that we can source the judgment and wisdom of the \npeople that we represent. I, for one, if we have that debate and have \nthat vote, will go back to my community. I will talk to veterans who \nhave served in our wars. I will talk to the parents of future \nservicemembers whose children's lives will be put on the line, some \nwhich will be lost, some which will be changed forever. I think that is \nthe minimum responsibility that we must meet.\n  I wish that an AUMF were brought to the floor in some other way, but \ntoday this is the only way to get there. For that reason, I will \nsupport this.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. \nWalorski), a member of the Armed Services and the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittees.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I just came from an Armed Services \nCommittee meeting where the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs both agreed that under no circumstances should this \nHouse consider this resolution at this time, which is conceivably an \nimmediate withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and Syria. This causes, \nthey discussed, an immediate risk to our homeland and our allies.\n  We would not be here today debating this issue if the Commander in \nChief had articulated a strategy to the American people. We would not \nbe debating this concept.\n  Even so, Mr. Chairman, this is dangerous for America, and this is not \nthe way to go on a plan for an immediate withdrawal with our allies and \nwith our homeland being at risk.\n  The world is watching today. The world has watched for the last \nseveral years our lack of a foreign policy plan, but today the world is \nwatching to see if this U.S. House is going to stand together in a \nbipartisan manner and reject this resolution and stand together for the \nsafety that we were sworn to stand together and uphold, which is the \nsafety of the United States of America.\n  I ask my colleagues to reject this resolution.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Sherman).\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I don't want to characterize the \nresolution. I want to read it.\n  It requires the President of the United States to remove all of our \nforces, except those needed to protect our diplomatic facilities--and \nhere are the words--``by no later than the end of the period of 30 days \nbeginning on the day on which this concurrent resolution is adopted.''\n\n[[Page H4465]]\n\n  Now, that certainly applies to all our naval forces and all our air \nforces. But then it goes on to say, if the President determines that it \nis not safe to remove forces, he can have an additional period up to \nthe end of the year. That assumes that our ground forces cannot be \nwithdrawn within a 30-day period.\n  Our forces are mobile. They are capable. They are currently behind \nthe front lines. And they can, indeed, leave within 30 days. So clause \n2 is applicable only to a military that is engaged in combat or is \nimmobile. Our military is neither.\n  Clause 1: ``30 days beginning on the day on which this concurrent \nresolution is adopted.''\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the resolution because basically what it \ndoes, it gives the President up through the end of the year, if he so \nchooses. I mean, that is what the resolution says. And I would hope \nthat in 6 months we could come together and pass an AUMF. I would hope \nthat all my colleagues--who are complaining here that we don't have an \nAUMF--would actually come together in the next 6 months to do something \nbecause it hasn't happened in the first 10 months. We can point fingers \nall we want, but it is not getting done.\n  And this is a way to force this Congress to do its job. It is that \nsimple.\n  This is not about walking away from the conflict in the Middle East. \nThis is about making sure that the men and women who serve in the \nUnited States Congress live up to our constitutional responsibilities \nand do our job.\n  I am sorry that so many people think that is a radical idea, but we \nhaven't done our job. And I think it is a disservice to the men and \nwomen who serve in our Armed Forces, and it is a disservice to our duty \nas Members of Congress.\n  With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. \nNolan).\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, one of the great \nfailures of this Congress in our time has been the abdication of our \nresponsibility, which could not be more clearly defined by our \nFounders, for declarations of war and, subsequently, resolutions \nauthorizing the use of force.\n  Clearly, the time is long overdue for this Congress to step up and \nassume its responsibility for these declarations, these seemingly \nendless wars of choice that are so costly in blood and in treasure. It \nis time that this Congress step up and have that debate on whether or \nnot it is in our interest to continue our involvement in these wars. We \nneed to be presented with a rationale. We need to be presented with a \nstrategy. Or, in fact, it is time to put an end to them and to bring \nour troops home.\n  Mr. Speaker, my fellow colleagues, we owe it to our taxpayers, who \nhave spent trillions of dollars in these ventures. We owe it to our \nFounders, who knew and understood the importance of having the Congress \nmake these decisions--not executives. And we owe it to our troops.\n  It is time to have that resolution debated and decided here, or it is \ntime to bring the troops home, Mr. Speaker.\n  As Judge Poe would say, ``And that is just the way it is.''\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lee), one of the coauthors of this resolution.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank Congressman McGovern for \nyielding and for his tireless effort and leadership. Also, I am proud \nto join with Congressman Walter Jones and, again, Mr. McGovern on this \nbipartisan resolution.\n  This resolution calls only for the withdrawal of U.S. Armed Forces \nfrom Iraq and Syria by the end of the year absent, mind you--absent--\nthe passage of an Authorization for Use of Military Force against ISIS.\n  However, this resolution is also about reclaiming a fundamental \nconstitutional responsibility: the constitutionally protected right of \nCongress to debate and determine whether and when this country enters \ninto war.\n  For the last 10 months, our Nation has been fighting yet another war \nin the Middle East, a war that Congress has yet to authorize or even to \ndebate. We have been patient, and we have given the House leadership \nplenty of time to develop a strategy to bring up an authorization.\n  When this war began, Congressman McGovern and I wrote to the Speaker, \ncalling for an immediate debate and vote. Nothing happened. Then at the \nbeginning of this Congress, the Speaker said that the President had to \nsend to Congress an authorization. More than 4 months ago, the \nPresident did just that. Once again, nothing happened.\n  In the 10 months since the war began, we have had no real debate and \ncertainly no vote. This is outrageous.\n  Now, let me be clear about what we are trying to do with this \nresolution. This is not about making a political point. This is about \nforcing Congress to take up an Authorization for Use of Military Force \nby the end of the year and to follow through on its constitutional \nresponsibility. It is about making us do our job. It is unfortunate \nthat we have to do that.\n  The timeline included in this bill gives the leadership of the House \n6 months to bring forward an AUMF, but the clock is ticking.\n  Just last week, the President announced he authorized the deployment \nof 450 more American troops to train and assist Iraqi forces in the \nfight against ISIS.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is textbook mission creep.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here to say, enough is enough. After more than a \ndecade of wars in the Middle East, thousands of U.S. lives and billions \nof dollars lost, the need for Congress to reclaim its war-making powers \nis more critical than ever.\n  Members of Congress are sent to Washington, D.C., to make hard \ndecisions, but in the case of war, Congress, instead, has chosen to \nduck its responsibilities.\n  And let me just say, the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military \nForce--which is a blank check for endless war--has been cited as the \nauthorization for the ongoing war against ISIS. That is why, of course, \nI voted against it 14 years ago and have introduced legislation every \nCongress to repeal this blank check for endless war.\n  Keeping this authorization on the books indefinitely without \nrepealing or replacing it has allowed Congress to avoid its \nconstitutional responsibility to bring up an authorization against \nISIS.\n  From what I remember, we only had 1 hour of debate in 2001. At least, \nMr. Speaker, we have 2 hours now to debate whether or not to debate an \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force.\n  Congress must have a role in how we do our work and what we are \nrequired to do, and that is exactly what this resolution is about. Many \nof us agree that a robust debate and a vote is necessary, long overdue, \nand must take place.\n  During the full committee markup last week of the Defense \nAppropriations bill, I offered a sense of Congress amendment that \nsimply reaffirmed that Congress has a constitutional duty to debate and \ndetermine whether or not to authorize the use of military force against \nISIS. This amendment was adopted with the support of six Republicans on \nthe committee.\n  While we may all not agree on what an AUMF should look like, we know \nthere is bipartisan agreement around the need for Congress to debate on \na specific AUMF.\n  We need to do our job. We know full well there is no military \nsolution in Iraq or Syria, for that matter, and that any lasting \nsolution must be settled in the region among warring factions.\n  The American people deserve to know the costs and the consequences of \nthis new war, and Members of Congress should represent their \nconstituents by saying ``yes'' or ``no.''\n  This resolution is a procedural mechanism. It is unfortunate, again, \nthat we have to do this to make us live up to our constitutional job \nand duty in the matters of war and peace.\n  We need to vote ``yes'' on this resolution. It is simple. It is \nbipartisan. It just requires us to do our job and to exercise our \nconstitutional responsibilities. Enough is enough. We cannot allow the \nAmerican people to have no voice in what is said and what is being done \nwith their taxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas\n\n[[Page H4466]]\n\n(Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us here today, in my \njudgment, is dangerous and should be defeated.\n  For months, Congress and the American people have demanded a strategy \nfrom this administration to defeat and destroy ISIS, a barbaric and \ngrowing terrorist empire that threatens not only the people of Iraq and \nSyria but also the United States.\n  Today the Secretary of Defense testified that ``ISIS is a threat to \nthe homeland because of its avowed intentions to strike and recruit in \nthis country. ISIS must be and will be dealt a lasting defeat.''\n  But this President does not have a strategy to accomplish this. We \ncontinue to fight the terrorists with one hand tied behind our back, \nand the only thing worse would be to disengage completely, which is \nexactly what this resolution would do.\n  I recently led a bipartisan delegation to the Middle East, where I \nvisited Iraq, ground zero in the fight against ISIS, a week before \nRamadi was overtaken by ISIS, and I spoke with Prime Minister Abadi. \nUnfortunately, the current strategy, in my opinion, relies too heavily \non Shia militias, a proxy of Iran, to defeat ISIS.\n  We now have over 3,000 American servicemembers there to advise and \nassist the Iraqi national military. But the President has restricted \nour ability to take the fight to the enemy because he is more committed \nto his campaign pledge to end the wars in the Middle East than he is to \nending ISIS. The President has, in fact, made the situation more \ndangerous. His failure to negotiate a status of forces agreement and \nthe complete failure of Prime Minister Maliki to govern effectively \ncreated a vacuum that ISIS now fills.\n  In Syria, a civil war continues to rage. There too ISIS has filled \nthe void. Islamist fanatics from more than 100 countries have traveled \noverseas to fight with groups like ISIS and al Qaeda. Thousands of \nthese jihadists carry Western passports and can exploit security gaps \nto return to the West and the homeland, where they plot attacks against \nthe United States.\n  Meanwhile, Iran is actively engaged in both Iraq and Syria, embedding \nShia fighters in Sunni communities in Iraq and doing Assad's bidding in \nSyria.\n  As Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu recently told our delegation: \n``Iran and ISIS are competing for the crown of militant Islam.''\n  This resolution would ensure that Iran and ISIS will continue to \ndominate in the region while thousands of innocent civilians suffer and \ndie.\n  Just ask the Yazidi Christians in Iraq if they support leaving \nsecurity in the hands of ISIS and the Iranians. Thousands of Yazidis \nwould have been killed last summer if it weren't for U.S. airstrikes to \nrepel an ISIS advancement against them. Nothing could be more \nirresponsible or damaging to our interests.\n  But let me say this in response to those who say this is a vote to \nurge an AUMF vote. I personally support a strong AUMF, an \nauthorization, but one to defeat and destroy ISIS.\n  We met the White House counsel. He presented a very different AUMF \nthat would restrict further the President's current abilities to \ndestroy and defeat ISIS. I cannot support that.\n  And this resolution, with all due respect, is the wrong way to \naccomplish the goal of defeating ISIS through a strong Authorization \nfor Use of Military Force.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Nadler), my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, and I commend the \nsponsors, Mr. McGovern and Ms. Lee, for introducing it. And I do so not \nbecause I necessarily think we ought to withdraw all our troops in 6 \nmonths. Maybe we should. I am not sure of that yet. But I do know that \nwe are waging a war that is probably unconstitutional, as we did in \nLibya.\n  Since World War II, we have time after time gotten away from the \nconstitutional command that Congress shall declare war. The Framers \nsaid war is too important to allow one person--the President--to decide \non it. But we have gotten away from that. We got away from it because \nwe didn't have time. That was the excuse. With the missiles flying over \nthe poles, you couldn't call Congress into session.\n  But then came Iraq. We had a resolution for the use of military \nforce. Then came Libya. No excuse. Plenty of time to consult with NATO. \nPlenty of time to consult with Arab countries. No time to consult with \nCongress. I believe that was an unconstitutional--and a foolish, as it \nturns out--but an unconstitutional use of force.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. Speaker, now we have this force in the Middle East, in Iraq and \nin Syria. We are getting more and more into a war. I am not commenting \non the intelligence of that right now. It may be that we have no choice \nbut to fight ISIS. Maybe, as the Republicans seem to want without \nsaying so, we should have a lot of boots on the ground, because that is \nwhat they are really saying when they say the President is doing it \nhalfway. Or maybe the bigger threat is Iran, and we should turn our \nattentions to Iran instead of tacitly allying with Iran against ISIS. \nOr maybe we should say it is up to the Middle Eastern people--they can \nhandle it--and pull our troops out altogether. That is the debate we \nought to have. And what are the limits of our commitment, if any? That \nought to be debated in Congress. Congress ought to make these decisions \nin the name of the American people, not the President.\n  Now, because we haven't had an AUMF on the floor, we must have this \nresolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. NADLER. This resolution is not intended to force a pullout in 6 \nmonths. It is intended to force a debate in Congress in 6 months. Let \nus get back to our constitutional tradition. Let Congress do its job, \nand if the President submitted an AUMF that is too strong or too weak, \nlet's bring up a different one. But it is our job to make those \ndecisions. It is our job to stand before our constituents to say we \nbelieve this is important enough to go to war with ISIS or with Iran, \nto send more troops there or not, and here is why and here are the \nlimitations, we shouldn't have boots on the ground or we should.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are our decisions to make, and our decisions we \nshouldn't be able to avoid. That is what this is about. We have had 10 \nyears of war, 13 years of war. The 2001 AUMF cannot possibly be \nrelevant now. We thought we were voting for 3 weeks of strikes against \nbases in Afghanistan. The 2002 AUMF was to topple Saddam Hussein. He is \ngone. I didn't think that was a good idea, but it is over. The \nconsequences are not over.\n  We ought to debate this. We ought to debate an AUMF. We ought to pass \none or not. That is our decision, but let's pass this resolution that \nsupports that decision on us.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis).\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution.\n  First let me thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Lee), and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nJones) for their tireless leadership on this issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. McGovern.\n  For 14 long years, our Nation has been at war. Our people are sick \nand tired of war. This resolution simply opens the door to bring \nAmerican soldiers home.\n  Let me be clear. We must maintain a strong national defense. We have \na responsibility to protect our borders, our diplomats, and Americans \nat home and abroad. But the end to terrorism is not found through the \nbarrel of a gun or more boots on the ground. More weapons cannot stomp \nout the root causes of terrorism, and more bombs cannot eradicate the \nseeds of hate.\n  Over and over again, I have stood on this very floor and reminded my \ncolleagues that the use of force cannot--must not--be taken lightly, \nespecially when the needs at home are so great and the sea of terrorism \nis so vast.\n  President John F. Kennedy once said, ``Those who make a peaceful \nrevolution\n\n[[Page H4467]]\n\nimpossible will make violent revolution inevitable.''\n  Many years ago, I shared my concerns with you that young people in \nthe Middle East would never forget the violence that they have \nexperienced in their youth. I feared then--and I say it again--that \nthey would grow up hating our children, our grandchildren, and \ngenerations yet unborn. I feared those young people would have very \nlittle faith in the idea of democracy, in the values of inclusion, or \nthe hope for lasting peace.\n  ``Hate begets hate,'' as Martin Luther King, Jr., would say, \n``violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness. We \nmust meet the forces of hate with the power of love.''\n  These young people must be our focus. We must lift them up and listen \nto regional voices for peace. We must counter the consequences of \nviolence by demonstrating that diplomacy and the spread of true \ndemocracy are the most effective weapons against terrorism.\n  Yes, I will say it again. Our people are sick and tired of war. I \nhope that all of my colleagues will support this resolution and vote \n``yes'' for a method to build a peace for long a time and for years and \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. It is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom the District of Columbia, Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York for \nyielding to me. I have something special to say.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the United States has increasingly drifted into war \nwithout the usual congressional authorization, I appreciate that \ntoday's resolution permits the House to assert its appropriate role. I \nonly ask that the residents of the District of Columbia be permitted to \nbe heard in the same way as other Americans. My colleagues will not \nonly speak today, they also will vote the will of their constituents. \nAlthough District residents are already serving in Iraq, Syria, and \nelsewhere, I am limited to speaking without a vote.\n  What an outrage, especially to our veterans. That outrage is \namplified, considering that District residents pay $12,000 annually per \ncapita in Federal taxes, more in Federal taxes than the residents of \nany State in the Union, to support our government in war and in peace. \nRegardless of what is decided on this resolution, Mr. Speaker, District \nresidents will be there for America, as they have been for every war \never since the Nation was created. It is time that the Congress was \nthere for District residents.\n  Nearly 200,000 D.C. residents have fought for America's freedom in \ntime of war, yet our residents, including our veterans, are still \ndenied a vote in the national legislature that sent them to war. In \nfact, D.C. servicemembers fought and won the vote for citizens in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, yet our veterans came home without the same voting \nrights for themselves. The Nation willingly accepts their sacrifices \nand demands their tax dollars but denies them representation in \nCongress.\n  D.C. residents have not only given their lives for this country since \nits creation as a nation, they have died in disproportionate numbers in \nall of the 21st century wars; yet these veterans, among the 650,000 \nAmericans who live in the District of Columbia, still have no vote on \nnational security, no vote on defense spending, no vote in the decision \nto send our country to war, and no vote on anything else in this House.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. NORTON. I protest, Mr. Speaker. I protest continuing to demand \nfull citizenship costs from the residents of our Nation's Capital while \ndenying them the vote granted to all other Americans that come with \nthose costs.\n  I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford.)\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for \noffering this important proposal that he is joined with by colleagues \nfrom California, New York, North Carolina, and other places.\n  I am a Republican who stands proudly with this Democrat because I \nthink he is hitting the nail on the head. I do so because, in this \ninstance, it has been argued against as a blunt instrument. But what \nthe Founding Fathers were incredibly deliberate about--very blunt \nabout, if you will--was that only Congress had the ability to declare \nwar. And so this one blunt instrument is ultimately about backing up \nthe bluntness of the Constitution in absolutely being declarative in \nsuggesting that only Congress has the power to authorize war.\n  What the Founding Fathers knew was that, at the end of the day, body \nbags don't come back to Washington, D.C., when something goes wrong in \nsome far-off battlefield; they come back to congressional districts \nacross this country. So they wanted a check and a balance wherein \npeople from those local districts could report into Congress and say \nthat this is or this isn't working for folks back home.\n  Again, the Founding Fathers were so blunt. I look here at a document \nthat is 250 days beyond the authorization of war that is even granted \nin the War Powers Act. I look at an administration and the Congress \nthat is hinging, it is building and sustaining of war in the Middle \nEast based on a 14-year-old document, in essence, a blank check, and \nthere are no blank checks in this process.\n  I look at what James Madison said years ago. He said: ``The \nConstitution supposes what the history of all governments demonstrates, \nthat the executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and \nmost prone to it. It has accordingly, with studied care, vested the \nquestion of war to the legislature.''\n  This proposal is about cost. It is about saying we have spent $2.5 \ntrillion in the Middle East. The Harvard study says 6 trillion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, for all these different reasons, we need to \nstop and pause, not necessarily to bring troops home, but, as has been \nsuggested by others, to force a debate on Congress' role. This is \nsomething Republicans and Democrats ought to equally care about: Do we \nor don't we have proper lanes in the channel? Is the executive \nexceeding its authority or not?\n  This is something Republicans absolutely ought to care about. For \nthat reason, Mr. Speaker, again, I commend the gentleman from \nMassachusetts for his work on this and ask for this bill which is so \nimportant for, simply, Congress' authorization of war effort.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I, too, reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I first would like to insert in the Record \na letter of support from the Constitution Project, which is signed by \nour former colleague, Republican Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma; a letter \nin support of this resolution from the Council for a Liveable War; a \nletter of support from Win Without War; and a letter of support from \nthe Friends Committee on National Legislation.\n\n                                     The Constitution Project,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2015.\n     Hon. Jim McGovern,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Walter Jones,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Barbara Lee,\n     House of Representatives.\n       Dear Representatives McGovern, Jones and Lee: We write to \n     applaud you for your efforts to compel Congress to exercise \n     its constitutional responsibility to decide on war. For ten \n     months President Obama has prosecuted the war against the \n     Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) under a specious \n     legal claim that Congress authorized it fourteen years ago. \n     Congress has done no such thing. It is high time that Members \n     weighed in.\n       We take no position on grave policy choices about whether \n     to continue to use military force against ISIL, and if so \n     how. But Congress must. The Framers vested the war power in \n     the legislative branch precisely because they believed that \n     young Americans should only be put in harm's way when the \n     people, through their representatives' collective judgment, \n     approved it.\n       We know this is the most difficult issue that Members face. \n     It is also your most important responsibility. If Congress \n     agrees that U.S. service men and woman should be engaged in \n     battle, it is Members' constitutional duty to say so. If \n     Congress disagrees,\n\n[[Page H4468]]\n\n     those men and women should come home. What Congress cannot do \n     is continue to avoid the question. We support H. Con. Res. 55 \n     because it would force this long-overdue debate and vote.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact us, via Scott Roehm at \n     The Constitution Project, with any questions or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mickey Edwards,\n       Vice President, Aspen Institute; former Member of Congress \n     (R-OK) and Chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee; \n     co-chair The Constitution Project War Powers Committee.\n     Louis Fisher,\n       Specialist in Constitutional Law, Law Library of Congress \n     (ret.); Scholar in Residence, The Constitution Project.\n     Virginia Sloan,\n       President, The Constitution Project.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Council for a Livable World,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 2015.\n       Dear Representative McGovern,  Later this week, Congress \n     has the opportunity to take action it has conspicuously \n     avoided: debate and vote on the war in Iraq and Syria.\n       While America has dropped thousands of bombs, deployed \n     3,500 troops--with plans to send 450 more and spent billions \n     of dollars in our latest war, Congress has failed to perform \n     its most basic constitutional responsibility: to debate and \n     vote on war.\n       But this week, Reps. Jim McGovern (D-MA), Walter Jones (R-\n     NC), and Barbara Lee (D-CA), are demanding that Congress do \n     its job.\n       They have introduced a bipartisan resolution, H. Con. Res. \n     55, which could force the House of Representatives to debate \n     and vote on the war.\n       If adopted, the legislation would direct the President to \n     withdraw all American military personnel from Iraq by \n     December 31, 2015 unless Congress votes to authorize the use \n     of force.\n       The right of Congress to declare war is fundamental to our \n     Constitution, yet Congress has avoided taking a stand on our \n     most recent war in the Middle East. In addition, Congress \n     holds the power of the purse, and yet the war is costing at \n     least $9 million per day without congressional approval. \n     Congress owes it to the thousands of Americans we have put \n     into harm's way to ensure it is for the right reasons.\n       The President should not be permitted to wage war without \n     Congressional approval; he should not be able to claim \n     outdated authorizations for the use of military force dating \n     to 2001 and 2002 as his cover for war.\n       We urge you to support H. Con. Res. 55, the McGovern-Jones-\n     Lee resolution. It is time for Congress to take a stand.\n           Sincerely,\n     Angela Canterbury,\n       Executive Director.\n     John Isaacs,\n       Senior Fellow.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Win Without War,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 2015.\n       On behalf of the Win Without War coalition and our 11 \n     million members, we urge Rep. Jim McGovern to SUPPORT \n     H.Con.Res.55.\n       This bipartisan resolution, introduced by Reps. McGovern \n     (D-MA), Jones (R-NC), and Lee (D-CA), would force Congress to \n     debate the use of military force in Iraq and Syria. We expect \n     the resolution to be on the floor tomorrow, June 17.\n       While America has dropped thousands of bombs, deployed \n     3,500 troops, and spent billions of dollars in our latest \n     war, Congress has failed to perform its most basic \n     responsibility to debate and vote on the war in Iraq and \n     Syria. After ten months of bombing Iraq and Syria, it is past \n     time for Congress to do its job and debate and vote on this \n     war. It is simply unconscionable that we are asking our men \n     and women in uniform to risk their lives in a war that \n     Congress has not voted on.\n       The McGovern-Jones-Lee Resolution would force Congress to \n     vote on the war in Iraq and Syria, and, importantly, if \n     Congress continues to shirk its constitutional duty, it would \n     bring our troops home. In the words of Rep. McGovern, ``if \n     this House doesn't have the stomach to carry out its \n     constitutional duty to debate and authorize this latest war, \n     then we should bring our troops home. If the cowardly \n     Congress can go home each night to their families and loved \n     ones, then our brave troops should receive that same \n     privilege.''\n       However one feels about this latest war in the Middle East, \n     we can all agree that it is long past time for Congress to do \n     its job and finally debate and vote on the war in Iraq and \n     Syria.\n       Congress needs to fulfill its constitutional duty of \n     debating and voting on this war. We hope you will SUPPORT \n     H.Con.Res.55.\n       As always, if we can be of any additional assistance as \n     your office considers this important resolution, please let \n     us know.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                                Stephen Miles,\n\n                               Advocacy Director, Win Without War.\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                              Friends Committee on\n\n\n                                         National Legislation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2015.\n       Today your boss will take an important vote on war \n     authority. The House is expected to consider H.Con.Res.55, a \n     privileged resolution led by Reps. Jim McGovern, Walter \n     Jones, and Barbara Lee. By exercising Congress' ability under \n     the War Powers Resolution to urge cessation of hostilities \n     absent a congressional authorization of force, the resolution \n     would serve as a forcing mechanism for Congress to finally \n     debate the war against ISIS that has lasted more than ten \n     months without specific congressional debate and \n     authorization.\n       Nearly ten months ago, the Obama administration sidestepped \n     its constitutional mandate to seek authority from Congress \n     before engaging in new military hostilities. This greatly \n     expanded the scope of the 2001 AUMF and the scope of \n     executive war powers. Further, it deprived the American \n     people and their elected representatives of an opportunity to \n     express opposition, or to ask important questions about the \n     overall strategy, and why more war will solve the region's \n     problems, when it has failed to do so any other time.\n       The Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) urges \n     your boss to take this opportunity to debate the war, to vote \n     for the re-establishment of congressional war power, and to \n     vote in favor of H.Con.Res.55. It's time for Congress to \n     weigh in on this issue.\n       Please do not hesitate to reach out to us at \n     Elizabeth@fcnl.org if you have any further questions or \n     concerns.\n           Thanks,\n     Maggie O'Donnell,\n       Program Assistant, Militarism and Civil Liberties, Friends \n     Committee on National Legislation.\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the gentleman from California \nand the gentleman from New York. I know that if it were left up to \nthem, they could fashion an AUMF that could get 218 votes here. Quite \nfrankly, we wouldn't be here today if we had done our job, because the \nonly reason why you can bring up a privileged resolution under the War \nPowers Resolution is if our troops are in harm's way and we haven't \nacted. This could end right now if the Speaker of the House or the \nmajority leader would give us a date certain by which we would debate \nand vote on an AUMF.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am deeply troubled by our policy in Iraq and Syria. I \ndo not believe it is a clearly defined mission, and I fear that it \nmight be just more of the same.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  I am not convinced that by enlarging our military footprint, we will \nend the violence in the region, defeat the Islamic State or address the \nunderlying causes of unrest.\n  Regardless of whether you support the war or oppose the war, believe \nwe should escalate our involvement or place restrictions on it, the \nbottom line is that Congress needs to debate an AUMF and vote on it. \nThat is our duty. That is our job. If we don't have the guts to do so, \nthen we should at least have the decency to bring our troops homes to \ntheir families and to their loved ones.\n  I hope that each Member of this House, before they come down to this \nfloor to vote on this resolution, takes a minute to look in the mirror. \nAsk yourself: Why do we get to go home to our families when our troops \ndon't have that privilege?\n  They have been sent to Iraq and Syria to fight in our name, but we \ndon't have the courage to stand up for them and to authorize the war, \nand we don't have the guts to bring them home.\n  Take a minute and ask: We are willing to send our troops into danger; \nwe are willing to spend billions upon billions upon billions of \nborrowed money for this war, but we are not willing to carry out our \nconstitutional duty, the same Constitution we keep asking our troops to \nput their lives on the line to protect? How can we keep asking them to \nsacrifice for us when we are not willing to put anything on the line \nfor them?\n  I have had colleagues come up against this resolution and say: We \nshare your frustration over the fact that we have not debated and voted \non an AUMF.\n\n[[Page H4469]]\n\n  I appreciate that, but I would ask them: What in the world can we do \nin a bipartisan way to force this question to come to the floor? What \nis it going to take to get the leadership of this House to say, I am \ngoing to schedule an AUMF, and we are going to debate it and vote on \nit?\n  We have been involved in this latest war for over 10 months. Our \nresolution would give them another 6 months to come up with an AUMF, \nand if they didn't, then we bring our troops home.\n  This resolution before us, I admit, is a bit of a blunt instrument; \nbut if Congress had lived up to its responsibilities, we wouldn't need \nto be so blunt. Congress needs a clear deadline for a debate on an AUMF \nfor Iraq and Syria.\n  That deadline is the withdrawal of our troops by the end of this \nyear. It gives this House, it gives this Republican leadership 6 entire \nmonths to get an AUMF enacted. It gives this House and this leadership \n6 more months in which to simply do their job.\n  A vote for this resolution is not a vote to pull out, as some have \nasserted; it is a vote to give House Republican leadership a deadline \nthat they cannot ignore, to force them to do their duty as leaders of \nthis House by finally bringing an AUMF to the floor for a vote.\n  I heard some of my colleagues complain that they don't like the \nPresident's policy in Iraq and Syria; yet rather than trying to bring \nan AUMF to the floor to define that policy better, they are simply \ncontent to sit back and criticize from the sidelines. That is not what \nwe are here to do. That is not our job.\n  This is important stuff. War is a big deal. We ought to treat it like \nit is a big deal. War has become too easy for this Congress. I see no \nother way to force this issue than by supporting this resolution before \nus.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H. Con. Res. 55, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to \nclose.\n  Let me, first of all, I will conclude the way I began. I want to \ncommend my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), for raising this issue. It is an issue that has to be \nraised, and I am in sympathy with many of the things that he said. I \ndon't really think we are really disagreeing here; we are just \ndisagreeing on tactics.\n  As I have said, the intentions behind this resolution are \ncommendable, but I cannot support this policy which, when you all boil \neverything down, would require a straight withdrawal without \nconditions. That is not the right policy for this country, a straight \nwithdrawal without conditions.\n  I share my colleague's frustration that we haven't acted on a new \nAUMF. We need to pass an AUMF, but we need to pass the right AUMF.\n  If we pass this resolution, our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle will be pushed to pass their own language overriding this \nmeasure. What will it look like? I would wager that it won't include \nthe limitations that many of us on this side would like to see.\n  Worse still, we could just rubberstamp the argument that the 2001 \nAUMF applies to ISIS in 2015. Again, that is why I said we have to be \ncareful we don't cut off our nose to spite our face.\n  Now, the President sent us an AUMF. I thought it was a good starting \npoint. I know it was panned on both sides--Republicans thought it was \ntoo light; Democrats thought it was too harsh--but it was a good \nstarting point.\n  There are many things in an AUMF we have to consider. We need to \nconsider time, geography; we need to consider what we do with the \nprevious AUMFs. These are issues that should be debated, and I hope we \nwill debate, but I think the White House put forth a good starting \nposition.\n  The American people expect us to do our job and pass a new AUMF. They \nexpect us to keep the United States out of another large-scale open-\nended war and pass a responsible policy for degrading and defeating \nISIS. Voting for withdrawal is not the right way forward. I believe \nthat with all my heart.\n  Let's vote down this resolution and go back to the drawing board. \nChairman Royce and I will work together in a bipartisan way, as we have \nso many times in the past, and let's put before this Congress the right \npolicy to get this job done.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I very much appreciate Mr. McGovern for his consistency. Even when we \nmay disagree on substance, I have worked with him on policies with \nrespect to human rights in Africa and, frankly, across the world on \nmany, many issues. I agree that an AUMF would be good, but only the \nright AUMF.\n  I would make this point: the White House hasn't helped the case to \nmove an AUMF. Indeed, as soon as the President sent up his draft AUMF \ntext to the Congress in February, the White House said he has all the \nlegal authority he needs to conduct these operations, regardless of \nwhat the Congress does, undercutting our effort to build a consensus, \nbut we should not give up in terms of our effort to build this \nconsensus.\n  To that end, I intend to continue to work with Mr. Engel and others \nand craft a bipartisan and successful AUMF that sends a message of \nunity, that sends a message of resolve.\n\n  To that end, I would point out that the committee has held seven full \ncommittee hearings and nine subcommittee oversight hearings on the ISIS \nthreat. We have discussed the AUMF; we have discussed the U.S. and \ncoalition response, but given the wide range of views, including the \nview that we have no military business in Iraq, reaching an agreement \non a bipartisan AUMF that authorizes the actions needed to defeat ISIS \nmay not be possible, but it may be possible. For that reason, we are \ngoing to redouble our effort.\n  There would, though, be a price paid for failure on this floor, \nsignaling disunity. As we work towards the effort to build a consensus, \nwe have passed legislation to directly arm the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga \nforces who are fighting ISIS on the ground.\n  We have worked to strengthen U.S. defense cooperation with our \nregional ally Jordan, to help prevent Americans who join and fight for \nISIS from returning home to the homeland--we passed that legislation--\nand to combat the cultural genocide being perpetrated by ISIS forces.\n  As I say, we will continue to work with our colleagues to try to find \na way forward on a revised and updated authorization focused on the \nvicious and growing threat posed by ISIS, but acting without a credible \nway forward would be foolhardy, not brave. A divisive and unsuccessful \nprocess would be perceived by our allies, our partners, and our enemies \nas a no-confidence vote in the fight against ISIS, resulting in a \nsignificant blow to the national security of this country.\n  For that reason, I would ask Members to contemplate for a moment what \nthe world would look like should ISIS, should our forces, our \nairstrikes against ISIS, be pulled out of that region because I \nremember what it looked like when we did not have airstrikes on ISIS \nbefore they went into Mosul, and members of our committee, in a \nbipartisan sense, called for airpower to be used against ISIS on that \ndesert path as they were headed to Mosul.\n  Here is what we saw when they took that city: mass killings, \nbeheadings, abductions, forced conversions, torture, rape, sexual \nassault, using women and children as human shields, people being burned \nalive and buried alive, women and girls the age of 13 being taken as \ncaptives to be sold as sex slaves and put into forced marriages with \nISIS fighters. That is what we witnessed after the fall of that great \ncity.\n  The question I would ask is: If we are to abandon our airstrikes in \nsupport of these Kurdish units on that 600-mile front--50,000 of those \ntroops are women fighting against ISIS, and they no longer have U.S. \nair support to support them in their effort to turn back ISIS--what \nwill become of them? What will become of others?\n  Because this is no longer simply a terrorist organization--it is now \na full-blown army seeking to establish a self-governing state through \nthe Tigris and Euphrates valley in what is now Syria and Iraq and \nLebanon and seek to expand that further.\n\n[[Page H4470]]\n\n  We know a lot now about its leader, Abu al-Baghdadi, in Syria. He is \na designated global terrorist under U.S. law. His mission, he clearly \nstates, if you want to go online and see the blueprint of ISIS.\n  Part of that is to gain resources and recruits and create a safe \nhaven to attack the United States. Yes, this certainly goes to the \ndirect security interest of the United States if we were to pull off \nand give a breather to Abu al-Baghdadi and to ISIS.\n  In Iraq, we are taking less than half measures to assist the ISF, the \nforces there fighting ISIS, with insufficient trainers and advisers, as \nI said, with no forward air controllers, with insufficient plans to \ntrain the Sunni tribes, and insufficient arms to the Kurds and Sunnis, \nsomething we are trying to do something about with our legislation. The \nbalance of power in the Middle East is shifting against the U.S. \nregional interest and certainly against U.S. security.\n  As stated, there are no simple answers or solutions; we discussed \nthis in this debate, but without our involvement--without our \ninvolvement--our adversaries will continue to be emboldened, and our \nfriends out of fear are susceptible to poor decisions, while the Middle \nEast region and the world become a more dangerous place.\n  This organization ISIS is simultaneously a strategic threat to the \nregion and to the world and a genocidal terror movement. I recall us \nsaying on the floor of this House, never again with respect to \ngenocidal terror, and we are watching genocidal terror.\n  I would just close with this argument, Mr. Speaker, and that is let's \nwork together to get an Authorization for Use of Military Force, which \nthe President already claims he has under our prior authorization that \nwe gave for him to attack al Qaeda and any al Qaeda affiliate, but let \nus not pull out our airpower that is being used right now to slow the \nadvance of ISIS as it tries to take over that region and as it attacks \ncivilians throughout the Middle East.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the order of the House of Wednesday, June 16, 2015, the \nprevious question is ordered on the concurrent resolution.\n  The question is on adoption of the concurrent resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN.

The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and \nthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), the author of this legislation, \nbe permitted to control the time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, defibrillators, operating room monitors, \ninsulin pumps, pacemakers, heart valves, artificial hips, x ray \nmachines, ventilators, and ultrasound machines, these are life-\nimproving and lifesaving technologies that have reduced costs for the \nimproved health of millions of Americans.\n  Unfortunately, the President's healthcare law implemented a new tax \non all of these innovative devices, a tax on medical devices. Only in \nWashington, Mr. Speaker, would you impose a tax on lifesaving medical \ntechnology and think you will actually reduce healthcare costs. This is \nbad tax policy, and it needs to be repealed.\n  The medical device industry is truly an American success story, \nemploying more than 400,000 people. In my State of Minnesota, 35,000 \npeople are employed in this industry, 400 companies alone in the State \nof Minnesota; 80 percent of device manufacturers are small businesses \nwith less than 50 employees; 98 percent of all these companies have \nless than 500 employees.\n  It can take these small startups 10 to 15 years to even achieve \nprofitability or earn one penny of profit because they rely on \ninvestment and the promise of a future of earnings to survive.\n  The device industry is a net exporter. We have a trade surplus with \nour exports. Most importantly, these companies are producing lifesaving \nand life-improving devices for millions of our patients across the \nworld.\n  Medical advancements have helped add 5 years to U.S. life expectancy \nin the last two decades. It has helped slash the death rate from heart \ndisease by a stunning 50 percent and cut the death rate from stroke by \n30 percent.\n  Devices have contributed to a 16 percent decrease in mortality rates \nand an astounding 25 percent decline in elderly disability rates in \njust the last 20 years of innovation. Medical innovation is leading and \nwill continue to lead the way we improve lives for our seniors who have \nchronic disease.\n  Despite all the benefits that this industry provides, a 2014 Harvard \nBusiness Review article recently found that the device industry now \nfaces one of the most uncertain competitive environments in the entire \ncountry. Instead of hurting this industry, we should be empowering this \nindustry, creating more jobs, producing more innovation, and helping \nmore patients.\n  We often hear that America needs to start making things again to help\n\n[[Page H4473]]\n\njump-start the economy, and one of the best ways to protect American \nmanufacturing and spur innovation is to repeal this harmful medical \ndevice tax because here is what the tax is doing: it is costing us \njobs.\n  One company that I spoke with said they have never laid off any \nemployees in the last 22 years of their history of business, but they \nlaid off 25 employees, and they refrained from hiring another 15 \nemployees because of the tax.\n  If you take it to a bigger, larger picture, up to 39,000 jobs have \nbeen lost because of the tax since it has been imposed. These are high-\npaying jobs, Mr. Speaker, that pay nearly $20,000 more than the \nnational average.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  And the 2.3 percent excise tax, it may not sound like much, but \nhere's the problem: it is taxing revenue; it is not taxing profit.\n  A small device manufacturer, they may not be making any money, but \nthey still have to pay that tax. One company I spoke to, they have 20 \nemployees. They recently said they are borrowing $100,000 a month from \nthe bank just to pay the tax. That doesn't make any sense.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is also raising tax rates. Medical device companies \nnow have to pay one of the highest effective tax rates of any industry \nin the world. Recent testimony in the Joint Economic Committee, there \nwas a small company from Minnesota that now says because of the tax, \nthey have a 79 percent effective tax rate. Who here can justify that?\n  It is also harming innovation because instead of investing in the \nnext generation of innovative devices that can literally save people's \nlives, companies are spending money on compliance and accountants \ninstead of on research and development, which is the lifeblood of this \nindustry.\n  Members should know that this is separate from the debate about how \nwe reform health care. This is about a bipartisan effort today on the \nfloor to promote American innovation to protect and promote American \nmanufacturing and research and development jobs because Democrats and \nRepublicans, conservatives and liberals in both parties, in the House \nand the Senate, favor repealing this tax. It is a bad tax policy that \nis killing jobs. It is hurting our seniors, and it is harming \ninnovation.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time to protect our American seniors, American \npatients, and American innovation and repeal this destructive tax.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I shall consume.\n  There are certain basic facts here. One is this industry participated \nin the creation of healthcare reform. They, like other providers, were \ninvolved; and like other providers, they said that they would \nparticipate in helping to pay for it. That is a fact. Now they want \nout.\n  Another fact is that they have benefited from it. According to a \nrecent analysis by Ernst & Young, the industry's revenue increased by \n$8 billion in the year the tax took effect.\n  Also, there has been a reference to R R, according to that \nreport, spending by the industry, also increased by 6 percent in the \nsame year.\n  There has also been reference to employment. The analysis of Ernst & \nYoung also says that, in that year, employment increased, and the \noverall employment has increased by 23,500. There has been a 23,500 \nincrease in employment.\n  So those are the facts.\n  There is another aspect. If people vote for this industry to \nessentially go back on its commitment to participate, other providers \nare going to ask for the same treatment. So in that respect, what the \nRepublicans are aiming to do is to unravel ACA.\n  Another fact is this is unpaid for. So when you add this unpaid-for \nprovision, you get, all together, well over $610 billion that the \nRepublicans have passed in permanent tax cuts without paying for one \ndime.\n  Another factor is that this applies to imports as well as to those \nthat are produced in this country and not at all to exports. So look at \nthe equities. Look at how this industry has benefited. Look at the \nirrationality and irresponsibility and coming forth to this body and \nsaying let's repeal and not pay for at all from a party that talks \nabout fiscal responsibility.\n  So let me just read from the Statement of Administration Policy. That \nis another fact. If this were ever to pass the House and the Senate, it \nwould be vetoed. So here is the Statement of Administration Policy:\n  ``The Affordable Care Act has improved the American health care \nsystem, on which Americans can rely throughout life. After more than \nfive years under this law, 16.4 million Americans have gained health \ncoverage. Up to 129 million people who could have otherwise been denied \nor faced discrimination now have access to coverage. And health care \nprices have risen at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years. As we work to \nmake the system even better, we are open to ideas that improve the \naccessibility, affordability, and quality of health care, and help \nmiddle-class Americans.''\n  And it concludes:\n  ``In sum, H.R. 160 would increase the deficit to finance a permanent \nand costly tax break for industry without improving the health system \nor helping middle-class Americans. If the President were presented with \nH.R. 160, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.''\n  So I close with this. You know, people can be provincial in the sense \nthat they respond to one pressure point or another, and I understand \nthat. What you have to do is to look at an entire system, an entire \nstructure, and what it means for Americans throughout this country.\n  This industry, as I said, participated in helping to pay for \nhealthcare reform. They have benefited from it, and now, essentially, \nthey are coming forth and saying: Just take us out of it; separate us \nout.\n  That is unfair, unwise, irresponsible, and sets a pattern that will \ndo what Republicans really want to do, and that is to pick apart and \ntear apart this reform that has been 75 years in coming. So I urge \neverybody to look at the broader interests of the people of this \ncountry and to vote ``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on H.R. 160, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Minnesota?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, just in response to the report that was just mentioned, \nthe Ernst & Young report, it is true that companies have been hiring \nand growing in certain cases, but all of that growth from the report is \noutside of the United States. So if you want to continue to promote \nmore jobs outside of the United States, don't vote for the repeal, and \nwe will continue to see jobs move overseas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nMeehan), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by dispelling the premise that \nsomehow this whole thing was devised so that we can allow the medical \ndevice companies to flourish. The thing we want to flourish is research \nand development that is producing the kinds of things that are helping \nthe American people, and that is the essence of what the medical device \nR innovation is doing, and this is stifling.\n  At the precise moment where breakthrough opportunities, oftentimes, \nin small businesses--I see them, Mr. Speaker; I visit them in my \ndistrict--and at the time that it is the most fragile for them, they \nare being hit with this 2.4 percent tax which touches them at the time \nwhen it is not on profits. These are the very dollars that are being \nused to be invested into R, whether they sell that product or not. We \nare killing our innovation right in the cradle.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the repeal of the \nmedical device tax.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nMcDermott), the ranking member on the Health Subcommittee.\n  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nhis remarks.)\n\n[[Page H4474]]\n\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Levin was correct. When we were \ndesigning the Affordable Care Act, everyone was expected to share in \nthe cost as we work for the American people.\n  The medical device industry initially opposed 5 percent. They said: \nHow about 2.3 percent? We will go for that.\n  They agreed to it. Here they are today asking for us to give them \nnothing, no taxes; they don't have to pay anything no matter how they \nbenefit from it.\n  Now, repealing this tax, which the nonpartisan analysts have shown \nhas no negative effect on jobs, will add $24.4 billion to the deficit. \nIt would eliminate an important source of revenue simply to appease an \nindustry that has benefited directly and greatly from the expansion of \nthe coverage of ACA.\n  On top of that, the bill is a distraction from a more important issue \nthat the Congress needs to address in the context of medical devices. \nThey would not let us vote on an amendment in the committee to bring up \nthe institution of unique device identifiers.\n  An essential tool of improving patient safety is the UDI. A UDI is a \nnumber associated with a medical device right on the device. They \ncontain important information about where, when, and by whom the device \nwas made. They provide for post-market surveillance to identify \nproblems and notify patients when objects that they put in their bodies \nare faulty or dangerous. This has dramatic impacts for safety.\n  In 2010, a massive recall of breast implants in France impacted tens \nof thousands of women. Many cancer patients undergo reconstructive \nsurgery following mastectomy, and their lives are threatened when \nfaulty implants leak dangerous contaminants into their bodies. In \nsituations like this, it is essential that we know who has given the \nfaulty device so that recall efforts can save as many lives as \npossible.\n  Unfortunately, even when the FDA finishes its new UDI regulations in \nthe coming years, we will lack important tools, including devices, in \nthe agency's postmarket safety checking system, the Sentinel \nInitiative. The primary source of information for the Sentinel is \ninsurance claims forms, yet, unlike pharmaceuticals, CMS does not \ncurrently require UDIs to be listed on Medicare claims. That makes it \nall but impossible to apply the Sentinel Initiative to the device \ncontext.\n  Furthermore, additional gaps exist in the FDA's rulemaking on UDIs. \nFor example, there is no requirement that UDIs be affixed directly to \nthe implantable devices.\n  As we look forward, I encourage my colleagues to look beyond efforts \nto undermine the ACA and to look for opportunities to enhance safety \nand improve the system for patients, not just the device industry.\n  I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this and come back with a bill--if \nyou want to take the tax off, that is one thing, but at least make them \nidentify the name and the place and the number of where it came from \nso, if somebody you know gets impacted by one of these devices going \nbad, we will have a way to trace it.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentleman from Indiana \n(Mr. Young), a leader on the Ways and Means Committee, who is also \nconcerned about the impact of this tax on his home State of Indiana.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare's medical device tax has \nalready been devastating to innovation, patient care, and job creation, \nespecially in my home State of Indiana.\n  Up north, we have Warsaw, which is known around the world as the \northopedics capital of the world. In central Indiana, we have a \nburgeoning life sciences industry centered around the Indianapolis \narea. Further south, we have Bloomington, which is home to Cook \nMedical, the largest privately held medical device manufacturer in the \nworld.\n  Medical device startups dot Indiana's landscape from Lake Michigan \ndown to the Ohio River. Indiana's world-class medical device companies \nlike Biomet, Boston Scientific, Hill-Rom, Zimmer, and dozens more don't \njust create and produce lifesaving technology. They also employ tens of \nthousands of Hoosiers, and these jobs pay well.\n  At a time when factories have closed and jobs in rust belt States \nhave been sent overseas, medical device manufacturing jobs have been a \nlifeline for hard-working Hoosiers and their families.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Every day this tax remains in effect, we continue to slow \nadvancements in lifesaving and life-improving technologies, and we \nhinder patient care. This day is long overdue. It is time to support \nH.R. 160 and finally repeal this harmful, ill-advised tax.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is now my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a member of our committee.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the gentleman from Indiana is \nleaving the floor right now because one of the companies he mentioned--\none of the companies, there are others--was brought before the Justice \nDepartment because of their behavior not long ago. So my friend from \nIndiana talks about Zimmer Holdings. That is one of the reasons why I \nam asking you to review your support of this legislation. Because let \nme tell you what happened to Zimmer and Stryker in the State of New \nJersey not that many years ago when the U.S. Attorney looked at these \ntwo companies and many others.\n  Here is what they were brought to heel about: bribing doctors to \nrecommend their prosthetic to senior citizens under Medicare. Dante \nsaid, what place in hell will they be? These guys should be in the \ndeepest place in hell--the deepest. You check the record. You can't \nmake this stuff up.\n  Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legislation. When the Affordable Care Act \nwas being negotiated, these companies were at the table. They agreed to \nthis. You can't deny that. Because of the ACA, the health care market \nincludes millions of newly insured Americans, more business for these \ncompanies, by the way, driving up the demand for medical devices and \nother health care services--increased demand, capitalism, you know \nabout that.\n  However, the device industry wants it both ways. They want new \nbusinesses, and they want new business under the ACA, that the ACA has \ncreated, and since the law was passed, they have been lobbying for \nrepeal of what they agreed to. I swear you can't make it up.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support the ACA and its goals. You don't. And it needs \nto be funded. It is the law of the land, as the Speaker once said. You \ncan't support the goals of the ACA and then start stripping out the \npieces of the law that fund the realization of the goals.\n  Oh, but you can. And you have tried 56 different times to repeal this \nlegislation, and you failed every time, even though you are in the \nmajority.\n  This legislation would add $24.4 billion to the deficit--through the \nSpeaker to my good friend from Pennsylvania--and it is not paid for. \nDespite industry claims of job loss and economic hardship, medical \ndevice companies have seen a 7 percent growth in employment since the \nACA. Furthermore, I remain concerned about some of the behavior we have \nseen in this industry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would like to remind the gentleman \nto address his remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Sure, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, I became highly involved in the medical device issues \nsince 2007 when a number of device manufacturers entered into \ncontroversial deferred prosecution agreements for providing doctors \nwith kickbacks for using their knee and hip replacement devices. A \nnumber of these products ended up being recalled. That is the record.\n  As a result, on the justice side, I have worked to put an end to \ndeferred prosecution agreements that don't hold the bad actors \naccountable. There are many good companies providing medical devices, \nbut the facts are the facts, and the history is the history, and the \nculture of this industry needs to be known. I have also worked to \nimprove the safety of medical devices for patients by encouraging the \nuse of clinical data registries.\n  Repealing the device tax is not good policy, Mr. Speaker, and it is \nnot good for our budget--another $24.5 billion added to the deficit. I \nthink if you would ask our ranking member, Mr. Levin, he would give you \na precise\n\n[[Page H4475]]\n\nnumber as to how much you have increased the deficit in legislation you \nhave provided over the last 6 months.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Dent).\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I just want to address something that was \nstated by one of the previous speakers from Washington State who made a \ncomment to the effect that the medical device industry supported that \ntax. Well, that is a statement that is simply not based in fact. In \nfact, what happened, as I recall, Senator Baucus helped impose the tax \non the industry because he felt that they were not providing enough at \nthe table in terms of concessions for the ACA. In fact, since they \nweren't doing enough at the table, the medical device industry was \nplaced on the menu. They fought this tax vigorously. There is no letter \nto indicate they had any support for this tax.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation to repeal \nthe medical device tax. However you feel about the 2010 health care law \non the whole, we can all agree that the legislation has its flaws. \nAgain, one of the most glaring deficiencies in the law is the medical \ndevice tax, designed to extract $26 billion from the industry over 10 \nyears. This new law is already stifling critical innovation and \nthreatening high quality jobs in my district.\n  More importantly, it is increasing costs for consumers on products \nwhich are an absolute necessity of life for those who rely on them, \nsuch as prosthetics, pacemakers, and artificial hearts. Costs are also \nbeing passed on to consumers at all levels through increased insurance \npremiums and bills from medical providers.\n  The medical device industry currently supports over 75,000 jobs in \nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Several of the companies affected by \nthe new tax are located in my district, including OraSure Technologies, \nOlympus, Boas Surgical, and B. Braun. In fact, B. Braun CFO Bruce \nHeugel recently testified before the Senate Finance Subcommittee on \nHealth Care that his company has been forced to drastically reduce \ninvestments in research and development and also has had job losses as \na result of the medical device tax. In fact, they are not building a \nnew headquarters because of this tax. These are good paying, 21st \ncentury jobs, and this Congress should not support policies that will \nkill them or send them overseas.\n  Mr. Speaker, the medical device tax is a punitive tax, and it is \ncreating disincentives for companies looking to stay competitive, hire \ndomestically, and create lifesaving new technologies. It is past time \nthat Congress repeal this onerous new tax, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Protect Medical Innovation Act. Let's get rid of this thing \nonce and for all. Let's excise the excise tax.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Rokita). Since he was first elected in 2010, he has been a \nleader on this, organizing freshman Members, recognizing the importance \nof repealing this disastrous tax.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for \nyielding the time. He has been the leader on this from day one, and I \nam happy to join him. I also thank Chairman Ryan of the Ways and Means \nCommittee for allowing this to come to the floor the way it has. I \nthink it is very important. Most of America thinks this is very \nimportant, and to have it stand alone here where it can be debated, \nhopefully honestly, I think speaks well to the process, I think it \nspeaks well to the leadership of Chairman Ryan and Member Paulsen and \nothers who are behind this.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to be back on the floor to support this. \nIt is long overdue. It needs to happen. There is an old adage, Mr. \nSpeaker, and that is, if you want less of something, tax it. The same \nis true here. If you want less jobs in this area, like the 56,000 jobs \nin Indiana alone, tax the devices that those jobs produce. If you want \nless innovation, tax these medical devices. If you want America to be \nless of a leader in the world when it comes to this industry, tax it. \nThat is all their argument, Mr. Speaker, is saying, and our bill \ncorrects that. Let the free market work, and let innovation work. Let's \nkeep us a leader in the world in this area.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Brooks) who has also been a leader as part of the Indiana \ndelegation on the issue.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my \ncolleague from Minnesota for leading this effort since I came to \nCongress in 2013.\n  I rise today joining my fellow Hoosiers seeking greater opportunity \nfor all Americans, and I rise today to call for a swift end to a tax \nthat is standing in the way of that opportunity.\n  Back home, I hear from countless Hoosiers about the restrictions the \nmedical device tax is placing on our life sciences industry, not only \nin Indiana but across the country. This tax takes away the \nopportunities to innovate, to hire more people, and most importantly to \nimprove the patient access to critical technology.\n  In Indiana the life sciences industry is vitally important. It has a \n$59 billion impact on our economy and employs more than 56,000 people. \nIn fact, we are second--Indiana is second only to California in exports \nof life sciences products.\n  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that the \nunfair medical device tax jeopardizes our competitive edge, it stunts \nour workforce opportunities, but most importantly, it is decreasing \naccess to lifesaving technology for people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to stand for jobs, stand for improving people's \nhealth, and stand for more opportunity. I urge my colleagues to repeal \nthe medical device tax.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Stefanik) who has also been doing an awesome job of \norganizing a lot of the freshman Members and recognizing the importance \nof this issue to the State of New York.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 160, the Protect \nMedical Innovation Act introduced by Mr. Paulsen, and in March I was \nproud to lead a bipartisan letter by 43 freshman lawmakers to Speaker \nBoehner calling for a vote to repeal the medical device tax.\n  According to a 2014 industry survey, the tax resulted in employment \nreductions of 14,000 industry workers in 2013 and years prior to \nimplementation of this tax, with approximately an additional 4,500 jobs \nlost in 2014. Furthermore, if we don't repeal this tax, the industry \nwill forgo hiring of nearly 20,500 employees over the next 5 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, this important bipartisan legislation will repeal the \nAffordable Care Act's medical device tax that is limiting access to \nhealth care devices that North Country families need and undermining \nthe medical device industry that is so important to our local economy.\n  Repealing the medical device tax will help our small businesses \ncreate jobs for North Country families and protect employees who are \ncurrently at risk from this job-killing tax. This an extremely \nimportant issue for my district, especially in Warren County, home of \nwhat is called ``catheter valley'' because of the numerous catheter \nmanufacturers.\n  I commend the House for bringing this important legislation to the \nfloor, and I urge all Members to support this measure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Stutzman), someone I traveled with in the State of Indiana \nwho showed me firsthand the impact this device tax had in Indiana.\n  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 160, the Protect \nMedical Innovation Act, and I appreciate the work that Congressman \nPaulsen has done on this very important issue that has affected my \ndistrict dramatically.\n  As a sitting U.S. Congressman of Warsaw, Indiana, known as the \nOrthopedic Capital of the World, the burdensome medical device tax hits \nvery close to home for my constituents. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the \nHoosier State as a\n\n[[Page H4476]]\n\nwhole is second in the Nation in exports of life science products, and \nacross the State over 20,000 Hoosiers are directly employed by this \nindustry. The impact on our communities and our neighbors is one of the \nreasons I have fought so long and hard alongside Mr. Paulsen and my \ncolleagues to repeal this very destructive tax.\n  Mr. Speaker, back home in Indiana, Hoosiers know that taxation does \nnot create jobs; it kills them. In fact, a recent study has shown that \nthe medical device tax, implemented to fund ObamaCare, has cost more \nthan 33,000 jobs nationally so far. Mr. Speaker, repealing this medical \ndevice tax is a simple, commonsense reform, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello), who knows the importance of this issue.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the cost of health care \ncontinues to increase in this country.\n  As a philosophical matter, I do not believe inserting more government \nbetween a patient and their doctor will reduce costs. In fact, to the \ncontrary. But there are things government can do.\n  That is why we in the House of Representatives are putting more money \ninto NIH funding. It is why 21st Century Cures has been introduced--to \nstreamline approval processes at the FDA and make sure that various \nstakeholders involved in finding cures are all working together.\n  Yet what remains as a contradiction at the heart of ObamaCare is the \npolicy that taxes those who seek to innovate and improve public health \noutcomes through pioneering medical device equipment. We are taxing \nthose who are trying to help improve, and who have improved, public \nhealth outcomes. It just doesn't make sense.\n  Simply put, it is a disincentive to invest capital in precisely the \nindustry that has proven itself to be the single most important in the \nhistory of civilization to improve public health--our life sciences \nindustry here in this country.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) to speak on this issue.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of \nH.R. 160, the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2015, also known as the \nmedical device tax repeal.\n  This bill would repeal the tax on medical device manufacturers that \nwas put into place under ObamaCare. The medical device tax rate is 2.3 \npercent, and this is in addition to the State sales tax on common \nmedical devices such as pacemakers, hearing aids, and insulin pumps.\n  This tax hurts the very same Americans we should be helping. For \nexample, 13 percent of West Virginians--the State I am blessed to \nrepresent--have diabetes. This 2.3 percent tax makes it more difficult \nfor struggling taxpayers in West Virginia and around the country to \naccess critical healthcare devices like insulin pumps.\n  If gone unchecked, this tax will continue to weaken the industry's \nability to grow and help people in need. It will also continue to \nhinder the development of lifesaving treatments and devices.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me tomorrow in voting for the repeal \nof the ill-advised medical device tax.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Benishek), a physician who works with patients each and \nevery day and understands the importance of repealing this tax.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 160, the Protect Medical Innovation Act.\n  H.R. 160 will permanently repeal the misguided excise tax on medical \ndevices that was imposed by the President's healthcare law.\n  I am a cosponsor of this important legislation, along with over 280 \nMembers of this House of Representatives. In the 113th Congress, the \nSenate endorsed getting rid of this burdensome tax by an overwhelming \nmargin. It is clearly time for this tax to go.\n  The medical device tax discourages innovation, lowers the quality of \nmedical care available to the American people, and cuts jobs while \ndriving production overseas.\n  Companies like RTI Surgical, based in my district, are being harmed \nby this burdensome tax. Instead of hamstringing these manufacturers, we \nshould be allowing them to produce new medical devices and create jobs.\n  I am a doctor who treated patients in northern Michigan for 30 years. \nI know how important medical devices are for providing quality health \ncare, and I believe that getting rid of this tax will improve our \nNation's healthcare system.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this commonsense \nand long overdue fix for the train wreck that is the President's \nhealthcare law.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Rohrabacher), a State that has been a leader in \ndeveloping new medical technologies.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this effort to \nprevent this very destructive tax from having the harmful impact that \nwe know it will have. This medical device tax is perhaps the most \nodious of any tax that has ever been loaded upon the shoulders of the \nAmerican people in the history of our Republic.\n  Our first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Marshall, once \npointed out: ``The power to tax is the power to destroy.'' Well, who is \nbeing destroyed and who is being hurt by this medical device tax? It is \nthe American people who are suffering maladies and health challenges, \nand we are putting them as the people who are going to be basically \npaying the bill or doing without their medical devices.\n  I would like to give a personal example of this. I know it is very \npainful for me to do so, but I think I need to share this with my \ncolleagues.\n  Two and a half years ago, I was notified that my daughter, who was at \nthat time 9 years old, had leukemia. It was a horror story for my \nfamily, a horror story, just like it is for families across America. We \ncame out of that. We went through it. It was a tough, tough road for a \nyear. Last week, she had her last cancer treatment and, last week, she \nwas declared cancer free.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fitzpatrick). The time of the gentleman \nhas expired.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Ninety percent of the kids who get leukemia today \nare cured from leukemia after a period of time. They actually will live \nthrough this. Only 40 years ago, 90 percent of the kids who got \nleukemia died.\n  We have had different advances in medicine that have actually \nachieved this goal. But in my daughter's case, I could see very easily \na medical device was put under her skin, a portal, so that she did not \nhave to take the chemotherapy into her arms, which resulted in younger \nkids decades ago with their veins collapsing because of the \nchemotherapy being shot into their arm.\n  The people who devised that medical device saved my daughter's life, \nand now we want to make them the most heavily taxed people in our \ncountry. That is ridiculous. We want to encourage people to build these \ntypes of devices that will save our children and help those people who \nare suffering.\n  This medical device tax is odious, it is wrong, and it was \nwrongheaded from the very beginning. In the name of saving future \nchildren from things that we might be able to cure with a proper \nmedical device, we need to make sure we eliminate this tax and keep \nfaith with future generations, as well as those people who are \nsuffering today.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in getting rid of this tax on medical \ndevices.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire the amount of time remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Minnesota has 11 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 16\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).\n\n[[Page H4477]]\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from \nMinnesota.\n  I rise today as a 30-year health care professional and a proud \ncosponsor of H.R. 160, the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2015.\n  This bill would repeal the Affordable Care Act's 2.3 percent tax on \nmedical devices. These are medical devices that save and improve lives \nfor millions of Americans. These devices include pacemakers, artificial \njoints, CAT scan machines, and many, many more.\n  Mr. Speaker, the medical device tax is a terrible policy that is \nstifling innovation and United States competitiveness and is hurting \nsmall businesses all across the Nation, and certainly in the \nPennsylvania Fifth Congressional District.\n  This legislation, which has strong bipartisan support, will help to \nprotect American jobs, keep America at the cutting edge of \ntechnological medical advances, and preserve a patient's access to \naffordable, lifesaving devices.\n  Having served in a nonprofit healthcare setting for three decades, I \nrise today and ask my colleagues to join me in voting to repeal this \nunnecessary and very harmful tax.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  There is no one that questions the importance of this industry--no \none. This country has been in the forefront in terms of creating \nmedical devices. There has been innovation and there has been \nenterprise, and it has impacted the lives of millions of people. That \nis not the issue here.\n  The issue is this. A number of industries and a number of providers \nparticipated in creating the Health Care Reform Act. Essentially, I am \nnot sure it is the industry as much as some Members are essentially \ncoming here and saying: Give this industry a free ride in terms of \ntheir participation, while others are doing their part.\n  That isn't fair; it isn't workable; and it is also fiscally \nirresponsible. I would like to talk to the CEOs of any of these \ncompanies and ask them if they think it is fiscally responsible to \nrepeal this provision costing well over $20 billion, unpaid for, made \npermanent.\n  Indeed, this is industry joined with others in the healthcare world \nin this country in a letter of May 11, 2009, to the President:\n\n       Dear Mr. President,\n       We believe that all Americans should have access to \n     affordable, high-quality healthcare services. Thus, we \n     applaud your strong commitment to reforming our Nation's \n     healthcare system. The times demand and the Nation expects \n     that we, as healthcare leaders, work with you to reform the \n     healthcare system.\n\n  And it concludes with this paragraph:\n\n       We, as stakeholder representatives, are committed to doing \n     our part to make reform a reality in order to make the system \n     more affordable and effective for patients and purchasers. We \n     stand ready to work with you to accomplish this goal.\n\n  And it was signed by a number of representatives--the AMA; America's \nHealth Insurance Plans, their leadership; the Pharmaceutical Research \nand Manufacturers; et cetera, and also signed by the president and CEO \nof the Advanced Medical Technology Association.\n  So now people are coming here and saying what was essentially \ncommitted to in 2009 should essentially be ripped out of ACA in 2015.\n  I just want to read from a report by the National Center for Health \nResearch. And I refer, for example, to the chart on the number of \nemployees at the 12 largest U.S.-based device companies. All of them \nshow an increase in employment of the 12 largest, except two, and in \none case, the reduction was from 10,800 to 10,500. One company did have \na larger loss, but it wasn't anything close to catastrophic.\n  Then the number of employees at the small, publicly traded device \ncompanies--one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine--of \nthose, only seven show a reduction in the number of employees from 2012 \nto 2014. In one of them, there was a reduction of one, and the other, a \nreduction of four employees. And then there is another with a reduction \nof four, and another, a reduction of six. The others had increases in \ntheir employment, and two of them, one went from 230 to 320, and \nanother from 244 to 303. These are the smallest.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Let me also refer in this document to stock prices for the 12 largest \nU.S.-based device companies.\n  When you look down at the profit margin, all of their profits went up \nexcept one, which had a reduction of 1.6 percent from the close of \nJanuary 2, 2013, to the close of January 2, 2015. That reduction was \ntiny. The others had a very substantial reduction, some in the \ntwenties, one in the thirties, and the average was a 13.8 percent \nincrease in the profit margin.\n  Also, this report reads:\n\n       Similarly, the report on 2013 employment, released by a \n     financial analysis news service, EP Vantage, showed that 11 \n     of the top 15 device makers expanded their workforce after \n     the device tax went into effect.\n\n  I think what is happening here is that a few of my colleagues are \ncoming here and are using a few examples--and I don't deny, in a \ncapitalist system, there are some losers as well as winners.\n  Everybody isn't necessarily a winner, and there was a recession in \nthis country during some of these years, but to come here and to use \nthose examples that really are refuted by the overall data, I think, is \nessentially saying that we ought to begin, on this point, to rip apart \nthe ACA because, in every case, there hasn't been an improvement for \nevery company. In terms of research and development, the Ernst & Young \nreport makes it very clear that spending by the industry increased by 6 \npercent in the same year.\n  I am just asking everybody who cares about healthcare reform and who \ncares about the overall picture here in the United States to resist the \ntemptation to take several examples, perhaps, from their own districts, \nto draw conclusions about what really has happened in the medical \ndevice industry and to, essentially, come forth because of those \nrelatively few examples and say that we should now, essentially, repeal \nthis provision, costing well over $20 billion--unpaid for--permanently.\n  That is not only contrary to the letter I read, but it is contrary to \nfairness within the healthcare industry, and it is really unfair to the \nmillions of people who have benefited from the ACA when the motive, \nreally, of so many of the Republicans who come here is not to simply \nrepeal this tax, but it is part of an effort to, essentially, repeal \nthe ACA altogether. We should resist that.\n  The people of this country do not want that repeal, so let's vote \n``no''--and a resounding ``no''--on this proposal.\n\n                                                     May 11, 2009.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We believe that all Americans should \n     have access to affordable, high quality health care services. \n     Thus, we applaud your strong commitment to reforming our \n     nation's health care system. The times demand and the nation \n     expects that we, as health care leaders, work with you to \n     reform the health care system.\n       The annual growth in national health expenditures--\n     including public and private spending--is projected by \n     government actuaries to average 6.2% through the next decade. \n     At that rate, the percent of gross domestic product spent on \n     health care would increase from 17.6% this year to 20.3% in \n     2018--higher than any other country in the world.\n       We are determined to work together to provide quality, \n     affordable coverage and access for every American. It is \n     critical, however, that health reform also enhance quality, \n     improve the overall health of the population, and reduce cost \n     growth. We believe that the proper approach to achieve and \n     sustain reduced cost growth is one that will: improve the \n     population's health; continuously improve quality; encourage \n     the advancement of medical treatments, approaches, and \n     science; streamline administration; and encourage efficient \n     care delivery based on evidence and best practice.\n       To achieve all of these goals, we have joined together in \n     an unprecedented effort, as private sector stakeholders--\n     physicians, hospitals, other health care workers, payors, \n     suppliers, manufacturers, and organized labor--to offer \n     concrete initiatives that will transform the health care \n     system. As restructuring takes hold and the population's \n     health improves over the coming decade, we will do our part \n     to achieve your Administration's goal of decreasing by 1.5 \n     percentage points the annual health care spending growth \n     rate--saving $2 trillion or more. This represents more than a \n     20% reduction in the projected rate of growth. We believe \n     this approach can be highly successful and can help the \n     nation to achieve the reform goals we all share.\n       To respond to this challenge, we are developing consensus \n     proposals to reduce the rate of increase in future health and \n     insurance costs through changes made in all sectors of the \n     health care system. We are committed to taking action in \n     public-private partnership\n\n[[Page H4478]]\n\n     to create a more stable and sustainable health care system \n     that will achieve billions in savings through:\n       Implementing proposals in all sectors of the health care \n     system, focusing on administrative simplification, \n     standardization, and transparency that supports effective \n     markets;\n       Reducing over-use and under-use of health care by aligning \n     quality and efficiency incentives among providers across the \n     continuum of care so that physicians, hospitals, and other \n     health care providers are encouraged and enabled to work \n     together towards the highest standards of quality and \n     efficiency;\n       Encouraging coordinated care, both in the public and \n     private sectors, and adherence to evidence-based best \n     practices and therapies that reduce hospitalization, manage \n     chronic disease more efficiently and effectively, and \n     implement proven clinical prevention strategies; and,\n       Reducing the cost of doing business by addressing cost \n     drivers in each sector and through common sense improvements \n     in care delivery models, health information technology, \n     workforce deployment and development, and regulatory reforms.\n       These and other reforms will make our health care system \n     stronger and more sustainable. However, there are many \n     important factors driving health care costs that are beyond \n     the control of the delivery system alone. Billions in savings \n     can be achieved through a large-scale national effort of \n     health promotion and disease prevention to reduce the \n     prevalence of chronic disease and poor health status, which \n     leads to unnecessary sickness and higher health costs. Reform \n     should include a specific focus on obesity prevention \n     commensurate with the scale of the problem. These initiatives \n     are crucial to transform health care in America and to \n     achieve our goal of reducing the rate of growth in health \n     costs.\n       We, as stakeholder representatives, are committed to doing \n     our part to make reform a reality in order to make the system \n     more affordable and effective for patients and purchasers. We \n     stand ready to work with you to accomplish this goal.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stephen J. Ubl,\n       President and CEO, Advanced Medical Technology Association.\n     Karen Ignagni,\n       President and CEO, America's Health Insurance Plans.\n     Rich Umbdenstock,\n       President and CEO, American Hospital Association.\n     J. James Rohack, MD,\n       President-elect American Medical Association.\n     Billy Tauzin,\n       President and CEO, Pharmaceutical Research and \n     Manufacturers of America.\n     Dennis Rivera,\n       Chair, SEIU Healthcare, Service Employees International \n     Union.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I have a couple of points right off the bat. My friend from Michigan \nclaims that the tax hasn't necessarily impacted jobs, that there are \nonly certain stories. I would just point out that, in his home State, \nthere is a company named Stryker--now, it is a larger company--that \nlaid off 1,000 employees back in November of 2011 to provide \nefficiencies and realign resources in advance of the new medical device \nexcise tax.\n  As to a lot of data that was mentioned earlier, those figures that \nare talking about how well the industry is doing and as to the growth \nand the sales numbers are global data. These are companies that have \nglobal awareness and a global presence. Those are not U.S. jobs. We \nwant those jobs in the United States. If we can repeal this tax, we can \nmake sure that job growth is here in the U.S. instead of outside of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not smart tax policy. It is hurting our \ninnovators, and it is costing us jobs. This industry is an American \nsuccess story. We all know the names of the larger companies because \nsome of those were mentioned here in debate on the floor today, but \nthere are thousands of these companies--the vast majority--because, \nagain, 98 percent have fewer than 500 employees, and over 80 percent \nhave fewer than 50 employees.\n  These are companies you have never heard of, but there is a doctor or \nan engineer or an entrepreneur who has started or who has come up with \nan idea to create a company in the backyard or in the garage to help \nimprove lives or to save lives. That is what we are trying to protect \nhere, Mr. Speaker.\n  These are not technicians in some white lab coats who are trying to \nimprove widgets or to build a widget faster. These are, literally, \nsmall businesses that are on missions to save lives. If you think about \nit, what could be more entrepreneurially worthwhile than that?\n  We in Congress have a responsibility to give America's innovators the \nbest shot, the best opportunity possible, by removing any obstructions \nto those inventions that are going to bring us all a better quality of \nlife. We have the ability to help create a new age of American \ninnovation, and we can help kick-start that process this week--today, \ntomorrow, with a vote--by repealing the destructive medical device tax.\n  It was mentioned as a part of the debate also that the industry came \nforward and that there was vast support for the Affordable Care Act, \nand they agreed to the tax. Mr. Speaker, there are no letters from the \nindustry whatsoever that support their buy-in for a 2.3 percent excise \ntax--a tax on revenue, not on profit.\n  It is true that there were letters that were put out that said they \nwere committed to healthcare reform and that they wanted to see that \nprocess move forward, but then they were very vocal when this excise \ntax idea was floated as a part of the new healthcare law and even after \nthe law passed. It has been continuous, this awareness about their \nopposition in their knowing of the detrimental effects that it would \nhave.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is also not about the Affordable Care Act because \nwe have had many votes on that--to repeal it, to change it, to move in \na different direction. This is about a tax that is going into the \ngeneral fund, that is not going into some special account to fund \nObamaCare. That is not what this tax is doing. This is going into the \ngeneral fund.\n  That Affordable Care Act discussion will come up at another time with \nthe Court case coming up in the near future. This is more of an \nopportunity to stand up with a bipartisan voice to declare our support \nfor American manufacturing, for American jobs, and for protecting our \npatients, including our seniors.\n  I just want to remind my friends that the President has said that he \nhas been open to any ideas that will improve accessibility, that will \nimprove affordability, and the quality of health care. That is exactly \nwhat this bill does. It is about protecting access to those devices.\n  It is also important to point out the 281 cosponsors. The bipartisan \nsupport is deep, and it is broad. If you think back to the sustainable \ngrowth rate debate we had just a little over a month ago, that is \nimportant to bring up. Why? It is because there was broad, bipartisan \nsupport and a belief that the policy was harming patient care and \ninnovation.\n  This is good policy now if we can repeal this tax. It is about doing \nthe right thing for our constituents, which outweighs the concerns of \nthe offsets.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

VALUE-BASED INSURANCE DESIGN DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall \n     establish a 3-year demonstration program to test the use of \n     value-based insurance design methodologies (as defined in \n     subsection (c)(1)) under eligible Medicare Advantage plans \n     offered by Medicare Advantage organizations under part C of \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-21 et \n     seq.). The Secretary may extend the program to a duration of \n     4 or 5 years, as determined necessary by the Secretary in \n     coordination with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Innovation.\n       (b) Demonstration Program Design.--\n       (1) Selection of medicare advantage sites and eligible \n     medicare advantage plans.--Not later than two years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall--\n       (A) select at least two Medicare Advantage sites with \n     respect to which to conduct the demonstration program under \n     this section; and\n       (B) approve eligible Medicare Advantage plans to \n     participate in such demonstration program.\n\n     In selecting Medicare Advantage sites under subparagraph (A), \n     the Secretary shall take into account area differences as \n     well as the availability of health maintenance organization \n     plans and preferred provider organization plans offered in \n     such sites.\n       (2) Start of demonstration.--The demonstration program \n     shall begin not later than the third plan year beginning \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Eligible medicare advantage plans.--For purposes of \n     this section, the term ``eligible Medicare Advantage plan'' \n     means a Medicare Advantage plan under part C of title XVIII \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-21 et seq.) that \n     meets the following requirements:\n       (A) The plan is an Medicare Advantage regional plan (as \n     defined in paragraph (4) of section 1859(b) of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395w-28(b))) or Medicare Advantage local plan (as \n     defined in paragraph (5) of such section) offered in the \n     Medicare Advantage region selected under paragraph (1)(A).\n       (B) The plan has--\n       (i)(I) a quality rating under section 1853(o) of such Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395w-23(o)) of 4 stars or higher based on the \n     most recent data available for such year, or (II) in the case \n     of a specialized Medicare Advantage plan for special needs \n     individuals, as defined in section 1859(b)(6)(A) of such Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395w-28(b)(6)(A)), a quality rating under section \n     1853(o) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-23(o)) equal to or \n     higher than the national average for special needs plans \n     (excluding Institutional-Special needs plans) based on the \n     most recent data available for such year; and\n       (ii) at least 20 percent of the population to whom the plan \n     is offered in a service area consists of subsidy eligible \n     individuals (as defined in section 1860D-14(a)(3)(A) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-114(a)(3)(A))).\n       (4) Disclosure to beneficiaries.--The Secretary shall \n     provide to each individual eligible to enroll under a \n     Medicare Advantage plan approved to participate under the \n     demonstration program during a plan year for which the plan \n     is so selected--\n       (A) notification that the plan is participating in such \n     demonstration program;\n       (B) background information on the demonstration program;\n       (C) clinical data derived from the studies resulting from \n     the demonstration program; and\n       (D) notification of the potential benefits that the \n     individual will receive, and of the other potential impacts \n     that the individual will experience, on account of the \n     participation of the plan in the demonstration program.\n       (c) Value-Based Insurance Design Methodologies.--\n       (1) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``value-based insurance design methodology'' means a \n     methodology for identifying specific prescription \n     medications, and clinical services that are payable under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act, for which the \n     reduction of copayments, coinsurance, or both, would improve \n     the management of specific chronic clinical conditions \n     because of the high value and effectiveness of such \n     medications and services for such specific chronic clinical \n     conditions, as approved by the Secretary.\n       (2) Use of methodologies to reduce copayments and \n     coinsurance.--A Medicare Advantage organization offering an \n     eligible Medicare Advantage plan approved to participate \n     under the demonstration program, for each plan year for which \n     the plan is so selected and using value-based insurance \n     design methodologies--\n       (A) shall identify each prescription medication and \n     clinical service covered under such plan for which the plan \n     proposes to reduce or eliminate the copayment or coinsurance, \n     with respect to the management of specific chronic clinical \n     conditions (as specified by the Secretary) of Medicare \n     Advantage eligible individuals (as defined in section \n     1851(a)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-\n     21(a)(3))) enrolled under such plans, for such plan year;\n       (B) may, for such plan year, reduce or eliminate \n     copayments, coinsurance, or both for such prescription \n     medication and clinical services so identified with respect \n     to the management of such conditions of such individuals--\n       (i) if such reduction or elimination is evidence-based and \n     for the purpose of encouraging such individuals in such plan \n     to use such prescription medications and clinical services \n     (such as preventive care, primary care, specialty visits, \n     diagnostic tests, procedures, and durable medical equipment) \n     with respect to such conditions; and\n       (ii) for the purpose of encouraging such individuals in \n     such plan to use health care providers that such organization \n     has identified with respect to such plan year as being high \n     value providers; and\n       (C) if a reduction or elimination is applied pursuant to \n     subparagraph (B), with respect to such medication and \n     clinical services, shall, for such plan year, count toward \n     the deductible applicable to such individual under such plan \n     amounts that would have been payable by the individual as \n     copayment or coinsurance for such medication and services if \n     the reduction or elimination had not been applied.\n       (3) Prohibition of increases of copayments and \n     coinsurance.--In no case may any Medicare Advantage plan \n     participating in the demonstration program increase, for any \n     plan year for which the plan is so participating, the amount \n     of copayments or coinsurance for any item or service covered \n     under such plan for purposes of discouraging the use of such \n     item or service.\n       (d) Report on Implementation.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date on \n     which the demonstration program under this section begins \n     under subsection (b)(2), the Secretary shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the status of the implementation of the \n     demonstration program.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall, \n     with respect to eligible Medicare Advantage plans \n     participating in the demonstration program for the first plan \n     year of such program, include the following:\n       (A) A list of each medication and service identified \n     pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(A) for such plan with respect \n     to such plan year.\n       (B) For each such medication or service so identified, the \n     amount of the copayment or coinsurance required under such \n     plan with respect to such plan year for such medication or \n     service and the amount of the reduction of such copayment or \n     coinsurance from a previous plan year.\n       (C) For each provider identified pursuant to subsection \n     (c)(2)(B)(ii) for such plan with respect to such plan year, a \n     statement of the amount of the copayment or coinsurance \n     required under such plan with respect to such plan year and \n     the amount of the reduction of such copayment or coinsurance \n     from the previous plan year.\n       (e) Review and Assessment of Utilization of Value-Based \n     Insurance Design Methodologies.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall enter into a contract \n     or agreement with an independent entity to review and assess \n     the implementation of the demonstration program under this \n     section. The review and assessment shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) An assessment of the utilization of value-based \n     insurance design methodologies\n\n[[Page H4480]]\n\n     by Medicare Advantage plans participating under such program.\n       (B) An analysis of whether reducing or eliminating the \n     copayment or coinsurance for each medication and clinical \n     service identified pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(A) resulted \n     in increased adherence to medication regimens, increased \n     service utilization, improvement in quality metrics, better \n     health outcomes, and enhanced beneficiary experience.\n       (C) An analysis of the extent to which costs to Medicare \n     Advantage plans under part C of title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act participating in the demonstration program is \n     less than costs to Medicare Advantage plans under such part \n     that are not participating in the demonstration program.\n       (D) An analysis of whether reducing or eliminating the \n     copayment or coinsurance for providers identified pursuant to \n     subsection (c)(2)(B)(ii) resulted in improvement in quality \n     metrics, better health outcomes, and enhanced beneficiary \n     experience.\n       (E) An analysis, for each provider so identified, the \n     extent to which costs to Medicare Advantage plans under part \n     C of title XVIII of the Social Security Act participating in \n     the demonstration program is less than costs to Medicare \n     Advantage plans under such part that are not participating in \n     the demonstration program.\n       (F) Such other matters as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n       (2) Report.--The contract or agreement entered into under \n     paragraph (1) shall require such entity to submit to the \n     Secretary a report on the review and assessment conducted by \n     the entity under such paragraph in time for the inclusion of \n     the results of such report in the report required by \n     paragraph (3). Such report shall include a description, in \n     clear language, of the manner in which the entity conducted \n     the review and assessment.\n       (3) Report to congress.--Not later than 4 years after the \n     date on which the demonstration program begins under \n     subsection (b)(2), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the review and assessment of the demonstration \n     program conducted under this subsection. The report shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A description of the results of the review and \n     assessment included in the report submitted pursuant to \n     paragraph (2).\n       (B) Such recommendations as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate for enhancing the utilization of the \n     methodologies applied under the demonstration program to all \n     Medicare Advantage plans under part C of title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act so as to reduce copayments and \n     coinsurance under such plans paid by Medicare beneficiaries \n     for high-value prescription medications and clinical services \n     for which coverage is provided under such plans and to \n     otherwise improve the quality of health care provided under \n     such plans.\n       (4) Oversight report.--Not later than three years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of \n     the United States shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     demonstration program that includes an assessment, with \n     respect to individuals enrolled under Medicare Advantage \n     plans approved to participate under the demonstration \n     program, of the impact that the age, co-morbidities, and \n     geographic regions of such individuals had upon the \n     implementation of the demonstration program by the plans with \n     respect to such individuals.\n       (f) Savings.--In no case may any reduction in beneficiary \n     copayments or coinsurance resulting from the implementation \n     of the demonstration program under this section result in \n     expenditures under parts A, B, and D of the title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act that are greater than such \n     expenditures without application of this section.\n       (g) Expansion of Demonstration Program.--Taking into \n     account the review and assessment conducted under subsection \n     (e), the Secretary may, through notice and comment \n     rulemaking, expand (including implementation on a nationwide \n     basis) the duration and scope of the demonstration program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, other than \n     under the original medicare fee-for-service program under \n     parts A and B of such title, to the extent determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary, if the requirements of \n     paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of subsection (c) of section \n     1115A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315a), as \n     applied to the testing of a model under subsection (b) of \n     such section, applied to the demonstration under this \n     section.\n       (h) Waiver Authority.--The Secretary may waive such \n     provisions of titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     as may be necessary to carry out the demonstration program \n     under this section.\n       (i) Implementation Funding.--For purposes of carrying out \n     the demonstration program under this section, the Secretary \n     shall provide for the transfer from the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund under section 1817 of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i) and the Federal Supplementary \n     Insurance Trust Fund under section 1841 of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395t), including the Medicare \n     Prescription Drug Account in such Trust Fund, in such \n     proportion as determined appropriate by the Secretary, of \n     such sums as may be necessary.\n\n     SEC. 4. TREATMENT OF INFUSION DRUGS FURNISHED THROUGH DURABLE \n                   MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.\n\n       Section 1842(o)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395u(o)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ``(and including a \n     drug or biological described in subparagraph (D)(i) furnished \n     on or after January 1, 2017)'' after ``2005''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (D)--\n       (A) by striking ``infusion drugs'' and inserting ``infusion \n     drugs or biologicals'' each place it appears; and\n       (B) in clause (i)--\n       (i) by striking ``2004'' and inserting ``2004, and before \n     January 1, 2017''; and\n       (ii) by striking ``for such drug''.\n\n     SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND \n                   DISTRIBUTION OF QUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO \n                   MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n     incorrectly interpreted subsection (n) of section 1853 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-23) as prohibiting the \n     provision of any Medicare quality incentive payments under \n     subsection (o) of such section with respect to Medicare \n     Advantage plans that exceed the payment benchmark cap under \n     such subsection (n) for the area served by such plans; and\n       (2) the Secretary should immediately apply quality \n     incentive payments under such subsection (o) with respect to \n     such Medicare Advantage plans without regard to the limits \n     set forth in such subsection (n).\n\n     SEC. 6. MEDICARE IMPROVEMENT FUND.\n\n       Section 1898(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395iii(b)(1)) is amended by striking ``during and after \n     fiscal year 2020, $0'' and inserting ``after fiscal year \n     2020, $220,000,000''.\n\n     SEC. 7. NON-INCLUSION OF DME INFUSION DRUGS UNDER DME \n                   COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1847(a)(2)(A) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3(a)(2)(A)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and excluding'' and inserting ``, \n     excluding''; and\n       (2) by inserting before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and excluding drugs and biologicals described \n     in section 1842(o)(1)(D)''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1842(o)(1)(D)(ii) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395u(o)(1)(D)(ii)) is amended \n     by striking ``2007'' and inserting ``2007, and before the \n     date of the enactment of the Strengthening Medicare Advantage \n     through Innovation and Transparency for Seniors Act of \n     2015''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hardy). Pursuant to the rule, the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nRangel) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 2570, \ncurrently under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I stand in strong support of H.R. 2570, the Strengthening Medicare \nAdvantage through Innovation and Transparency for Seniors Act.\n  This package is comprised of two policies, and I will let the \nsponsors, who have worked so hard, speak to them in more depth.\n  The Electronic Health Fairness Act of 2015, as marked up by the \ncommittee back in February, brings fairness to physicians who are \npracticing in the ASC setting by reducing meaningful use burdens for \nsites of service that were left out of the EHR technology requirements. \nThis exemption only lasts until the ASCs are able to catch up, and then \neverybody will be on an equal footing regarding meaningful use \nrequirements.\n  The bill then establishes a new demonstration program based on value-\nbased insurance design. This proposal would give plans the ability to \nadjust benefits based on their enrollees' needs. The one-size-fits-all \npolicies in Medicare Advantage create the need for different types of \nplans that wouldn't be necessary if regular Medicare Advantage plans \ncould adjust their benefit structures to better serve our seniors.\n  Reducing copays or cost sharing for beneficiaries for the sake of \nbetter healthcare outcomes is right in line with the principles that I \nsupport as all seniors are different and should be served as such, so \nthat all have an opportunity for positive health outcomes.\n  The bill also includes a policy that changes the way Medicare pays \nfor drugs that doctors prescribe that are infused through durable \nmedical equipment items. This change means that Medicare payments will \nbe more market based.\n\n[[Page H4481]]\n\n  The policy does take away the potential that these rates could change \nsignificantly in the future by exempting the drugs from DME competitive \nbidding. I am committed to ensuring that beneficiaries who need these \ndrugs are able to continue to get them in their homes, and I will \ncertainly monitor the impact.\n  I want to thank Ways and Means members Mrs. Black of Tennessee and \nMr. Blumenauer of Oregon for their continued leadership in improving \nMedicare Advantage. Their very hard work will ensure that seniors, for \nyears to come, will enjoy better healthcare choices and more options at \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I join with the gentleman from Texas in supporting H.R. 2570. \nRepresentative Diane Black and Representative Earl Blumenauer have \nworked hard on this issue.\n  This legislation will allow the Secretary of HHS to conduct a \ndemonstration, giving managed care organizations the ability to offer \nplans with a variety of benefit structures that would lower the cost \nsharing for high-value service. We think it makes a lot of sense, and I \nconcur.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee (Mrs. Black), a key member of the Committee on Ways and \nMeans and a healthcare professional herself.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, as a nurse for over 40 years, I understand \nthe challenge of helping Americans find affordable healthcare coverage, \nbut the sad truth is, even for those who do have health coverage, high \ndeductibles and out-of-pocket costs can leave too many Americans \nfunctionally uninsured.\n  When families are forced to choose between buying groceries and \nfilling a prescription, their health is sidelined, and they risk facing \neven higher medical costs down the road. That is why I authored H.R. \n2570, the Strengthening Medicare Advantage Through Innovation and \nTransparency for Seniors Act. Our bill directs CMS to set up a pilot \nproject for what is known as Value-Based Insurance Design, or otherwise \nknown as VBID.\n  Instead of the current one-size-fits-all approach to cost sharing, \nVBID embraces the idea that by lowering a patient's out-of-pocket costs \nfor essential prescription drugs and services, customers will then be \nmotivated to stick with their regimen and stay healthier. This will, in \nturn, decrease the overall long-term costs to our healthcare system and \nprovide a higher quality of care for our patients.\n  My bill also helps our providers by offering ambulatory surgical \ncenters relief from the electronic health records' meaningful use \nmandate. While this recordkeeping system may make sense in a hospital \nsetting, it doesn't always work for a small, outpatient surgical \nfacility. Providers who practice medicine in these settings should not \nbe penalized as a result.\n  I thank Congressman Blumenauer and Congresswoman Cathy McMorris \nRodgers for their strong commitment to VBID policy.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 2570.\n  Mr. RANGEL. I yield myself the balance of my time to close.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time I concur with the gentleman from Texas. \nMembers have worked hard in perfecting these bills, and I support H.R. \n2570.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This is a very good bill. It is a good improvement to Medicare \nAdvantage, and it is really a case of Republicans and Democrats finding \ncommon ground and doing it in a way that helps seniors with their \nchoices and really tailoring health care to them.\n  I strongly urge support for this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2570, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act with respect to the treatment of \npatient encounters in ambulatory surgical centers in determining \nmeaningful EHR use, establish a demonstration program requiring the \nutilization of Value-Based Insurance Design to demonstrate that \nreducing the copayments or coinsurance charged to Medicare \nbeneficiaries for selected high-value prescription medications and \nclinical services can increase their utilization and ultimately improve \nclinical outcomes and lower health care expenditures, and for other \npurposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4481-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4481-H4483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INCREASING REGULATORY FAIRNESS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas.

ESTABLISHING AN ANNUAL RULEMAKING SCHEDULE FOR \n                   PAYMENT RATES UNDER MEDICARE ADVANTAGE.\n\n       Section 1853(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w-23(b)) is amended--\n       (1) in the subsection heading, by inserting ``, Annual \n     Rulemaking Schedule for Payment Rates for 2017 and Subsequent \n     Years'' after ``Rates'';\n       (2) in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (B)--\n       (i) in the subparagraph heading, by inserting ``before \n     2017'' after ``years''; and\n       (ii) in the matter preceding clause (i), by inserting ``and \n     before 2017'' after ``2005''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) Annual rulemaking schedule for payment rates for 2017 \n     and subsequent years.--For 2017 and each subsequent year, \n     before April 1 of the preceding year, the Secretary shall, by \n     regulation and in accordance with the notice and public \n     comment periods required under paragraph (2) for such a year, \n     annually determine and announce the following:\n       ``(i) The annual MA capitation rate for each MA payment \n     area for such year.\n       ``(ii) The risk and other factors to be used in adjusting \n     such rates under subsection (a)(1)(A) for payments for months \n     in such year.\n       ``(iii) With respect to each MA region and each MA regional \n     plan for which a bid was submitted under section 1854, the MA \n     region-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amount for that \n     region for the year involved.\n       ``(iv) The major policy changes to the risk adjustment \n     model, and the 5-star rating system established under \n     subsection (o), that are determined to have an economic \n     impact.''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) by inserting ``(or, for 2017 and each subsequent year, \n     at least 60 days)'' after ``45 days''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``(for 2017 and each subsequent year, of \n     no less than 30 days)'' after ``opportunity''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Brady) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2507 currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of H.R. 2507, the Increasing \nRegulatory Fairness Act. This is an important piece of legislation. \nToday, the Medicare Advantage program serves more than 16 million \nseniors throughout the country. Enrollment has increased more than \nthreefold over the past decade, and it is expected to nearly double in \nthe next.\n  To ensure that seniors are able to continue receiving the kind of \nhigh-\n\n[[Page H4482]]\n\nquality care they receive under the program, the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, known as CMS, is expected to pay about $156 \nbillion to more than 3,600 Medicare Advantage plans just this year. \nThat is nearly 30 percent of all Medicare spending, by the way.\n  Typically, every year CMS sends out what is called the rate notice to \nplans and Medicare Advantage companies that details the various payment \nrates and benefit changes the agency plans to make for the following \nyear. This notice follows the standard rulemaking process of other \npayment systems. That is, a draft notice is published, the public has a \ncertain amount of time to submit comments and questions, and then the \nagency publishes a final notice based on that feedback.\n  Right now, this current process takes about 45 days. Do you know how \nmany days are currently allotted for public comment? The answer: A mere \n15 days--15 days for thousands of plans and millions of stakeholders to \nsubmit comments on proposed changes to a program that amounts to one-\nthird of all Medicare spending.\n  I could almost understand this if the rate notice were a short and \nconcise document, easy to understand, and simple to implement, but of \ncourse it is not. The rate notice has grown from around 16 pages in \n2006 to nearly 150 pages this year. That is over a ninefold increase. \nAll the while, the time for the public comment period has remained the \nsame. This means less and less time for plans and Congress to conduct \nthe necessary review so we can provide CMS with the kind of feedback \nthat would better help the agency assess the impact of their proposed \nchanges. This is important because without accurate feedback, CMS could \ninadvertently move forward with a proposed change to the Medicare \nAdvantage program that might negatively impact these seniors who depend \non these plans for access to essential medical care.\n  The legislation before us is simple and straightforward. All it \nproposes to do is extend the public notice period from 45 days to 60 \ndays, which would mean an extension of the comment period from 15 to 30 \ndays. This is a commonsense, good government fix we can make that will \ngive plans more time to understand the changes that Medicare proposes, \noffer constructive feedback, and make the Medicare Advantage program \noverall more responsive to senior needs.\n  I want to thank Mr. Thompson of California, who is a key member of \nour Committee on Ways and Means, and Mr. Pitts, the chairman of the \nHealth Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce, for their thoughtful and \nvery helpful work on this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Brady. It was a pleasure \nworking with him on this piece of legislation.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2507. Every year, as was pointed out, the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes its Medicare \nAdvantage call letter and rate notice that outlines all the payment \nrates and the changes for nearly 2,000 plans that serve our most \nvulnerable population.\n  About 10 years ago the call letter and rate notice were less than 20 \npages long. Since then, enrollment in Medicare Advantage has nearly \ntripled. Medicare Advantage policies have become more complex, and the \ncall letter and the rate notice has grown nearly tenfold. They run \nabout 150 to 200 pages.\n  The same time, the time between the publishing of the draft notice \nand the final notice, which is currently 45 days, has remained \nunchanged. During this 45-day period, in which there are only 15 days \nto comment on the proposed changes in the program, the plans, Members \nof this body and our staff are expected to review 150 pages of \nregulatory changes and understand the impacts of the proposed policy \nchanges on those programs that provide essential medical care to over \none-third of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  As we all know, and as we have all experienced every February and \nMarch, this does not lend itself to an efficient, effective, nor \ntransparent process. Moreover, it deprives CMS of thoughtful, \nconstructive feedback that is necessary to improve a program that our \nseniors love and rely on. This bill is a simple, straightforward \nmeasure that will improve the current process by expanding the current \ncycle from 45 to 60 days, which will give plans, stakeholders, Members, \nand our staff 30 full days--double the current time allowed--to analyze \nand provide feedback on the draft call letter and rate notices.\n  This is a no-cost, good government, bipartisan bill that will make \nthe process more transparent, more fair, and more advantageous for the \nbeneficiaries whom we serve. Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Carter), a key new member of the House of \nRepresentatives who understands the importance of Medicare Advantage.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, one of the things I always strive \nfor in my personal and professional life is always trying to do things \nbetter. As I tell my staff, there is no such thing as standing still. \nIf you are not moving forward, then you are moving backward. We can all \ncontinue to get better at what we do.\n  That is the goal of H.R. 2507, the Increasing Regulatory Fairness Act \nof 2015. As part of an annual rulemaking process, the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services update payments to the Medicare \nAdvantage program. With the current structure of this annual process, \nhealth insurers are given little time to submit comments to the new \npayment rates or even determine whether the payment adjustment is \nbeneficial to Medicare Advantage enrollees.\n  With H.R. 2507, health insurers will have additional time to analyze \nwhether the payment adjustments for Medicare Advantage plans are \njustified and overall beneficial. I believe we must always try to get \nbetter every day. This includes our work as civil servants. H.R. 2507 \nwill provide a better environment for CMS and health insurers to create \nthe best payment rate agreement regarding Medicare Advantage plans. By \nproviding more time for comments and the finalizing of rates, Medicare \nAdvantage enrollees will receive a better calculated benefit for their \nplans.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I concur with the statements \npreviously made by my colleagues and thank both Mr. Brady and Mr. Pitts \nfor working with me on this legislation. As I have stated before, this \nis a simple, no-cost bill that will improve the current process and the \nMedicare Advantage program for our seniors. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 2507.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join with Congressman Thompson. I appreciate so much \nhis work in this area in a bipartisan way on a bill that not only \nbridges both parties but a number of committees in this Congress and \nreally just provides a commonsense way to make sure the public, \nCongress, and others can comment, and to make sure these rules really \nbenefit the seniors who are receiving Medicare Advantage. I urge strong \nsupport for this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today expands an annual \nregulatory schedule for Medicare Advantage (MA) payment rates so that \nstakeholders have the necessary time to review and provide feedback to \nensure seniors continue to have access to quality, low-cost plans of \ntheir choosing.\n  H.R. 2507, the Increasing Regulatory Fairness Act of 2015, was \nintroduced by my colleague, Representative Kevin Brady (TX), Chairman \nof the Health Subcommittee of Ways and Means, and I cosponsored along \nwith Mike Thompson (CA), Pete Sessions (TX), and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ). \nThis bipartisan, commonsense legislation will facilitate greater \nunderstanding and collaboration between industry stakeholders and \nregulators, and will offer a greater opportunity for public input in \nthe establishment of policies affecting the MA and Part D plans.\n  Since 2006, when the Medicare Modernization Act's official \nimplementation, and the Medicare Advantage/Part D call letter and rate\n\n[[Page H4483]]\n\nnotice were around 16 pages long, a two-week comment period may have \nbeen adequate. Today, however, that document has grown to nearly 150 \npages--and the comment period--still just 15 days--is simply not enough \ntime for plans that now serve one-third of the Medicare population to \nanalyze and gather substantive comments on increasingly complex policy \nchanges. This bill would increase that comment period to 30 days, a \nstrong step towards regulatory fairness for the successful Medicare \nAdvantage/Part D programs.\n  Expanding this comment period allows for a fair amount of time in \nwhich both stakeholders, as well as Members of Congress and Committees, \nhave sufficient time to understand the policy implications and \nformulate comments, if they so choose. More time equals better, more \nthoughtful policies.\n  Mr. Speaker, by approving this legislation, we will be giving \nseniors, insurance plan providers and other interested stakeholders \nadequate time to comprehend and provide comments on proposed changes to \nMedicare Advantage plans.\n  This is an important and necessary legislative change and I urge all \nof my colleagues to support H.R. 2507.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to, specifically, the \nprovision of H.R. 2570 that pays for the Value Based Insurance Design \nfor Better Care Act. If this bill passes with its current pay-for in \nplace, it will do so at the detriment of Americans who rely on home \ninfusion therapies.\n  ``Infusion therapy'' refers to the administration of medication \ndirectly into the bloodstream through a needle or catheter. A patient \nwill undergo infusion therapy when his or her disease or infection \ncannot be adequately treated by oral medications. Infusion therapy is \nused to treat cancers, congestive heart failure, immune deficiencies, \nmultiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, gastrointestinal diseases, \nand other conditions.\n  The administration of infusion therapies is significantly more \ninvolved than that of oral medications. Infusion therapy entails \nspecialized equipment, supplies, and professional services, including \nsterile drug compounding, care coordination, and patient education and \nmonitoring.\n  Currently, Medicare fully covers infusion therapy when it is \nadministered in a hospital, doctor's office or nursing home. However, \nMedicare's coverage of infusion therapy in the home is fractured and \ndoes not adequately cover the services needed to provide infusions in \nthe home.\n  Not only does this coverage gap force patients into expensive \ninstitutional settings, but it also puts patients at risk of developing \nadditional infections in these environments. What's more, this coverage \ngap prevents patients from receiving the treatment they need in the \nmost comfortable setting possible: their homes.\n  Although Medicare does not presently pay for the services that are \nessential for a patient to receive infusion therapies at home, \nproviders have been able to offer a limited set of home infusion drugs \nto Medicare beneficiaries via Medicare Part B DME coverage, as the \nreimbursement they receive for home infusion drugs is substantial \nenough to cover the services necessary to administer those drugs.\n  If H.R. 2570 passes in its current form, this will no longer be the \ncase.\n  The demonstration program that this legislation creates is financed \nby modifying the reimbursement structure for infusion drugs under the \nMedicare Part B durable medical equipment benefit. This change will \nperpetuate the coverage gap that prevents Medicare from covering the \nindispensable service component of home infusion therapy.\n  In addition, the drug reimbursement that providers receive will no \nlonger be significant enough to capture home infusion services as it \ndoes currently. As a result, it will become exceedingly difficult for \nproviders to offer Medicare beneficiaries infusion therapy in their \nhomes.\n  I want to emphasize that I do not oppose changing the manner in which \nhome infusion drugs are paid for. On the contrary, I have introduced \nH.R. 605, the Medicare Home Infusion Site of Care Act, with Congressman \nPat Tiberi. Our bill, which has garnered cosponsors from both sides of \nthe aisle, would explicitly cover the services that must be provided to \nadminister infusion drugs at home.\n  I ask that my colleagues think about the patients who depend on home \ninfusion therapies. If we allow H.R. 2570 to pass in its current form, \nwe simultaneously deny patients the ability to receive life-saving \ntherapies in their homes, forcing them into institutional settings that \nwill come at a cost to the Medicare program and, most importantly, to \npatients' quality of life.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2507, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4483-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4483-H4485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1745\n          MEDICARE ADVANTAGE COVERAGE TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas.

This is commonsense legislation. It \nis truly about transparency in healthcare data.\n  Medicare Advantage currently makes up close to one-third of the \nMedicare program's enrollees. The Congressional Budget Office projects \nthat Medicare enrollment numbers will swell over the next decade and \nthat Medicare Advantage will grow to over 40 percent of Medicare.\n  It will be beneficial for Members of Congress to fully understand \nwhat the makeup of health enrollment is in their district, whether it \nis Medicare Advantage; part D, the prescription drug plan; or fee-for-\nservice. Members and their staff will be able to serve their \nconstituents better and more\n\n[[Page H4484]]\n\nfully with access to this data.

As you are aware, the bill also was referred to \n     the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I wanted to notify you \n     that the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo action \n     on H.R. 2505 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the \n     House floor for consideration.\n       This is done with the understanding that the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce's jurisdictional interests over this and \n     similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In \n     addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees \n     on H.R. 2505 and requests your support when such a request is \n     made.\n       I would appreciate your response confirming this \n     understanding with respect to H.R. 2505 and ask that a copy \n     of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the \n     House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I concur with the gentleman from Texas. My dear friend Mike Kelly and \nCongressman Ron Kind have worked together in trying to get more \ninformation for the Congress from our congressional districts to see \nexactly what the enrollments are in Medicare. It makes us better \nlegislators so we can improve the bill.\n  I think these bills are worthy of the support of the House of \nRepresentatives, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a new member of the Ways and \nMeans Committee and a businessperson who understands the openness and \ntransparency required to improve Medicare.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, Thomas Jefferson once opined:\n\n       The cornerstone of democracy rests on the foundation of an \n     educated electorate. Whenever the people are well-informed, \n     they can be trusted with their own government.\n\n  Jefferson's vision for our democracy was premised on the notion that \nindividuals are intelligent enough to determine the best choices for \ntheir lives, their families, and their communities, and not some \nmonolithic, paternalistic government.\n  A prerequisite to being well-informed, however, is to ensure that the \nAmerican people have adequate information about how Federal policies \nand decisions made in Washington will or are impacting their lives. \nThat is why transparency is so vital to our system of government: it \nprovides the necessary information to educate or our on which our \ndemocracy depends.\n  Laws and their impacts should not be shrouded in secrecy. Congress \nand the administration need to be fostering a culture of openness and \ntransparency when legislating and making decisions here in Washington. \nThat is what this legislation is all about: providing more transparency \nto the American people about their health care, specifically Medicare \nAdvantage coverage.\n  H.R. 2505, the Medicare Advantage Coverage Transparency Act, is a \nbill to do just that. With passage of H.R. 2505, CMS will be required \nto provide additional information on Medicare Advantage enrollment \nbased on ZIP Code, congressional district, and State.\n  This data will be available for both Medicare Advantage Prescription \nDrug Plans as well as regular Medicare Advantage. Enrollment data under \npart A, part B, enrollment under an MA plan under part C, and \nenrollment under part D would also be covered.\n  The purpose of this additional data is to provide greater information \nto the public, policymakers, and the healthcare community so that they \nhave the benefit of more and better information when making decisions.\n  CMS should provide a more transparent accounting of Medicare \nenrollment data to Congress, other government offices, and the American \npeople so committees of jurisdiction can better understand how Medicare \nis serving the healthcare needs of the Nation as well as individual \ncongressional districts.\n  H.R. 2505 would require an annual report on Medicare enrollment data \nso that Members of Congress have more accurate information regarding \nthe constituents' use of Medicare programs. Such transparency will \nallow Americans and Members of Congress to better know and understand \nthe scope of Medicare enrollment on a local level as well as the \nspecific population affected.\n  In 2014, the majority of the 54 million people on Medicare are in the \ntraditional Medicare program, with 30 percent enrolled in a Medicare \nAdvantage plan. Since 2004, the number of beneficiaries enrolled in \nprivate plans has almost tripled--from 5.3 million to 15.7 million in \n2014.\n  In Pennsylvania, 18 percent of the total population in the \nCommonwealth is enrolled in some form of Medicare. Of the 18 percent, \n39 percent of those Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage plans. That means that 7 percent of Pennsylvanians are \nenrolled in the Medicare Advantage plan.\n  This legislation will give me and my constituents more information \nabout how changes to Medicare Advantage plans in Washington will impact \nmy constituents at home in the Third Congressional District of \nPennsylvania and every Member and their constituents around this great \ncountry.\n  I want to thank Chairman Ryan for bringing up this bill. I also want \nto thank Leader McCarthy for bringing this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), one of the key authors of the \nlegislation and one of the leaders of health care on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill I am \nproud to sponsor with my friends--Representative Kelly, who is the lead \nsponsor, and Representative Kind--H.R. 2505, the Medicare Advantage \nCoverage Transparency Act.\n  Fifteen million Americans choose Medicare Advantage. By all accounts, \nMedicare Advantage has been successful for its enrollees, including \nthose I represent. Similarly, approximately 37 million seniors chose \npart D as of 2014. Over 1,000 Medicare part D plans are offered \nnationwide, and the program has continued to grow in popularity and be \nwell under its initial budget projections. I think Medicare part D is \none of the greatest programs in the history of the Congress.\n  The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Office of Legislation \nused to issue reports on the Medicare Advantage and part D enrollment \ndata for each congressional district; however, in 2012, they stopped \nissuing these\n\n[[Page H4485]]\n\nreports. Why? It is now 2015, and they have still not provided this \ndata.\n  Information is valuable to legislators and health researchers. The \nmore information we have about how a program is working, the better \ndecisions we can make. Currently, enrollment data for Medicare \nAdvantage and part D come from third-party sources; however, it is time \nfor CMS to continue to do its job and provide this information.\n  As I said earlier, by all accounts from third parties, both Medicare \nAdvantage and part D are successful programs and, of course, as is \ntraditional Medicare. These programs are used by so many seniors, Mr. \nSpeaker. They are keeping our seniors healthier and saving them money.\n  This is a good government bill, and I am hopeful for a strong, \nbipartisan vote.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I concur with the objectives of this bill. I \nadvocate a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Mr. Kelly, Mr. Bilirakis, and Mr. Kind \nfrom Wisconsin, who together, Republicans and Democrats, crossed \ncommittees and recognized the need for openness.\n  Knowledge is power. Knowledge of Medicare Advantage and who is \nreceiving it in whose district we think is very important to \nstrengthening Medicare as an entire program going forward.\n  I urge support for this legislation, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE STAR \n                   RATING SYSTEM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has \n     inadvertently created a star rating system under section \n     1853(o)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-\n     23(o)(4)) for Medicare Advantage plans that lacks proper \n     accounting for the socioeconomic status of enrollees in such \n     plans and the extent to which such plans serve individuals \n     who are also eligible for medical assistance under title XIX \n     of such Act; and\n       (2) Congress will work with the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid Services and stakeholders, including beneficiary \n     groups and managed care organizations, to ensure that such \n     rating system properly accounts for the socioeconomic status \n     of enrollees in such plans and the extent to which such plans \n     serve such individuals described in paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE RISK \n                   ADJUSTMENT.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services should \n     periodically monitor and improve the Medicare Advantage risk \n     adjustment model to ensure that it accurately accounts for \n     beneficiary risk, including for those individuals with \n     complex chronic comorbid conditions;\n       (2) the Secretary should closely examine the current \n     Medicare Advantage risk adjustment methodology to ensure that \n     plans enrolling beneficiaries with the greatest health care \n     needs receive adequate reimbursement to deliver high-quality \n     care and other services to help beneficiaries avoid costly \n     complications and further progression of chronic conditions \n     and to the extent data indicate this to be the case, the \n     Secretary should make necessary adjustment to the risk \n     adjustment methodology; and\n       (3) the Secretary should reconsider the implementation of \n     changes in the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment methodology \n     finalized for 2016 and to use to the extent appropriate the \n     methodology finalized in 2015 for one additional year.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Brady) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2582, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of H.R. 2582, the Securing \nSeniors' Health Care Act of 2015.\n  When Medicare began implementing the STARS ratings measurement \nsystem, they did so using the typical Washington approach of one size \nfits all. The STARS program uses the same measures to evaluate plans \nwith different benefit designs and different coverage mixes. Congress \nneeds to work with stakeholders and Medicare to reform this system to \nmake it work for all.\n  CMS should continue to study issues like the effect that \nsocioeconomic conditions have on health care and the effect that \ncoverage of duals has on various rating systems and thus properly serve \ntheir populations.\n  This legislation is common sense. Let's not restrict seniors from \nplans they have chosen and like just because they aren't performing \nwell under CMS's poorly managed STARS standards.\n  Until we truly understand the effects of duals and low-income \nbeneficiaries on the plan's STARS ratings, we shouldn't be terminating \nthem. A 3-year delay will do just that: give CMS and Congress the time \nto address the STARS rating system and allow all seniors access to the \nplans they choose and that they like.\n  CMS has made some poor policy decisions in recent years through the \nregulatory process in Medicare Advantage and part D of the prescription \ndrug plan, and this years's call letter and rate notice is no \nexception.\n  The changes to the risk adjustment system include masking coding \nintensity adjustments, while in press releases CMS touts not exceeding \nstatutory levels of coding intensity adjustments.\n  In plain English, Medicare Advantage plans are managed care plans, \nand the changes in the recent regulations handcuff plans from properly \nmanaging some of our frailest seniors suffering from, for example, \nblood and kidney diseases.\n  This bill requires that CMS review the changes made in their most \nrecent regulatory cycle and reverse those that negatively affect risk \nadjustments.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  This bill has CMS reviewing the use of encounter date as well. CMS \nhas told Congress, the Government Accountability Office, and MedPAC \nthat the data is not ready yet to show us; yet it is being used for \nrisk adjustment in Medicare Advantage? That doesn't make sense. We need \nto see a stronger commitment by CMS to be transparent about their \npolicies and their data in Medicare Advantage.\n  The changes made this year to MA just don't make sense, and I look \nforward to working with all my colleagues to reverse some of these \nchanges and make continued improvements to the system as a whole.\n  I want to thank Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Rangel, Mrs. Blackburn of \nTennessee, Mr. Guthrie, and Mr. Loebsack for their hard work in getting \nthis policy moving forward.\n  I want to, again, reiterate my thanks to Mrs. Black and Mr. \nBlumenauer on our committee for their leadership regarding these \nissues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for bringing up this bill \nand also my colleague, Mr. Buchanan of Florida.\n  There was some comment that CMS was making some mistakes that have \nnot been transparent. It has been my understanding that they have had \nproblems wrestling with this so-called star system themselves and have \nnot enforced the law, that we are now saying that they will not enforce \nthe law until after they study the complexities and report back to the \nCongress in an additional 3 years.\n  In short, they have this star system and, as most people should \nrecognize, that when you are dealing with old, fragile, sick, poor \npeople, there are more complexities to performance than in ordinary \nprograms that compete with Medicare Advantage.\n  We have this population, and they have penalized some of the \nproviders because they have had just more problems to deal with than \njust medical problems, and they haven't been able to resolve them. They \nhaven't enforced this provision.\n  Under this bill, which Mr. Buchanan and the other sponsors have \nagreed, it tells the CMS to go back and to find out a way that you can \ntreat these recipients of health care in a fairer way. It also tells \nCMS to take into consideration that the problems that Medicare \nAdvantage has still to come are far more severe and far more complex \nthan in other areas.\n  This is particularly true with our citizens in Puerto Rico that don't \nreally have an option to anything except Medicare Advantage. Of course, \nas we all know, the economic conditions and the poverty that prevails \nthere is extreme.\n  I don't have any other requests for time, but I do want to thank my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle for assisting to make certain \nthat the Affordable Care program and other programs like it become more \neffective.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), one of the thought \nleaders on health care on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I do thank the gentleman from Texas for \nhis leadership and for, really, his commitment to working these issues \nthrough. As you have heard him say, dealing with Medicare Advantage \nissues are important, and it is important that we get them right.\n  That is why I appreciate the fact that we come to the floor with \nthese suspension bills to revisit these issues and say: Look, there are \nsome things that just are not working as they were intended.\n\n[[Page H4487]]\n\n  As you have heard, there has been bipartisan agreement, that the \nstars rating program needs a revisit, and CMS even agrees that the \nrules are not working.\n  As the gentleman from New York said, this has a specific effect on \nthe frail, the low-income, those beneficiaries that are the most frail. \nIt also affects the dual eligibles, those that are both Medicare and \nMedicaid eligible.\n  It is appropriate that we look at this rating program, that we back \nup and pause and consider the negative impact that some of these \narbitrary ratings have on these programs when it may be the only \nprogram that is available that will meet these needs.\n  This is common sense. It is the right thing to do. I thank my \ncolleagues that they are willing to say: CMS, it is not working; you \nhave to come to the table with us.\n  This delay, this pause, and a review of the system is appropriate.\n  I thank everyone involved for their leadership, and I do express \nthanks to Mr. Buchanan and his team for the way they have worked with \nus and the Energy and Commerce Committee on the issue.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee (Mrs. Black), again, one of our key healthcare leaders \non the Ways and Means Committee who is critical in the advancement of \nthis legislation.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2582, the \nSeniors' Health Care Plan Protection Act.\n  I am pleased that this legislation includes the language of my bill, \nthe Securing Care for Seniors Act; and I thank Congressman Buchanan for \nhis efforts to bring this important policy solution to the floor of the \nHouse today.\n  Across the country, 16 million seniors enjoy the flexibility of the \nMedicare Advantage plan. When we make changes to this program, seniors \nare the ones impacted. It just makes sense that they would have a place \nat the table when these changes are discussed.\n  Recently, CMS revised the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment model \nunder the shroud of secrecy with little input from Congress and, most \nimportantly, from Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Members of both parties have concerns that these modifications could \ndiscourage plans to detect and care for the chronic conditions in their \nearly stages. That is why, today, we are calling for a timeout on CMS' \nchanges.\n  We are instructing the agency to reevaluate their risk adjustment \nmodel and to move forward with metrics that are accurate, evidence-\nbased, and are transparent. This will ensure that seniors pay a fair \ncost for their healthcare plans, and that the MA program remains \nsustainable in the long term.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 2582.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just like to say that this has been one of the most exciting \nrecent legislative experiences I have had, where we are dealing with \nAmericans who are not Republican and Democrat, but they are sick \npeople; and, in this particular case, they are sick, and they are old, \nand they are fragile, and the government is not serving them.\n  Both sides of the aisle have agreed that the administration has to do \nsomething to make certain that they study how we can be fair to the \nproviders and, at the same time, provide the service to those people \nthat need it. They, themselves, agree that, for 3 years, they have not \nbeen able to find an answer.\n\n  What we have said jointly is you find that answer in 3 years. Until \nsuch time, don't you think about terminating these programs. It is with \nthis cooperation that we both have a common sense of our obligation as \nlegislators, and it has been really a legislative pleasure working with \nmy colleagues on these suspensions this evening.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I agree with the gentleman from New York that this is a bill that \nbrings, really, a team of Republicans and Democrats together with their \nbest ideas on how we can help improve Medicare for our seniors.\n  This bill is titled ``Securing Seniors' Health Care Act.'' It is \naptly titled.\n  I am hopeful that today is just one example of more common ground \nbetween Republicans and Democrats, not just on the Ways and Means \nCommittee, but through the House as well. I urge strong support for \npassage of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2582, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill To amend \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act to delay the authority to \nterminate Medicare Advantage contracts for MA plans failing to achieve \nminimum quality ratings, to make improvements to the Medicare \nAdjustment risk adjustment system, and for other purposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4487-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge this body \nto pass the Protect Medical Innovation Act, which will repeal the 2.3 \npercent medical device excise tax.\n  This harmful tax, mandated by ObamaCare, stifles innovation, sends \njobs abroad, hurts consumers, and places a heavy burden on small \nbusinesses in my State and across the country.\n  More than 35,000 Minnesotans are employed in the medical device \nindustry, and thousands of Minnesotans depend on these state-of-the-art \ndevices to enhance or even save their lives.\n  This bill has been stalled for long enough. It is imperative that \nCongress pass this legislation now to encourage the development of \nthese innovative technologies, rather than enact laws that discourage \ntheir creation and accessibility.\n  I am grateful for the tremendous work by my Minnesota colleague, Erik \nPaulsen. Representative Paulsen has done much to ensure the medical \ndevice industry in Minnesota continues to thrive for many years to come \nwith this legislation.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to support the Protect Medical Innovation \nAct and pass it immediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4487-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4487-H4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REPEAL THE MEDICAL DEVICE TAX\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that the medical \ndevice tax that is found within the President's Affordable Care Act \nsends American jobs overseas, hurts American jobs here in the United \nStates, raises healthcare costs for all Americans, and stifles \ninnovation.\n  While I have supported the House's action to repeal this onerous tax \nand support innovation, it is important that I highlight an important \nissue to my constituents back home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, \nbecause it is tied into this whole debate. That issue is medical device \nsafety, and it is patient safety.\n  Many who serve in this Chamber may have seen the headlines over the \npast several months regarding a medical device known as a power \nmorcellator and, specifically, the devastating damage it has caused to \nwomen's health by spreading unsuspected cancer throughout their body.\n\n[[Page H4488]]\n\n  These devices are gynecological tools used to remove uterine fibroids \nand have been on the market for over two decades, but only recently, we \nhave learned that the use of these devices increases the risk of \nspreading unsuspected cancers in women to as high as 1 in 350 cases.\n  That finding prompted the FDA to issue a black box warning on the \ndevices last fall. Several major insurance companies have stopped \ncovering the procedure, and some medical device manufacturers have \npulled them from the shelves--all appropriate steps to be taken when it \nbecomes clear that a previously approved device has potential to harm \ninstead of help.\n  As a lawmaker, I must ask: How is it that we have gotten to this \npoint? What are the FDA and the medical device industry's protocols?\n  That is why, on February 19 of this year, I sent a letter to the FDA \nasking pointed questions about the current streamlined regulatory \nprocess that the power morcellator went through, known as 510(k).\n  I asked about FDA's reporting process for dangerous devices and their \npostmarket surveillance techniques. I asked for detailed explanations \non why the power morcellator remains on the market, despite the high \nrisks that have now been revealed.\n  To date, nearly 4 months from the date that this letter was hand-\ndelivered to the FDA, I have not received a written reply. I will \ninsert my letter to the FDA into the Record.\n  These are important questions, the answers to which will inform any \nnext steps that we need to take.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  My constituents want answers. I want answers. And I think this \nChamber needs answers so that we can properly begin to address these \ngaps in our device safety regulations that allowed the morcellator to \nslip through the cracks for so long.\n  Ensuring the safety of our constituents is paramount to each Member \nof this body, and that is what I seek when it comes to this issue. I am \nhoping the FDA will partner with me. I am hoping that every Member of \nthis body will partner with me.\n  Industry and government need to work together to develop a robust, \nmodernized postmarket device surveillance program that allows us to \ncatch issues like the power morcellator faster and encourages \nresponsive reporting protocols so if a doctor finds an issue with a \ndevice, the manufacturer and the FDA are promptly notified and provided \naccurate data to take the next appropriate steps.\n  But, unfortunately, it is becoming clear that the reporting system \nfor faulty and deadly devices is broken. A recent Wall Street Journal \nstory highlighted how, in 2006, a doctor from central Pennsylvania \nstarted to raise the alarm and asked questions about power \nmorcellators. He was seeing an alarming number of cancerous tissues \narriving at his lab that were coming in from morcellation surgeries. He \nestimated the occurrence at somewhere in the range of 1 in 300.\n  It took the FDA and industry nearly a decade to come to that same \nconclusion. Within that decade, an unknown number of women were harmed \nand deceased because their cancers went from localized and treatable to \nstage four and metastasized within days of being spread by the blades \nof this device.\n  What happened with the power morcellator should never be allowed to \nhappen again. We need to ensure that risks are adequately assessed \nbefore devices hit the market. We need to monitor the devices once they \nare on the market. And we need to have efficient and effective \nreporting procedures in place. And those within industry and the FDA \nneed to be held accountable if it is found that they are turning a \nblind eye to these issues.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in ensuring that patients and \nsafety always come first.\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 19, 2015.\n     Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg,\n     U.S. Food and Drug Administration,\n     Silver Spring, MD.\n       Dear Commissioner Hamburg, I write to seek clarification of \n     your agency's regulation of medical devices. I am \n     specifically looking to obtain answers about the 510(k) \n     process, and hoping to gather information about whether the \n     FDA has plans to alter this process in light of \n     recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IOM)\n       It is my understanding that the 510(k) clearance process \n     for medical devices was established through the Medical \n     Devices Amendments (MDA) passed by Congress in 1976. The \n     process was created as a by-product of the three-tiered \n     medical device regulatory framework created by the MDA to \n     balance competing considerations of ensuring product safety \n     and fostering further innovation.\n       After 1976, medical devices were organized into three \n     classes.\n       Class I--devices for which general controls such as \n     misbranding and adulteration prohibitions and Good \n     Manufacturing Practices (GMP) suffice to reasonably assure \n     safety and effectiveness.\n       Class II--devices that require both general controls and \n     product performance to reasonably assure the same.\n       Class III--devices for which only a premarket approval \n     (PMA) process similar to new drug approval can ensure safety \n     and effectiveness.\n       Section 510(k) was created as part of the MDA's attempt to \n     address medical devices that were on the market prior to its \n     enactment and new medical devices introduced later \n     consistently within this framework. Since its creation, the \n     510(k) process has come to dominate the path to market for \n     virtually all Class I, Class II, and some Class III medical \n     devices despite the fact that consumer protection is severely \n     lacking. To reinforce this statement, it has been reported \n     that between 1976 and 1990, more than 98 percent of FDA-\n     regulated medical devices were cleared through the 510(k) \n     premarket notification, and in the year 2005, almost 99 \n     percent of devices were cleared through the 510(k) process.\n       In 2011, the FDA sought to address this process, and turned \n     to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to review the 510(k) \n     process and answer two questions:\n       1. Does the current 510(k) process protect patients \n     optimally and promote innovation in support of public health?\n       2. If not, what legislative, regulatory, or administrative \n     changes are recommended to achieve the goals of the 510(k) \n     process optimally?\n       IOM found that the current 510(k) process is flawed based \n     on its legislative foundation. Rather than continuing to \n     modify the thirty-five year old 510(k) process, the IOM \n     concluded that the FDA's finite resources would be better \n     invested in developing an integrated pre-market and post-\n     market regulatory framework that provides a reasonable \n     assurance of safety and effectiveness throughout the device \n     life cycle. The IOM outlined its criteria for the framework \n     in a comprehensive report they provided to your agency that \n     same year.\n       Following the release of IOM's recommendation, the US \n     Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions \n     (HELP) held a full committee hearing entitled ``Medical \n     Devices: Protecting Patients and Promoting Innovation'' on \n     November 15, 2011. During this hearing, Jeffrey Shuren, the \n     Director of the Center for Device and Radiological Health \n     (CDRH) within the FDA, provided testimony to Committee \n     Members about CDRH's premarket review process and the \n     center's plan to improve the predictability, consistency, and \n     transparency of their regulatory processes. When asked about \n     510(k) Mr. Shuren stated that getting rid of this clearance \n     process as IOM suggested would be highly disruptive to both \n     the FDA and medical device manufacturers, but assured the \n     Committee that the FDA would focus on trying to improve the \n     process along with the safety of medical devices.\n       Nearly four years has passed since this hearing and to my \n     knowledge, the 510(k) process remains the same. I \n     respectfully request that you answer the following questions \n     regarding this process:\n       1. Does the 510(k) mechanism ensure patient safety in the \n     medical device arena by requiring premarket safety testing?\n       2. Does the 510(k) mechanism have a specific mechanism for \n     surveillance of adverse outcomes? What are the legislative \n     barriers to FDA surveillance of adverse outcomes in the \n     medical device space?\n       3. The majority of medical devices in the United States are \n     cleared via the 510(k) process. This process operates based \n     on a ``predicate'' system. What is the process through which \n     FDA makes the determination that a device is an appropriate \n     predicate?\n       4. Type 2 devices are reviewed via the 510(k) mechanism. \n     Who assigns a device as being a type 2 device? Is this \n     determination reviewed by any expert committees, and how? If \n     not, why not? Are there specific examples where the Type 2 \n     status was assigned, but was then later changed or should \n     have been changed?\n       5. As previously mentioned, A committee of The Institute of \n     Medicine concluded and subsequently testified to the senate \n     HELP committee, in 2011, that the 510(k) legislation cannot \n     ensure patient safety and must be overhauled. What specific \n     steps did the FDA take to mitigate the patient safety deficit \n     in response to this analysis?\n       6. The Institute of Medicine report of 2011 also expressed \n     significant concern to FDA and congress regarding the lack of \n     pre-market safety testing requirements and absence of any \n     post-market adverse outcomes surveillance mechanisms in \n     510(k). What are the barriers at FDA for implementation of \n     such safety standards in the medical device space?\n       7. What specific guidelines does the FDA currently use to \n     determine if a device is eligible for a 510(k) application?\n\n[[Page H4489]]\n\n       8. Does the FDA currently permit persistence of devices \n     approved via 510(k), whose predicate device has been found to \n     be faulty?\n       The FDA's primary focus should be to ensure patient safety. \n     Please consider the following questions regarding the \n     reporting process and post-market surveillance techniques for \n     harmful medical devices:\n       9. Does FDA have a legal and prosecutable ``positive \n     mandate to self-report adverse outcomes in the medical device \n     space'' for individual practitioners? If so have there been \n     any prosecutions for failure to report?\n       10. Does FDA have a legal and prosecutable ``positive \n     mandate to self-report adverse outcomes in the medical device \n     space'' for hospitals? If so have there been any prosecutions \n     for failure to report?\n       11. Does FDA have a legal and prosecutable ``positive \n     mandate to self-report adverse outcomes in the medical device \n     space'' for device manufacturers? If so have there been any \n     prosecutions for failure to report?\n       12. The FDA has a database that could be used to report \n     adverse outcomes in the medical device space, known as MAUDE. \n     Public concerns have been raised that this database is a \n     ``dead mail-box'' with inefficient to ineffective monitoring. \n     How is the MAUDE database monitored? And how are safety \n     concerns registered in MAUDE addressed by FDA?\n       13. Is there a role for implementation of new legislation \n     to require a window of post-market surveillance of adverse \n     outcomes related to the use of new devices? And can the FDA \n     under its current authority mandate post-market surveillance \n     of adverse outcomes related to the use of new devices?\n       14. Can the FDA, under its current legal authority, mandate \n     a positive duty for practitioners, organizations that provide \n     health care services, and manufacturers to report adverse \n     outcomes to the FDA? And is there a role for new legislation \n     focused on more strongly and clearly mandating a ``positive \n     requirement to self-report adverse outcomes'' to FDA by \n     practitioners, hospitals and manufacturers?\n       15. Please explain the asymmetry between the safety and \n     reporting requirements imposed on the medical device, versus \n     drug industries, by FDA?\n       The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is \n     the branch of the FDA responsible for the premarket approval \n     of all medical devices, as well as overseeing the \n     manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices. \n     Please respond to the following questions regarding the CDRH:\n       16. How many people are employed at the CDRH and in what \n     capacities? How effective is this staff at protecting patient \n     safety and is the first and foremost priority of this group's \n     agenda to protect and promote patient safety? What consumer/\n     patient protection mechanisms have been established by the \n     CDRH to promote patient safety and how is the efficacy of \n     these mechanisms evaluated?\n       17. Does the CDRH consider the medical device industry as \n     equal stake-holder to patients and consumers in the United \n     States?\n       Lastly, as you are likely aware, many safety concerns have \n     been raised in conjunction with the use of power morcellators \n     in routine surgeries. Please consider the following questions \n     regarding that specific device.\n       18. Recently, FDA placed a black box warning on a device \n     known as a power morcellator. FDA recognized and reported to \n     the public that as many as one in 350 unsuspecting American \n     women undergoing morcellation will be at risk of having their \n     occult uterine cancers upstaged with devastating \n     consequences. Johnson & Johnson, the largest manufacturer of \n     the power morcellator subsequently voluntarily recalled its \n     product from the worldwide market. Other manufacturers, such \n     as the german company KARL STORZ, have elected not to recall \n     the product and many gynecologists continue to believe the \n     risk to be minimal.\n       a. Given the avoidable nature of this potentially deadly \n     hazard and unwillingness of industry advocates and many \n     gynecologists to abandon this practice, why did FDA elect not \n     to ban this device from market?\n       b. Was there any role for the FDA commissioner's office to \n     exercise its authority under Title 21 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulation, Section 895? And why was this option not \n     exercised?\n       19. The FDA's analysis demonstrated that up to one in 350 \n     unsuspecting American women undergoing morcellation were put \n     in deadly harm's way using FDA authorized power morcellators. \n     The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology \n     subsequently demonstrated that the incidence may be as high \n     as one in 156. It, therefore, appears that morcellation and \n     Power morcellators may have caused the unnecessary or \n     premature deaths of many hundreds (if not thousands) of \n     American women for over 2 decades. It now appears that the \n     manufacturers of power morcellators and many gynecological \n     specialty organizations had full knowledge of this hazard. \n     However, no one appears to have reported this potentially \n     deadly hazard back to FDA, a complication associated with the \n     use of this device until December 2013-20 years after the \n     device was introduced to market using 510(k) clearance.\n       a. Can you confirm that this is, in fact, the case? The \n     reporting of adverse outcomes associated with the use of \n     medical devices is a requirement set forth in the Code of \n     Federal Regulation, Title 21, Section 803. This requirement \n     was not followed by the manufacturers, practitioners, \n     hospitals, or specialty organizations.\n       b. Is there any role for the FDA, the HHS Office of \n     Inspector General or the United States Congress to inquire \n     and hold FDA, the device manufacturers or the gynecological \n     specialty organizations accountable for the loss of life in \n     the United States?\n       Thank you in advance for you diligent and timely reply.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mike Fitzpatrick,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/17/house-section/article/H4489-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL\n\n\n revisions to the allocations of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 2015.\n     Hon.
