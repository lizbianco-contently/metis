The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, on the campus of Umpqua \nCommunity College in Roseburg, Oregon, nine innocent men and women lost \ntheir lives. They were killed, as so many have been this year in \ncommunities across our country, because a person with evil in their \nheart was able to get his hands on a gun.\n  This horrific event was the 294th mass shooting that we have seen in \n2015, more than any other country in the world. So far this year, we \nhave mourned nine parishioners who were killed during Bible study at \ntheir church in Charleston, South Carolina; two women who were killed \nand nine others who were injured at a movie theater in Lafayette, \nLouisiana; and a local television reporter and her cameraman who died \ncovering a story outside Lynchburg, Virginia.\n  But there were thousands of other victims of gun violence. Their \ndeaths have garnered less media attention, but they too deserve to have \ntheir stories told.\n  In the United States this year, more than 10,000 people have died and \nmore than 20,000 have been injured during an incident that involved a \ngun. Each day an average of 92 Americans are killed in an incident \ninvolving a gun.\n  Yesterday the victims included the supervisor of a food market in \nHouston who was killed by a disgruntled employee; a 21-year-old father \nof two in Louisville; and a 23-year-old man and an 18-year-old woman \nwho were killed outside New Orleans during a drive-by shooting. \nAltogether, nearly 1.5 million Americans have lost their lives to gun \nviolence since the year 1970.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt that every one of my colleagues in this \nChamber has spent much of the last few days thinking about and praying \nfor the victims in Oregon and their families. I know I have.\n  But to put it bluntly, our thoughts and prayers aren't good enough, \nnot for those who have already been killed and not for the 92 Americans \nwho are going to lose their lives today, tomorrow, and every day until \nwe do something.\n  Thoughts and prayers won't bring back the innocent men, women, and \nchildren who have been killed or heal the families that have been torn \napart. Thoughts and prayers are no excuse for inaction and cowardice in \nthe face of powerful special interests.\n  It is on all of us to do better than thoughts and prayers. It is long \npast time to take actions to reduce the threat of gun violence and to \ndo all we can to protect our constituents from the ravages of this \nepidemic.\n  Earlier this year I introduced a package of three bills to get to the \ncore of our country's problem with gun violence by focusing on keeping \nguns from children, criminals, and those who are severely mentally ill \nsuch that possession of a firearm would pose a threat to themselves or \nothers.\n  The End Purchase of Firearms by Dangerous Individuals Act, H.R. 2917, \nrequires that States provide information to the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System on individuals who are committed to a \nmental institution or make a threat of violence to a mental health \nprofessional that demonstrates that this individual would present a \ndanger to himself or others if armed with a gun.\n  The Fire Sale Loophole Closing Act, H.R. 2916, ends the practice by \nwhich Federally licensed gun dealers who lose their licenses for \nmisconduct can convert their entire inventory to a ``personal \ncollection'' in order to liquidate it without conducting background \nchecks on their customers. Under the law, such dealers could transfer \ntheir inventory only to other properly licensed Federal gun dealers.\n  I also introduced a resolution, H. Con. Res. 59, to support the goals \nof National ASK Day, which falls on June 21 each year. National ASK Day \nencourages parents to ask other parents whether their children are \nplaying in a house with an unlocked gun.\n  In the United States, 1.7 million children are in homes with loaded, \nunlocked guns. This initiative is supported by Head Start, the American \nPublic Health Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n  In addition to these measures that I have introduced, I have also co-\nsponsored the Large Capacity Ammunition\n\n[[Page H6798]]\n\nFeeding Device Act to ban the sale of large-capacity magazines and \nDenying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act to prohibit \nindividuals suspected of ties to terrorist organizations from \npurchasing a gun, and H.R. 2380 and H.R. 3411, which fix our broken \nbackground check system.\n  Any of these bills would immediately improve public safety in this \ncountry, a country that sees its citizens die at the hands of a loaded \ngun 297 times more than in Japan, 49 times more than in France, and 33 \ntimes more than in Israel.\n  Any one of these rational, commonsense proposals would immediately \nmake life safer for men, women, and children in cities and towns across \nAmerica; yet, we are going to sit on our hands because Republican \nleaders would rather genuflect before the National Rifle Association \nthan do anything that could help save the lives of thousands of \nAmericans.\n  The last time this institution passed a major bill to prevent gun \nviolence was November 10, 1993, when the House approved the Brady \nHandgun Violence Prevention Act and President Clinton signed it into \nlaw.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will end by saying I do not know what it will take for \nus to finally take action. But I do know what I will do. I will \ncontinue speaking out every week on the floor of this Chamber until we \nget something done that makes our communities safer and honors the \nlives of all the victims who have lost their lives in this country to \ngun violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6798-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICA MUST STAND FIRM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Abraham) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I just wrote on the board that it has been \n1,510 days since the President said that Syria's Bashar Assad must go. \nHe is still in office.\n  It is 767 days since the President drew the red line in the sand that \nsaid, if Bashar Assad used chemical weapons on his own people, he must \ngo. He is still in office.\n  What we are seeing in Syria--the refugees' humanitarian crisis, a \nbloody civil war, the rise of ISIS--is a direct response to this \nadministration's ineptness to handle these problems.\n  Now we have Russia's Putin on the floor of the U.N.--on U.S. soil--\nsaying America is weak. But we didn't need Putin to tell us that by his \nwords. He has done it by his actions. He invaded Crimea in Ukraine \nbecause he knew that this administration would draw another red line, \nbut do nothing about it.\n  America is losing her standing in the world because we would rather \nappease our enemies than show strength. This administration still has \nno strategy handling ISIS, no tangible plan to handle the Syrian \nproblem or defeating Assad, and certainly no plan to deal with Russia's \nnew very powerful aggression in many areas of the world.\n  Assad must go. ISIS must be defeated. America must stand firm and \nshow the world that we are a force to be reckoned with, not to be \ntrampled on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6798-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CELEBRATING THE LIVES OF BEN KUROKI AND SUSUMU ``SUS'' ITO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nHawaii (Mr. Takai) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the lives of two \ntrailblazers for the Asian American community, Ben Kuroki and Susumu \n``Sus'' Ito.\n  After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Kuroki and his brother were one of \nthe first Japanese Americans to enlist in the United States Air Force \nduring World War II at a time when over 100,000 other Japanese \nAmericans were forced into incarceration camps without due process \nunder the law.\n  The need for aerial gunners was high; so, Kuroki applied for the job, \nwas approved, and was sent to a 2-week course in Britain. Kuroki \nreceived on-the-job training. His maiden flight was on December 13, \n1942.\n  During this time of heavy discrimination against Japanese Americans, \nKuroki's flight crew was instrumental in protecting him from the sneers \nand abuse by his fellow soldiers.\n  Kuroki received three Distinguished Flying Cross medals for \nvolunteering to fly 25 combat missions against Germany and 28 missions \nin the Pacific. He was the only Japanese American to serve as an aerial \ngunner in the Asia-Pacific theater during World War II.\n  The son of Japanese immigrant farmers, Kuroki was born on May 16, \n1917, in Gaithersburg, Nebraska.\n  After his many missions in Europe, Kuroki visited other Japanese \nAmericans behind barbed wire to promote the military and asked other \nJapanese Americans to join what would soon become the 442nd Regimental \nCombat Team of the 100th Infantry Battalion.\n  Ben Kuroki exemplified the embodiment of patriotism and service above \nself. He often said, ``I had to fight for the right to fight for my own \ncountry, and now I feel vindication.''\n  Today I rise to share Ben Kuroki's tremendous accomplishments and \ndedicated public service with the House of Representatives. Ben Kuroki \nwas the definition of an American hero.\n  I would also like to take this time to recognize another \nextraordinary trailblazer for the Japanese American community, Susumu \n``Sus'' Ito.\n  Ito, the oldest and only son of Japanese immigrants, was drafted into \nthe military in 1940. After Pearl Harbor, his parents and his sister \nwere sent to the incarceration camp in Rohwer, Arkansas. During this \ntime, he volunteered to become a forward observer for the 442nd \nInfantry Battalion, one of the most dangerous positions in the \nbattalion.\n  Known as mischievous, he brought with him to Europe an Agfa Memo, a \ncontraband 35-millimeter camera that fit right in the palm of his hand. \nIto spent his deployment in Europe, starting in 1944 until the war \nended, taking pictures of his surroundings.\n  From playing chess during downtime to posing with the Colosseum \nduring their trek into Rome, he spent the war revealing the daily lives \nof this little known mostly Japanese American unit.\n  However, many of Ito's pictures also accurately depicted the \nbrazenness of war. The 442nd was one of the first battalions to reach \nthe Dachau Concentration Camp, and Ito took pictures of dazed prisoners \nleaving the camp for the very first time. He also captured the despair \nof his fellow soldiers as they rescued the Lost Battalion.\n  After World War II and through the GI Bill, he started an \nextraordinary career as a cellular biologist and became a researcher \nand professor at Harvard Medical School, where he worked for over 50 \nyears.\n  Ito donated his vast collection, thousands of images, to the Japanese \nAmerican Museum in Los Angeles, as part of their Before They Were \nHeroes: Sus Ito's World War II Images collection.\n  In August, I had the opportunity to tour this exhibit. The images he \ncaptured constantly reminded me of the courage of our Japanese American \nGIs who fought valiantly for our country while their families remained \nbehind barbed wire.\n  Today I rise to share Sus Ito's tremendous accomplishments and \ndedicated public service with the House of Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6798-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6798-H6799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n            LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Nation saw \na very important program expire, the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nI rise today to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin with me and call for a vote on a full and continued permanent \nreauthorization of the LWCF.\n  For 50 years, this critical fund has added value to my district and \nto so many across the Nation. Last week, inaction by Congress led to \nthe expiration of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and I believe \nit is critical that we renew our commitment to the fund.\n  The fund helps our communities protect critical lands by providing \nState and local governments with necessary funding and flexibility to \ndevelop and improve the very land on display for\n\n[[Page H6799]]\n\neveryone to enjoy. Nowhere is it more critical than in my home State of \nPennsylvania.\n  Over the past 50 years, Pennsylvania has received approximately $300 \nmillion in land and water conservation funding for protection in many \nareas of national significance, such as Gettysburg National Military \nPark, the Paoli Battlefield, the Brandywine Battlefield, Valley Forge \nNational Historical Park, and John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Not only have we seen the LWCF at work on the State level, we have \nalso seen its benefits at the local level, including the Birdsboro \nWaters Forest Legacy Project, protecting critical woodlands at the East \nCoventry Wineberry Estates, expanding Shaw's Bridge Park in East \nBradford Township, and enhancing the Pottstown Borough Memorial Park \nwith a new dog park, pavilions, restrooms, ballfields, and walking \ntrails.\n  The outdoor recreation industry, Governors, mayors, sportsmen, small-\nbusiness owners, conservation leaders, landowners, ranchers, farmers, \nand millions of Americans are united in a push for permanent \nreauthorization and full funding of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund because it provides an economic benefit to our region and across \nthe country. The LWCF gives a boost to the $646 billion recreation \neconomy and serves to protect our national parks and other public lands \nfrom being destroyed.\n  Indeed, in one such study, the Outdoor Industry Association has found \nthat outdoor active recreation generates $21.5 billion annually in \nconsumer spending in Pennsylvania alone. Outdoor recreation supports \nover 219,000 jobs across the State and generates $7.2 billion in wages \nand salaries. It also produces $1.6 billion annually in State and local \ntax revenue.\n  Outdoor recreation benefits the Pennsylvania economy. The U.S. Census \nBureau reports that each year over 5.4 million people participated in \nhunting, fishing, and wildlife watching in Pennsylvania, contributing \n$5.4 billion to the State economy.\n  Additionally, the Land and Water Conservation Fund State Assistance \nProgram provides matching grants to help States and local communities \nprotect parks and recreation resources. Nationwide, the LWCF has \nbenefited countless counties in America, supporting over 41,000 \nprojects.\n  The State assistance 50-50 matching program acts as the primary \ninvestment tool to ensure that all can enjoy hiking, biking, running \ntrails, community parks, and playgrounds. Approximately $4 billion in \nLWCF grants have been awarded to States, including $4.27 million for 34 \ntotal projects in Berks County, $4.78 million for 30 total projects in \nChester County, $2.8 million for 49 total projects in Montgomery \nCounty, and over $800,000 for 11 projects in Lebanon County. These are \nall counties in my congressional district.\n  Our public lands and outdoor recreation areas are an integral part of \nour heritage, civic identity, and local community. I believe the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund is one of our most important conservation \nprograms and an excellent example of a bipartisan commitment to the \nsafeguard of our natural resources and cultural heritage, and we must \nreauthorize it.\n  As an original cosponsor of H.R. 1814 to permanently reauthorize the \nLWCF, I look forward to working with my colleagues to preserve our \npublic lands so that current and future generations may continue to \nenjoy and appreciate them year-round.\n  I respectfully call upon my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to work for a \nbipartisan solution to reauthorize this very important program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6799-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, in recognition of \nHispanic Heritage Month, I would like to recognize the great \nachievement of Latinos within their communities.\n  America has been home to countless numbers of outstanding Latinos \nover time who reflect the best of our community: activists like Cesar \nChavez and Joan Baez; artists like Selena and Carlos Santana; the brave \nwomen and men who have served in our armed services; and, of course, \ntoday's ambitious young DREAMers.\n  Latinos, like all Americans, are committed to building a better and \nstronger future for our country and within our communities. We strive \nto instill a culture of hard work, of healthy living, and of academic \nsuccess.\n  Latino families recognize the importance of attaining an education in \ntoday's society. In the past decade, Latinos have worked to cut their \ndropout rate in half, while tripling enrollment in 2- and 4-year \ncolleges.\n  The top degrees that we earn speak to our involvement in community: \nour liberal arts degrees, to help the less fortunate; to heal the sick \nwith our healthcare degrees; to create employment with our business \ndiplomas.\n  In regards to health care, with the landmark Affordable Care Act, a \nrecord 2.6 million new Latinos are signed up for health care, and they \nare on track to leading healthier lives.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, even with these great advances in our communities, \nthere is still so much work to be done. Although our dropout rate is \nlower, we still have the highest dropout rate among all ethnic groups. \nLatinos have increased their scores in math and science, but we are \nstill below the national average. And while our communities have made \nmassive strides in putting our children in college, still only 15 \npercent of college degrees are in the hands of Latinos, again, the \nsmallest percentage of any ethnic group.\n  And even while 2\\1/2\\ million new Latinos signed up for health care, \n25 percent of Latinos have no healthcare plan, and we battle high \nobesity and diabetes.\n  So I have seen these issues firsthand in my district and in \nCalifornia and, as a whole, have seen and have worked to improve our \ncondition.\n  This Congress, I introduced the All-Year ACCESS Act, which would \nrestore Pell grants for both full-time and part-time students, giving \naccess to postsecondary education all year-round. Back in my home \ndistrict, I relaunched Enroll OC, adding an additional 2,000 people \nthis year, Latinos in my district, to health care.\n  So while we make these incredible strides in wellness and education, \nthe Latino community still has so many issues to address. I will tell \nyou this: the problems are not just Latino problems; they are problems \nfor the United States because, you see, America is a family. It is a \nfamilia, and we have to address these issues together because, for the \nfirst time in my beautiful home State of California, the largest \nmajority ethic group is now Latino.\n  And you know what? This should not frighten people, Mr. Speaker. I \nthink it is actually pretty exciting because the Latino community is so \nembedded in the success of the American Dream, and the American Dream \nis so embedded in us. We are not aliens, Mr. Speaker. We are doctors, \nlawyers, community leaders, social workers, laborers, and DREAMers. But \nmore importantly, we are sons, daughters, parents, siblings, and we are \nneighbors.\n  It is time for the United States as a whole to embrace the power and \nthe potential of the Latino community and to realize that we share the \ncommon goal of furthering the greatness of this Nation. I believe as \nsoon as we realize Latinos yearn to share the same American values and \naspirations as so many descendants of other immigrant groups--of \nItalian Americans and Irish Americans and German Americans and Asian \nAmericans and all Americans--certainly America will thrive.\n  Latinos are finding their voice, and America needs to listen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6799-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, today, I note with great concern the \ndivisive involvement of Russian forces in Syria. Due to the failure of \nthis administration to articulate a strategy, Russia has now stepped in \nto conduct its own strategy, including airstrikes.\n  United States adversaries have picked up on the administration's lack \nof a well-articulated strategy in Syria. Sources say that Russian \nforces are launching deliberate airstrikes on Syrian groups backed by \nthe CIA. While conducting these contentious attacks, Russia has \nviolated Turkish airspace.\n  NATO has warned President Putin to halt the airstrikes, but where is \nPresident Obama with his warnings? If sources are accurate, the \nadministration has abandoned CIA-backed fighters. President Obama is \nfearful of taking the necessary steps. But given his failings in the \nregion, is anyone surprised by Russia's actions?\n  This unrest contributes to the growing refugee crisis, putting a \nstrain on our own country and others to manage the influx of refugees \nfleeing the turmoil that this administration has helped to create.\n  As warned in Proverbs 28:19, ``Where there is no vision, the people \nperish.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6800-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REPUBLICANS' CALENDAR OF CHAOS\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, well, last week 151 Republicans, a majority \nof the Republicans in Congress, voted to shut down the Federal \nGovernment. This week, another entry into this calendar of chaos and \ndysfunction. We are coming up on several crucial deadlines, and so far \nthe Republican leadership in Congress has presented no clear plan, no \npath forward.\n  As we approach another debt limit, there are questions as to whether \nthe United States Government will default on its obligations. There is \nanother highway funding expiration, another government funding deadline \nof December 11, and lack of the reauthorization of the Export-Import \nBank, which is costing the United States jobs--thousands of jobs.\n  The American people are frustrated, and rightfully so.\n  We may not agree on this floor, we may not agree with the majority, \nbut there is no excuse for not getting your job done. That is what I \nhear from the people back home, from the American people, a simple \nquestion: Why can't Congress just do its work, just do its job?\n  We stand ready to work with Republicans. We need a willing partner. \nThere is a lot of work to do for the American people. Let's get down to \nbusiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6800-7", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SYRIAN REFUGEES AND THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT\n\n  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN.

How can we verify these refugees do not \npresent a threat to our national security? Syria has proven to be a \nfertile recruiting ground for Islamic extremists and terrorists.\n  Second, the Office of Refugee Resettlement has not been transparent \nand accountable enough to handle the transfers. Over the past year, I \nhave been investigating ORR and found that they have not been filing \nannual reports on their activities as required by law. In addition, \nthere is evidence of widespread abuse of refugees, including children, \nwho are improperly handled by the ORR. In many instances, a failure to \nrefer the abuse to the FBI has allowed child abusers to walk free.\n  The curtain must be pulled back completely on the ORR's operations \nbefore we can trust it with a responsibility as serious as settling \nSyrian refugees in the U.S. We must find the delicate balance and \nprotect our safety and security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6800-8", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6800-H6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENT AMENDING THE AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY \n BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC--MESSAGE \n      FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H.

The \nSupplementary Agreement, signed at Prague on September 23, 2013, is \nintended to modify a certain provision of the Agreement on Social \nSecurity between the United States of America and the Czech Republic, \nwith Administrative Arrangement, signed at Prague on September 7, 2007, \nand entered into force January 1, 2009 (the ``U.S.-Czech Social \nSecurity Agreement'').\n  The U.S.-Czech Social Security Agreement as amended by the \nSupplementary Agreement is similar in objective to the social security \nagreements already in force with most European Union countries, \nAustralia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Norway, and the Republic of Korea. \nSuch bilateral agreements provide for limited coordination between the \nUnited States and foreign social security systems to eliminate dual \nsocial security coverage and taxation, and to help prevent the lost \nbenefit\n\n[[Page H6801]]\n\nprotection that can occur when workers divide their careers between two \ncountries.\n  The Supplementary Agreement amends the U.S.-Czech Social Security \nAgreement to account for a new Czech domestic health insurance law, \nwhich was enacted subsequent to the signing of the U.S.-Czech Social \nSecurity Agreement in 2007. By including the health insurance law \nwithin the scope of the U.S.-Czech Social Security Agreement, this \namendment will exempt U.S. citizen workers and multinational companies \nfrom contributing to the Czech health insurance system, when such \nworkers otherwise meet all of the ordinary criteria for such an \nexemption.\n  The U.S.-Czech Social Security Agreement, as amended, will continue \nto contain all provisions mandated by section 233 of the Social \nSecurity Act and other provisions that I deem appropriate to carry out \nthe purposes of section 233, pursuant to section 233(c)(4) of the \nSocial Security Act.\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report required \nby section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act on the estimated number \nof individuals who will be affected by the Supplementary Agreement and \nits estimated cost effect.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2091. My friend and \ncolleague, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), has worked hard to \nbuild significant bipartisan support for this commonsense legislation. \nIt passed out of the Committee on Financial Services with a vote of 56-\n2.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember that most child support \npayments are collected from noncustodial parents through income \nwithholding. In order to verify income, assets, and debt for purposes \nof establishing or enforcing child support obligations, State and local \nchild support agencies and courts often request consumer reports from \nthe consumer reporting agencies.\n  State and local child support agencies argue that the 10-day notice \nprovision provides obligors with an opportunity to hide savings and \nother assets, run up credit card debt, and take other financial or \nemployment actions to avoid or reduce child support payments.\n  This bill authorizes a consumer reporting agency to furnish a \nconsumer report in response to a request by the head of a State or \nlocal child support enforcement agency if the requestor certifies that \nthe report is needed for enforcing a child support order, award, \nagreement, or judgment. The bill also repeals the requirement of 10 \ndays' prior notice to a consumer whose report is requested.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense piece of legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I support H.R. 2091, the Child Support Assistance Act, because it \nwill help child support enforcement agencies do their job and will make \nchild support payments more efficient.\n  When a State child support enforcement agency wants to locate a \nparent who is delinquent on his or her child support payment, the \nagency requests the parent's consumer report from one of the consumer \nreporting agencies. This allows the agency to verify the parent's \nemployment and income, which are key factors for child support \npayments.\n  Current law, however, requires the agency to provide the delinquent \nparent 10 days' notice before it can even request the consumer report \nfrom the credit bureaus. This 10-day head start serves no legitimate \npolicy purpose. In fact, the only thing it does is give delinquent \nparents time to manipulate their financial position to evade paying \ntheir child support obligations.\n  The consequences of this 10-day notice requirement is that some \ndelinquent parents who should be paying child support are not paying \nall they owe and the money they do pay isn't\n\n[[Page H6802]]\n\ngetting to the families as quickly as it should.\n  This bill would eliminate this loophole by doing away with the 10-day \nnotice requirement. Providing 10 days' notice before pulling someone's \nconsumer report might make sense in some circumstances, but in this \nsituation, it only slows down the wheels of justice and gives \ndelinquent parents an opportunity to further avoid paying their child \nsupport obligations.\n  I support this bill that was reported out almost unanimously, with \nonly two people voting against it. I would like to thank the gentleman \nfrom Maine (Mr. Poliquin) as well as Mr. Ellison on the Democratic side \nfor their hard work on this commonsense bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaine (Mr. Poliquin). He has worked tirelessly on this piece of \nlegislation. I appreciate his efforts.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this \ntime. I am thrilled to stand before the House today as the author of \nthe Child Support Assistance Act, H.R. 2091.\n  Across America today we have 17 million kids coast to coast who \nbenefit from the child support program. In our great State of Maine \nalone, there are some 57,000 kids who need our help. As a single parent \nmyself, I believe that the most important job in the world is taking \ncare of our kids. Unfortunately, not every parent believes that.\n  After a court determines that a noncustodial parent owes financial \nsupport for his or her children, there currently is, as Mrs. Maloney \nstated, a 10-day waiting period between the time when the court \ndetermines that money is owed for the kids and when the State agencies \ncan start collecting that money. As a result, here across America there \nis about $100 billion in unpaid child support. In the State of Maine \nalone, there is over $500 million that is owed our kids.\n  This bill, H.R. 2091, the Child Support Assistance Act, fixes a \ntechnical part of this law that is a commonsense fix. As Mrs. Maloney \nstated, it removes this 10-day waiting period.\n  Now, what that simply means is that a parent who is supposed to be \nresponsible for his or her children will have less of an opportunity, \nless time to shift those assets or hide those assets, put them in the \nname of someone else or maybe even quit his or her job and be paid \nunder the table.\n  That is not right, and that is certainly not fair. We need in this \nChamber Republicans and Democrats to stand up and be compassionate and \nto help those 17 million kids across our country that need this \nsupport.\n  As a single parent myself, I know what it is like to work a demanding \nfull-time job and to care for a child. In my case, it was one child, my \nson. I know what it is like to pick up my son after school and then to \nrush off to the grocery store to do our shopping and get home quickly \nso I can start dinner and he can start working on his homework. When \nthat is done, we have to clean up and I expect Sammy to do his reading \nor I read to him and then it is a bath and to bed.\n  Then while you are working on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for \nthe next day and thinking about what you have to do with your own job, \nyou get a few hours' sleep after that before you have to do it all over \nagain.\n  I cannot imagine, Mr. Speaker, what it must be like for a single mom \nor dad to do this with two, three, or four kids. The last thing our \nsingle parents need is to worry about child support payments that they \nare rightly owed, that the court says they are due, to help their kids \nhave food on the table or buy a new pair of winter boots or to make \nsure there is lunch money the next day.\n  In this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, we speak about a lot of things--debt \nand spending and national security issues--but this bill is so close to \nthe ground that it directly and immediately will help our kids and our \nsingle parents who are trying to raise our kids under very difficult \ncircumstances for a lot of them.\n\n  I am thrilled to offer this bill, Mr. Speaker. I am greatly \nappreciative of the tremendous bipartisan support. I do thank Mr. \nEllison for all of his hard work on this bill. I encourage everybody to \nplease support the Child Support Assistance Act.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no further \nspeakers. I just urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill \nthat Mr. Poliquin pointed out can make a real difference in the lives \nof single parents and their children. Again, I thank him for his \nleadership on it and his very eloquent statement today on the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, too many children grow up \nin today's society without basic essentials: food, clothing, proper \nshelter. Many times this is the result of a lack of child support \npayments from an estranged parent.\n  I have a young boy, and I can tell you he takes a lot of energy out \nof my wife and me. We do everything we can to support him to our \nfullest with love and all the basic essentials, but not all children \nare that lucky. Some are due child support payments that they don't \nreceive.\n  I know our local district attorneys do a lot in furtherance and \nsheriff's departments do a lot in furtherance of collecting those child \nsupport payments, but Congressman Poliquin's commonsense measure here, \nthe Child Support Assistance Act, is going to help State and local \nenforcement agencies aid families in collecting child support payments \nin a timely manner.\n  How is that going to happen? It is going to allow enforcement \nagencies to obtain consumer reports on negligent parents in a more \nexpeditious manner. Consequently, that is going to streamline the \nprocess and better enforce the collection of child support payments.\n  I believe Representative Poliquin stated it very eloquently just a \nmoment ago. This is something that we can all get behind. It is for the \ngood of this country.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in\n\n[[Page H6803]]\n\nwhich to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous \nmaterial on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Tipton for his hard \nwork in advocating for community bank regulatory relief. This is a \ncommonsense regulatory relief measure that has earned significant \nbipartisan support. It was reported out of the Financial Services \nCommittee by a vote of 58-0.\n  This legislation is designed to allow additional well-managed \nfinancial institutions to qualify for an 18-month exam cycle. The \nlonger exam cycle permits community banks to focus their time and \nresources on the surrounding community rather than on the exam process. \nThis bill also allows bank examiners to spend their resources working \nwith banks that need additional attention instead of with banks that \nare already considered well managed.\n  To qualify, an institution must have total assets of less than $1 \nbillion, and at its most recent examination, it must have earned an \n``outstanding'' or ``good'' rating under the Uniform Financial \nInstitutions Rating System, or CAMELS. So only smaller, well-financed, \nwell-rated financial institutions who pose very little risk would \nqualify for extended exam cycles.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1553, the Small Bank Exam Cycle Reform Act. \nThis bill allows more small banks to qualify for a longer, 18-month \nexam cycle. This means that these banks would only have a full, onsite \nexamination every 18 months, rather than every 12 months.\n  The logic behind this bill is simple: small community banks that are \nboth well capitalized and well managed do not need as much regulatory \nscrutiny as larger, more complex banks. In addition, regulators need \nthe ability to focus their limited resources on the banks that present \nbigger risks. That is why we have long allowed well-run small banks to \nhave less frequent examinations than larger, more complex banks.\n  This bill simply increases the threshold for banks that qualify for \nthe 18-month cycle from $500 million to $1 billion. Onsite examinations \nare time-consuming endeavors both for the regulator and the bank, and \nif the regulator is conducting exams of these well-run banks more \nfrequently than he really needs to, then he is wasting precious \ngovernment resources. In addition, he is also wasting the bank's \nresources, because the frequent exams require the time and attention of \nthe bank's executives and staff, and it is costly. Therefore, banks \nwith assets between $500 million and $1 billion that are well \ncapitalized and well managed will receive real, meaningful regulatory \nrelief as a result of this bill.\n  Not only is this bill supported by small banks, it is also supported \nby the regulators. The OCC has in fact advocated for this change for \nsome time now.\n  I am very glad that we are moving this bill through the House today, \nand I hope that the Senate will act quickly on the bill as well so that \nwe can get regulatory relief to some very deserving community banks. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I congratulate my colleague, Lacy Clay, for also being the lead \nDemocrat and working very hard on this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, community banks are a crucial source of \ncredit for many across the Nation, but these banks are currently facing \nan ever-increasing regulatory burden that they can no longer shoulder. \nThese misguided regulations are resulting in a devastating impact on \nsmall banks, forcing consolidation or failure and stifling creation of \nnew banks in communities that need access to credit.\n  In rural areas, such as my district in western Colorado, oftentimes \nthe only access to credit for small businesses is a community bank. \nUnfortunately, rising compliance costs and complicated regulatory \nrequirements have dried up bank credit for those in need of it most.\n  For these reasons, I introduced, along with Representative Lacy Clay \nand Representative Barr, the Small Bank Exam Cycle Reform Act, a \ntargeted relief effort designed to allow additional well-managed \nfinancial institutions to qualify for an 18-month exam cycle.\n  Full-scope, onsite examinations of insured depository institutions \nare a rigorous event for banks of all sizes, especially small banks \nthat may not have dedicated compliance staff. These examinations \nrequire significant preparation leading up to the examination, as well \nas attention to the onsite examiner during the exam itself.\n  Whereas larger banks can absorb the work hours and compliance costs \nassociated with these onsite examinations, community banks, much \nsmaller institutions, do not have the economy of scale to deflect the \nburden. However, a longer exam cycle permits well-run community banks \nto focus their time and resources on the surrounding community rather \nthan on the exam process, opening up opportunities for sustainable \neconomic growth in towns across the United States.\n  The Small Bank Exam Cycle Reform Act amends the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Act to increase the qualifying asset threshold from $500 \nmillion to $1 billion for small banks. This relief measure is only for \nwell-managed community banks that did not cause the financial crisis \nbut are now living with regulatory blowback.\n  As part of the examination process, financial regulators rate \nfinancial institutions on several criteria, including safety and \nsoundness and their compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. \nTo qualify for the 18-month exam cycle, an institution must have earned \nan outstanding or good rating on their most recent examination. Only \nsmaller, well-rated banks, those which pose little risk, can qualify \nfor extended exam cycles.\n  The banking regulators also support an increase in the qualifying \nasset threshold. In February, the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency sent draft legislative ideas for regulatory relief to the \nHouse Financial Services Committee, including a proposal that is the \nframework for H.R. 1553. The Comptroller of the Currency, Thomas Curry, \npublicly stated such a change would reduce burdens on well-managed \ncommunity institutions. It also was applauded by the FDIC and the OCC \nduring committee hearings earlier this spring.\n  Not only will this legislation provide relief for community banks, it \nwill also allow examiners to focus their resources, working with banks \nthat need the additional attention or present supervisory concerns.\n  This bipartisan legislation enjoys the support of the American \nBankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers Association, the \nConference of State Bank Supervisors, the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Council, as well as 19 bipartisan cosponsors. The \nlegislation was voted out of the Financial Services Committee with a \nunanimous 58-0 vote.\n\n  Congress last raised the threshold for outstanding-rated institutions \nin 2006 and granted agencies discretion to increase the threshold for \ngood-rated institutions in 2007. It is time again to raise the \nthreshold in statute so these small banks can continue to serve their \nimportant purpose in our communities: providing capital for small \nbusiness growth and banking products for their local communities.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes \nto the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), who is also the ranking \nmember on the Financial Institutions Subcommittee and the lead Democrat \non this bill.\n  Mr. CLAY. Let me thank my colleague from New York for yielding.\n  I, too, rise today to support H.R. 1553, the Small Bank Exam Cycle \nReform Act. I would also like to commend the gentleman from Colorado \n(Mr. Tipton) as well as Mr. Barr for their leadership on this important \nissue.\n  The overwhelming majority of banks in this country are community \nbanks with less than $1 billion in assets. As\n\n[[Page H6804]]\n\nthe regulatory landscape has evolved for the Nation's financial \ninstitutions since the financial crisis, I have worked with my \ncolleagues on the Financial Services Committee to ensure that our \ncommunity banks are not unduly burdened. H.R. 1553 is a part of that \neffort, as it will extend much-needed relief to Main Street banks by \nallowing well-managed, well-capitalized community banks an opportunity \nto take advantage of an extended 18-month examination cycle.\n  While bank examinations are vital to the safety and soundness of the \nAmerican banking system, the time and resources that banks put into \npreparing for and responding to examinations can be extremely time \nconsuming, particularly for smaller banks with limited staff and \nresources that cannot afford to divert key personnel away from their \ncore business in order to prepare for examinations.\n  H.R. 1553 also allows banking regulators to better allocate their \nresources to financial institutions that warrant additional attention \nand away from community banks that have otherwise demonstrated that \nthey are soundly managed and well capitalized.\n  I have heard from community bankers in Missouri and from across the \ncountry that straightforward, bipartisan, commonsense regulatory relief \nproposals like H.R. 1553 can contribute significantly to community \nbanks' ability to lend to Main Street businesses and reinvest in our \ncommunities.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I yield the gentleman such time \nas he may consume.\n  Mr. CLAY. I look forward to working with Mr. Tipton and my other \ncolleagues on the Financial Services Committee to find additional \nopportunities to enact targeted relief for our community banks, and I \nwould urge my colleagues to adopt H.R. 1553.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense piece of \nlegislation. You talk about bipartisan; when it passes out of your \ncommittee with no opposition, that is bipartisan support. I think that \nsays a lot about how important community banks are to America and how \nimportant this Congress thinks community banks are.\n  The fact is these organizations that are well managed and have good \nratings will only have to get an examination every 18 months. So I \nencourage support for this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1553.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the chairman of the \nFinancial Services Committee--that would be the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Hensarling)--for his leadership in helping to bring a number of \nbills, as we have just seen, to the floor today.\n  I would also like to thank all of my colleagues on the Financial \nServices Committee from both sides of the aisle--obviously, both \nsides--because they have voted unanimously, voted the Disclosure \nModernization and Simplification Act out of committee not just once, \nbut twice, when you include passage last year as well.\n  I would also like to add this legislation passed the House of \nRepresentatives by voice vote in December of 2014.\n  So you ask what is the purpose of this bill, and why is it necessary.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, look, if you step back about eight decades ago, \nCongress made the monumental decision in this country that disclosure, \nopening up, and transparency would be the centerpiece of our Nation's \nsecurities law.\n\n[[Page H6805]]\n\n  See, instead of carving out or creating a merit review system where \nthe Federal Government determined which companies we were allowed to \nput our money into, Congress wisely went down the other road and \ndecided that those decisions would be best made where?\n  Left in the hands of the people, in the hands of the investors \nthemselves, so long as they were provided with a sufficient level of \ndisclosure from publicly traded companies.\n  Unfortunately, over the last eight decades since the securities laws \nwere first put in place, the quarterly and annual reports filed by the \npublic companies have grown, and they have grown in size tremendously, \nlarger and more complex than ever, to the point where now the most \nsophisticated of investors have trouble understanding even the most \nbasic operations and risks of these companies. This has come to be \nknown as the phenomenon of information overload.\n  So to put this in perspective, a recent article in the Wall Street \nJournal noted that the average annual report from public companies is \nnow 42,000 words, a 40 percent increase just from the year 2000 alone \nand even longer than the entire Sarbanes-Oxley bill that passed \nCongress in 2002.\n  Another recent report out of Stanford University found that only 38 \npercent of institutional investors view disclosures about executive \ncompensation as ``easy to understand.''\n  So, if you think about it, if the majority of institutional investors \ncan't understand the disclosure, what chance does the little guy, the \nmom-and-pop investor, have to understand all this?\n  They, of course, have very little chance and can even be harmed by \nthe disclosures that too voluminous and complex reports show.\n  As then-SEC Commissioner Troy Paredes put it way back in 2013, ``If \ninvestors are overloaded, more disclosure actually can result in less \ntransparency and worse decisions, in which case capital is allocated \nless efficiently and market discipline is compromised.''\n  So what would our bill do today? It would rectify the situation.\n  How? One, it would require that the SEC eliminate any outdated or \nduplicative disclosure requirements that are not material to investors \nand, furthermore, to scale disclosures for emerging growth companies \nand small issuers.\n  Two, it will allow issuers to file a summary page of their annual \nreport that will include simply cross-references to the material \nalready included.\n  Three, it would require the SEC to produce a broad study on how best \nto, amongst all the other things, utilize technology in order to \nimprove delivery and presentation systems for disclosure and, also, a \nrequirement that the SEC commence a rulemaking in order to implement \nsome of these ideas that come out of the study.\n  You see, these provisions will help our disclosure regime of the 21st \ncentury while at the very same time address the issue of information \noverload that I mentioned before.\n  If you go back, as part of the JOBS Act, Congress directed the SEC to \nreview its existing disclosure requirements, and it was told to \nidentify ways to make our current disclosure regime less burdensome for \nissuers and for people as investors.\n  While the SEC produced a report a few years ago--2013--that \nidentified a number of obsolete things and duplicative requirements \nthat could be addressed, unfortunately, the agency has yet to act upon \nthem, this despite an ongoing disclosure effectiveness review that has \nso far only produced a concept release.\n  So, at the end, it is important that this Congress come here today \nand act on behalf of all the American investors, all the people in this \ncountry, in order to keep the original intent of our securities laws \nrelevant today and ensure that the effective disclosure remains this \nvery centerpiece of the capital markets.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of this bill. I thank Mr. Garrett for his \nhard work. We worked together on this in the last Congress, and I added \nan amendment to improve the bill in the markup last year.\n  Markets are constantly evolving, and so too must our regulatory \nregime. This is especially true when it comes to reporting requirements \nfor small public companies.\n  The process of scaling and streamlining the reporting requirements \nfor these small companies is something that, in order to keep pace with \nthe ever-evolving marketplace, has historically been revisited roughly \nonce every 10 years. It requires vigilance by the SEC and, also, by \nCongress.\n  The Disclosure Modernization and Simplification Act directs the SEC \nto simplify the reporting requirements for small companies in \nregulation S-K.\n  First, the SEC would be required to revise regulation S-K to take \ncare of any low-hanging fruit, that is, make any improvements to \nregulation S-K that they have already identified as helpful for small \ncompanies.\n  Next, the SEC would conduct a study of the best way to simplify and \nmodernize the disclosure requirements in regulation S-K while still \nproviding all the necessary information to investors and to also make \nspecific detailed recommendations to Congress for how to achieve this.\n  Finally, the bill allows companies to submit a summary page on their \nform 10-K annual reports in order to make these annual reports easier \nto understand by investors.\n  In testimony before the Financial Services Committee last year, \nColombia Professor John Coffee called the idea ``simple and \nunobjectionable'' and said that he ``didn't see how anyone could be \nopposed to it.''\n  I agree that this is a commonsense idea that could make lengthy \nannual reports, which are often hundreds of pages long and difficult to \nnavigate, significantly more investor-friendly.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I thank my colleague, Mr. Garrett, for his leadership. He has worked \non this for several Congresses.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from New York for working with us today and \nalso working with us over the last several years as well, trying to \nmove this along. As you have said and I have said, this is one of those \nproverbial commonsense pieces of legislation.\n  If anyone got confused by all the technical terms that you and I used \nhere, at the end of the day, it means, whether you are a sophisticated \ninstitutional investor or whether you are a mom-and-pop-type investor \nor if you are something in between, you just want to have clarity, you \njust want to understand what all these voluminous, hundreds-of-pages \nannual reports and quarterly reports are.\n  That is what our bill does. It just makes it a little bit simpler and \nthen directs the SEC to go even the step further to develop other ways \nto do so as well.\n  So I look forward to passing this out of this House now for the third \ntime, I believe, send it over to the Senate and, hopefully, get some \naction in the Senate and put it on the President's desk.\n  I encourage Members from both sides of the aisle, once again, out of \nthe House and to the Senate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Garrett) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. \nMaloney) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to again commend the sponsor of this bill, the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), who just joined us, for \nall of his work on this bill and the earlier bills as well and for his \ncontinued work on capital formation issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that the JOBS Act of 2012 has been a \ntremendous success, a huge success, for the American public and the \npublic marketplace.\n  The number of companies that have gone public has risen dramatically \never since the barriers to capital formation that existed for several \nyears have been lifted, if you will, helping to make our capital \nmarkets more attractive to companies and investors in the United States \nand all around the world as well.\n  But the JOBS Act also did something else, somewhat ironically. It \nincluded a number of provisions that helped companies to stay private \nfor a longer period of time.\n  You see, these provisions have allowed pre-IPO companies to expand \ntheir investor base, if you will, and have allowed them to open up the \ndoors to capital that were previously shut out to them.\n  But, you see, as these companies raise more capital and as these \ncompanies issue more shares to investors, it can become even more \ndifficult and even more costly for shareholders to find a willing buyer \nor to exit their position in that company.\n  That is what this bill is all about. That is where H.R. 1839, the \nRAISE Act, would come in. The RAISE Act would build upon the success of \nthe JOBS Act of 2012 by creating an environment, if you will, where \nrestricted securities of pre-IPO companies can be traded in a more \nliquid secondary market, which then could ultimately have the effect of \nlowering the cost of capital for businesses.\n  So the RAISE Act does this how? By codifying the longstanding \nexemption developed by the courts, the SEC, and the securities laws \nthat would provide a means for the resale, if you will, of these \nprivate restricted securities.\n  Now, for those just listening here, this sounds a little bit \ntechnical. Maybe it sounds a lot technical to be effective. But, \nreally, it is a simple fix\n\n[[Page H6807]]\n\nthat could ultimately have the effect of helping literally thousands of \nbusinesses all across this country to do what? To raise more capital \nand put it to use, put it to use to innovating or to hiring more \nemployees.\n  That is at the end of the day exactly the type of bipartisan solution \nour constituents are calling on Congress to implement. I urge all of my \ncolleagues, again, on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1839, which is an excellent example \nof bipartisan compromise that I think we should do more of in this \nbody.\n  I would like to thank Mr. McHenry and Ranking Member Waters for all \nof their work on this bill on which I am pleased to be the lead \nDemocrat.\n  This bill codifies a longstanding rule that has been recognized in \nthe securities law, known informally as rule 4(1)(\\1/2\\), which allows \ninvestors to resell private restricted securities without registering \nwith the SEC.\n  Rule 4(1)(\\1/2\\) has long been recognized by the SEC and has been \nrecognized by the Federal courts on numerous occasions as well.\n  But no one has ever bothered to codify this rule, even though \neveryone is okay with it and supports it, with investors relying on \nthis informal rule.\n  The reason that the SEC and the courts have long recognized this rule \nis that it fully complies with the spirit of the Securities Act of \n1933. These sales are really just transactions between two \nsophisticated investors.\n  As a result, different law firms have different interpretations of \nwhat rule 4(1)(\\1/2\\) requires and the market has become very \nfragmented.\n  So I think it is a very good idea to finally codify rule 4(1)(\\1/2\\) \nso that everyone knows the rules of the road and investors can have \nconfidence that they are complying with the law when they resell \nprivate securities to other sophisticated investors.\n  But this bill doesn't just codify rule 4(1)(\\1/2\\). It actually \nimproves upon it by establishing minimum standards for disclosure, \nmarketing, and a holding period that will protect investors, foster \ntransparency, and make this market even stronger.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  This bill addresses several concerns that we heard from investor \ngroups and regulators:\n  First, it requires that the seller provide the buyer with some basic \ninformation about the company, which ensures that buyers have the \nstandard information they need before making an investment decision.\n  Second, it prohibits bad actors, such as people who have been banned \nfrom the securities industry, from taking advantage of the rule.\n  Third, it prohibits the securities of shell companies from being sold \nunder this new rule, 4(1)(\\1/2\\).\n  So I am pleased that we were able to work together with the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. McHenry) on this bill and that we were able to \nadd these important investor protections because now we have a bill \nthat will enjoy strong bipartisan support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Again, I thank the gentlewoman from New York.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the sponsor of the legislation.\n  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nGarrett), the chairman of the Capital Markets and Government Sponsored \nEnterprises Subcommittee, for yielding time.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the \nranking member of the subcommittee, for working with me on the \nprovisions of the bill we are talking about this afternoon.\n  I also want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine \nWaters), the ranking member of the full committee, for working with us \nto craft this compromise we have on the floor here today.\n  I have joined together with my colleagues from across the aisle to \noffer a Federal exemption from registering for the resale of private \ncompany securities, which is vital for adding liquidity to the \nsecondary markets and driving economic growth.\n  Today private growth companies are not only disrupting existing \nindustries, but are creating entirely new markets. Thanks to private \nmarkets, in particular, the advancement in American technology and \nentrepreneurship is thriving.\n  Funding the growth of these private companies, however, has created a \nparadigm shift. This shift requires our regulatory framework to achieve \na balance between encouraging innovation and growth while ensuring that \nshareholders and investors are protected, and those investor \nprotections need to remain strong.\n  Unfortunately, as successful entrepreneurs and startup employees look \nto sell their private shares in the secondary markets, they encounter a \nregulatory framework that is inefficient. That inefficiency is costly \nand dries up the liquidity of these securities and is harmful to \neconomic growth.\n  Most private secondary transactions rely on a broadly accepted \nexemption known as section 4(1)(\\1/2\\). While widely known and applied, \nsection 4(1)(\\1/2\\) has never been formally codified into securities \nlaw. The result has been a disjointed collection of case law and no-\naction SEC letters that have shaped these private secondary \ntransactions.\n  Our bill attempts to fix this problem. The bill would provide an \nexemption for these types of transactions, allowing startup employees \nthe ability to execute trades in a way that is consistent, clear, and \ncertain.\n  That is why we have Federal securities laws, for that certainty, that \nclarity, and that consistency. It would allow for private companies to \nfind a much better way to raise capital by opening up the secondary \nmarkets.\n  Although the bill is a technical fix, we have worked hard to seek \ncompromise and find commonsense solutions to this complicated \nexemption.\n  While we have negotiated in good faith on this bill, as has the party \nacross the aisle, my goal is to ensure that the language and operation \nof this compromise will work in the real world.\n  Further improvements to the bill may be necessary to fully codify \nexisting uses of that authority, and I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues across the aisle as well as folks in the Senate to clarify \nthe intent here.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with our ranking member of the \nfull Committee on Financial Services, as necessary, to ensure that the \nlaw is a useful tool and serves as an example of how policy can meet \nthe demands of a changing marketplace.\n  The bottom line is this bill is a sensible way forward. This bill \nwill lower costs and provide transparent standards for the issues that \nare important in the private and secondary transactions. Additionally, \nthe bill will give today's private growth companies a foundation on \nwhich they can confidently plan their trajectory through the capital \nmarkets, both private and public.\n  Ultimately, codifying this exemption will ensure the United States \nremains the best market in the world for the world's innovators to \nbuild their businesses here and employ Americans and grow our economy.\n  I am pleased that this legislation enjoys bipartisan support, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have no \nadditional speakers on the floor. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Again I thank the gentlewoman from New York for her support on this \nand the prior legislation, and I thank the gentleman from North \nCarolina.\n  When the gentleman from North Carolina makes a reference to the \nregulations of 4(1)(\\1/2\\), then you know there is something wrong out \nthere that there are just too many obscure regulations that are holding \nback and being impediments to our capital markets.\n  The gentleman from North Carolina also came up with the right \nsummation of this. It is a technical bill to deal with all of these \nabsurdities and technicalities just to make it easier for\n\n[[Page H6808]]\n\npeople to be able to start a business, grow a business, sell a \nbusiness, hire employees, grow capital formation and the number of \nemployees in this country as well.\n  With that being said, I look forward to strong, bipartisan support, \nas we have seen in the past on this type of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1839, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6808-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6808-H6811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM \n                      REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. ROYCE.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     to the Commission $3,500,000 for each of the fiscal years \n     2016 to 2019 to carry out the provisions of this Act and \n     section 4 of the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2015.\n       ``(b) Availability of Funds.--Amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated under subsection (a) shall remain available \n     until the earlier of--\n       ``(1) the date on which they have been expended; or\n       ``(2) the date on which the Commission is terminated under \n     section 209.\n       ``(c) Limitation.--In each fiscal year, the Commission \n     shall only be authorized to expend amounts that have been \n     appropriated pursuant to subsection (a) if the Commission--\n       ``(1) complies with the requirements set forth in section 4 \n     of the United States Commission on International Religious \n     Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2015; and\n       ``(2) submits the annual financial report required under \n     section 208(e) to the appropriate congressional \n     committees.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. \nCicilline) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 days to revise and extend and to include any extraneous material \nin the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, tragically, religious persecution around the world \ncontinues. I thought I would give one example that we heard in our \ncommittee last week, the Foreign Affairs Committee, from ``Bozi,'' who \nis a young 20-year-old Yazidi woman from Iraq. She told us the story.\n  She very bravely recounted her brutal captivity and the abuse she \nfaced at the hands of ISIS. As we are talking about religious freedom, \nshe explained that, in her village, the 700 men and boys were killed, \nincluding several of\n\n[[Page H6809]]\n\nher brothers. One small brother survived because he had a bullet in his \nhead and they thought he was dead. But, other than that, her family is \nall gone.\n  She was bought by an American who had been recruited to ISIS about 4 \nyears prior, she said. He bought 10 of the girls, sold 9, and kept her \nas a concubine.\n  She recounted how he explained to her that, because she was a Yazidi, \nshe was an infidel, in his mind, and she was a Pagan, in his mind; and, \ntherefore, he had the right to enslave and rape and sell Yazidi women \nand children, and he does this.\n  After about a year, she escaped. But she reported that there were \nabout 3,000 girls and women in ISIS captivity, Yazidis, who faced the \nsame fate that she faced while she was in that captivity.\n  These crimes are just the latest outrage against people of faith \nwhich continues in so many parts of the world, whether it be against \nYazidis or Christian minorities in the Middle East or the Baha'i in \nIran or religious communities attempting to worship without official \nsupervision by repressive regimes, for example, in Burma or in North \nKorea. Anti-Semitism also is on the rise, including in Europe.\n  This legislation, which was passed unanimously by the Senate last \nweek, will continue the good work of the United States Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom. Congress created this Commission as an \nindependent Federal entity back in 1998.\n  The reason it was created was because, while the fundamental freedom \nof religion was under siege around the world, it did not receive enough \nattention in U.S. foreign policy circles.\n  This Commission is a body of experts who speak out on behalf of \npersecuted believers of any faith and push for accountability, \naccountability beyond what the State Department or the White House may \nview as diplomatically feasible.\n  The Commission's independent voice remains critical today, as the \nState Department too often pushes religious freedom to the side. For \nexample, the State Department's Ambassador at Large for religious \nfreedom sat vacant for 2 years during the start of this administration \nand again for another 10 months before the appointment of the current \nAmbassador, Rabbi David Saperstein.\n  And this year, after a 3-year lapse, the Department finally made the \nlegally required designation of ``Countries of Particular Concern'' for \nreligious freedom, 3 years of the State Department shirking its legal \nresponsibility.\n  But, as the Commission has found, another eight countries should also \nbe placed on that list and were not placed on the list. Those countries \ninclude Vietnam, whose recent so-called amnesty of more than 18,000 \nprisoners included convicted murderers, convicted drug dealers, human \ntraffickers.\n  But what it did not include was prisoners of religious conscience, \nsuch as the Venerable Thich Quang Do of the Unified Buddhist Church of \nVietnam. I have visited him under house arrest. They did not include \nFather Nguyen Van Ly, the Catholic priest who has been repeatedly \nbeaten. These were not the people released. No. It was the human \ntraffickers and the murderers.\n  So this Commission is critical in calling out these abuses.\n  This bill extends the authorization of the Commission for 4 more \nyears and includes new strategic planning and transparency improvements \nin the act. This should ensure that the Commission's important work \nremains strongly bipartisan and represents the diverse American \nconsensus on the importance of our first freedom: religious liberty.\n  I want to thank Senators Corker and Cardin and their colleagues who \nworked to craft this bill, which received unanimous support in the \nother body.\n  I also want to recognize the important work of the chairman of the \nForeign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human \nRights, and International Organizations, the gentleman from New Jersey \n(Mr. Smith), the author of the House side reauthorization bill, who has \nbeen a legislative leader on religious freedom issues throughout his \ncareer.\n  And, as always, I appreciate the cooperation of the ranking member, \nMr. Eliot Engel of New York, and the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. \nCicilline) in bringing this legislation to the floor today.\n  So this bill, which has the unanimous support of the Senate and all \nnine current Commissioners, deserves our support also. With its \npassage, it goes to the President's desk. With his signature, it will \nensure that freedom of religion under continuous threat from extremists \nand authoritarian governments remains front and center.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I rise in strong support of S. 2078.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill will reauthorize the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom, what we call USCIRF, and it deserves \nthis body's strong support.\n  I want to begin by thanking Senator Corker, Senator Cardin, and \nSenator Durbin for the work that they did in pushing this bill on the \nSenate side. I want to thank our chairman, Chairman Royce, and \nRepresentative Chris Smith for his strong leadership here in the House \non matters dealing with religious freedom.\n  This bill, which has been endorsed by all nine of the current \nCommissioners, would reauthorize the Commission for 4 years and require \nthat the Commission agree on a bipartisan strategic plan to be \nsubmitted to Congress within 180 days. Moreover, the Commission will \nalso be required to reach bipartisan agreement on personnel policies, \nwhich I hope they will see as an opportunity, as an organization \ndedicated to promoting freedom and tolerance, to include strong \nnondiscrimination protections for religion, gender, gender identity, \nand sexual orientation, as well as the other federally protected \nclasses.\n  The right to practice religion and worship freely is a bedrock \nprinciple of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, of course, \nof our own Constitution. This Commission on International Religious \nFreedom does so much to defend that liberty, whether through invaluable \nresearch, analysis, and reporting or efforts to guide lawmakers from \nthe United States and elsewhere on the importance of this issue. Yet \nevery day, religious communities around the world endure violence, \npersecution, and discrimination--and the problem, sadly, is escalating.\n  In Nigeria, Christian and Muslim communities live in fear of the \nfanatical terrorist group Boko Haram. In Iran, the regime continues to \npersecute members of the Baha'i faith. In Vietnam, Christians are \narrested and beaten by police. Pakistan has fallen down on the job of \nprosecuting violence against religious minorities, while at the same \ntime convicting religious minorities for blasphemy. And, of course, \npeople of all faiths are being massacred by ISIL as it attempts to wipe \nout any beliefs that don't align with its perversion of Islam.\n  Mr. Speaker, this sort of intolerance has no place in the 21st \ncentury. Governments are obligated to respect the religious freedom of \nall citizens. It is the right thing to do, and it is also in their own \ninterests. After all, when societies are more open, they become more \nprosperous. When citizens live freely without fear of persecution, they \ncontribute more and help drive growth and stability.\n  So the United States wants to see religious freedom thrive around the \nworld. That is why we established the Commission on International \nReligious Freedom, and that is why we should vote today to support the \nCommission's vital continued work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 2078.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith). He worked on the original authorization of the \nReligious Freedom Act, and he is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs \nSubcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and \nInternational Organizations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the chairman for his leadership and \nfor his commitment to human rights, particularly religious freedom, and \nI want to thank Senator Corker for helping to shepherd this legislation \nthrough the\n\n[[Page H6810]]\n\nSenate when there were some contentious issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom \nwas created as part of the landmark International Religious Freedom Act \nof 1998, originally authored by my good friend and former colleague \nFrank Wolf, who provided exemplary service and leadership in this \nHouse.\n  The creation of USCIRF made the promotion and protection of religious \nfreedom a priority of U.S. foreign policy; and believe me, before the \npassage of this law, it was not. Since its inception, USCIRF has been a \nvaluable, independent, and bipartisan source of information and policy \nrecommendations for the Congress, U.S. Government, and the American \npeople.\n  Mr. Speaker, USCIRF gives voice to persecuted religious groups and \nraises prisoner cases, individual cases, at the highest levels of the \nU.S. Government. USCIRF's annual report--and I encourage Members to \nread it--often provides a fuller view of violations of religious \nfreedom than the State Department's International Religious Freedom \nReport. As an independent body, USCIRF has the political freedom to \nreport the facts and provide critical insight and recommendations on \ncountries like Vietnam, Pakistan, India, Cuba, or China, countries \nwhere the U.S. Government may be hesitant to draw attention to \nreligious rights violations because it is concerned about upsetting \nforeign governments.\n  It needs to be noted that in the beginning, the Clinton \nadministration actively opposed passage of the International Religious \nFreedom Act of 1998. I know because I chaired the hearings. We heard \nfrom people like Assistant Secretary John Shattuck, who said it would \ncreate a hierarchy of human rights, which it did not. It put religious \nfreedom in its rightful place. Of course, years later, people from the \nadministration pointed out that none of that happened and it was a very \nimportant addition to our work. I also want to note that a very broad \ncoalition supported and continued to support IRFA in general and USCIRF \nin particular. In the end, President Clinton did sign the legislation \ninto law.\n  The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops endorses USCIRF's \nreauthorization, as do over 80 different nongovernmental organizations \nand religious groups, part of the International Religious Freedom \nRoundtable. These groups sent a letter to every Member of Congress and \nsaid, in pertinent part, ``while there is very little we agree on \ntheologically, or politically, we all agree on the importance of \nreligious freedom.''\n\n  Mr. Speaker, bipartisan cooperation is critically important at a time \nwhen religious freedom is under siege through the world. Anti-Semitism, \npervasive in most of the Middle East, has spread like a cancer to parts \nof Europe. The increase in violence perpetrated against Christians, \nMuslims, and other religious minorities has reached staggering \nproportions, including disturbing reports of torture, rape, \nimprisonment, forced exile, and murder.\n  Mr. Speaker, the world faces a deepening crisis of religious freedom \nrestrictions and abuses by governments. The Pew Foundation estimates \nthat over 75 percent of the world's population lives in countries where \nsevere religious freedom abuses are commonplace. Ancient Christian \ncommunities in Iraq and Syria are on the verge of extinction, and other \nreligious minorities in the Middle East face a constant assault from \nISIS. ISIS, as we all know, has committed and is committing genocide, \nmass atrocities, and war crimes.\n  China continues to suppress religious practice broadly and with \nimpunity. It has been another punishing year for the Tibetan Buddhists, \nUighur Muslims, Christians, as well as Falun Gong practitioners who \nface restrictions, imprisonment, and torture.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Burma is a problem; Rohingya Muslims face \nproblems. In Pakistan, as we all know, there are problems; in Iran, not \njust with the Baha'i who are persecuted again and have been facing that \nwith unrelenting pressure, but also other Christians who live there and \nother Muslims.\n  Mr. Speaker, the need for USCIRF is clear, and I hope all Members \nwill support this important human rights legislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I do not have any more speakers, so I \nyield myself the balance of my time.\n  First, again, I want to thank our chairman, Ed Royce, and our ranking \nmember Eliot Engel for, once again, the bipartisan way in which the \nwork of the Foreign Affairs Committee is conducted, evidenced again \ntoday with strong bipartisan support for this bill. I also want to \nacknowledge the great leadership of Congressman Smith, who has worked \nin this area for a very long time.\n  Mr. Speaker, my home State, Rhode Island, was founded by Roger \nWilliams, searching for a place that respects religious freedom. Rhode \nIsland is home to the oldest synagogue in America, the Touro Synagogue, \nwhere President Washington famously wrote to the Hebrew congregation at \nTouro Synagogue to reassure them that this new, young Nation will be a \nplace that respects religious freedom of all its citizens. It is this \nCommission that continues to promote that work around the world, to \nensure that religious freedom is respected everywhere in the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Before I close, Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs \nSubcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, religious liberty is the first right in our Bill of \nRights, and it is in the First Amendment. There are five rights in the \nFirst Amendment. Religious liberty is the first of those five rights. \nThat is not by accident. Our ancestors believed in the right of \nreligious liberty.\n  In fact, throughout the world today, religious freedom is the most \nimportant personal right for many, many people of all religious \nfaiths--the right to practice one's religion free of persecution \nregardless of what that religion is.\n  Mr. Speaker, Saddique Azam was promoted as the headmaster of an \nelementary school in Pakistan a few months ago. Three Muslim teachers \ndidn't like the fact that they had a Christian as their boss. So, \nyesterday, about 7:45 in the morning, they stormed his office and \ndemanded that he resign because he was a Christian. He refused. They \nbeat him up until he was rescued by some other staff members.\n  Curricula in schools throughout the world are teaching religious \nintolerance. The Saudi school curriculum openly vilifies other faiths, \nincluding Jews and Christians. Not too long ago, there was a 14-year-\nold boy by the name of Ayman Nabil Labib, a Christian in Egypt, a \nCoptic Christian. He went to school. The teacher of his class, a non-\nChristian, saw that he had a cross on his wrist. Coptic Christians I \nunderstand have a tattoo of a cross. He was told to cover up the cross. \nHe did not. In fact, he pulled out a cross from underneath his shirt \nand displayed it as well. The teacher grabbed him around the neck and \nstarted choking him and asked the other students: What are you going to \ndo about this? And they beat him to death--a 14-year-old Coptic \nChristian in Egypt.\n  Persecution happens to all faiths throughout the world.\n  It is the most important, in my opinion, human right, natural right, \nto practice one's faith, religion, and belief freely without \npersecution by government especially. This legislation helps protect \nthat right worldwide. It is an important right here, but, as I said, it \nis a natural right, and it should be protected. I support this \nlegislation because it protects the basic right of religious freedom.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressmen Chris Smith, David Cicilline, and \nJudge Ted Poe.\n  Two weeks ago, we were all here on the floor of the House, and we \nheard\n\n[[Page H6811]]\n\nPope Francis charged with those listening to his remarks of the \nimportant responsibility of safeguarding religious freedom. He stated \nat the White House that that freedom remains one of America's most \nprecious possessions. Of course, that freedom is not only an American \npossession, and it is not only enjoyed by certain religions. That \nfreedom flows from the inherent dignity of every human person and \nshould be protected wherever it is threatened.\n  The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom \nremains a strong, independent, and authoritative voice on behalf of \nreligious believers everywhere. This measure will ensure that it \ncontinues to pursue the Commission's nonpartisan mission of promoting \naround the world the right of religious liberty that we hold so dear as \na nation. It deserves our unanimous support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support a commission which \nembodies the highest of our democratic principles: independence, \nbipartisanship, transparency and the defense of our fundamental \nfreedoms.\n  The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom was \ncreated from a landmark piece of legislation, the 1998 International \nReligious Freedom Act (IRFA).\n  How that bill came about is a story in its own right, and a \ndemonstration of how a diverse set of our nation's leaders can come \ntogether to protect a foundational freedom.\n  One of the best ways to expose attacks on religious freedom is \nmeticulous chronicling of such abuses and then proclaiming them loud \nand clear to a watching world.\n  The importance of USCIRF's mission of monitoring, recording and \npublishing attacks on religious belief--or any belief at all--cannot be \noverestimated.\n  Their annual report is an invaluable reference for my colleagues and \nme and our staffs.\n  Like the TIP report which monitors countries' records on human \ntrafficking, the USCIRF annual report exposes lawbreakers and violators \nof human rights--and recommends what actions should be taken.\n  And we have seen how across the world religious minorities are under \nattack.\n  Christians made up 20 percent of the Middle East population at the \nstart of the 20th century.\n  Given a sustained attack in recent years on Christian belief and \npractice, that number is now around 5 percent and declining.\n  In fact, less than 1 percent of the world's more than 2 billion \nChristians live in the Middle East--the birthplace of the religion.\n  Other religions and belief systems have suffered under sustained \npersecution.\n  Yazidis in Iraq and Syria have been systematically targeted by ISIS \nfor slavery and execution.\n  Just this week, news reports have revealed Yazidi women have taken \ntheir own lives out of despair after repeated rapes and assaults.\n  USCIRF has documented ethnic cleansing of Muslims and sectarian \nviolence in the Central African Republic, and urged the State \nDepartment designate it as a Country of Particular Concern.\n  In Russia, ``serious violations of freedom of religion or belief \ncontinue.''\n  China has taken further steps to ``consolidate'' its ``authoritarian \nmonopoly'' over the lives of its citizens.\n  This has led to ``unprecedented violence'' against Uigher Muslims, \nTibetan Buddhists, Catholics, Protestants, and Falun Gong \npractitioners.\n  And the list goes on and on.\n  An attack on the religious belief of one is an attack on all of us.\n  USCIRF is a unique, independent voice calling the world to pay \nattention and act, especially when this freedom can take a backseat in \nforeign affairs.\n  The world forgets that the chilling of religious belief is the first \nstep toward totalitarian control over all areas of life.\n  All other freedoms flow from religious liberty.\n  Without the freedom to believe what your conscience tells you, and \nlive that belief out without fear of violence or other persecution, all \nother freedoms are meaningless.\n  USCIRF recognizes this reality, and acts in defense of all peoples \neverywhere.\n  I urge the House and reauthorize this important commission, and \ncontinue to defend and promote our First Amendment freedoms around the \nworld.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2078.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6811-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6811-H6813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        AIRPORT ACCESS CONTROL SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. KATKO.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 3102 is a critically important, bipartisan piece of legislation, \nwhich serves as a culmination of months of intense oversight on the \nissue of airport access controls and the insider threat to aviation \nsecurity.\n  The gaps in airport employee access control made headlines after an \ninvestigation revealed that aviation employees were trafficking weapons \nand ammunitions between Atlanta and New York. More than 170 guns were \ntrafficked in such a manner.\n  Furthermore, a recent inspector general report found that TSA failed \nto identify 73 aviation workers with possible links to terrorism. \nLastly, at airports such as Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles \nInternational, and Oakland, many major drug-trafficking rings have been \nuncovered involving employees using their insider ability to access the \nairports.\n  It is the responsibility of this committee to act to prevent similar \nstories from continuing to emerge.\n  Specifically, H.R. 3102 requires TSA to consult with Federal and \nprivate sector partners to review existing employee screening protocols \nand work comprehensively to improve the effectiveness of controls at \nairports across the United States.\n  Moreover, the bill improves standards of vetting for the credentials \ngranted to individuals with access to secure areas of airports and \ntakes a robust approach to bolstering the oversight of the access given \nto these employees.\n  H.R. 3102 codifies a number of recommendations put forward by the \nAviation Security Advisory Committee, which examined the issue of \nairport access controls earlier this year at our urging.\n  This legislation reflects rigorous oversight, including a number of \nhearings, site visits, and briefings from Homeland Security, TSA, the \nFBI, and aviation stakeholders.\n  Furthermore, I am very proud of the cooperation among our private \nsector stakeholders, Federal partners, and the labor community that has \nhelped to bring this bill to the floor today.\n  Throughout this legislation's development, we have worked tirelessly \nwith the same end goal in mind: to enhance the security of our Nation's \nairports and mitigate threats to aviation workers and the traveling \npublic.\n  The insider threat to aviation is real, and it is critical that we \nevolve our security standards and best practices to stay abreast of \nchanging threats to transportation.\n  I wish to thank Ranking Member Rice and Ranking Member Thompson\n\n[[Page H6813]]\n\nfor their hard work and attention to this issue, as we have focused \nheavily on these problems in a bipartisan manner.\n  I also wish the thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. McCaul, \nfor his support on the committee's oversight efforts and for seeing \nthis bill through the committee.\n  Together--together--we can fix these problems and assure the American \npublic that their aviation system is secure and adaptive to changing \nthreats.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3102.\n  Last year we learned that airport employees used their access to the \nsecure areas of airports to bypass screening to smuggle weapons and \ndrugs onto commercial flights.\n  In response, then-Acting Administrator Melvin Carraway requested that \nTSA's stakeholder advisory committee, the Aviation Security Advisory \nCommittee, take on the challenge of evaluating airport access controls \nand come up with approaches to address security vulnerabilities.\n  In April, the ASAC issued a thoughtful report with 28 recommendations \ndesignated to mitigate threats and risks associated with airport access \ncontrols.\n  Congress approved legislation in December 2014 to codify ASAC in law \nin the hopes that it would result in better aviation security \npolicymaking at TSA.\n  We envisioned a process in which various stakeholders throughout the \naviation community were able to come together and address security \nissues affecting the industry. In this instance, the process worked as \nenvisioned, and TSA is making sure and steady progress towards \naddressing many of the recommendations.\n  I believe that, by advancing this bill today, we will send a message \nto TSA and aviation stakeholders that we have a strong interest in \nraising the bar when it comes to securing our Nation's airports.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I simply reiterate that the committee \nremains interested in raising the level of security within our Nation's \nairports. As such, we will continue to track TSA's efforts at \nbolstering access controls and addressing the ASAC's recommendations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the issues addressed in H.R. 3102 are a pressing concern \nto the security of our Nation's airports. It is critical that we send \nthis bill to the Senate today. Congress cannot stand idly by and grant \ntacit approval to lax security standards for employees when we have the \nauthority and responsibility to spur action and keep the traveling \npublic safe from harm.\n  I want to thank Mr. Richmond for his bipartisan comments. That truly \nis the nature of what we have done today, is act in a bipartisan manner \nto attack a problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise to speak on H.R. 3102, the ``Airport Access \nControl Security Improvement Act of 2015,'' which amends the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002 to reform programs of the Transportation Security \nAdministration, and streamline transportation security regulations.\n  The objective of the bill is to establish a risk-based, intelligence-\ndriven model for the screening of employees at airports based on level \nof access and employment positions at domestic airports.\n  The model is intended to ensure that only those individuals \nauthorized to have access to secure areas of a domestic airport are \npermitted such access.\n  The model must be able to differentiate between individuals \nauthorized to have access to an entire secure area and those who are \nnot permitted access.\n  The Director of the FBI and Director of the Aviation Security \nAdvisory Committee are directed to review the disqualifying criminal \noffenses in the Code of Federal Regulations to determine the adequacy \nfor an individual to have continued access to Secure Identification \nDisplay Areas of airports.\n  The review based on the current language of the bill would consider \nwhether the list of disqualifying offenses should be amended to include \nother offenses.\n  As House Judiciary Committee's Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on \nCrime, Terrorism and Investigation, I am concerned that the bill \ncontains this language.\n  At a time when we are discussing the rights of non-violent offenders \nto have an opportunity, if their conduct and records dictate to be able \nto fully reintegration into society, that there may be other efforts to \nmake this process more difficult without a serious review of why such \nmeasures should be taken and for whom should they be applied?\n  I would offer to work with my fellow members on the House Committee \non Homeland Security to consider carefully the reasons for any \nexpansion on this list, especially if the expansion only involves the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  There are similar concerns regarding language in the bill that may \nextend the period of time that may be considered between a particular \nsituation and the life a person is currently leading.\n  Considering behavior of a teenager when considering the conduct of a \n35 year-old adult, the weight of the consideration should be on the \nlife of the adult and the seriousness of the offense.\n  Any new model that may be developed that would impact the \nemployability of current persons who hold access credentials and future \nemployees should be further reviewed by the full committee prior to \nbecoming policy.\n  The bill's goals are important--the House should consider every \naspect of airport security to improve aviation safety.\n  I will continue to work in my capacity on both the House Committee on \nHomeland Security and the House Committee on the Judiciary to improve \naviation security.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3102, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6813-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6813-H6815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3510, the Department of \nHomeland Security Cybersecurity Strategy Act of 2015, sponsored by \nRepresentative Cedric Richmond, ranking member of the Cybersecurity, \nInfrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies Subcommittee, of \nwhich I am the chairman.\n  This legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security to \ndevelop and to submit to Congress a cybersecurity strategy and \nimplementation plan. Because the Department of Homeland Security is \ncharged with securing the dot-gov domain and working with the private \nsector to secure the dot-com domain, a comprehensive strategic plan and \nimplementation plan will support DHS' essential cybersecurity mission.\n  Mr. Speaker, too often these days cyber attacks disrupt the \noperations of government, of businesses, and of the lives of the \nAmerican people. The increasingly sophisticated nature of the cyber \nthreats we face on a daily basis underscore the need to manage and \nstrengthen the cybersecurity of our Nation's critical infrastructure.\n  The Government Accountability Office has recommended the \nimplementation of an overarching Federal cybersecurity strategy. H.R. \n3510 is an important step toward accomplishing this task.\n  H.R. 3510 also precludes any reorganization effort of the Department \nof Homeland Security's National Protection and Programs Directorate, or \nNPPD, without congressional approval. This is an effort to ensure that \ncongressional oversight is conducted.\n  Mr. Speaker, in June of this year, a story in the press announced \nthat the NPPD was planning a significant reorganization. Since June, \nvery few specifics have emerged, and even those that have have been \nvery sparse in detail.\n  The details that have been made public elicit concern because they \nsupport overhauling the infrastructure protection and cybersecurity \nfunctions of the directorate without providing details on exactly what \nthis would mean for the mission, for the structure, or for the \nworkforce of the directorate.\n  The language in this bill follows a bipartisan letter sent just last \nmonth to the Department expressing congressional concern with the lack \nof transparency surrounding this proposed reorganization and \ncommunicating the congressional intent to provide oversight on this \nissue. The letter also clearly stated that any reorganization or \nrealignment should require congressional authorization.\n  Over the past several years, the Committee on Homeland Security, on \nwhich I serve, has built up a collaborative working relationship with \nthe NPPD, consulting with it to pass several strong and bipartisan \npieces of legislation to improve chemical security and to strengthen \nDHS' cybersecurity mission and stature in the Federal Government.\n  Given our shared goal of protecting this country and the committee's \ncontinued legislative oversight efforts to strengthen DHS' \ncybersecurity functions, it is essential that the Department submit any \nproposal to Congress prior to reorganization or realignment.\n  It is Congress' role and responsibility to authorize the key \nresponsibilities of the executive branch to include strengthening our \ncybersecurity posture and ensuring the security and resiliency of our \nNation's critical infrastructure.\n  I would like to thank Mr. Richmond for the work that he and his staff \nhave done to come together in a bipartisan way on this legislation.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3510.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. \nRatcliffe. I want to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. \nMcCaul, and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Thompson, who \nall signed on and support this legislation.\n  H.R. 3510, the Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity Strategy \nAct of 2015, will require the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop \na comprehensive strategy and implementation plan for carrying out its \ndiverse and complex cyber and information security missions.\n  Today the Department of Homeland Security is not only responsible for \nworking with Federal agencies to protect Federal civilian networks, but \nalso for helping to bolster information security within the private \nsector, principally through the National Cybersecurity and \nCommunications Integration Center.\n  It also plays a major role in information security research and \ndevelopment, cyber crime investigations, and international engagement \nwith cybersecurity partners.\n  My bill requires DHS to put in place a strategy that includes \nnecessary strategic and operational goals for executing the Secretary's \nbroad responsibilities.\n\n[[Page H6815]]\n\n  In September, the inspector general issued a report highlighting the \nneed for such strategy. The report, entitled ``DHS Can Strengthen Its \nCyber Mission Coordination Efforts,'' found that intradepartmental \ncoordination was lacking and recommended that the Department develop a \ncomprehensive cross-departmental strategic implementation plan that \ndefines each component's cyber missions and responsibilities.\n\n  The Department operates frontline programs that protect this Nation \nfrom manmade and natural disasters. With cyber threats increasingly at \nthe forefront today, it is essential that all of the Department's day-\nto-day programs, policies, and activities are effective and meeting its \nmulti-layered cybersecurity responsibilities.\n  As the lead Federal agency responsible for securing Federal civilian \nnetworks and as the vital cyber information-sharing partner to national \ncritical infrastructures, it is crucial that the Department have a \ncomprehensive and achievable strategic plan in place.\n  Mr. Speaker, in recent years, Congress has provided significant \nresources to the Department to expand its cyber operations and \nworkforce.\n  A lot of money has been spent to respond to cyber events and \npersistent information security threats. We must make sure our \ninvestments in operational plans and research and development are \ntechnically achievable and transparent where they can be.\n  Fundamentally, my bill seeks to ensure that the Department takes a \nmeasurable, strategic posture that can be a model for others and to \nhelp protect our Nation's vulnerable information security networks.\n  I ask for my colleagues' support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3510.\n  I thank Congressman Richmond for his bipartisan approach in bringing \nthis bill to the floor today.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 3510, the ``Department of \nHomeland Security Cybersecurity Strategy Act of 2015,'' which amends \nthe Homeland Security Act of 2002, to require the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to develop a cybersecurity strategy for the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  The strategy must include information on the programs, policies, and \nactivities that are required to successfully execute the full range of \nthe cybersecurity programs, policies, and activities in furtherance of \nthe Department of Homeland Security's mission regarding the National \nCybersecurity and Communication Integration Center.\n  The National Cybersecurity and Communication Integration Center \naddresses cybersecurity risks faced by federal and non-federal \nentities.\n  In July of this year it was reported that the Office of Personnel \nManagement lost personal information on 21.5 million current and former \nfederal employees and their families.\n  In 2014, the following agencies reported breaches: The State \nDepartment revealed that its unclassified email network had been \nbreached in a cyberattack; the U.S. Postal Service reported that \n800,000 personnel files were potentially affected by a cyber breach; \nthe Department of Health and Human Services reported cyber intruders \nhad accessed a server used to test code for the healthcare.gov website \nand installed malicious software; and the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, the agency that oversees the U.S. nuclear power industry, \nrevealed a number of attempted intrusions and three successful \nintrusions into its computer systems.\n  In cyber time, which is near the speed of light--federal computer \nnetworks will not get a warning from a determined enemy that an attack \nis occurring.\n  Our nation's critical infrastructure and civilian government agencies \ndepend on the cybersecurity talent and resources that the Department of \nHomeland Security can provide on the frontline to defend against \nattacks.\n  As with other threats that this nation has faced and overcome, we \nmust create the resources and the institutional responses to protect \nour nation against cyber threats while preserving our liberties and \nfreedoms.\n  We cannot accomplish this task without the full cooperation and \nsupport of the private sector, computing research community and \nacademia.\n  This level of engagement requires the trust and confidence of the \nAmerican people that this new cyber threat center will be used for the \npurpose it was created and that the collaboration of others in this \neffort to better protect computing networks will be used only for \nprotection and defense.\n  There are people with skills and those with the potential to develop \nskills that would be of benefit to our nation's efforts to develop an \neffective cybersecurity defense and deterrence posture.\n  It is my hope that as we move forward the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity will continue in a bipartisan manner to seek out the best ways \nto bring the brightest and most qualified people into the government as \ncybersecurity professionals.\n  Toward that end, I am hosting a Town Hall on Wednesday, October 7, \n2015, Town Hall'' on Minority Representation in the Cybersecurity \nWorkforce.\n  I am pleased to have the Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus \njoin me in support of this important Town Hall.\n  The message from the federal government to the public regarding the \nemployment opportunities available in STEM careers that include \ncybersecurity.\n  It is my commitment that Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Native American Colleges \nand Women's Colleges and Universities should be actively engaged when \nagencies conduct outreach and program development on cybersecurity.\n  The Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program's report ``The Hidden STEM \nEconomy,'' reported that in 2011, 26 million jobs or 20 percent of all \noccupations required knowledge in 1 or more STEM areas.\n  Half of all STEM jobs are available to workers without a 4 year \ndegree and these jobs pay on average $53,000 a year, which is 10 \npercent higher than jobs with similar education requirements.\n  There will be STEM winners and losers, but not because the skills \nneeded are too difficult to obtain, but because people are not aware of \nthe jobs that are going unfilled today, nor do they know what education \nor training will create job security for the next 2 to 3 decades.\n  I am very aware of the importance of STEM job training and education.\n  A third of Houston jobs are in STEM-based fields.\n  Houston has the second largest concentrations of engineers (22.4 for \nevery 1,000 workers according to the Greater Houston Partnership.)\n  Houston has 59,070 engineers, the second largest populations in the \nnation.\n  STEM jobs are at the core of Houston's economic success, but what we \nhave done with STEM innovation and job creation in the city of Houston \nis not enough to satisfy the regions demand for STEM trained workers.\n  We anticipate that in the next 5 years the gap in the number of \npeople with STEM skills and training will not keep up with the number \nof positions requiring those skills.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 3510, the \n``Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity Strategy Act of 2015.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3510, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6815-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6815-H6817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ADOPTIVE FAMILY RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and \npass the bill (S. 1300) to amend section 221 of the Immigration and \nNationality Act to provide relief for adoptive families from immigrant \nvisa fees in certain situations.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                S. 1300\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Franks) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 1300 currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  When I hold and kiss my little children good-bye to come to this \nplace every week, the pain that I feel in leaving them for several days \nis mitigated by the conviction that I will be seeing them again very \nsoon.\n  But I stand here tonight, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of hundreds of \nAmerican families who are separated from their children with no sense \nof certainty or knowing when they will be allowed to see their children \nagain or to know when their children will be home for good. That is \nbecause, in September of 2013, now more than 2 years ago, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, or the DRC, ceased issuing exit \nvisas, including visas for the more than 350 children who had been \nfully legally adopted by American families. These families had fully \ncomplied with international adoption laws in both the United States and \nthe DRC, had already spent months or years going through the tedious \nintercountry adoption process, and some of them had already arrived in \nthe DRC with the belief that they would be bringing their adoptive \nchildren home at last to their forever families in America.\n  Despite significant, ongoing efforts by both Congress and the State \nDepartment to alleviate any of the DRC Government's concerns and \nresolve the exit permit process, Mr. Speaker, it is unknown when that \nsuspension will be lifted. Meanwhile, American adoptive families are \nbeing faced with the added burden of having to repeatedly renew their \nadoptive child's adoption paperwork and visas in order to keep it up to \ndate.\n  Thus, the Adoptive Family Relief Act grants flexibility to the State \nDepartment to waive the immigration visa renewal fees of $325 per child \nfor adoptive families in America in extraordinary circumstances like \nthis where the cause of delay is out of the family's control. Mr. \nSpeaker, waiving the visa renewal fee would alleviate one portion of \nthe overwhelming burden that these American families are enduring until \ntheir adoptive child or children can travel to the U.S.\n  While the U.S. Government continues to work toward the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo lifting the exit permit suspension, this \nlegislation is critically important and will offer some practical \nrelief to the American families held powerless in a very difficult \nsituation.\n  It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that the many families waiting to bring \ntheir adopted children home will receive encouragement from the strong \nbipartisan effort here in Congress to support them during this time, as \nwe work collectively to engage the DRC Government and work toward the \nsuspension being fully lifted. This bill is a reminder to them that the \nCongress has not and will not forget their plight, and we will not \ncease working on their behalf until their families are finally \npermanently united and whole.\n  Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank Chairman Goodlatte and \nChairman Royce for their noble and principled leadership in helping to \nelevate this issue and bring this legislation to the floor.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1300, the Adoptive Family Relief \nAct.\n  As has been mentioned, 2 years ago, the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo suspended issuing exit permits to children who had been adopted \nand trying to leave the country to be with their parents. To this day, \nthat country continues to suspend issuing these permits; and without \npermits, the children can't join their mom and dad, the people who have \nadopted them, even though the children are in possession of immigrant \nvisas.\n  Now, we know to be separated from a child and not to be able to \nprovide love and care for that child is a stressful and tormenting \nepisode for any parent. For the families that adopted children in the \nDRC, this is exacerbated by the fact that their children are stuck in a \ncountry that has one of the worst healthcare systems in the world.\n  There are hundreds of families throughout the United States--and \nabout 350 of them are waiting simply for an exit permit--missing their \nchildren and worried about the health of their children stuck in the \nDRC. The only thing that is preventing them from bringing their child \nor children home is this exit visa.\n  Now, our visas are valid only for 6 months, unfortunately, and I \nthink, as was mentioned, it costs $325 to renew a visa even though, \nreally, there is no work involved. We have checked with the State \nDepartment, and there is minimal expense. So this is not going to be a \nhit on the State Department's budget, but it is a hit on the budget of \nfamilies. Some families have spent $1,000 over the past 2 years, and \nsince we don't know when the DRC is going to start issuing these visas, \nwe don't know how much money these families are looking at in the \nfuture.\n  This bipartisan bill doesn't solve the exit problem, but at least it \nsolves the financial burden that we have put, not intentionally, on \nthese families. It is the right thing to do. It will show support for \nthese families during this distressing time.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer).\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1300, the \nAdoptive Family Relief Act.\n\n  For many, family is everything, and as any parent knows, not seeing \nyour child for even one day can be hard. Now, imagine you are separated \nfrom your child by over 6,000 miles for more than 2 years. This is the \nreality for too many Americans. Hundreds of adopted children are stuck \nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo because their government has \nrefused to provide the paperwork required for these children to leave.\n\n[[Page H6817]]\n\n  For over 2 years, the Meyers, a family in my district, have been \nwaiting to bring home their son and daughter, Papy and Octavie. We can \ndo better for Papy and Octavie and all the other children waiting to \ncome home to their families.\n  As the Department of State continues to work to bring home these \nchildren, S. 1300 would provide much-needed relief to American families \ngoing through this harrowing experience. I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor this legislation. It is the right thing to do and worthy of your \nsupport.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. \n1300, the Adoptive Family Relief Act. This bill seeks to remove \nobstacles for immigrant visas to be issued to adopted children from \nother countries. It eliminates fees for such visas.\n  Clearly, the challenge of caring for orphans due to crises worldwide \nis increasing. Rather than frustrate, however, or undermine the \ncompassion and the love of American families who seek to adopt, this \nlegislation modestly seeks to remove some of those barriers and some of \nthose obstacles.\n  I would point out to my colleagues that I have held of number of \nhearings on adoption in my subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Africa, \nGlobal Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. At \none of those hearings several months ago, one of our witnesses made a \nvery keen observation that there are more than 50 million children \norphaned on the continent of Africa; and if you put that number in \nperspective, that would make that number of children, if they were in a \nsingle country, the fourth largest country in all of Africa after \nNigeria, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n  One remedy, of course, for this crisis is intercountry adoption, \nwhich sometimes brings children from Africa to our shores to provide \nthem with loving homes. Of course, this is only a partial remedy. Many \ndo find a place to live, a home with family members, but many others \nare left to fend for themselves.\n  This legislation recognizes that countries' policies do matter. Look \nat the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Currently, there are more than \n400 American families who have successfully adopted children from the \nDRC. However, due to the DRC Government's suspension of exit permits, \nwhich was implemented beginning in September of 2013, many of these \nfamilies have been unable to bring their adopted children home to the \nUnited States. About a dozen of those children have paid with their \nlives, dying in the country before they could receive medical \nattention. Others are in dire need of medical aid which, again, this \nlegislation would help, at least, in terms of the families to give them \na bridge for the financial burdens they face.\n  I would point out that at one of my hearings, one of the witnesses \nreally, in a very powerful way, said--and her name was Jovana Jones, an \nadoptive parent--``As adoptive parents, we spend years preparing, and \nit is imperative that our children come home immediately. We have done \nour part. Our families have done all we can, and we are at our limit.''\n  And then she said: ``Our arms are open now, and our homes are ready \nto receive them today. We pray that our government mirrors our \ndedication and acts now so that our children come home soon.''\n  This is a very important piece of legislation that hopefully will \nfacilitate the adoption and, at least, help those parents who are \nputting their money on the line; and it allows them to facilitate that \nadoption, to just hang in there until they can get their children.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, before coming to the floor, I wanted to \nreassure myself that the State Department did not have the authority to \nwaive these fees just administratively. It is pretty clear that they \nneed this legislation in order to waive these fees. In fact, they want \nto waive the fees; they want to support the families. So there is no \nargument here between the House and Senate, between Republicans and \nDemocrats, between the administration and the legislative branch. This \nis something that we can all agree on.\n  You know, to raise kids is one of the most wonderful experiences you \ncan ever have, and we have wonderful American families that want to \nprovide a home for orphans, not only in the DRC, but to orphans all \naround the world. So it is really important for those of us in the \ngovernment, administration, and Congress to do what we can to support \nAmerican families who want to raise these adoptive children.\n  It is worth noting that the DRC is the problem today, but we have had \nother problems in the past in other countries, in Latin America and \nAsia. So this change in the law is going to provide the necessary basis \nfor relieving parents from excessive fees should this occur, God \nforbid, with other countries.\n  We would ask our State Department to redouble its efforts with the \nDRC to get these exit permits underway. It is really unfair to the \nchildren and their parents to keep these kids stranded.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Finally, I would just note that we have not done very much by way of \nanything touching on immigration where we could have bipartisan \nsupport. I still wish that we had before us comprehensive immigration \nreform. That is not this, but it doesn't mean that we shouldn't support \nthis. I think that it is important that we pass this and show these \nAmerican parents that we are on their side and we hope that they can \nuse the funds that they save to provide for their new sons and \ndaughters.\n  Mr. Speaker, unless the gentleman has additional speakers, I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are very few things that we do in this body more \nimportant than trying to make sure that parentless little children have \nhope in life. Through our State Department, all across the world we do \nvery laudable things to try to make sure they have this chance in life. \nSometimes it is orphanages; sometimes it is just other types of help \nthrough NGOs.\n  In this particular case, we are doing everything that we can to \nfacilitate children being put into a loving family on a permanent \nbasis. To bring sometimes childless parents together with often \nparentless children is, I think, a very beautiful and noble effort on \nour part. I hope that this bill allows that in a greater way with the \nDRC and, as Ms. Lofgren mentioned, with other states across the world \nif it becomes necessary.\n  I am grateful for all the bipartisan support. I know this is \nsomething that we have come together on. Again, I express appreciation \nto Chairman Royce, Chairman Goodlatte, and to the gentlewoman who has \nexpressed her support for this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember the lives of \nthose who were taken too soon at Umpqua Community College on Thursday, \nOctober 1, 2015.\n  I ask that all Americans pray for the friends and families of these \nnine victims as they grieve and rebuild from this tragedy.\n  We must also keep in our thoughts and prayers those who were injured \nphysically and emotionally by this event. It will take time, our \nsupport, and patience as they grieve and recover.\n  Mr. Speaker, Roseburg is a small, strong, and tight-knit community. I \nam heartened, and not surprised, by the acts of kindness and generosity \nin response to this unthinkable act. We call that ``UCC Strong,'' \n``Roseburg Strong.'' It is this strong spirit that will carry everyone \nthrough this difficult time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House pause for a moment of silence in \nhonor of those impacted by the tragic events at Umpqua Community \nCollege last week.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 2168) to make the current Dungeness crab fishery management \nregime permanent and for other purposes, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2168\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``West Coast Dungeness Crab \n     Management Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY MANAGEMENT.\n\n       Section 203 of the Act entitled ``An Act to approve a \n     governing international fishery agreement between the United \n     States and the Republic of Poland, and for other purposes'', \n     approved November 13, 1998 (Public Law 105-384; 16 U.S.C. \n     1856 note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (i); and\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (j) as subsection (i).\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Newhouse) and the gentleman from Northern Mariana \nIslands (Mr. Sablan) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, we are considering H.R. 2168, sponsored by my \nfriend and fellow Washingtonian, Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler.\n  This bipartisan, consensus-based legislation makes permanent the \nlongstanding management of the Dungeness crab fishery by Washington, \nOregon, and California. The three States manage this crab fishery under \nthe umbrella of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. \nManagement is funded by the participating States.\n  We must pass legislation to continue this management. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office recently estimated that H.R. 2168 would \nsave the Federal Government up to $1 million in discretionary Federal \nspending since State management would continue under this bill.\n  If State management expires and this bill is not enacted, then the \nFederal Government would have to expend new resources to manage the \nfishery. This bill keeps that from happening. The States have shown \nthat they are exemplary at handling this management and it is \nunnecessary for this authority to fall to the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page H6820]]\n\n  This bill is a win for the American taxpayer, a win for the seafood \nconsumer, a win for my home State as well as the States of Oregon and \nCalifornia, and a win for those employed by the sustainable harvest of \nthe species.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 2168 would repeal the sunset clause from legislation that allows \nthe West Coast Dungeness crab fishery in Federal waters to be managed \ncooperatively by the States instead of by the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, or NOAA.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  The Dungeness crab fishery is one of the most valuable fisheries on \nthe Pacific Coast, and it is a model of effective marine resource \nmanagement.\n  The specifics of the fishery, including robust stock assessments, \naccurate catch reporting, and harmony between Federal waters commercial \nfishermen and near-shore recreational crabbers, make regional \nmanagement a good choice.\n  California, Oregon, and Washington have managed the fisheries \ntogether with oversight from NOAA since 1980 and have proven they can \ndo so responsibly.\n  H.R. 2168 would allow the States to continue managing the Dungeness \nfishery without having to return to Congress every several years for \npermission.\n  As opposed to a fishery like the Gulf of Mexico red snapper, \nmanagement of the Dungeness crab is based on cooperation among States \nand fishing sectors as well as respect for the best available science, \nand the States have proven to be good stewards of the resource.\n  I agree with the goals of this legislation, and I ask my colleagues \nto stand with me in support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nWashington (Ms. Herrera Beutler), my colleague and friend, who has \ncommitted to me that she will go to every effort to make sure she has \nsamples of Dungeness crab in her office so we all know what we are \ntalking about.\n  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues \nto support H.R. 2168, the West Coast Dungeness Crab Management Act. \nThis bipartisan bill is an important solution for residents of coastal \ncommunities in southwest Washington.\n  The successful, two-decades-old tri-state Dungeness crab management \nagreement will expire September 30 of 2016. This bill simply makes \npermanent the management authority between Washington, Oregon, and \nCalifornia. This management authority has worked.\n  For the last 20 years, these States have overseen one of the most \nvaluable fisheries in the Pacific Northwest. In 2014, fishermen \ndelivered 53 million pounds of crab, totaling $170 million. This \neconomic activity helped support the 61,000 jobs relating to the \nseafood industry in Washington State alone.\n  How has it maintained this success? The fishery has been managed in a \nsustainable way. And, importantly, it doesn't cost taxpayers a dime.\n  However, should this authority expire, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, or NOAA, says its management of the fishery \nwill cost taxpayers over $1.15 million each year.\n  So, simply put, this bill maintains local control on the West Coast \nand ensures sustainability of the Dungeness crab fishery, and it saves \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  I want to thank Chairman Bishop and the House Natural Resource staff \nfor bringing this bill to the floor. It is common sense.\n  I urge the House to vote ``yes'' on this bill to ensure a bright, \nsustainable economic future for coastal crab-dependent communities like \nIlwaco, Washington, and many others on the West Coast.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 2168.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I, too, have no further speakers. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this good, bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2168, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6820-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6820-H6821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ALBUQUERQUE INDIAN SCHOOL LAND TRANSFER ACT\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Newhouse) and the gentleman from Northern Mariana \nIslands (Mr. Sablan) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 986, which would direct \nthe Secretary of the Interior to place 11 acres of Federal land into \ntrust for the collective benefit of 19 Pueblos in the State of New \nMexico.\n  These 11 acres were historically part of the Albuquerque Indian \nSchool site, which are culturally and historically significant to the \nPueblos. Upon transfer, the lands may be used by the 19 Pueblos for the \neducational, health, cultural, business, and economic development \npurposes by these Pueblo tribes. One important thing to note is this \nland may not be used for gaming purposes under this bill.\n  Since 1976, the 19 Pueblos have used the lands of the former \nAlbuquerque Indian School for the cultural and economic benefit of the \n19 Pueblos. This is the last portion of Federal lands of the former \nschool site, which has not been conveyed to the 19 Pueblos.\n  This bill is supported by the entire New Mexico congressional \ndelegation. Recognizing the support of the local delegation, the House \ncompanion bill, H.R. 1880, sponsored by Congresswoman Lujan Grisham, \nwas favorably reported by the Natural Resources Committee on September \n30 of 2015.\n  I urge passage of this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, Senate bill S. 986 would direct the Secretary of the \nInterior to convey approximately 11 acres of land to the United States \nto be held in trust for the 19 Pueblos of New Mexico.\n  The land taken into trust shall be used for the educational, health, \ncultural, business, and economic development of the 19 Pueblos.\n  Passage of this bill will finally complete the process started in \n1969 when the United States began converting the Albuquerque Indian \nSchool Reserve into land under the jurisdiction and control of the 19 \nPueblos.\n  I would like to thank our colleague, Ms. Lujan Grisham, for \nintroducing and championing the House version of the act and to \nChairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for moving it swiftly \nthrough committee.\n  I would also like to thank my colleague, the gentleman from \nWashington, for joining me tonight in managing this bill.\n  Just as Mr. Newhouse stated, this legislation is supported by the \nentire New Mexico delegation. I urge its quick adoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham), the \nsponsor of the House version of the bill.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I thank \nRepresentative Sablan and Representative Newhouse for their support. I \nalso thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for their help \nin bringing this legislation to the floor. Of course, I extend my \ngratitude to our Senator Tom Udall for working with me on this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I am the proud sponsor of the House companion to the Albuquerque \nIndian School Land Transfer Act, which, as you have heard, directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to take into trust four tracts of land for \nthe New Mexico 19 Pueblos.\n  The land taken into the trust would be used for educational, health, \ncultural, business, and economic development of the New Mexico Pueblos. \nThe four parcels are located within a former Federal Indian boarding \nschool site called the 1884 Albuquerque Indian School Reserve in \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico.\n  In 1969, the United States started the long process of converting the \nReserve into land under the jurisdiction and control of the New Mexico \nPueblos. Since then, Congress has enacted legislation in 1978, 2001, \nand 2008 to convey additional land from the Reserve in trust for the \nNew Mexico Pueblos.\n  Pursuant to the 2008 legislation, the Bureau of Land Management \nconducted a new survey of the former school properties and identified \nminor discrepancies in the previous trust deeds and, also, identified \nthe correct boundaries of two additional tracts of land within the \nReserve that the Bureau of Indian Affairs no longer needed for its \nadministrative functions.\n  This legislation addresses those technical discrepancies identified \nby BLM's survey, and it would complete the process of transferring \nBIA's portion of the Reserve to New Mexico's Pueblos.\n  This transfer allows the Pueblos to expand their current economic \ndevelopment plan for the region, which creates jobs, expands \neducational and cultural opportunities, while continuing to generate \nrevenue for the New Mexico Pueblos.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this noncontroversial legislation, \nwhich, as you have heard, has the support of the entire New Mexico \ndelegation and would benefit the New Mexico 19 Pueblos.\n  Mr. SABLAN. We have no further speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support S. \n986.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 986.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6821-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6821-H6822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NEW ENGLAND FISHERMAN PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, heavy new fines the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration is proposing could destroy New Hampshire's \nremaining fishermen who are carrying on a proud New England tradition.\n  That is why I recently introduced legislation to stop the Federal \nagency from shifting its funding responsibility to our struggling \nGranite State fishermen.\n  NOAA mandates that at-sea contractors monitor their daily catch, but \nwill cease to pay for this government mandate in December, forcing \nfishermen to pick up the more than $700 per day tab.\n  These small family businesses will be on the hook for thousands of \ndollars in new fees each month. That is a figure that would simply \neradicate the industry in my home State.\n  This is not a partisan issue. The New England Fisherman Preservation \nAct simply asks the Federal agency to continue paying for a program it \nhas funded for years rather than forcing hardworking, middle-class \nfamilies to pay for it.\n\n[[Page H6822]]\n\n  I am asking colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in \nsupport of this bill, so important to hardworking fishermen who put \nfood on our tables so that they can continue with their task.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6822-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1930\n              AMERICAN VETERANS DISABLED FOR LIFE MEMORIAL\n\n  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida.

It is a beautiful tribute \nto the brave men and women who suffered permanent injuries on the \nbattlefield. This memorial sits just south of our Capitol, and it \nreminds us every day of the selflessness of those who fought for our \nfreedom and returned home with the scars of duty.\n  I offer my great thanks and appreciation to the 4 million veterans \nwho are living today with service-related disabilities and the friends \nand the family who take care of them. The American Veterans Disabled \nfor Life Memorial celebrates your lives every day, as we all do in our \nhearts and our minds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6822-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING THE DEDICATION OF THE TOTI MENDEZ CARDIOPULMONARY DIAGNOSTIC \n                                 SUITE\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the triumph of the \nRoboGals, a student robotics team from the 11th Congressional District \nof Illinois.\n  The RoboGals are Kaiya Hollister, a fifth grader at the John C. \nDunham STEM Partnership School, and Jensie Coonradt, a fourth grader at \nThe Wheatlands Elementary School, both in Aurora, Illinois.

Now they advance to the \nworld championship round in Qatar, taking on over 50 countries from all \nover the globe.

Mr. Speaker, the numbers never lie--unless they do.\n  Each month we all react to the release of the employment report as \nthe supposed indicator of economic health around our country. The most \nrecent jobs numbers show an unemployment rate of 5.1 percent, but that \nheadline number paints a picture that simply doesn't exist. It distorts \nthe economic outlook and distracts this Chamber from working toward the \ncreation of better jobs and more opportunities for millions of \nAmericans.\n  Economists of all persuasions have criticized this method as \noverstating job market strength, noting that the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics only considers limited factors when reporting the \nunemployment rate and ignoring things like underemployment or the \nnumber of workers who have left the labor force. What we are left with \nis a flawed view of labor market strength.\n  With that in mind, I have joined with colleagues in introducing the \nLabor Statistics Improvement Act, which would clear the way for changes \nin methodology that could help the unemployment rate more accurately \nreflect the strength of the labor market.\n  If the jobs report dictates how this Congress addresses real economic \nchallenges, we can't afford to get it wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6822-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE LIFE OF ERMA JOHNSON HADLEY\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a \ndedicated Fort Worth community leader, Erma Johnson Hadley, who passed \naway last week after a very long battle with cancer.\n  Mrs. Hadley was born in Leggett, Texas, where she graduated from high \nschool in 1959 and became the first Black woman from Leggett to attend \ncollege. Mrs. Hadley attended Prairie View A University.\n  When she finished her career teaching in high school, she came to \nTarrant County College, where she served in a variety of different \nroles, including vice chancellor, and was ultimately named the interim \nchancellor and chancellor in 2010 of the Tarrant County College system.\n  Chancellor Hadley was known for her passion for ensuring accessible \nand affordable education for students in Tarrant County. I will never \nforget Mrs. Erma Johnson Hadley telling me a story about how while all \nkids are not necessarily gifted equally, all kids that put their mind \nto it, if their parents work with them, can get a good education and \nmake something of themselves.\n  Mrs. Hadley believed in each and every student that attended Tarrant \nCounty College, and I know that the campus and the students are going \nto continue to benefit from her legacy and her belief in them.\n  She is survived by her husband, Bill Hadley; Ardenia Johnson Gould, \nwho is her daughter; and Spencer Gould, her son-in-law; and a \ngrandchild.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6822-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6822-H6823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IT IS TIME FOR CONGRESS TO ACT\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is a very difficult time for \nAmericans as we mourn with our fellow citizens in Oregon. I offer my \ndeepest sympathy to the congressional delegation here in the Congress, \nas we join them in their expression of deep sympathy to those who were \ninjured and those who lost their lives, to the families of those \nindividuals.\n  I spoke to a member of the United States military, and he indicated \nthat in battle he had two guns. We understand that the perpetrator of \nthis horrible act had at least 14 guns, or double-digit guns.\n  I have heard the refrain: ``What else will have to happen before we \naddress\n\n[[Page H6823]]\n\nthe question of gun regulation and gun safety?'' Mr. Speaker, it is \ntime now to ask the question of an extended waiting period so that \nsomeone would not amass 14, 15, 30 guns, more than the United States \nmilitary, and a serious background check dealing with any issues that \nwould impact a person's stability in having guns.\n  Yes, people do kill, not guns, but they use guns to kill. I have been \nthrough too many of these, Mr. Speaker, from Columbine to this \nincident. Every single one I have been through since being in the \nUnited States Congress. It is time for the Congress to act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6823-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6823-H6826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT AFFECT AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, the attention of the House is drawn to \nmany, many issues this week. Certainly, the tragedy in Oregon draws all \nof our attention, our sympathy, but unfortunately not our vote. We have \nnever really had a vote here on the floor of the House to deal with \nthis issue of gun safety; although, legislation has been passed around \nmany, many times.\n  Even the most conservative columnists are now saying that we must \ntake action, and we really should. So I will just start by saying to \nall of our colleagues: Let's vote, vote up or down on the various \nproposals that have been made.\n  Certainly the attention of this body is turned to who is going to be \nthe next Speaker. It seems to occupy most of the discussion and most of \nthe articles in the newspapers around this town. It is important, but \nthere are many, many other issues that come before the House. Some of \nthem are really going to affect America.\n  I want to talk about one of them today, and it is in the context of \nsomething we have been discussing here for the last 4 or 5 years. We \ncall it Make It In America. It is about rebuilding the American \nmanufacturing sector. It is about rebuilding the American middle class. \nIt is about creating jobs in America by doing what we once did so very, \nvery well, which is manufacturing. Make things: big things, little \nthings, all kinds of things. We call it our Make It In America agenda.\n  I am going to go through it very quickly here and then focus on one \npiece of this agenda. Here it is: trade policies. This is going to take \na lot of time to discuss this. We are not going to go into it today, \nbut the President announced just in the last couple days that the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership deal is done.\n  Now, we don't know what is in it. We have--at least I have--great \nconcerns about this and that it will be one more step in hollowing out \nthe American manufacturing sector, but it is all secret. We don't know \nyet. We will find out soon enough, and we will undoubtedly come back \nand talk about trade.\n  Taxes and tax policies, I will hit on this in a few moments.\n  Labor issues, well, that ties back to the trade issue and whether we \nare going to send more of our jobs overseas.\n  Education, research, infrastructure, today I really want to focus on \nthis energy and infrastructure. If you bear with me a few moments, I \nwant to go into this in some detail.\n  For many, many years, we have tried to make America energy \nindependent, and in the last 5 years, 6 years now, we have seen an \nenormous increase in the production of energy in the United States.\n  Now, a lot of that energy has come from green technologies--solar, \nwind, and biofuels--and many other ways of producing renewable energy \ncalled green energy. That is good because all of that reduces \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and we need to do more of it.\n  Frankly, we need tax policy.\n  Maybe I will put this back up again so I can point out the way in \nwhich the Make It In America agenda fits all of this.\n  Tax policy has a great deal to do with green energy. There are tax \nbreaks for solar installation on your home, solar installation for \nbusinesses, the production tax credit for wind and solar. All of these \nthings make it really possible to advance the green energy agenda.\n  Tax policy also has a great deal to do with the other part of our \nenergy independence--we are not quite there, but we are making great \nadvances on it--and that has to do with petroleum products: natural gas \nand crude oil.\n  There has been much talk about the Bakken revolution in Wyoming and \nNorth Dakota producing a lot of energy. We are talking about different \ntechniques to extract oil, enhanced oil production, otherwise known as \nfracking. All of these things have led to an explosion--well, \nliterally, in the case of the Bakken fuel because it is highly \nvolatile, and it does explode when trains tip over.\n  But what we are talking about here is an explosion in the volume of \noil and natural gas produced in America. We have literally doubled the \nproduction of natural gas and oil over the last 5 to 6 years, bringing \ndown the cost of fuel. Also, around the world, the slowdown of the \nChinese economy and Europe have reduced the demand for oil, and we are \nseeing a reduced price of oil on the world market, even at a time when \nwe are seeing more and more production of crude oil and natural gas \nhere in the United States.\n  What does all this mean to the oil industry, to the petroleum \nindustry? It means they have got a lot of oil, and the United States is \nnot consuming all of it or as much as they would like to keep the \nprices up. So guess what they want to do. They want to export oil. \nIsn't that something?\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  How do we become energy-independent if we are exporting oil? Well, we \nhave got a lot of interesting economic arguments about how that could \nbe done. I am saying I don't think so.\n  I don't think it is in the interest of the United States to take a \nstrategic national asset--natural gas, crude oil--and export it to \nChina. It may be good for China. It certainly would be good for the \nenergy industry, the petroleum industry. Wow, they have got a new \nmarket.\n  You see, right now there is a Federal ban on the export of crude oil \nto other countries, with the exception of Mexico and Canada. We swap \ncrude oil back and forth. A little bit of crude oil is also shipped out \nof the United States from the North Slope of Alaska.\n  A very interesting law was established back in the seventies, when \nthere was this energy crisis and there were long lines at the gasoline \npumps. That law said: No. You cannot export crude oil.\n  And then later, in the 1990s, there was a little opening provided for \nMexico and Canada and for Alaska North Slope oil. It could be shipped \nto other countries--exported--with this caveat: You cannot increase \ndomestic oil prices.\n  I don't know that that was ever enforced. We certainly saw the \ngasoline prices zip to the top last year. Now it is coming back down, \nand that is good. It is bad that it went up, good that it is coming \ndown.\n  But I don't think the Department of Energy or the Department of \nCommerce really enforced what was in the law about the export of crude \noil from Alaska.\n  So we have got this strategic asset--natural gas and crude oil--that \nhas allowed us to have a resurgence of American manufacturing. They are \ncoming home. American manufacturers are coming home to make it in \nAmerica.\n  Dow, a big chemical operation, is coming back to America because \nnatural gas prices are low. Other companies are doing the same thing. \nBecause the United States has a strategic advantage as a result of \nstrategic assets: oil and natural gas, together with green energy.\n  So what does the petroleum industry want to do? They want to ruin all \nof that. They want to take the strategic assets and ship them overseas.\n  This week the House of Representatives is going to take up a piece of \nlegislation that opens the spigot for the export of crude oil. There is \nalready an open spigot for the export of natural gas. I will come to \nthat in a few moments.\n  So is this in the interest of the United States? Well, if you are in \nthe oil patch--North Dakota, Texas, maybe\n\n[[Page H6824]]\n\neven California--maybe it is good. Maybe you will be able to make a \nlittle more money.\n  But at the expense of who? America, American consumers at the pump, \ntruckers, trains. All of those use diesel produced here in the United \nStates from our refineries.\n  So good for the petroleum industry, but bad for America. We ought not \ndo that. And if you would consider for a few moments that, should we \never allow the export of crude oil, we ought to put some serious \ncaveats on that piece of legislation.\n  But just today the Rules Committee of this House decided no, no, no \ncaveats. Just a bare bill. Open the spigot. Send the crude oil \noverseas. Don't worry about the price of fuel. Don't worry about the \nprice of energy in the United States. Worry about the bottom line of \nthe petroleum industry.\n  I say time out. Wait a minute. This is America. This is about the \nAmerican economy. This is about men and women that go to the gas pump \nand buy gasoline, farmers out there having to buy diesel in order to \nplow their fields and harvest their crops, trains moving goods and \nservices back across the United States, the airline industry.\n  This is not just about the petroleum industry. This is a big deal for \nAmerica. If we take a strategic national asset and just allow it to go \nanywhere in the world so that it is to the benefit of a small, but \nimportant, slice of the American economy, we are making a big mistake.\n  So let me just put some caveats on this piece of legislation. Harken \nback to the Alaska situation back in 1995 where they opened the spigot. \nThey put in a caveat that said: No. You can't do it if it results in an \nadverse effect on the price of transportation fuels and home heating \nfuels in the United States.\n  Does the legislation we have this week have any caveats on it? No. It \ndoesn't have that one.\n  Let me give you another caveat. If we are going to ship a strategic \nnational asset overseas, why don't we look at other strategic assets in \nthe United States, shipbuilding?\n  The entire United States Navy is dependent on American shipyards for \nall of their ships. Those shipyards no longer produce large, ocean-\ngoing commercial vessels. All of that has been off to China, off to \nKorea and Japan. All of those countries subsidize those shipyards. We \ndon't do it in the United States.\n  But we can put caveats on the export of this crude oil and simply \nsay, if we are going to export crude oil, caveat one, not at the \nexpense of American consumers; two, not at the expense of American \nrefiners and other strategic asset--the refinery of these petroleum \nproducts; and, three, ship it on American-built ships with American \nmariners.\n  Right now there are over 400,000 men and women working in the \nshipyards producing smaller ships for trade within the coastal zone of \nthe United States and for the barges up and down the rivers and canals \nof the United States, but not building ocean-going tankers. What does \nit mean? Well, let me just give you an example.\n  It has been estimated that the maximum amount of oil that could be \nshipped is somewhere about 3.6 million barrels a day. That is at the \ntop level. Hopefully, they will never get close to that because that is \nalmost certain to raise prices. But let's say that they do.\n  For the largest tanker currently on the ocean today--these are the \nmaximum tankers, too large to even go through the new Panama Canal and \nlarger than the Panamax ships--it would take 180 ships to handle 3.6 \nmillion barrels of oil a day.\n  What if those ships were American-built ships? This isn't Saudi \nArabian oil. This isn't Iraqi oil, Venezuelan oil. This is American \noil. What if we require that that oil be shipped on American ships and \nsuddenly, over the next decade or two, our shipyards were to build 180 \nsupertankers or, if they are Panamax-size ships, 384 Panamax-size \nships?\n  Think of the employment that would take place in the American \nshipyards and then through the entire supply train, all of the engines, \nall of the communications, all of the electronics, all of the pumps, \nall of the valves. We could see a resurgence in American manufacturing.\n  Who benefits from this? Americans benefit. Americans benefit in the \nshipyards and in the manufacturing facilities all across this Nation.\n  But, no, we are not going to do that here on the House floor. We are \ngoing to simply take a bill that opens the spigot and that gives the \nbenefits to the oil patch, to the petroleum industry.\n  And I am not saying that is not good for them. There will certainly \nbe jobs. There will be some construction jobs, and there will be oil \nrigs that will have to be built. That is good.\n  But think what we could do if we had a law that said: Okay. We are \ngoing to ship, but we are going to protect the domestic price of \nrefined products, we are going to protect the American refineries, we \nare going to build American ships, and we are going to put American \nmariners on those ships.\n  We are talking about tens of thousands, if not a hundred thousand, \nnew jobs in the United States. That is a good thing for the middle \nclass. That is a good thing for America.\n  We can do it by simply amending the oil export bill. But it is not \ngoing to happen. The majority here isn't going to allow that. They are \nsimply going to pass a bill that opens the spigot.\n  It is a shame. Shame on all of us if we would allow that to happen. \nShame on us if we do not protect the American consumer. Shame on us if \nwe do not protect the American maritime industry, the shipyards of \nAmerica, the American middle class.\n  Watch closely. It is going to happen. It is going to happen here on \nthe House floor this week while all of the attention of America is \nlooking at this Speakership thing.\n  Okay. That is where we are on one critical issue. I want to take up \none more and then I will call it a night.\n  That is a new Amtrak locomotive for the Eastern Corridor, and it is \n100 percent American-made. Why is it 100 percent American-made for the \nfirst time in decades--well, at least a decade and a half--and that the \nUnited States is once again producing locomotives?\n  By the way, that is made near my district, in Sacramento. It is about \n4 or 5 miles from the edge of my district. Several hundred men and \nwomen are employed doing this.\n  Why did this happen? Because the Congress wrote policy that said your \ntaxpayer dollars are going to be used not to buy a locomotive made in \nChina or Japan or Europe, but to buy a locomotive made in America, made \nin America. Your tax dollars are being used to build locomotives in \nAmerica.\n  It is part of a transportation policy, which is where I want to go \nnow. Before I do, I guess I forgot this.\n  This is a liquefied natural gas tanker. I was just talking about \ncrude oil and what could be done. This is another one. If we are going \nto export our natural gas--that strategic asset--it ought to be \nexported on American-made liquefied natural tankers.\n  A new facility is opening down in Texas to export liquefied natural \ngas. That facility will take 100 tankers for that one facility. Not to \nworry. Those tankers are going to be made in China, Japan, Korea. They \nare not going to be made in America.\n  But under 16 lines of law--all we need to do is write 16 lines of \nlaw--we would be manufacturing these tankers in the United States.\n  It is the same argument that I made about the crude oil tankers. I \nwon't go into it in any more detail. This is one of the great could-\ndo's, should-do's, ought-to-do's for America.\n  So the export of these strategic national assets--natural gas, \npetroleum--why don't we build them in America? Why don't we make it in \nAmerica?\n  I started to talk about the locomotives. October 29 is just about 23 \ndays from today. The highway trust fund is out of money. Once again, we \nare on one of those cliffs--this time, a transportation cliff--and we \nhave got to do something.\n  And so what are we going to do? The President proposed the GROW \nAmerica Act. It provides money for our crumbling transportation system, \nthe infrastructure structure.\n  There is a rail portion of it, locomotives, improving the rail \nsystem. There are buses, ports, bridges, and highways. It is a very, \nvery good piece of legislation. It is $476 billion over the next 6 \nyears. It is a big deal.\n\n[[Page H6825]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  It helps America come from number, I think, 18 in the infrastructure \ncapability compared to other nations of the world.\n  China has, I don't know, 5,000, 3,000 miles of high-speed rail. The \nUnited States has zero. Chinese airports, Japanese airports. I think \neven Cuba is now in the process of building a new deepwater port to \ntake the Panamax ships.\n  And what are we doing? Not much. The Grow America Act is totally \nstalled. It is not going anywhere right now.\n  But we have got 23 days. So what are we proposing? Are we proposing \nsomething that will increase the rail capacity in the United States, \nthat will combine rail, ports, and highways into a system to provide \nfor goods movement, freight movement, integrated? No, we are not going \nto do such a thing. Other countries do it. Hey, but this is America. We \njust like to fall behind.\n  So where are we with the Grow America Act? Well, some of us have \nintroduced it. Some of us think we ought to do something like this, \nthat we really ought to pay for our infrastructure.\n  Oh, by the way, this doesn't raise gas taxes. It doesn't raise diesel \ntaxes, but it does require that those American corporations that have \nskipped out on their obligation to their home country to bring their \nprofits back to the United States and be taxed.\n  So we maintain the existing excise tax on gasoline and fuel, and we \npay for the rest of this by having American corporations pay their just \ndue to this Nation by repatriating their foreign earnings hidden off \nsomewhere in Ireland or some other tax havens, not taxed, even though \nthey are American corporations.\n  Oh, and some of this stuff is just too good.\n  Apple, an American company, all of their manufacturing is overseas, \nand most of their profits are overseas also because, even though it is \ninvented here, even though the software, even though the new equipment \nis invented in California, it is licensed in Ireland, and the profits \nstay in Ireland and are taxed there at a very low percentage--not fair \nto America.\n  So those profits would come home from other companies as well, and it \nwould fill this $476 billion over 6 years.\n  I want to just go through some of this, and then we will wrap this \nup.\n  The Grow America Act would provide $52 billion a year for highways. \nWe are presently spending $41 billion a year for highways, so we are \nlooking at something $11 billion more for highways. Maybe there won't \nbe so many potholes. Maybe one out of four bridges in the United States \nwill get repaired. Right now, they are deficient. They could fall down. \nThey are insufficient in capacity. Maybe we could do that.\n  Now, the Senate has done a little better. The Senate has passed a \nhighway bill that is $46 billion a year, which is $5 billion more than \nwe are currently spending, and that is good. It is a 5-year program \nthat is only paid for in 3 years.\n  Huh? How does that work? It doesn't, but it is a good start. But the \nGrow America Act, $52 billion a year.\n  Anybody take buses in the United States? Anybody take BART in \nCalifornia, or the Metro system in Los Angeles, or here in Washington, \nthe Metro, or the subways in Chicago, New York, Atlanta and so forth? \nThat is called transit. We are presently spending about $10 billion, \n$10.6 billion a year on transit, supporting these transportation \nsystems. The Senate bill adds about $2 billion, so they go to $12.5 \nbillion.\n  The Grow America Act, let's get on with it. Let's build those \nsystems. $19 billion, without raising your fuel taxes.\n  But if you happen to be those American companies that have skipped \nout on their obligation to this Nation, they are going to wind up \npaying their fair share.\n  So we go from 10.6 for transit, $10.6 billion annually for transit, \nto $19 billion in the Grow America Act.\n  Remember, I put some of these trains up here? We presently spend $1.4 \nbillion on our rail system--not the transit. This is the heavy rail \nsystem. The Senate would go to $2.2 billion, and the Grow America Act \nwould go to $4.7 billion.\n  Are we going to do this? Not likely. Not likely.\n  We have perfected a childhood game here in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. In fact, your American Government has \nperfected this game. Something, when you didn't have a ball to kick \naround, you would kick a can around. It is called kick the can down the \nroad. We have perfected that. I think we have done it more than 30 \ntimes to transportation over the last decade and a half.\n  We are highly likely to do it again, as the attention of America and \nthe attention here amongst all of us is focused on the Speakership \nfights, which will culminate at the end of October when the Speaker \nretires and we will have a new vote. But in the intervening 23 days, \nare we going to focus on a transportation program for America or are we \ngoing to focus on the internal politics of the House of \nRepresentatives?\n  I will tell you where I would put my money. I would put my money on \nthe House of Representatives worrying about the internal politics of \nwho is going to be the next leader and not paying attention to what \nAmerica wants us to do.\n  America wants us to pay attention to their needs, not to the internal \npolitics of this place, but to the needs of America, American jobs for \nAmerican workers.\n  Can we build ships? Oh, yeah, we can build ships.\n  Can we build liquefied natural gas tankers? You bet we can. We are \nalready building ships that are fueled by liquefied natural gas. We are \ndoing it in San Diego. We know how to do this. We would have to ramp \nup. We are not going to build 180 ships in 1 year, but we sure could \nover the next two decades.\n  But maybe we care more about the petroleum industry than we do about \nthe American worker and the American sailor and the shipyards of \nAmerica. I am afraid that is the way it is likely to be here.\n\n  I notice that I am joined here by an extraordinary woman from what \nused to be the manufacturing center of the United States, the Midwest, \nOhio, to be quite clear.\n  Marcy Kaptur, I have been going on for more than I probably should \nhave in time but, boy, these are important issues. These are really \nimportant issues. Please join us.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman from California for being an \nextraordinary leader on Make It In America and restoring prosperity to \nall corners of this country. The citizens of California really have \nsent an amazing Congressman to speak on behalf of the Nation and the \nimportance of making items in America.\n  It is probably a tragedy, over the last three decades, that we have \naccumulated over $9 trillion in trade deficit, which translates into \nlost wealth, lost income for America's families, and, ultimately, a \nbudget deficit that we just can't get under control because people \naren't earning enough. So much economic activity has been outsourced \nthat there are many who have forgotten how much manufacturing actually \nmatters.\n  So I agree with the gentleman. Make it in America, grow it in \nAmerica, use the technology of America to transform farm field products \ninto ethanol and biodiesel.\n  Let us use the sun. Let us invent our way forward to become energy \nindependent because, at some point, not in our lifetime, but at some \npoint over the next 100 years, the oil wells will run dry, and even the \nnatural gas fields currently being discovered in Ohio and Pennsylvania, \nwhich are mother lode supplies with horizontal drilling, those are \nfinite and they will be gone. So the world with many more people is \ngoing to have to figure out how to sustain life.\n  The gentleman has addressed many of these issues in terms of energy \nproduction, America's need to become energy secure, which would create \nprosperity here at home, and also all the investments of hard \ninfrastructure on rail, on over-the-road, air transportation.\n  I have to add, obviously, our ports and, in my part of the country, \nthe Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway so in need of infrastructure \nimprovement, several billion dollars actually.\n  We are having a Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway meeting tomorrow\n\n[[Page H6826]]\n\nmorning, inviting in many of the business interests along the seaway \nand looking for ways in our transportation bill where we can make more \ninvestment in that region so it can sing fully economically again.\n  So I thank the gentleman for a moment here. And believe me, I unite \nwith you in your efforts to make America fully strong again, and Make \nIt In America can lead us down that path.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. You have been a leader on these issues for many, many \nyears and certainly in your territory of Ohio. You saw what happened \nwhen the manufacturing plants left; but they are coming back, and we \ncan make policy to do that.\n  I think you may have other things that you would like to bring to our \nattention. You are certainly welcome to do so.\n  I think with that, it is time for me to say ``enough,'' or maybe I \nhave said too much already.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6826-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6826-H6832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MENTAL HEALTH WEEK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. McSally). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, this evening, just before \nvotes, I went outside on the balcony here of this Capitol to watch the \nsun set. It was one of those beautiful evenings of crimson and gold and \ngray clouds silhouetted against the twilight glow of the evening. And \nthen I glanced over to the buildings here at the Capitol and was \nsuddenly brought back to reality when I saw so many flags on our \nbuildings flying at half mast, flying at half mast because, once again, \nwe are remembering the tragedies that have shaken our Nation time and \ntime again.\n  This has been a bloody summer, a bloody summer of many attacks that \nhave been associated with folks with mental illness.\n  I know most people with mental illness are not violent, and I know \nthat there are many other tragedies that occur; but tonight, during \nthis week, which is Mental Health Week in America, I want to highlight, \nMadam Speaker, what we must do as a nation, what we cannot continue to \npush aside.\n  Just think of what happened this summer, just a few examples:\n  June 13, attack on the Dallas Police headquarters by a man who had a \nhistory of family violence and mental instability;\n  July 23, Lafayette, Louisiana, a shooting in a movie theater by a man \nwho had had a judge's orders to send him to a mental hospital in the \npast;\n  August 16, Antioch, Tennessee, a movie theater attack;\n  August 26, Roanoke, Virginia, a live, on-air shooting, a tragic scene \nof a reporter being killed, and a cameraman;\n  August 28, 2015, Houston, Texas, while a deputy police officer was at \na gas station, riddled with bullets by a man who had a history of \nmental illness;\n  September 22, the son of a State senator, former State senator of \nVirginia, killed a man, and also killed himself in Bowling Green;\n  And this last week, October 1, in Roseburg, Oregon, nine people were \nkilled, and the gunman killed himself in another tragic scene.\n  There is more to it than this, of course. In this country last year, \n125 people with mental illness were killed in some sort of a police \nshooting where the police oftentimes did not even know, but the \nconfrontation grew and ended in a death.\n  It is estimated there were somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 murders \nin this country this last year by people with mental illness. But more \nthan that, there are 10,000 or more, maybe 20,000, maybe 100,000 people \nwith mental illness who are the victims of crime. Some are killed.\n  There are thousands and thousands of people who are homeless, who die \nthat slow-motion death of homelessness, of their physical ailments and \ntheir illnesses.\n  There were 41,000 suicide deaths, 1.2 million suicide attempts that \nrequired some medical care, 43,000 substance abuse overdose deaths. \nThis list goes on and on and on.\n  And what happens is, when we treat people with mental illness early \nin their life, their prognosis is improved. In many cases, they can go \non to have fruitful lives. But when it is untreated, they likely \ndevelop other problems, not just with mental illness, but social, job, \nand physical health.\n  Persons with serious mental illness, in treatment, are 15 times less \nlikely to engage in an act of violence than those who are not in \ntreatment.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  In America, some 60 million people in any given year will have some \ndiagnosable mental illness, from the very mild and transient ones, \nwhich we all experience, to severe mental illness, such as \nschizophrenia or bipolar or extreme depression. But of those with \nserious mental illness, about 4 million of those 11 million will not \nhave any treatment for a variety of reasons: treatment may not be \navailable; they may refuse treatment; or what happens so often with \nthose with serious mental illness, they are characteristically unaware \nthat they have an illness--it is a brain illness, a serious mental \nillness--like a person with Alzheimer's or stroke or traumatic brain \ninjury, a person who may not even know that they have a problem.\n  What do we do about this as a nation? Mostly we just talk. Sadly and \ntragically, what we do here in the House of Representatives, we will \nhave a moment of silence, but it is not followed by action. What we \nneed is not more silence. We need action.\n  Madam Speaker, we need people in this country to rise up and say: \nThis is the time. This is the day. This is the issue where we are, once \nand for all, going to do comprehensive reform of our mental health \nsystem in America.\n  Our mental health system in America is fragmented at best, a system \nwith regulations that are abusive and neglectful towards those with \nserious mental illness. And more so, it is worse if you are a minority \nor low-income.\n  This is odd because in a field that is filled with some of the most \ncompassionate and caring people I know, people I have had the pleasure \nto work side by side with in my role as a psychologist, we have Federal \npolicies and State policies that leave their hands tied, their eyes \nblinded, and their mouths gagged to prevent treatment from occurring. \nUltimately, the individuals suffer and their families suffer.\n  Tonight we will review what the problem is and what can be done \nsystemically, thoroughly, and definitively, what this country must do \nif we are serious about treating mental illness.\n  One of my colleagues from the Toledo area, who represents northern \nOhio, is with us now. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. \nKaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank you, Congressman Murphy, for yielding to me. I \nwant to say how fortunate the country is that the people of \nPennsylvania have elected you here to serve the people of our Nation \nwith the strong background that you have and with the obvious depths of \nknowledge that you have about those who are mentally ill and the \ncompassion you have in a field that is very difficult, where the \nanswers still remain incomplete.\n  I want to be on the floor this evening to say to those who are \nlistening in the Chamber, to those who may be listening outside, your \nefforts to draft the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. \n2646, is a watershed moment in this Congress.\n  I have served in this Congress a lot longer than the others on the \nfloor this evening. I was here in 1998 when, sadly, we lost two of our \nCapitol Police officers, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson. A diagnosed \nschizophrenic receiving Federal SSI benefits but off his medicines and \nestranged from his family headed on a rampage all across the country, \nall the way from the West to here, and delusionally, he set out to \nquash, I guess, a purple force he had tracked here to the Capitol.\n  He broke into the majority leader's office. All the staff went under \nthe desks. I thought, well, maybe this is the moment that Congress will \nfinally face up to the violent impulses that have fallen right at our \nknees. I said, but I would wager one of two things will happen: either \nwe will finally cut the mustard and do what is right, or we will have \nmore barricades and armed officers. Well, it was the latter option that \nactually happened.\n  As we mourn the deaths of nine innocent victims at Umpqua Community\n\n[[Page H6827]]\n\nCollege, I commend Congressman Murphy of Pennsylvania for putting a \nbill forward that forces us to probe deeply the pattern of these mass \nshootings. We need to know the perpetrators.\n  We understand the perpetrator in Oregon had served in the U.S. \nmilitary for a very brief time. He was discharged. And my question to \nthe U.S. military is: Why? Why was he discharged? Did you discharge him \nto care if you saw a pattern that needed treatment? Or did you close \nyour eyes too? Because that has happened repeatedly in the U.S. \nmilitary, though I must say that they are doing a little bit better, \nbecause some of their own members have now been killed around the \ncountry because of individuals who face very severe illnesses in their \nown lives and have simply never had the kind of doctor to help them \ncome out of the dark shadows of the existence in which they have been \nliving.\n  Many of these individuals have been abandoned by their families. Many \ntimes they are expelled from school.\n  As you look around the country and you see the people who commit \nthese heinous, heinous crimes and then many times take their own life, \nthey are completely alone or they are living with one member of their \nfamily, abandoned by their other family members and, as the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania has said, many times ending up homeless, the victims \nof attacks themselves, or many times, out of whatever is happening in a \nvery ill brain, taking it out on the rest of society.\n  Probing deeply into mental illness requires a discipline that \nCongressman Murphy has and an understanding that no Congress yet has \nhad. That myopia is symptomatic of what is happening across our Nation: \nmore security but no significant attention to those who show out-of-\ncontrol and violent tendencies, those tragically mentally ill citizens \nwho are driven by their illness to harm others.\n  If someone has a broken back, we have special wards. What happens to \nthe mentally ill in the district that I represent and across this \ncountry, some of them end up in the jail. Seventy-five percent of those \nincarcerated in northern Ohio have dual diagnoses of mental illness and \nsubstance abuse. What does that tell us? Our jails have become the \ndepositories for this Nation's mentally ill.\n\n  I am not saying that individuals diagnosed with mental illness are \nmore likely to commit crimes. I agree with Congressman Murphy that most \nof them become victims of crimes because they aren't thinking straight, \nand it doesn't have to be this way.\n  The bill that Congressman Murphy has written and has vetted and has \nworked with different groups and individuals, and which I support and a \nhost of other Members do on a bipartisan basis, is supported by one of \nthe most important organizations in our country: the National Alliance \non Mental Illness. I have the highest respect for them.\n  H.R. 2646 fixes the Nation's broken mental health system by \nrefocusing programs, reforming grants, and removing Federal barriers to \ncare. It names an assistant secretary for mental illness at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and it encourages more \nmeaningful involvement from family members and caregivers who, frankly, \nat this point, many times, just give up because they have this force \nwithin their homes that they cannot contain.\n  Rather than just paying tribute to those among us who have been lost \nand those who save them at risk to their own lives, cannot we elevate \nthe solution to efforts that could help to prevent further tragedies?\n  We think about the Capitol shootings. We think about Sandy Hook. We \nthink about Virginia Polytechnic. The U.S. leads the world in mass \nshootings. There have been 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone, and each \none gives us an indicator of the possible sign of untreated mental \nillness. Each one represents a failure of our society, and dispelling \nthe stigma of mental illness for those who suffer remains a task \nunfinished.\n  When do the elected Representatives of the American people say, \n``Enough. America can do better. America must do better''? Let's create \na pathway, by passing H.R. 2646, to immediate treatment for those \nmentally ill citizens dangerous to others and dangerous to themselves.\n  Congressman Murphy, I can't thank you enough. I don't recall a bill \nwhich has had such broad bipartisan support. You have worked so hard to \ngo around the country. This is not a partisan issue; this is an \nAmerican issue. I hope America can lead the world in trying to find a \nbetter way.\n  The suffering that we see in our districts, in community after \ncommunity after community, broken families, broken people, this doesn't \nhave to be in our country.\n  In the hearing that you conducted in Cleveland, I learned something \nreally important that I didn't know, and that is that in the way that \nthe reimbursement occurs to hospitals for people seeking care, that \nresearch in mental illness is at the bottom of the list because \nreimbursement doesn't flow the same way. So as we try to find answers \nto what is going on in the human brain, with the secretion of such \nchemicals like dopamine and serotonin and these different chemicals \nthat those who are healthy have being secreted at a normal level, those \nwho do not have that system working for them have big problems; but \nyet, if doctors try to get research dollars to solve and figure out \nwhat is going on in the human brain, the reimbursement system we have \ntoday simply doesn't work. I didn't know that.\n  So I thank you for coming to Ohio because I am focused on that like a \nlaser beam, and it is a part of the answer. So thank you for allowing \nme some time tonight on the floor. The people I represent thank you. We \nwant to help you. I hope those listening will find cosponsors from \ntheir different parts of the country to help you move this bill \nforward. We couldn't do anything more important for the country. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman \nfrom North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers), a member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee and a cosponsor of this bill.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Thank you to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania.\n  I, too, want to thank him for his tireless work on this effort. This \nis such an important piece of legislation in dealing with mental health \nand putting necessary reforms in place. The gentleman has truly been an \nabsolute champion on this issue, and H.R. 2646 is such a meaningful \npiece of legislation that will help in so many different ways.\n  Mental health in this country is a crisis and it is an epidemic, and \nthere are so many families across this country that are dealing with \nthis issue.\n  The gentleman came to my district a little over a year ago, and we \nhad a wonderful roundtable discussion. There were so many individuals \nwho came to it, so many family members who came to it to speak on this \nissue. They were so appreciative of the fact that there was actually \nsome legislation that was being developed to deal with this issue. \nThese are families that have nowhere else to go.\n  In my experience as a nurse, in health care, but then also as my \nexperience has gone forward in taking care of those in my district and \nthen traveling across the country and meeting with families and talking \nwith individuals about how much this affects their lives, and it is \nalmost amazing when you start having the conversation about this piece \nof legislation because I don't even think they think that anybody wants \nto help them anymore. I think they feel so far and left behind that it \nisn't even in their mind that someone is out there looking for an \nanswer and helping in a way that will be meaningful into the future.\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania has done extensive work with so many \ngroups, so many patient advocacy groups. His own personal knowledge as \na child psychologist has played into this issue. There are certain \nbarriers that are in place, and they are in place because we have put \nthem there. Well-meaning, well-intended HIPAA laws, all of these things \nthat have been put in place to help protect patients and their privacy \nand their issues, yet it prevents us from being able to understand the \nsituation. It prevents families from being able to get care for their \nloved ones.\n  Maybe an adult child of parents who are struggling to help their \nchild, their son, their daughter. They may be out\n\n[[Page H6828]]\n\non the streets; they may be at home; they may have issues; they may not \nbe working. I mean, there are so many different things that can be \nhappening, and they know that that individual needs help, and they have \nno one to go to.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Madam Speaker, this legislation will change much of that. It is a \nstep in the right direction. There is much more that needs to be done. \nWe were just talking a moment ago about our jails, our prisons, and how \nmany of those who are within those walls and behind those bars \nliterally are there because they have mental health issues. Yes, they \nmay have committed a crime; yes, they may have found themselves in a \nterrible situation and ended up in jail, possibly even drug abuse; but \nthe bottom line is the mental health issue that lies there.\n  We are talking even about issues of fiscal responsibility in this \ncountry, and I think of how much money we will save and how much of a \ndifference it will make if we deal with this issue in the way that it \nneeds to be dealt with.\n  So, Madam Speaker, I am a cosponsor of this legislation. This is an \nincredibly important piece of legislation. It is bipartisan, and it is \nfor every American in this country, every American in this country that \nis dealing with this issue with a loved one or with a friend. We all \nhave them. We all walk down the streets and see individuals who we know \nare homeless, and we know that the root cause is mental illness. We can \nchange something in this country. This is one change we need to make. \nWe need to come together as a whole House of Representatives to pass \nthis piece of legislation.\n  Again, I just want to finish by thanking the gentleman from \nPennsylvania one more time for his tireless efforts. You have truly \nbeen the champion for every mental health issue, and this piece of \nlegislation passed by the House of Representatives will be a monumental \nstep in the direction of mental health reform.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentlewoman for her comments \nand for her continued pursuit of making sure we pass this.\n  This bill was first introduced over a year ago, reworked with a lot \nof bipartisan input, Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, \nand also from many, many organizations. The other day, some 23 \norganizations delivered a letter to some Members of Congress saying \nthey want to see comprehensive mental health reform.\n  This is the first and the most comprehensive mental health reform our \ncountry has seen. The last time some efforts were made, it was the very \nlast bill that President Kennedy signed before he was assassinated to \nbegin to make some change in our country to move away from the asylums \nand towards community mental health. Unfortunately, that dream only \ncame partially true because what happened is we closed those asylums.\n  Back in the 1950s, we had 550,000 psychiatric hospital beds in this \ncountry. At that time the population of the country was 150 million. \nNow the population of the country is over 316 million, 320 million, and \nwe only have 40,000 psych beds.\n  Now, Madam Speaker, some of that is because we have come up with more \neffective treatments, better ways of identifying and diagnosing people, \nbetter medications, and, quite frankly, those asylums of yesteryear \nneeded to close. Many times they were homes of abuse and given \nnicknames like snake pits, cuckoo's nests, and other derogatory terms \nbecause they were so bad. But then along came community medical health \ncenters, and that was supposed to pick up the slack. As States found \nthat they could close these asylums, they looked and saw that they \ncould save some money, and they didn't put the money into mental health \nservices, nor did the Federal Government. What happened instead was the \npeople traded the hospital bed for the jail cell, for the homeless \nshelter, and for the morgue. That is where we are today.\n  Now, it is not for lack of trying because, indeed, the Federal \nGovernment has spent a lot of money--some $100-plus billion a year--on \nthis, mostly through disability payments, but some for Federal \nprograms.\n  Madam Speaker, what I want to do tonight is now talk about 10 things \nwe can do as a nation to deal with this, 10 things we must do.\n  First of all, the General Accounting Office report that we \ncommissioned from the Energy and Commerce Committee, we said: Tell us \nwhat programs there are in the Federal Government that deal with mental \nhealth and, more specifically, serious mental illness.\n  I was amazed to hear how many there were, 112 agencies scattered \nacross eight departments. It is a dysfunctional and uncoordinated \nsystem. It is a system that really does not have central control. It is \na system that has not even met among these agencies for years, even \nthough one of the agencies, SAMHSA, Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration, is supposed to be the lead agency to say get \ntogether and meet. They hadn't even met since 2009.\n  By the way, when we had a hearing on this in the Oversight and \nInvestigations Subcommittee, they said: Oh, we will start doing that \nsoon. But this report that came out that excoriated the Federal \nprograms said that they are not only uncoordinated, but nobody even \nchecks to see if what they do works. They are programs with the \nDepartment of Defense; Veterans' Affairs; Education, Health and Human \nServices; HUD. The list goes on and on. I think there are 20-plus \nprograms for homelessness. There was redundancy and there was overlap, \nbut it is not coordinated. We make it the most difficult for those who \nhave the most difficulty.\n  So here is number one of what we want to do. We want to have the \noffice of the assistant secretary for mental health and substance abuse \ncreated--a new office, but not new money. We do not need any money for \nthis. We take the current office of SAMHSA and elevate that title of \nthe person who runs that agency to the level of an assistant secretary. \nThat person's job will be to create an annual report to Congress to \ntell us the state of the States, tell us how they spend their money \nthat they get from the Federal level, tell us what are the best \npractices out there that can serve as models for other States, collect \nthat data.\n  Right now what we do get is data on numbers of suicides. We get some \nhomicide data, but we really don't get that much on homeless data. We \nhave so-so quality of data for substance abuse, what happens there. But \nfor the most part, no one asks about these agencies and coordinates \nthem. This person's job is to do this. More so, this person is going to \nhave to be a mental health provider, someone who understands the field. \nThe last Director of SAMHSA was an attorney, perhaps well-intended, but \ndid not understand the field. Just like you would not appoint someone \nto head the Joint Chiefs of Staff to run the Army who is not a general \nor the Navy who is not an admiral, you need someone to run this who \nknows what they are doing.\n\n  In addition to coordinating these agencies, what they would do is \ngive a report to Congress of which ones can be eliminated because they \nare redundant, merge the money together, make more money available, and \nsend more money out to communities. Let Congress then act to revamp \nthese multiple organizations to do what is most effective to get \nfunding back to the communities and to the people where it is needed, \nnot to stay in Washington, D.C.\n  I think President Reagan talked about perhaps some proof of eternity \nis a Federal program. What we don't want to have here is the \ncontinuation of programs that exist just for the sake of employment. \nPrograms should exist for the sake of doing the right thing for people \nout there, and right now, we have a failure.\n  The second item is to drive evidence-based care. Another General \nAccounting Office report which came out talked about some of the \nabysmal conditions here. They were saying that agencies had difficulty \nidentifying programs supporting individuals with serious mental illness \nbecause they didn't always track whether or not such individuals were \namong those served by the program.\n  Again, SAMHSA in the past--which is supposed to lead these \norganizations--doesn't really track to say: What are the evidence-based \nprograms you are doing? When we had a hearing on these issues, SAMHSA \ntold me afterwards they would change nothing.\n\n[[Page H6829]]\n\nThey do list some evidence-based programs, but the evidence base is \noftentimes people who do programs and say: Take my word for it, it \nworks.\n  If it works, why do we have millions of people with mental illness? \nWhy do we have 4 million people not getting any care at all? Why do we \ncontinue to fill our jails, homeless shelters, and morgues with people \nwith mental illness? There are some excellent programs out there, quite \nfrankly, but there are also many that need to be changed.\n  As part of this process, it was stated in the GAO report that many of \nthe programs hadn't completed their evaluations, many had no \nevaluations, some were underway, and 17 programs had no evaluation \ncompleted and none planned. So the government was not even looking to \nsee if what they were doing had any value. We are going to change that, \nMadam Speaker. We are going to make sure the programs that are out \nthere have evidence-based care.\n  The National Child Traumatic Stress Network is an excellent program \nthat does a great job. Another program is called RAISE, Response After \nInitial Schizophrenia Episode. It does a great job because they work in \nterms of getting care early in someone's life when they first show \nsymptoms. It is called the prodromal stage. When you get to someone \nearly, you improve their prognosis. But a lot of these other programs--\nand I will highlight some of the sloppy and irrational programs we have \nout here tonight--can make a difference if they are done the right way.\n  Madam Speaker, it is important to note that with regard to serious \nmental illness, about 50 percent of those with serious mental illness, \nit will emerge by age 14, and about 75 percent of the cases by age 24. \nEvery time a person has what the public popularly knows as a breakdown, \nor we refer to it as a psychological or psychiatric crisis, there is \nharm that occurs to the person, psychological harm and neurological \nharm, because it is a brain disease. So it is important to get to \npeople early on. That is why we want evidence-based care that really \nand truly does that and not programs that are fluff. We want them to \nhave outcome measures and determine them.\n  By the way, Madam Speaker, just the opposite of that, some of the \nthings that SAMHSA has funded in the past have also been programs \nspecifically geared toward telling people to stop taking their \nmedication. When people have anxiety, they have plans in telling you \nhow to drink a fruit smoothie. None of those are evidence-based care, \nand none of those treat people with serious mental illness.\n  Number three, go to the mental health workforce. We have a serious, \nserious shortage here of providers. Even if you wanted to get care, you \ncan't get care in many counties. I think perhaps one-fourth or one-\nthird of counties in Oregon do not even have a psychiatrist in them. \nMany do not have a clinical psychologist or clinical social workers or \npeer support teams with the adequacy to meet the need. It is the same \nacross the Nation.\n  What happens here is there are about 9,000 child psychiatrists in \nthis country. We need 30,000, precisely for the reason I said before, \nthat these problems emerge during those adolescent and young adult \nyears. If you don't have the right qualified people, you can't treat \nthem. Similarly, clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, \nclinical social workers, and peer support teams specifically trained \nand available to be out there, we have massive shortages.\n  Part of the job of the assistant secretary is going to be to identify \nwhat do we need in communities and how do we get them. Our bill \nauthorizes, for the first time, minorities to work with fellowships.\n  We also authorize people to be volunteers at community health \ncenters. This is one of the bizarre things that only the Federal \nGovernment can do. If you want to work at a community health center, \nyou can work, and your medical malpractice insurance is covered. If you \nwant to volunteer, it is not there.\n  Now, think about this. If there are some well-intended and \ncompassionate--as I know many are--mental health providers who want to \nvolunteer maybe an afternoon a week, give of their time to help, they \nare not allowed to do it because the center can't afford their \nmalpractice insurance because they would have to pay the regular rate \nas opposed to a Federal plan rate. Our bill also authorizes that they \ncan volunteer.\n\n  We also authorize programs with telemedicine so that when a \npediatrician or a family member identifies someone in need of care, \nthey can access them immediately if need be, especially in rural areas \nand faraway areas where there is not enough support there.\n  The next one is the shortage of mental health beds. I had mentioned \nearlier this grave shortage where we had 550,000 beds in the 1950s; we \nhave 40,000 today. It is a serious crisis-level shortage in every \ncommunity.\n  During one of our hearings, Senator Creigh Deeds, a State senator in \nVirginia, testified. Many are familiar with his story. He was a former \ngubernatorial candidate in Virginia, and he took his son, Gus, with him \noftentimes campaigning around the State of Virginia.\n  Gus played a musical instrument, and they enjoyed their time \ntogether; but sadly, Gus deteriorated. When his father, who raised him, \nfed him, and clothed him, took him to a hospital for care, the hospital \nsaid: We don't have any psych beds.\n  As they made calls and tried to find more in Virginia, they couldn't \nfind any. Young Gus was sent home with his father. They wouldn't \nprovide many details, but they sent Gus home. Gus took a knife and \nattacked his father, nearly killing him. Creigh escaped, and Gus then \nkilled himself, all because of a lack of beds.\n  Madam Speaker, there was a story last week in The Washington Post \nabout another Virginia man, a 24-year-old man who was arrested for $5 \nworth of shoplifting at a 7-Eleven in Virginia. He was taken to jail \nfor shoplifting. But upon recognizing that he had a serious mental \nillness, they wanted to get him to a hospital. Again, there weren't \nbeds available. So he stayed in that jail, I believe, over 70 days, \noften naked, covered in his own feces, refusing to eat, and losing 40 \npounds. Ultimately, he died for lack of a bed.\n  Now, that is not the only problem that is out there. Understand that \nwe don't want to bring back those asylums, but when a person is in that \ncrisis mode, it is not appropriate to bring them to a jail.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  It is not appropriate to leave them in an emergency room for hours or \ndays or weeks sometimes waiting for a hospital bed to open up, and it \ncertainly is inappropriate to discharge someone without any wraparound \nservices or care.\n  But what happens is, when you have a bed shortage, you cannot get \ncare for crisis by qualified persons. We don't have the providers. We \ndon't have the places.\n  It is important for someone to have a clean and calm and caring \nenvironment separate from other environmental stresses and problems so \nyou can work with them and stabilize them, perhaps get them on \nmedication, help them relax, help organize things for home care or \noutpatient care for them. Sometimes that takes a few days. Sometimes \nthat takes a couple weeks. But the idea is you need a place for them.\n  Without beds, oftentimes a staff simply cannot do a thorough \nevaluation and they sometimes then will simply make an uninformed and \npremature release of the individual, of the consumer, saying, ``Well, \nhe doesn't seem that bad. We will send him home,'' not really \nunderstanding whether or not that person is a threat to themselves or \nsomeone else.\n  Understand this, that even with the brain diseases of schizophrenia \nand bipolar, when questioned, someone could be in a position where, \nwhen asked if they are going to harm themselves or someone else, they \nwould say, ``No. I am fine. Really, it is okay. It was just a \ndisagreement I had.'' They can keep it together for a little bit.\n  And if a staff is already saying: Look, we don't have hospital beds. \nLet's send him home,'' they will be sent home without really knowing \nthe seriousness of their illness or providing full services.\n  Further, if you want to evaluate if someone is a threat to harm \nthemselves or someone else or in imminent\n\n[[Page H6830]]\n\ndanger of that, many times the doctors and the courts are reluctant to \ngo through that process. Many times they are looking for another out.\n  And many times--like in Pennsylvania, it is called a 302 procedure--\nthey will bypass that or they will say to the patient, ``Can you just \nvoluntarily commit yourself or promise you will be okay and you will go \nout and get care?''\n  I want to add this because it is very important while the President \nand other people are talking about access to guns and talking about \nbackground checks. You can't do a background check if you don't have a \nbackground record--you can't do a background check if you don't have a \nbackground record--and if there is no place to help people when they \nare in crisis.\n  And if doctors and judges are not going to have someone involuntarily \ncommitted, there is no record. There is nothing that can appear on the \nnational list to prevent a person from purchasing a firearm.\n  There was no time spent in a hospital where staff can truly evaluate \nare these delusions and hallucinations which can be controlled with \nmedication, will the person be stabilized, are they a risk threat. You \ncan't do that. We need more beds, and our bill says there will be more.\n  This is one of those areas of incredible prejudices and bigotry. You \nsee, Medicaid has this rule that, if you are between the ages of 21 and \n64, you cannot go into a private hospital that has more than 16 beds. \nNow, think about that.\n  If you have money, you can go in a hospital. If you are low income, \nyou are out of luck. You are on the street. It is a different standard \nthat is grossly unfair and incredibly prejudicial. And again I go to \nthis point, that those who are minorities or low income are treated the \nworst.\n  A person is ten times more likely to be treated in a jail cell than \nin a hospital if they are seriously mentally ill--ten times more \nlikely. And, yet, that treatment in a jail cell is not appropriate at \nall.\n  It is not treatment. Oftentimes they are put in isolation. They may \nget in a fight with a guard. What started off as a small charge may end \nup as a felony assault charge.\n  A person with serious mental illness oftentimes for the same crime \nwill spend four times the amount in jail as a person who is not \nmentally ill. And all along, if we had the proper place to treat them, \nwe could have done that.\n  Our bill lifts this 16-bed cap, this ridiculously absurd 16-bed cap, \nand says, instead, we would like to have an average length of stay of \nless than 30 days. That can be achieved. In about 98 percent of cases, \nit can be achieved.\n  And, by the way, it is far less expensive to have someone in a \npsychiatric hospital bed than an emergency room by about four times. \nSome studies have gone as high as saying it is about 20 times less \nexpensive to have them in outpatient care than in a jail cell.\n  We would save a lot more money if we fixed this crisis shortage, \nworked on other outpatient care to transition people out, and wrap them \naround with the necessary services so they could go out more stable.\n  Point number five: We eliminate the same day doctor barrier, another \none of those ridiculously prejudicial rules out there that Medicaid has \nthat harms those of low income.\n  I mentioned a number of times that the prodromal stages of \nadolescents and young adulthood is when serious mental illness begins \nto emerge, those first symptoms that sometimes someone may think is a \nlittle bit strange, there is something different about this person. \nPerhaps their grades are dropping. Perhaps they are not taking care of \nthemselves the way they used to. Perhaps they are withdrawing from \nrelationships and friends.\n  Those could be early signs of a bigger problem. But it takes, between \nfirst symptoms and first professional treatment, on average, 110 weeks, \nover 2 years, of waiting time between first symptoms, in part, because \npeople are not aware of what to look for in the symptoms, but, in part, \nbecause they are not connected with other providers here and, even when \nthey are, they are not allowed to do anything.\n  The same day doctor rule is a Medicaid rule which says you can't see \ntwo doctors in the same day at the same location.\n  So here is the problem. If a pediatrician says to a mother or father, \n``We are very concerned about your teenage son''--who is in the later \nyears, 17 or so--``I would like him to see a psychiatrist right away \nbecause I am very concerned about the behaviors you are describing to \nme'' and then, when that doctor realizes that that person is on \nMedicaid, basically, Medicaid says, ``We are not paying for it,'' how \ncruel and abusive is that, to say to someone, ``Just because you have \nlow income we are not going to cover the services here'' when this is a \ncritical time?\n  When you have that warm hand-off in the doctor's office, there is a \n95 percent likelihood that the person will follow up, according to a \nstudy by Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.\n  When you wait and you say, ``Here is the number. Call it another \nday,'' that likelihood drops below 45 percent.\n  And when you miss that golden opportunity to help a person in times \nof need, that person may be very reluctant to come back for care in the \nfuture. We fix this by saying we are going to drop that same day doctor \nrule.\n  Number six: We have to empower parents and caregivers to be part of \nthe solution. Twenty years ago HIPAA laws came out that said, ``In \norder to help your insurance be portable, we want to protect the \nrecords.'' Good idea. ``We wanted to make sure records had privacy.'' \nGood idea.\n  But HIPAA moved from the place where we are supposed to assist care \nand confidentiality to the point where it impairs care. It has gone too \nfar. Let me give you a couple of examples.\n  Right now a doctor--and I am a psychologist. If I know a family \nmember brings someone in to see me, I can listen to them in a very \npassive mode, but I can't provide them any information. That is \nhelpful. They are giving me vital information for history.\n  If I don't have the accurate history, a provider does not have \naccurate history, you can't accurately diagnose. You don't know if the \nperson has been on medication before, does it work or not work, who has \nthis person seen before, what sets them off, are they doing better, \nwhat are their symptoms.\n  If I don't have or a provider does not have that information, they \nmay miss making the accurate diagnosis and then not be able to provide \nproper treatment and follow-up. When that occurs, harm can follow.\n  Now, if I get the information, great. But what happens if that family \nmember is not there? The provider can't go out and seek other family \nmembers and friends to get that information because HIPAA laws are seen \nas barriers to that.\n  Because as soon as a doctor at a hospital calls and says, ``Your \nadult son is in the hospital. I need to ask you some information about \nit,'' that doctor has already violated HIPAA laws by identifying the \nperson's son is in a hospital.\n  Now, think about this, though. A parent, the person who was caring \nand loving throughout a lifetime, committed to their family member, a \nbrother, a sister, someone's mother or father, they are prohibited from \nbeing part of the care team by HIPAA laws.\n  A stranger, some appointed worker, someone who may see them as they \nroll in and out of their job, even if they care and they burn out, they \nwill be maybe sitting next to a family member in court and simply say, \n``I can't tell you anything about this family member. You will have to \nfind out for yourself.''\n  Here is another problem, though. Not only are you impaired from \ngetting diagnostic information, you can't evaluate medications. But \nunderstand that people with serious mental illness are often at high \nrisk for other medical problems, in part, because their hygiene may be \npoor, they may not take care of themselves, may not see doctors, et \ncetera.\n  But they also are in a situation where they may take some medications \nthat make them high risk for diabetes or heart disease. And without \ngetting a family member to help them with that, they do not have the \nability to properly treat them.\n  My goal in this bill is to simply say that, in cases where someone \nhas diminished capacity to take care of themselves where, in absence of \ntreatment, they become gravely disabled, a provider may tell a known \ncaregiver--so notice I have already set the bar pretty high--may tell a \nknown caregiver a few simple facts: the diagnosis,\n\n[[Page H6831]]\n\nthe treatment plan, the treating doctors, time and place of \nappointment, and what are the medications they are on. No therapy notes \nare allowed to be exchanged. We specifically prohibit that in this \nbill. But that is important.\n  And, by the way, I might add one other thing. As I hear a lot of \npeople talking about the concerns of why didn't a parent do anything, \nwhy didn't they know anything in some cases, like the young man at \nVirginia Tech who killed so many students or the gentlemen in Oregon or \nat Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, it is because providers \ncannot do a risk assessment.\n  They cannot contact a family member and say, ``Can you tell me if \nthis person has any morbid fantasy and fascination with death, with \nextremely violent video games, with dark Web sites? Do they have \nweapons that are unsecured? Do they talk about violent issues? Have \nthey made threats before?'' You can't do that risk assessment. Without \nthat, you end up not knowing the risk.\n  Number seven: States receive money for mental health services and \nsubstance abuse disorders. Those dollars are about $500 million for \nmental health and about $600 to $700 million for substance abuse. The \nodd thing about this is States are not allowed to mingle that money. \nThey can't braid it together.\n  Even worse is that many people with a substance abuse disorder have a \nmental illness and many people with mental illness will turn toward \nother substances to self-medicate. And, yet, the person will have to go \nto two different providers, two different clinics, to get care instead \nof one. We drop that barrier and say Federal grants should go to States \nin a way that help the States work this best.\n\n  Number eight: We want to bring accountability to the spending of \nFederal funds. Now, here is where we have seen in another GAO report \nthe absolute absurdity and cruelty of how money is spent.\n  A GAO report done this last summer told us that many times documents \nand applications for many who receive grants were not reviewed. They \ncouldn't tell you what the application criterion was to get an award. \nThey didn't have program-specific guidance. Information was missing or \nnot readily available. They didn't even know where it was stored. You \ncouldn't follow the paper trail to see where it was. And so what \nhappens is no one knows how this money was spent.\n  But let me tell you some of the absurd things we have found money is \nspent on, our tax dollars. How about this? A Web site last winter was \nposted by SAMHSA for the people of Boston to help them with their \nworries about snow. That is right. They posted a 1-800 number you could \ncall if you had snow anxiety. These are people from New England, for \ngoodness sake. They know how to handle snow. But our tax dollars went \nto help them understand it.\n  There are Web sites that tell you to drink a fruit smoothie if you \nare anxious, programs that tell you how to make a mask, programs that \nwe fund to how to make collages, a painting in SAMHSA's headquarters \nthat cost $22,500 of two people sitting on a rock surrounded by other \npeople--$22,000.\n  When we asked the director of SAMHSA what that was for, they said it \nis more mental health awareness. The only thing I am aware of is it is \na waste of money and that money could have gone to help pay someone's \nsalary to actually treat a patient.\n  Well, it gets worse. A Web site for 3-year-old children, the cost of \n$426,000, with animated characters and sing-along songs. The purpose, \nwe asked the director of SAMHSA, prevention. ``Prevention of what?'', \nwe said. ``Well, we think prevention is good.'' ``Well, what does this \nprevent and what does it do and does it work and does it do anything?'' \nWe waited for weeks to get an answer and we still don't have it 1 month \nlater. By the way, they took the Web site down when we shined a bright \nlight on it, saying, ``What does this do?''\n  We want accountability to this spending. There will be different \ngrant programs now--demonstration grants, innovation grants--where \npeople will know what these grants are. They can look at them as \nscientific studies in a blind review to make sure it is going to \nquality programs that really make sense. No more of this behavioral \nwellness stuff, but truly working at things that make a difference.\n  Number nine: Develop alternatives to institutionalization and have \nreal jail diversion. I said already what happens to so many people with \nmental illness. They end up in jail. Forty to sixty percent of people \nin prison have a mental illness.\n  And what this does is it helps provide some extra funding for States \nthat have wraparound services for those who have this history of \nviolent incarcerations, arrests, mental illness.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  New York has a program called Assisted Outpatient Treatment. Their \nprogram, which means a judge will say you need to stay in treatment at \nan outpatient level, has found they reduced incarcerations by 81 \npercent. They reduced homelessness by over 70 percent. They reduced \nadmissions to emergency rooms by over 70 percent. They had patient \nsatisfaction, consumer satisfaction at over 90 percent. And they cut \ncosts in half.\n  States have different programs here. About 46 States have something \non the books. But many of these States do not put these programs in \npractice because of the big cost. We know States will save a lot of \nmoney once they start doing this.\n  But what we want to do is take people out of this cycle, this \nrevolving door of jail and risk and more damage, and say that States \nneed to have programs where it wraps around services for that person. \nDon't just dump them from jail onto the streets and expect a problem \nbecause it will erupt again. Make sure those services are there. Make \nsure the person stays in treatment.\n  Now some say, well, that is unfair. Some say that might be an \ninvoluntary commitment, that it puts people there against their will \nand you impair their rights.\n  But I say this, that a person with serious mental illness 40 percent \nof the time is not even aware they have a problem and so many times \nthey refuse treatment or their past run-ins with the police and other \nhospitals because they don't want to be there, they don't want to get \ntreatment.\n  If we provide quality, compassionate, accessible care, they may get \nthat, but not under the current system. We want to make sure they have \nthat care, and we will provide the funding to do it.\n  Number 10, advance early intervention and prevention programs: A lot \nof what our government spends money on is what is called primary \nprevention, the things we do for everybody, like don't smoke, wear a \nseat belt.\n  But what happens is, in the area of mental illness, those wellness \nprograms like I described before that are out there, the silly things \nthat SAMHSA does, are not an effective use of dollars.\n  Secondary and tertiary prevention is valuable. Secondary is when you \nrecognize someone is at risk, but not with symptoms. Tertiary is when \nthey have symptoms and you try and help them get better.\n  By focusing money on the programs I mentioned before--the RAISE \nprogram or others, the Child and Adolescent Traumatic Stress Network--\nyou can move the dollars where they need to be funded and stop this \nsilliness.\n  Now, I should say this while I am talking about SAMHSA, that despite \ntwo GAO reports that criticize them--and one time afterwards I had the \ndirector of SAMHSA in my office and I said, ``Okay. Here is your \nopportunity. Would you change anything?'' And she said, ``No. I \nwouldn't change a thing.''\n  Another time during one of our hearings one of my colleagues said, \n``On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate yourself on your \nprograms?'' And the director said, ``I would give myself a 10,'' \ndespite all these failures.\n  That is the reason why we need to have an assistant secretary of \nmental health. That is the reason why we need to make these changes. \nThis is the current reason why we have so many of these problems.\n  Before I wrap up here, I want to yield a couple of minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), who has also been involved \nin the field of wellness and is also a supporter of this bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania for yielding and for\n\n[[Page H6832]]\n\nleading on this incredibly important issue that is before us.\n  I rise in support of Congressman Murphy's bill, H.R. 2646, the \nHelping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015. You know this \nsignificant piece of legislation aims to address the fact that millions \nof Americans who suffer from a serious mental illness are going without \ntreatment, as families and caregivers struggle to find support in a \ndisorganized healthcare system.\n  I practiced rehabilitation services for 28 years before I had the \nprivilege and honor in 2009 to come to work on behalf of the citizens \nof Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District. Part of my career was \nworking acute psychiatric services, working with people that were \nexperiencing some of the most chronic and reoccurring disabling \nconditions that are out there.\n  Many times the system that we are in only really responded when \npeople were in crisis, but it only responded to the point that the \nperson was no longer a danger to themselves or someone else.\n  The system did not allow for the types of resources to be deployed \nand the care to be provided to really meet the needs of these \nindividuals to stop the cycle.\n  It was really a privilege and honor to work with many different \nindividuals and many different family members.\n  But I am so excited about this step that we are taking with this \nbill, and I really encourage leadership. This is a bill whose time is \nnow. We need to elevate it to the House and to the Senate. This needs \nto be on the President's desk because we can make a difference in \npeople's lives with this bill.\n  It is hard to deny the staggering consequences of neglecting our \nmental health system. Suicide rates are at the highest they have been \nin more than 25 years. Our nationwide shortage of psychiatric beds is \nnearly at 100,000. The three largest mental health hospitals in the \nUnited States are classified as criminal incarceration facilities, \nprisons.\n  I have taken the opportunity--I think it is important--to make visits \nto our prisons within the congressional district. I have done that. I \nhave more of those visits coming up.\n  It is very apparent to me that, as we have closed in the past \nfacilities that perhaps we could have improved upon versus closing, all \nwe did was shift people to the streets and from the streets to the \nprisons.\n  So many people today have a dual diagnosis, some type of psychiatric \ndiagnosis, but also a substance abuse diagnosis, which tends to be a \npart of that spiral. And your heart breaks to see that.\n\n  If we want to reduce our prison population and the cost that it takes \nto maintain individuals, then this bill is a good step in that \ndirection of breaking that cycle. I would argue that this bill will \nhelp have a cost savings over time, short term and certainly long term.\n  Congressman Murphy has taken a compassionate and evidence-based \napproach to reforming the way the Federal Government addresses mental \nhealth.\n  H.R. 2646 breaks down barriers for families. It encourages innovative \nmodels of care. It advances early intervention and prevention programs.\n  Notably, it employs telepsychiatry to reach underserved and rural \npopulation areas where patients have difficulty accessing needed care. \nI know for a fact using telepsychiatry reduces the stigma of reaching \nout for help.\n  I authored a bill that has become law. It is called the STEP law, the \nServicemember Telemedicine Electronic Portability Act, which we really \ndid this for our military, our Active-Duty military Reserve and Guard.\n  We changed the law a few years back with a piece of legislation that \nhas expanded telemedicine that is used by the Department of Defense, \nand it really has helped save lives. It has not been the only thing we \nhave done, but it was a valuable part in the reduction of the suicide \nrate among our military.\n  So we know the many provisions within this bill are tested. They are \nproven. There are lives to be improved and lives to be saved. It \nrecognizes the important role of the family, the caregiver.\n  Now, these are some of the most chronic and recurring conditions, and \nyou need a strong support system. The way our system is today, it \nexcludes those family members.\n  So there is just a lot to support here, and I am certainly proud to \ndo it.\n  It is important that we make a commitment to address mental health \nwith the same urgency as we do physical health.\n  I will remain steadfast in my support for H.R. 2646, and I encourage \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. In my closing minute, let me say this: As \nI opened up, this will be known as the bloody summer of 2015. Let this \ntime be the autumn of our compassion in 2015.\n  The time is now. We have 40 newspapers around this country that have \npublished endorsements for this legislation. We have 133 bipartisan \ncosponsors.\n  I plead with my colleagues to please become a cosponsor to this bill. \nI beg leadership. Let's no longer have a blind eye to this, let's no \nlonger have a moment of silence, and let this be the time of our \naction.\n  Let's pass H.R. 2646, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis \nAct, and let's bring compassion and care to the many families in \nAmerica who are suffering from mental illness and show them that that \ntwilight, as the sun sets, is indicating that there soon will be a dawn \nof great hope in America.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/06/house-section/article/H6832-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF ESTABLISHING A \n   SELECT INVESTIGATIVE PANEL OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE\n\n  Ms. FOXX (during the Special Order of Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania), \nfrom the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.
