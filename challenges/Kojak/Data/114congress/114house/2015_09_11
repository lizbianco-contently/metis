Instead, the price is going up. Rates are going up.\n  So this action is, indeed, a strike for our constitutional values, \nthe ones we fought for, the ones we memorialized, the ones that are \ndear to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5945-7", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    14TH ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY.

Mr. Speaker, today marks 14 years since September 11, \n2001, a day when thousands of Americans lost their lives in a terrorist \nattack carried out by al Qaeda. On that day, we united as a Nation in \nresponse to a tragedy too terrible to fathom.\n  Today I remain thankful for our first responders, our firefighters, \npolice, and many others who displayed courage and strength in helping \nout all impacted by the attacks.\n  This day also reminds us to reflect on the dedication of the men and \nwomen in our Armed Forces. Thousands have served honorably in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and in the war on terror since September 11. We are \nthankful for their\n\n[[Page H5946]]\n\nsacrifice and willingness to stand for American interests across the \nglobe.\n  We all remember where we were on that fateful day 14 years ago, and \nwe all recognize where we stand today. Our Nation faces greater dangers \nand higher stakes than ever before.\n  The threat of a nuclear Iran remains all too real. That is why any \ndeal with Iran or any other country must be verifiable, enforceable, \nand accountable. Iran has been a chief sponsor of terrorism across the \nglobe. A nuclear Iran is a threat to everyone everywhere.\n  It is not just about us. It is about our worldwide stability. The \nsafety of the American people is not a partisan priority. It is an \nAmerican priority.\n  After closely reviewing the details of the unveiled agreement, it is \nclear this plan will not adequately deter the threat of a nuclear Iran \nnor safeguard the well-being of our citizens and national security \ninterests.\n  I hope that we can all remember, today especially, how crucial it is \nto protect ourselves, our children, and future generations against this \nhuge threat throughout the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5946-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FIRST SERGEANT P.

Mr. Speaker, last month Rhode Island and the United \nStates lost a hero when First Sergeant P. Andrew McKenna, an Army Green \nBeret serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, was killed during an attack on a \nNATO facility. He ran into danger so that the lives of hundreds of his \nfellow soldiers would be spared and, in doing so, lost his own life.\n  During his 17 years of service, Sergeant McKenna completed five tours \nof duty in Afghanistan and one in Iraq. His patriotism, loyalty, and \nsense of duty embodied all of the best values of Rhode Island and our \nentire Nation.\n  I was fortunate to meet Sergeant McKenna just 2 months ago at the \nBristol Fourth of July parade, where he was presented with a flag flown \nover the United States Capitol. I am grateful that I had this \nopportunity to thank him for his service to our country.\n  As we mark the 14th anniversary of the September 11 attacks today, it \nis important to remember there are still nearly 10,000 American troops \nserving in Afghanistan. We owe them and all of our men and women in \nuniform our gratitude for the sacrifices they have made so that we can \nall enjoy freedom and live safely.\n  My thoughts continue to be with Sergeant McKenna's parents, Carol and \nPeter, and his entire family during this incredibly difficult time. It \nis my hope that the heartfelt gratitude of our entire Nation will be a \nsource of comfort to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5946-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    14TH ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11\n\n  (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark the 14th anniversary \nof the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a horrific day that \nchanged our Nation forever, as terrorists killed thousands of innocent \npeople in lower Manhattan, the fields of Pennsylvania, and at the \nPentagon. We must never forget that day.\n  We saw good rise in the face of evil and heroes rise in the face of \ndanger. When the day was over, we learned that thousands of Americans \nhad lost their lives, 700 from my own State. We witnessed neighbors and \nfriends consoling one another and watched as Americans from all walks \nof life stood united together, side by side.\n  As America rebounded, we responded to these acts of terrorism with \nthe skill of our military and our first responders. This is a war we \ncontinue to fight. It began without provocation, without warning. It \nwas not a war of our own choosing, but it became a war of our priority. \nIt continues today.\n  It is the solemn duty of every Member of the House to protect the \nsecurity of our Nation and our citizens. In today's dangerous and \nchaotic world, we begin to honor that responsibility by pledging never \nto forget that day 14 years ago.\n  May God bless those who defend America, and may God continue to bless \nthe United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5946-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    14TH ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11\n\n  (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, this morning, at 8:46, across America there \nwas a moment of silence and remembrance that, on the morning of \nSeptember 11, 2001, the world witnessed a horrific attack against our \nNation.\n  The profound, unfathomable casualties shattered our sense of safety. \nYet, out of the ashes of the fallen World Trade Center towers, the \ncrushed concrete of the Pentagon, and the burning fields of \nPennsylvania, Americans rose united. We comforted strangers. We \nstrengthened community. Hope prevailed over hatred. Resilience defeated \nfear.\n  Americans will never forget where we were on that day. We must always \nremember what happened that day.\n  President Lincoln once cautioned of the silent artillery of time \nwearing away at our memories. He was referencing those who had lost \ntheir lives in the Civil War.\n  We pray that the years might ease the pain of the bereaved and that \nit would be a comfort to them that we will never forget.\n  Young people born after 9/11 are coming of age in a world that knows \nthat no attack will ever destroy America's ideals of liberty, freedom, \nand equality of opportunity for all people. Terrorism will never \ntriumph over justice. That is a goal of terrorists: to instill terror, \ninstill fear. They have failed.\n  We have emerged even more committed to protecting the liberties that \nhave long distinguished our Nation from regimes that rely on \ndivisiveness and hatred.\n  We honor the thousands of people we lost that day and those we lost \nto 9/11-related illnesses in the years that followed. We must remember \nthose heroes of 9/11. In remembering them, we must honor our \ncommitments to them, whether it is access to health care for those who \nwere affected by 9/11.\n  The selfless first responders--firefighters, police officers, and \ncourageous citizens who helped save lives, searched for survivors, and \njeopardized their own safety to rescue others--represent the very best \nof humanity.\n  May we forever remember the spirit of September 11, 2001, and strive \nto build a future based on the hope and unity that emerged from the \nashes that day. And may we always remember that, on this day, as we \ndiscuss this issue, we are walking on sacred ground. May we treat it \nwith dignity and respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5946-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               IRAN DEAL\n\n  (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, on this historic day of 9/11, a \nday in 2001 when terrorists killed thousands of Americans on United \nStates soil and a day in 2012 when terrorists killed four Americans in \nBenghazi, Libya, I stand today in strong opposition to the Iranian \nnuclear deal, a deal with Iran, a leading state sponsor of terror.\n  Every day that goes by another story comes out about why we shouldn't \nsupport the deal. The head of Iran's military has said they will never \naccept the deals restrictions on arms capabilities.\n  The AP recently uncovered that key verification provisions are buried \nin a pair of confidential side agreements that Congress doesn't even \nhave that will allow Iran to inspect its own nuclear capabilities.\n  Just last week the Supreme Leader of Iran changed the rules of the \ngame, saying that Iran will not comply with their side of the deal \nunless sanctions are lifted and not merely suspended.\n  This is a deeply flawed deal, and I know we can do better. America is \nstill the most prosperous and powerful country on Earth and the \nprotector of freedom and stability in the world. We must do better for \nthe victims of 9/11 and the victims of Benghazi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5946-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5946-H5947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0915\n               OCEANS AND CLIMATE CHANGE: SEA LEVEL RISE\n\n  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House\n\n[[Page H5947]]\n\nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, on this very solemn day, where we \ncommemorate those that gave their lives, I rise on behalf of the Safe \nClimate Caucus to bring to the House another unfortunate new reality. \nMore frequent flooding is going to be occurring now because of climate \nchange.\n  We are already seeing sea level rise; that is without doubt, and that \nhas resulted in the frequency of nuisance flooding in coastal \ncommunities. Cities across America are experiencing nuisance flooding. \nThere is a rise in nuisance flooding between 1960 and the present of up \nto 900 percent throughout the country. From 300 to 900 percent, it is \nmore often.\n  When rising sea levels combine with natural climate patterns like \nthis year's El Nino, even higher rates of nuisance flooding will occur.\n  For example, in my district, nuisance flooding threatens my entire \nLong Beach Peninsula and the Alamitos Bay. Flooding roads mean a loss \nof work or school days, and eroded beaches can have a negative impact \non property values.\n  Today's floods are tomorrow's high tides. That is why Congress must \nact on climate change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5947-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            GREAT RUN BY THE COON RAPIDS LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN.

SUSPENSION OF AUTHORITY TO WAIVE, SUSPEND, REDUCE, \n                   PROVIDE RELIEF FROM, OR OTHERWISE LIMIT THE \n                   APPLICATION OF SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO AN \n                   AGREEMENT RELATED TO THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM OF \n                   IRAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, prior to January 21, 2017, the President may not--\n       (1) waive, suspend, reduce, provide relief from, or \n     otherwise limit the application of sanctions described in \n     subsection (b) or refrain from applying any such sanctions; \n     or\n       (2) remove a foreign person listed in Attachment 3 or \n     Attachment 4 to Annex II of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \n     Action from the list of specially designated nationals and \n     blocked persons maintained by the Office of Foreign Asset \n     Control of the Department of the Treasury.\n       (b) Sanctions Described.--The sanctions described in this \n     subsection are--\n       (1) the sanctions described in sections 4 through 7.9 of \n     Annex II of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; and\n       (2) the sanctions described in any other agreement related \n     to the nuclear program of Iran that includes the United \n     States, commits the United States to take action, or pursuant \n     to which the United States commits or otherwise agrees to \n     take action, regardless of the form it takes, whether a \n     political commitment or otherwise, and regardless of whether \n     it is legally binding or not.\n       (c) Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action'' \n     means the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed at \n     Vienna on July 14, 2015, by Iran and by the People's Republic \n     of China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United \n     Kingdom and the United States, with the High Representative \n     of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security \n     Policy, and all implementing materials and agreements related \n     to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 2 hours, \nwith 30 minutes controlled by the chair of the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs or his designee, 30 minutes controlled by the chair of the \nCommittee on Ways and Means or his designee, and 1 hour controlled by \nthe minority leader or her designee.\n  The gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), and \nthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and to submit extraneous \nmaterials on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which would \nprohibit the President from waiving Iran sanctions and prevent the \nimplementation of this fatally flawed agreement.\n  Last night, we spent many hours debating this agreement. We heard \nfrom\n\n[[Page H5948]]\n\nMembers on both sides of the aisle, Members who have deep concerns \nabout where we are headed.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's be very clear. This isn't just a bad deal; it is a \ndisastrous deal. It is a disaster for the United States; it is a \ndisaster for our allies and friends in the region, including Israel.\n  When you think about it, when we think about the letter that we \nsent--84 percent of us in this House signed a letter asking for four \ncritical things in this negotiation--we got rolled on every one of the \nfour. Iran won on every point.\n  Iran gets to keep its nuclear infrastructure. The Obama \nadministration collapsed on the issue of verification. We don't have \nanywhere, anytime inspections in here. We have got self-inspections by \nthe Iranian regime with respect to Parchin, which is the one military \nsite where we know--we know--that the Iranians, because of 1,000 pages \nof documents, did most of their bomb work.\n  They say now: No, no, no, we will do the inspections. We will turn \nthat stuff over, but nobody is going into our military sites.\n  That is the argument they are making.\n  The sunset clause in this means that key parts of this deal expire at \nthe end of the deal. We have got permanent sanctions relief for the \nIranian regime, relief that is going to go into their military, in \nexchange for temporary constraints on Iran's nuclear program.\n  The restrictions on Iran's missile program designed to deliver those \nweapons--now, this came up in the eleventh hour of this negotiation. No \none anticipated it being in the agreement. At the eleventh hour, the \nRussians came forward and, on behalf of the Iranians, said: We want the \nlifting of the sanctions, international sanctions, that the community \nhas on the ICBM program and on the arms transfers with respect to Iran.\n  Unbelievably, we ended up getting rolled on this as well. As the \nSecretary of Defense told Congress, the I in ICBM stands for \nintercontinental, meaning flying from Iran to the United States. That \nis why--that is why--we never wanted this lifted.\n  It also provides resources and legitimacy to the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guards Corps, the very same organization that has killed \n500 U.S. troops in Iraq.\n  This nuclear deal really needs to be put in a larger context of the \nadministration's Iran policy. It is very dangerous; it is very risky, \nand I would say it is doomed to fail as a policy, given the fact that \nwe haven't seen any adjustment out of Iran other than a recommittal on \nthe part of the regime in Iran where they say: We are not going to be \nbound by any of the ballistic missile constraints. We don't intend to \nfollow that, and by the way, we are advancing new ballistic missiles \nand targeting and putting that into the hands of Hezbollah and into the \nhands of Hamas.\n  That is the messaging we have seen this week out of Iran.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, I strongly oppose H.R. 3460 because it is \nanother attempt to derail diplomacy and set the United States on the \npath to war. H.R. 3460 suspends until January 21, 2017--meaning through \nthe rest of President Obama's term--the authority of the President to \nwaive, suspend, or reduce sanctions pursuant to the Iran nuclear \nagreement.\n  This legislation was introduced less than 48 hours ago and has had \nabsolutely no committee process. While the Foreign Affairs Committee \nhas held 30 hearings since the announcement of the Joint Comprehensive \nPlan of Action in November 2013, this legislation has never even been a \ntopic of committee discussion.\n  This is not a serious attempt to legislate. Put simply, it is a \npolitical attack on the President of the United States in an attempt to \nderail a good deal that is in the best interest of our Nation.\n  The Iran deal represents the cumulative efforts of countless \ndiplomats. After imposing some of the toughest sanctions in history, \nthe P5+1--the U.S., the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and \nChina--were able to bring Iran to the table and strike a deal that \nachieves our core strategic objectives.\n  President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry deserve our respect and \nthanks for this achievement. They kept together a coalition that forced \nIran to make serious concessions in how they operate their domestic \nnuclear programs.\n  We did not get everything that we wanted, but we achieved a \nverifiable deal that is our best hope to prevent Iran from developing a \nnuclear weapon.\n  The details of the deal are commendable. Among other things, Iran \nwill reduce its uranium stockpile by 98 percent and lower its \nenrichment level below weapon levels. This will increase the ``breakout \ntime''--or how long it takes to create a weapon--to 1 year.\n  In addition, the International Atomic Energy Agency will oversee \ntesting and inspections, and cheating will be severely punished with \nsnapback provisions that reimpose the crippling sanctions that brought \nIran to the table.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the majority does not understand \nprogress in diplomacy. Those who are trying to undermine this historic \nagreement are motivated by the same naive approach to negotiation that \nhas paralyzed this Congress. This time, unless they get everything they \nwant, they will not accept a deal that forestalls war and prevents Iran \nfrom becoming a nuclear power.\n  This intransigence may be new in its degree, but it is an old and \nregretful approach taken by critics of diplomacy. I remember, almost 30 \nyears ago, when a President late in his second term reached out his \nhand in peace. His attempts to constrain and ultimately reduce nuclear \nstockpiles were mocked.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  I rarely saw eye to eye with that President, but nearly three decades \nlater, I am glad that he stood up when he did. That President was \nRonald Reagan. When he signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces \nTreaty with Mr. Gorbachev, he faced the same fury we see today. \nHowever, 28 months later, the Soviet Union was replaced by a growing \nnumber of free and independent states, and 28 years later, the United \nStates is still standing and remains as strong as ever.\n  The lesson in all of this is that diplomacy is rarely clean, and it \ndevelops in its own time. There are stops and starts. Things move \nforward, sometimes backwards, and even often sideways; but, repeatedly, \nwe have shown that a step in the direction of peace will be met in \nkind. Whether a Republican or a Democratic President seeks that peace, \nCongress has an obligation to support those efforts.\n  I am proud of our President's efforts to forge a new path with Iran. \nThe Iran deal prevents Iran from developing a bomb, creates a new \nfoundation for further diplomacy, and stands as part of a proud \ntradition of progress.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully consider and oppose H.R. 3460.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just make the point that, with respect to Ronald Reagan, when \nPresident Reagan was presented with a bad deal at Reykjavik, while in \nhis negotiations with the Russians, at that point, he walked away from \nthat deal. He pushed away from the deal because, in his mind, we could \ncome back and get a better deal if we stood our ground.\n  This was not the circumstance with respect to our negotiations with \nIran. With the Iranian negotiations, we had four points that this \nCongress--84 percent of us in a letter to the Secretary of State--laid \nout. Those points were that it was supposed to be anywhere, anytime \ninspections; it was supposed to last multiple decades; we were not \nsupposed to lift the sanctions up front but do it over the entirety of \nthe agreement in order to get compliance, to ensure we had compliance; \nand it was to make certain that those 12 questions that the IAEA had \nasked were answered.\n  These were all important because, again, as Reagan pointed out to the \nRussians--and threw their own expression back to them--he said: There \nis an old Russian expression, ``trust, but verify,'' and that is what \nwe need to apply to the agreement.\n\n[[Page H5949]]\n\n  That is the last point I would make here, the verification component \nof it, when you have side agreements which Congress has not seen and \nthose side agreements, in the case of Parchin--where we have ample \nevidence of their past bomb work--allow the Iranians to do their own \ninspections. I mean, I always thought it was going to be international \ninspectors who did the international inspections, not the Iranians, \nthemselves.\n  For these reasons, I do not think it is analogous. I think, in fact, \nwe should do what Reagan did at Reykjavik, which is to push back and \nsay, no, we need a better deal, and we need a deal with verification--\ntrust, but verify.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. \nZinke), who served our country with distinction as a U.S. Navy SEAL.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, this is not a Democrat or a Republican issue. \nThis is an American issue.\n  We are talking about Iran and injecting billions of dollars into \nIran. The Marine barracks were Iran. At least 500 troops, whom I served \nwith in Iraq, died as a result of Iran. Iran is not our friend. They \nare our enemy, at least this regime. You cannot say that Hezbollah or \nHamas, as surrogates of Iran, would not do the same on 9/11 as what \noccurred today in 2001.\n  Let's look at this deal.\n  General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said \nunder no circumstances should we give missile technology to Iran; yet, \nin 5 years, we relax the sanctions for conventional weapons to include \nmissile systems, to include the same missile systems that Iran has \ngiven to Hamas directly--at least 1,000 of them--and as many as 10,000 \ninto Israel from Gaza.\n  In 8 years, we will relax the sanctions on ICBMs. There is only one \npurpose for an ICBM, and that is to strike America. In 10 years--\nremember?--part of the deal is dismantle for dismantle. Dismantle the \nsanctions, and Iran was going to dismantle their nuclear facilities, \ntheir capabilities, and their ambitions. In 10 years, the centrifuges \nthat are not dismantled come out. They are upgraded. Then, in 13 years, \nby experts, Iran will have the capability of having at least 100 \nnuclear-tipped ICBMs.\n  How is that in the best interests of America? How is that in the best \ninterests of our allies in the Middle East? How is that in the best \ninterests of America and the world? It is not.\n  The policy of the United States has been to reduce our stockpiles, to \nreduce the countries that hold these incredibly destructive weapons--\nUkraine and South Africa are examples--SALT I, SALT II, SALT III.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Lastly, how could anyone vote for a deal in which the full \ndisclosure of documents is not delivered?\n  No Member of this body has been privy to the secret deal between the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and Iran. No Member has read this. \nThe verification is so incredibly critical; yet we are willing to cede \nour sovereignty--no American is on it--for a verification process that \nis 24 days, and even General Hayden said you can only monitor what you \ncan see.\n  This is a bad deal. The argument is to take this deal or go to war. I \nsay that this deal promotes war, that it promotes nuclear \nproliferation. It is not in the best interests of the United States, \nand it puts us--Americans--and the world at risk.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction because we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon, and this \nis the smartest, most responsible way to prevent that.\n  Nuclear experts, our own military and intelligence communities, and \nall five nations that have negotiated with us--countries that have a \ndirect interest in preventing an Iranian bomb--all agree this deal will \nwork. It does it by restricting Iran's nuclear enrichment to \nnonthreatening levels and by imposing an unprecedented framework of \ninspections, monitoring, and enforcement--mechanisms that are not built \non trust but that are built on distrust and verification.\n  Is this deal perfect? No. I would prefer a deal that permanently bans \nall enrichment. However, experts agree that this deal can and will keep \nIran's nuclear program in a box for at least the next 15 years.\n  Now, opponents think we should blow this deal up, walk away, and try \nfor a better deal. With all due respect, I think they are in denial. \nAll of our negotiating partners tell us that that is not going to \nhappen. We would go forward with a much weaker hand, without any, \nperhaps, sanction partners at all, and with a huge loss of credibility \nfor abandoning our own deal. Blowing this deal up only makes sense if \nyou are prepared to go to war.\n\n  I know--and I am distressed to say--that, across the aisle, many \nthink that that is a good idea. I am concerned that, across the aisle, \nthere is an outbreak of Dick Cheney fever and the amnesia that goes \nwith it. They want to take us back to the good old days of the Bush \nyears when unilateralism and militarism made us less safe, not safer.\n  There is a smarter and more responsible way forward to prevent Iran \nfrom having a bomb. Let's give diplomacy and peace a chance. Let's \nsupport this agreement.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Holding).\n  Mr. HOLDING. I thank the chairman. The chairman has one of the \nbrightest and most insightful foreign policy minds this Congress has \never produced.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the legislation in \nfront of us.\n  For years, our Nation, in conjunction with partners from across the \nglobe, built up a robust sanctions package against the regime in Tehran \nfor their illegal nuclear work, among other illicit actions and \nactivities. These sanctions worked, Mr. Speaker. Iran's economy \ncrumbled, which forced them to the negotiating table.\n  The only trouble is, Mr. Speaker, on the other side of that \nnegotiating table was the Obama administration--a group so eager to \nsign a deal that they gave in to the Iranians at every turn and forgot \nthe true nature and evil of who they were dealing with. To get a deal, \nthe administration walked back many of their initial demands--demands \nthat actually might have made this a better deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is all too clear that this deal must be reworked and \nrejected. Now, I certainly believe that there is a role for diplomacy, \nbut diplomacy must come from a source of strength, not weakness and \ncapitulation, which is why the legislation before us today is so \nimportant.\n  The waivers built into our sanctions were not meant to be used by any \nPresident to force an agreement past Congress and the majority of the \nAmerican people. The last thing the world--let alone the United \nStates--should be doing right now is relaxing sanctions and giving Iran \nmore money--more money to spread terror, more money to execute \ncivilians, more money to support murderous proxy regimes.\n  Mr. Speaker, this deal cannot stand, and I urge support for this \nbill.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today against this \nmeasure to restrain President Obama from lifting sanctions and to \nsupport the Iran deal--the most important step that we could take to \nsecure the future of this planet by stopping Iran's nuclear program for \n15 years.\n  A nuclear Iran is an unacceptable danger. Iran's support of terror \nand aggression throughout the world, its stated threats to Israel, and \nthe nuclear arms race they would trigger are the reasons the world's \nmajor powers came together to put crushing sanctions on Iran in the \nfirst place. Currently, Iran can produce enough material for a nuclear \nweapon in 2 to 3 months. Under this deal, Iran must take several \nunprecedented steps that would prevent them from having a nuclear \nweapon in 15 years.\n  This deal goes further than any agreement in history by including \ninspections of Iran's entire uranium enrichment supply chain for up to \n25 years. Additionally, Iran will be subject to inspections forever \nunder the additional protocol. It is those crushing economic sanctions \nthat brought Iran to the table to finally accept the nuclear deal.\n\n[[Page H5950]]\n\n  What is critical to remember is that our terrorism sanctions still \nremain in place, and if a military strike is necessary, the U.S. will \nhave the time and intelligence to intervene but without the threat of a \nnuclear bomb for 15 years. In contrast, without this deal, sanctions \nwill be lifted anyway, and we will be left with nothing but fear, \nuncertainty, and an unfettered Iran.\n  Considering the anxiety of recent years, when the prospect of a \nmilitary strike on Iran felt imminent, this deal is a welcome \nalternative, and the risks of rejecting it are too great. For the sake \nof our security, the security of our allies, and our position as a \ntrustworthy global leader, I urge my colleagues to support the deal and \nto reject this resolution.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Duncan), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee \non the Western Hemisphere.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me just pause to say that I remember the events of \n9/11/2001. I want to thank the first responders and those men and women \nin uniform who have served, our veterans, for what they do to protect \nus every day.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose the nuclear agreement with Iran. I \nstrongly oppose giving the President the ability to unilaterally lift \ncongressional sanctions. Our allies don't trust us, and our enemies \ndon't fear us. I think we ought to take Iran at its word. Here are some \nquotes.\n  During the negotiations, the Ayatollah said this:\n  ``The enemies are talking about the options they have on the table. \nThey should know that the first option on our table is the annihilation \nof Israel.''\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said this:\n\n       The Iranian people and leadership, with God's help, will \n     increase their defensive capability each day.\n\n  Through the Iran deal, we are getting ready to give Iran $150 \nbillion. They can do a lot of damage with that.\n  They are the largest state sponsor of terrorism. They are responsible \nfor killing people in Indonesia, in India, and all across the globe.\n  I chair the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. They are directly \nresponsible for the AMIA bombings in Buenos Aires in 1994, again in \n1996 through their proxy, Hezbollah.\n  The Ayatollah has said: We will not stop supporting our allies. That \nis Hamas, that is Hezbollah, and that is other terrorist groups.\n  They have said in their own words--take them at their word--they will \ncontinue to support materially and financially the terrorism groups \nlike in Yemen. There is nothing we can do to stop it.\n  They have also said that we, Western powers, will not have access to \nsecret military sites or secret nuclear sites, but, yet, we are going \nto give them 24 days in this agreement. America, I didn't say 24 hours. \nI said 24 days' advance notice.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Twenty-four days' advance notice before \nwe are going to inspect a site. Are you kidding me?\n  We are going to allow them to self-regulate. That means they can go \nout in the desert and get clean dirt and clean air and provide that.\n  That is like telling a regular drug user that you can bring somebody \nelse's urine and somebody else's hair sample to a drug test.\n  This is crazy, that we are giving Iran $150 billion and an \nopportunity to get a nuclear weapon in 10 years or less, assuming they \nare going to adhere to every line of the agreement, which nobody that I \ntalk to believes Iran is going to adhere to the agreement. They will \nhave a nuclear weapon.\n  The immediate concern is $150 billion in lifted sanctions, money we \nare giving to Iran so they can continue to fund terrorism around the \nglobe. People will die as a result of this agreement.\n  $150 billion can buy a lot of weapons, financial support for \nterrorist groups to continue attacking our allies and Americans \nanywhere they are in the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose that. As everyone can tell by my \npassion today, it is time for us to really talk in real terms about \nwhat that agreement is.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez).\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, they sound like \nwarmongers, don't they, those Iranian leaders?\n  And so we sit here today, humbled at the task before us. We sit here \nas Members of the world's greatest legislative body, debating the \nfuture of our country and the future of the world. Because Iran with a \nnuclear weapon is a threat to the world.\n  And after months of intense review and passionate conversation with \nthe people I represent and with advisers, with my colleagues, after 19 \nyears on the Armed Services Committee, 17 of those on the committee \nthat deals with nuclear proliferation and nonproliferation, chairing \nthat committee for the Democrats, I believe that diplomacy first is the \nbest path for the United States and our allies.\n  We stand here to discuss the issues of war and peace, of whether we \nbelieve in diplomacy with verification or armed engagement. We sit here \nand we reflect on all of those that will be affected by our votes: my \nfamily, our family, the soldiers, and countless others.\n  Can we look them directly in the eye and say we did all that we could \ndo? Can we tell them we did not give diplomacy a chance? So don't get \nme wrong, I am no fan of Iran.\n  When so many in this Chamber rushed to war in Iraq, I stood up and \nsaid no and I said at that time Iran is where we need to keep our \nfocus.\n  We need to ensure that this deal is implemented, and we need to hold \nthose accountable to implement it correctly. That is our role as \nMembers of Congress. No deal is perfect.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nMeehan).\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Iran deal. I believe the \ninspections regime is weak. I don't think the Iranians can be trusted, \nnor can we reasonably assume that Iran will hold up its end of the \ndeal.\n  A broad swath of sanctions is lifted all at once, and the deal lifts \nthe arms embargo. Iran will further destabilize an already dangerous \nMiddle East by trafficking more weapons and rockets to its terrorist \nproxies, like Hamas and Hezbollah. Tehran's coffers will be flush with \ncash to fund Iranian terror around the world.\n  But Iranian terrorism isn't new. Iran is the leading state sponsor of \nterrorism. Its support and influence was there in Beirut in 1983, \nKhobar Towers in 1996, Nairobi in 1998, and on this day, 9/11.\n  It has been there at suicide bombings on busses, at shopping malls, \nand pizza shops. It has supported hostage takings and assassinations \naround the world. And to this we are to look to diplomacy?\n  U.S. law allows victims of these attacks to sue Iran for damages in \nU.S. courts. Over the last 15 years, the United States courts have \nhanded down more than 80 judgments against Iran with $43 billion in \ndamages. Of course, not a penny has been paid.\n  I know there is disagreement on this overall issue, but surely we can \nagree that Iran should have to pay out these damages to its victims' \nfamilies before Iran benefits from U.S. sanctions relief.\n  So I have introduced the Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism \nAct. It requires the President to certify that Iran has paid all \njudgments owed to its victims before U.S. sanctions can be lifted. Our \nposition is: Not 1 cent in sanctions relief for Iran until it pays up \nto its victims--not 1 cent.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, what a weighty responsibility to stand \non this floor on September 11.\n  For those of us who were here in this body on that day, there is no \nmore solemn responsibility than the national security of this Nation.\n  For that reason, I am gratified to my ranking member for being able \nto serve\n\n[[Page H5951]]\n\nwith him through those very difficult times and to be one of the \noriginal members of the new Homeland Security Committee.\n  I have stayed on both of those committees, who hold in their hands \nthe constitutional privileges and rights, but, also, the national \nsecurity.\n  So I rise today with a heavy burden to speak to this very difficult \ndecision. So I start by saying I stand here as a mother, and I will \nchoose to speak to that child in Israel and the child in urban and \nrural America and the children around the world.\n\n  I would ask my colleagues the question: What is our burden and \nresponsibility to those children, that, if we have an opportunity not \nfor peace, but an opportunity to stop a potential nuclear rogue, would \nwe not take that opportunity or would we find all kinds of obstacles?\n  I rise in opposition to the underlying bill, and I rise today in \nsupport of this Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. I thank the President \nand Secretary Kerry, but I thank, more importantly, Republicans and \nDemocrats and Independents. I thank the negotiators.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we have is the statement and the agreement signed \nby Iran that it will never, never become a nuclear power. This \nagreement creates an enforceable roadmap for dismantling Iran's nuclear \nprogram.\n  Before the interim joint agreement in 2013, Iran went from operating \napproximately 164 centrifuges to 10,000, and then they went to 19,000. \nBut this agreement brings them down to 6,000. Is that not a standing in \nthe gap against a known actor of terrorism?\n  And then, of course, we have them at 300-kg enriched uranium, and \nthey are only allowed to enrich 3.67. We have a roadmap for the various \nentities that contributed to their ability to make a nuclear bomb.\n  Make no mistake about it. You cannot take away knowledge. Even if you \nbomb Iran through war, you cannot take away the knowledge. And they \nwill ultimately have the ability to come back again.\n  Now we have an agreement with the P5+1. This is not Munich, for \nMunich was a capitulation. No one in this agreement is capitulating to \nIran. We are demanding that Iran cease and desist.\n  Tell American people the truth. This is the best pathway to ensuring \nthe scientist in all. And for those who say that it is a reckless \nregime or scheme, rather, of inspection, they are wrong. Because the \nonly 24-day process deals with the undeclared and even that has an \nultimatum that the sanctions will snap back.\n  The IAEA inspectors are trained by the United States. The United \nStates will be present on site at the IAEA. Many Members traveled there \nand got a direct briefing of the intenseness of their inspection \nprocess.\n  America will be on site when they come back with their inspection \nmaterials, and we will be at the table. We will also be engaged in the \nredesign of some of those facilities in Iran for more civilian uses.\n  I ask you, Mr. Speaker, that, if we have the opportunity to save a \nchild from a speeding train, would we not take that opportunity to save \na child from a speeding train? I think we would. We need to save the \nchildren of this world.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee \nand the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, \nand Investigations, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3461, and in \nstrong opposition to H. Res. 412 and H.R. 3460.\n  I support H.R. 3461 and oppose H.R. 3460 and H. Res. 412 because I \nsupport the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (``JCPOA'') as the best \nand most realistically attainable means of preventing Iran from ever \nobtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  Mr. Speaker, more than twenty-five years ago, as a young mother, I \nfirst visited Israel and the Holy Land.\n  I have returned many times since then to the region that gave birth \nto three of the world's great religions, civilizations, and cultures.\n  And I have been a passionate supporter of the Mickey Leland Kibbutzim \nInternship program, which for over 20 years has enabled inner-city high \nschool students who live or study in the 18th Congressional District \nthe opportunity to spend a summer in Israel.\n  As a Member of Congress and a senior Member of the Committees on \nHomeland Security and the Judiciary, both of which deal with national \nsecurity issues, I have had the opportunity to visit many countries in \nthe Middle East.\n  I have long been committed and engaged in efforts to develop policies \nthat anticipate and respond to new and emerging challenges to the \nsecurity of our nation and the peace and safety of the world.\n  The threat to regional stability, world peace, and America's security \nposed by Iran's possession of a nuclear weapon is one of the greatest \nchallenges now facing the international community.\n  The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), negotiated by the \nP5+1, led by the United States is a response to that challenge.\n  I have consulted with policy professionals, scientists and other \nexperts, and have reviewed many publications supporting and opposing \nthe agreement.\n  I have met with and listened intently to supporters and opponents of \nthe JCPOA in my congressional district whose commitment to peace and \nsecurity is unquestioned and whose counsel on issues relating to \nIsrael's security and America's policies regarding the Middle East I \nhave always valued and will continue to seek.\n  After this lengthy period of review, consultation, and reflection, I \nhave concluded that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) \nrepresents the best and surest means of achieving the goal of \npreventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran, the most \nrigorous and intrusive in the history of nuclear nonproliferation \nagreements.\n  Under the JCPOA, the IAEA will have access to all elements of Iran's \nnuclear program, including those that have never been subject to \ninspection.\n  The JCPOA, for example, requires Iran to permit IAEA inspectors to \nmonitor the entire uranium supply chain which will enable them to \ndetect any diversion of nuclear material.\n  And, to enhance the number of IAEA eyes and ears on the ground, the \nJCPOA provides that about 130-150 IAEA inspectors will be deployed.\n  Additionally, the JCPOA makes applicable to Iran the ``Additional \nProtocol'' (AP) to its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, which is one \nof the verification agreements the IAEA uses to investigate allegations \nof any clandestine nuclear activities in Iran, and which requires Iran \nto detail all of its nuclear activities, including mining and milling \nand research and development activities.\n  I take seriously the concern that has been expressed regarding the \n24-day period for resolving disputes over IAEA's requests for access to \ncertain locations.\n  However, it should be noted that this 24-day period applies only to \nlocations not covered by the comprehensive agreement or the Additional \nProtocol.\n  Moreover, I am persuaded by experts, including Energy Secretary \nErnest Moniz, a Nobel laureate in physics, that the trace evidence \ncreated by activities involving nuclear material remains detectable for \nmonths, even years.\n  Finally, under the JCPOA, intransigence by Iran in permitting IAEA's \ninspectors access to requested locations can in itself be deemed an act \nof non-compliance subjecting Iran to the threat of re-imposition of \nsanctions.\n  Additionally, the IAEA must be satisfied with this inspection regime \nwith Iran and there must be a major reduction in the stockpile before \nfunds held in escrow are released to Iran.\n  Critics of the JCPOA are correct in pointing out that the agreement \ndoes not condition sanctions relief on Iran's renunciation of its past \nand present support of terrorist groups like Hezbollah.\n  That is why I take seriously the concern that Iran may use some of \nthe proceeds of sanction relief, approximately $56 billion, to support \nterrorist groups, especially those that are hostile to Israel.\n  But the best way to respond to this threat is not to reject the JCPOA \nbut to work with our allies and the international community to prevent \nIran from obtaining nuclear weapons.\n  The JCPOA makes it easier to confront, deter, and defeat terrorist \ngroups supported by Iran.\n  Nothing in the JCPOA limits the ability of the United States to \nexercise all of its authority to sanction Iranian entities for their \nsupport for terrorism. President Obama has made clear that he intends \nto exercise that authority:\n\n       ``With very limited exceptions, Iran will continue to be \n     denied access to our market--the world's largest--and we will \n     maintain powerful sanctions targeting Iran's support for \n     groups such as Hizballah, its destabilizing role in Yemen, \n     its backing of the Assad regime, its missile program, and its \n     human rights abuses at home.\n       ``The United States reserves its right to maintain and \n     enforce existing sanctions and even to deploy new sanctions \n     to address those continuing concerns, which we fully intend \n     to do when circumstances warrant.''\n\n  After discussions with Administration and outside experts, I believe \nthat between the IAEA's inspections (the results of which the United \nStates will continue to have immediate\n\n[[Page H5952]]\n\nand ongoing access) and our intelligence community's oversight, the \nnecessary verification measures are in place to ensure we can detect \nany illicit nuclear activity that Iran might attempt to undertake.\n  Finally, I believe it is important to acknowledge that by preventing \nIran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, the JCPOA contributes \nsubstantially to making the region and the world safer.\n  But an increase in safety should not be confused with an absence of \ndanger, especially for Israel.\n  Even with the JCPOA, there will remain actors who are intent on doing \nharm to Israel.\n  That is why I strongly support a substantial increase in assistance \nto Israel to make plain to any of its adversaries that Israel's \nsecurity is sacrosanct to the United States.\n  Specifically, I strongly support a new 10-year Memorandum of \nUnderstanding with Israel that enhances our strong security \nrelationship.\n  I also support an increase in missile defense funding so that the \nUnited States and Israel can accelerate the co-development of the \nArrow-3 and David's Sling defense systems.\n  And to ensure that Israel retains its qualitative military edge \n(QME), I support further military enhancements that are now underway.\n  Mr. Speaker, since its entrance into World War II in 1941, the United \nStates has been the leading force for good, for human dignity, and for \npeace in every region of the world.\n  From the establishment of the United Nations, the creation of NATO, \nthe recognition of Israel, the United States has been the world's \nindispensable nation.\n  In the words of former President Lyndon Johnson, we support Israel \n``Because it is right.''\n  And as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ``Israel's right to \nexist as a state in security is incontestable.''\n  Dr. King believed in the dignity of all humanity and my best hopes \nare that a non-nuclear Iran, ceasing to foment terrorism, will be the \ncatalyst for a Middle East in which all faiths and all peoples are \nrespected, and which enjoys economic prosperity and cultural diversity.\n  Simply put, I want peace and security for the people of the United \nStates and its allies, the Middle East, including Israel, and the \nworld.\n  Mr. Speaker, the JCPOA negotiated by the P5+1, led by the United \nStates, is in keeping with its tradition of global leadership and \ndesire for peace and security for all persons in all nations.\n  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I support the Joint Comprehensive \nPlan of Action (JCPOA), negotiated by the P5+1 and led by the United \nStates.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3461, which is a \nvote for a world in which Iran does not and will not possess any \nnuclear weapons with which it could threaten neighboring countries in \nthe region, especially our steadfast ally, Israel.\n\n             The Iran Deal Benefits U.S. National Security\n\n\n           An Open Letter from Retired Generals and Admirals\n\n       On July 14, 2015, after two years of intense international \n     negotiations, an agreement was announced by the United \n     States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China and Russia \n     to contain Iran's nuclear program. We, the undersigned \n     retired military officers, support the agreement as the most \n     effective means currently available to prevent Iran from \n     obtaining nuclear weapons.\n       The international deal blocks the potential pathways to a \n     nuclear bomb, provides for intrusive verification, and \n     strengthens American national security. America and our \n     allies, in the Middle East and around the world, will be \n     safer when this agreement is fully implemented. It is not \n     based on trust; the deal requires verification and tough \n     sanctions for failure to comply.\n       There is no better option to prevent an Iranian nuclear \n     weapon. Military action would be less effective than the \n     deal, assuming it is fully implemented. If the Iranians \n     cheat, our advanced technology, intelligence and the \n     inspections will reveal it, and U.S. military options remain \n     on the table. And if the deal is rejected by America, the \n     Iranians could have a nuclear weapon within a year. The \n     choice is that stark.\n       We agree with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     General Martin Dempsey, who said on July 29, 2015, \n     ``[r]elieving the risk of a nuclear conflict with Iran \n     diplomatically is superior than trying to do that \n     militarily.''\n       If at some point it becomes necessary to consider military \n     action against Iran, gathering sufficient international \n     support for such an effort would only be possible if we have \n     first given the diplomatic path a chance. We must exhaust \n     diplomatic options before moving to military ones.\n       For these reasons, for the security of our Nation, we call \n     upon Congress and the American people to support this \n     agreement.\n       GEN James ``Hoss'' Cartwright, U.S. Marine Corps; GEN \n     Joseph P.

Nancy Pelosi,\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Pelosi: National leaders and experts in \n     numerous fields--scientific, diplomatic, arms control, \n     military--are increasingly advocating support for the Joint \n     Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) negotiated between the \n     P5+1 and Iran. They have concluded that support for the JCPOA \n     is in our national interest after carefully evaluating both \n     the specifics of the JCPOA's effectiveness in stopping \n     nuclear weapons development by Iran and the viability of \n     alternative approaches.\n       In February, I joined Secretary Kerry at the negotiating \n     table as lead technical negotiator for the United States. To \n     help clarify the technical features and safeguards of the \n     JCPOA agreed to and supported by the P5+1, and place these in \n     the context of the choice between approval or disapproval of \n     implementation of the JCPOA that will be before Congress next \n     month, I have compiled and attached to this note a \n     streamlined side-by-side comparison of key elements.\n       I believe this comparison clearly underscores the \n     conclusions of the U.S. negotiators, the P5+1, and an \n     impressive body of experts: the JCPOA provides significant \n     technical safeguards and disincentives that effectively block \n     Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. It also explicitly enables \n     strong detection and verification measures and timely \n     responses should Iran choose to violate nuclear provisions of \n     the JCPOA. The President, the Congress, and our allies and \n     friends remain united in the determination that Iran will not \n     develop or acquire nuclear weapons. The JCPOA is the best \n     option available.\n       If you have questions that I can help answer, I would be \n     pleased to do so.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                  Ernest J. Moniz.\n       Enclosure.\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy), our majority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want \nto take a moment and thank the chairman for his work that has been done \nfor the American public that they have been able to see directly \nthrough what this Iran agreement is about.\n  An interesting thing is happening on this floor as I sit around and \nlisten. I am hearing Republicans and Democrats on the same side. Those \nthat are opposed to it are bipartisan. Those that support this all come \nfrom one place.\n  You know, when I came to Congress, the one thing you are always told \nis find a committee and stick with that committee because what happens \nis you get expertise.\n  If you care about banking, you go to Financial Services, and you get \nexpertise year over year. Taxes, Ways and Means. When it comes to \nForeign Affairs, you get the expertise of something like this.\n  So you know what? I have listened to those who sit on those \ncommittees, and I look to the chairman and the ranking member on the \nDemocratic side.\n  You know what I heard from both of them? They are in the same \nposition. They are opposed to this agreement. They took their years of \nexpertise, they read through it, they did the hearings, and they came \nto the same conclusion.\n  So I wonder, could that happen on the other side of this building, \ninside the Senate? Because they have committees as well. The same \nbipartisan conclusion came. It just didn't even come from the \ncommittees. The next Democratic leader in the Senate, the number two, \nis opposed to the Iran agreement.\n\n[[Page H5953]]\n\n  The American public always asks us for bipartisanship. This has \nbrought us together. But it is not just in this House. It is almost in \nthe majority of houses across America.\n  You see, in the latest poll, only 21 percent of the American people \nactually approve the deal and 49 percent oppose. That is more than 2 to \n1.\n  Only 2 percent of Americans are confident that Iran will abide by the \nagreement. Why? Because they never have before.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Iran has a history of not living up to their promises. It is clear \ntoday that, what the President said, he did not achieve.\n  Mr. Speaker, just in April, President Obama said he will ``do what is \nnecessary to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.'' He said \nthat he will implement this deal ``to prevent Iran from obtaining a \nnuclear weapon.''\n  He did the opposite. In 13 years, Iran can have a nuclear weapon not \njust because Iran wants it, but America will say then it is okay. \nThirteen years is not that far away.\n  That is not all that Iran gets in this deal. While we had sanctions \non Iran, the only reason they wanted to come to the table--what did \nthey do with their money, even though it was scarce, they didn't have \nmuch? They funded terrorism around the world.\n  What does this deal do? It gives them as much or maybe even more than \nthe bailout that Greece got. What will Iran become? They will become \nthe central bank of terror in the world. That is what we are voting on \ntoday.\n  If you want to know the truth about the deal, you go even further \nbecause there are side secret agreements we do not know. On this side \nof the aisle, we think we should keep with the law. We think when 400 \npeople on this floor voted for the Corker-Cardin bill that said you had \nto have all agreements, we felt when there were 98 Senators and only \none opposed that you would want to hold to the same agreement.\n  Why would anybody want to vote on something without having all the \nfacts, especially after you read the reports that maybe Iran can do \nself-inspection? If that is the case, why don't we bring to the floor \nand change the Olympic committee and those athletes should be able to \ntest themselves? I look for the Education Committee. Maybe students \nshould grade themselves.\n  Maybe that is facetious, but this is probably the most important bill \nyou will vote on in your term in Congress. Don't fall to political \npressure, because you don't need to. The bipartisanship of the majority \nof Americans stands opposed.\n  The expertise in this House that you respect, regardless of what \nparty you are in because you selected those Members to lead those \ncommittees, are opposed. If that is not enough, study history. History \nalways repeats itself. Have we not learned that peace without freedom \nis meaningless?\n  The President said he would not agree to any bad deal. Well, I \nbelieve we can have a better deal. History has shown Chamberlain just \nwanted peace, but history has shown other times in America where \nPresidents have stood up and stepped back and got a better agreement.\n  Ronald Reagan wanted to end the nuclear weapons when it came to the \nSoviet Union. In the end of Ronald Reagan's second term, he sat in \nIceland with Gorbachev. He sat down across the table, and he got almost \neverything he had asked for, but Gorbachev asked for one more item. He \nasked that America would end their SDI investment.\n  Ronald Reagan had a choice. Ronald Reagan said no, but he said: I \nwill do something even better. I will provide you the technology as \nwell, so everyone in the world could be safe.\n  Gorbachev said no. That is a defining moment not for that man, but \nfor this world, and Ronald Reagan got up and walked away. Some people \ncriticized on a political basis, but I ask you this: Would the Soviet \nUnion have collapsed, would the Berlin Wall have collapsed at the time \nit did, had Reagan not stood firm and asked and kept his word for a \nbetter deal?\n  Peace without freedom is meaningless. This deal does not bring \ngreater freedom to the world. It brings a nuclear missile race. This is \nnot just about America, Iran, or a few other countries. No country in \nthe Middle East will sit back after this action.\n  The world will not be safer; we will not be freer, but there is still \nan opportunity. History has shown, if we are willing to stand up, take \na step back, and get a better agreement, we can have peace and freedom.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 13 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from California has 13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, I have a proud record, a record as strong \nas any Member in Congress in supporting Israel. It is because of this \nsupport that I back the deal that the President and our allies have \nnegotiated. If I thought that this agreement made the State of Israel \nmore vulnerable, I would not support it, but that is just not the case.\n  Every security expert I trust, like Colin Powell, supports this deal; \nand almost every former government official I deeply distrust, like \nVice President Dick Cheney, opposes the agreement. This is one of the \nmost detailed international agreements of its kind in memory, and it \nwas no small task of American diplomacy, statesmanship, and good old-\nfashioned negotiating that brought the deal to reality.\n  The power and position of the United States as a world leader brought \nour allies to the table. It achieved an outcome our country working \nalone could not have achieved. It is not something that the Europeans, \nthe Russians, the Chinese, or even the United Nations could have \nachieved.\n  It is not something sanctions alone could achieve and not something \nthat war alone could achieve. The United States, working with our \nfriends and, in some cases, our rivals, brought about this end to \nIran's nuclear weapons program with an agreement for verifiable, \nenforceable, effective curbs on Iran's nuclear ambitions; and it is in \nIran's interest to abide by the agreement.\n  With this one step forward, the U.S. has helped erase our record of \ninternational shortsightedness. It gets us back on track as a leader \nwho leverages our economic power, our military power, our powers to \npersuade and compromise and bring people together.\n  There are not many times in a person's congressional career or in the \ncourse of history, for that matter, where a person can cast a vote \nliterally for war or peace. Voting to support the Iran agreement is a \nvote to give peace a chance.\n  Put diplomacy at the top of our agenda, stand up for our men and \nwomen in uniform, their families, and our Nation by avoiding war. Let \nus support a deal that is good for Israel, good for America, good for \npeace, and good for the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, Representative Yarmuth and I wrote an op-ed piece for \nThe Hill newspaper entitled ``The Iran Nuclear Deal is Good for America \nand Good for Peace,'' and I include it for the Record.\n\n                     [From the Hill, July 29, 2015]\n\n            Iran Nuke Deal Is Good for America and for Peace\n\n      (By Reps. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and John Yarmuth (D-Ky.))\n\n       We are both Democrats, but our districts and paths to \n     Congress share little in common. A Catholic city councilman \n     from Chicago and a Jewish journalist from Kentucky, the two \n     of us naturally bring very different viewpoints to our work. \n     But we are in complete agreement on one of the most important \n     issues the U.S. faces--the nuclear agreement with Iran is \n     good for America, crucial for Israel and an important step \n     toward a more peaceful Middle East.\n       The United States entered into negotiations with one \n     prevailing goal: to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear \n     weapon. After months of negotiations, we now have an \n     agreement that will do just that. The deal severely restricts \n     Iran's nuclear program to only energy-grade enrichment, \n     eliminates much of the country's uranium stockpile, retires \n     most centrifuges and gives International Atomic Energy Agency \n     (IAEA) inspectors more access in Iran than in any country in \n     the world. Most importantly, under this deal, Iran can never \n     have a nuclear weapon.\n       We recognize that some of our colleagues do not share our \n     enthusiasm for this deal, and we certainly share their \n     mistrust for the Iranian regime. But this agreement is not \n     built on trust. It's built on strict verification and \n     unprecedented enforcement. Iran has\n\n[[Page H5954]]\n\n     agreed to submit to full IAEA inspections throughout its \n     nuclear supply chain, leaving no site off-limits and ensuring \n     the IAEA will have access wherever it needs it, whenever it \n     needs it.\n       Iran conceded to these terms after the success of crippling \n     international sanctions. Relief from those sanctions will be \n     introduced gradually, only after Iranian compliance is \n     verified. And should leaders fail to comply at any point, \n     those sanctions will automatically snap back into place.\n       But make no mistake, sanctions were not delaying Iran's \n     march toward a bomb. Sanctions were designed to make that \n     march unbearable and force Iran to the negotiating table, \n     where we could strike a deal that would truly make the world \n     safer.\n       And it worked. Now, aside from war, we're left with two \n     choices. Either we support the deal and stop Iran from \n     getting a bomb, or we oppose the deal and allow Iran to \n     resume its nuclear path, unchecked and no longer encumbered \n     by the pain of global sanctions.\n       Whether we like it or not, that is where we find ourselves. \n     The sanctions' effectiveness depended on a coalition that \n     included China and Russia. Should the U.S. unilaterally \n     defeat this agreement, deemed positive by all members of the \n     coalition, China and Russia are unlikely to simply return to \n     business as usual. The formation of the P5+1 negotiating \n     countries--China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the \n     United States, plus Germany--was a unique historical moment. \n     A failure by Congress to recognize the significance of \n     today's moment would undo more than a decade of progress \n     while leaving Iran's nuclear program fully intact.\n       There is simply no acceptable alternative to this deal. \n     It's why, despite all the criticism, no viable substitute has \n     been offered. No one likes working with enemy nations, but \n     deals like these aren't necessary among friends. It's \n     understandable that much of the apprehension over these \n     negotiations has to do with Iran's history, and certainly, \n     the past must be taken into account-- it's also why there is \n     such high emphasis on verification. But we must not allow \n     history to be the obstacle in working toward a better, more \n     peaceful future.\n       Some have derided the agreement based on the Americans who \n     remain unjustly imprisoned in Iran. We too had hoped \n     negotiations would have already led to their release and \n     share the urgent need to free them. But here too, the deal \n     provides our best chance. An abrupt severing of ties would \n     give us no means to free the prisoners, but in an improved \n     negotiating climate, we have a real chance to secure their \n     release.\n       These choices are never easy, but after more than a decade \n     of groundwork, the best and right path is now clear.\n       To upend this agreement would be not only a setback for our \n     shared goal of a peaceful world, but it would be a major blow \n     to American diplomacy. If we walk away, the future of \n     international relations within the Middle East will be put at \n     risk. China and Russia will have no need to deal with us if \n     they again have the ability to deal with Iran directly. And \n     Iran's nuclear program will resume its growth, free of \n     safeguards from the international community.\n       The critics are right about one thing. This is not a \n     perfect deal. But no negotiation ends in perfection, and the \n     results of this negotiation are very good. To be certain, \n     it's the best deal available. It's good for the United \n     States, good for our allies--most especially Israel--and it's \n     good for the Middle East. By cautiously and carefully \n     inviting Iran to rejoin the world stage, we can guarantee it \n     plays by the rules and finally ensure regional stability and \n     security for all.\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Young).\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the bipartisan \nopposition to the President's nuclear deal with Iran. I didn't arrive \nat this decision lightly. As a former Marine Corps intelligence \nofficer, I know the difficulty of detecting covert military activity, \nand I fully expect Iran to cheat.\n  For years, President Obama has said no deal would be better than a \nbad deal. Now, as the sun sets on his final term, he has jammed \nCongress with an agreement riddled with dangerous concessions. No \nmatter the verification arrangements, this deal does not block Iran's \npathway to a nuclear weapon. This much, we know.\n  Rewarding the largest sponsor of international terrorism with \nbillions of dollars and long-range missiles requires Americans to \ncompromise our Nation's security. It is too high a price and one this \nmarine is unwilling to pay.\n  As sure as Iran will continue chanting ``death to America,'' ``death \nto Israel,'' I will oppose this agreement, and I will resolve to work \non a nonpartisan basis to preserve peace by projecting strength.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, a nuclear-armed Iran is \ncertainly unacceptable, and there are two ways to prevent Iran from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon: diplomacy and military force.\n  As someone who served in combat, I believe our Nation's first choice \nshould always be diplomacy. I say ``first choice'' because nothing in \nthis deal takes military action off the table, but before we go down \nthat road, we need to give diplomacy a shot, and this deal is the best \nway forward.\n  I am not new to the issue. I just finished serving 8 years on the \nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence. I have reviewed the \nintelligence; I have read the classified documents, and I have had \nnumerous briefings with experts from every side of this issue. There is \nno other deal to be had. It is this, or it is the status quo. Make no \nmistake, the status quo leaves Iran just a short time away from a bomb.\n  All of the intelligence clearly points towards the fact that this \nagreement is far better than doing nothing, better than the status quo. \nIran is already a nuclear threshold state. If we reject this deal, Iran \nwill keep getting closer and closer towards the development of their \nnuclear weapon.\n  If we accept the deal, we will be able to halt Iran's activities. The \nIAEA will have enormous access to conduct inspections, and Iran must \nforever honor the conditions of the nonproliferation treaty or face the \nconsequences.\n  This deal isn't about trust. I don't trust Iran, and I don't like \ntheir leadership, but as it has been pointed out, you don't negotiate \npeace agreements with those you know, like, and trust.\n  This deal is about verification. It is about making Iran prove it is \nnot developing a nuclear weapon. It is about keeping America and our \nallies safe. It is our best and only peaceful path forward. I urge the \nHouse to approve the Iran nuclear deal.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Kinzinger).\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the first question is: Does \nIran deserve the right to be trusted?\n  If the answer to that is yes, then I would ask how. Tell me how Iran \nhas earned this right to be trusted. If the answer is no, then \nobviously, you would have to verify if you don't trust.\n  If you actually look at the verification in this deal, in many cases, \nwe are finding out from these secret agreements that it is actually \nIran verifying for themselves that, in fact, they are going to be \nnuclear free.\n  I am a veteran of Iraq, and one of the things that I think is largely \nforgotten in this debate, even though it has been mentioned a few \ntimes, is Iraq is responsible for the death of hundreds if not \nthousands of American soldiers, both directly and indirectly, through \nthe explosive foreign penetrators they send to Iraq to kill American \ntroops.\n  The other thing is, Iran in this deal, there is all this talk about \nIran cheating, and we know it is in the DNA of Iran to cheat anyway. \nThey don't even need to cheat. They can follow this deal to the T and \nbecome a zero-time breakout nuclear state.\n  You don't even need to have nuclear weapons to have the same kind of \npower if you are a zero-time breakout nuclear state. You just need to \nhave the threat to marry a nuclear weapon to an intercontinental \nballistic missile--which, by the way, we give Iran the right to have in \nyear eight, ICBMs married up to the tip of a nuclear weapon.\n  In 5 years, by the way, Iran can now take weapons from Russia, \nEurope--frankly, the United States if we wanted to sell it to them--\nbecause we lift the arms embargo against them.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  South Korea and the United Arab Emirates have asked us for the right \nto enrich or reprocess uranium--friends of the United States--and we \ntold them no because of our dedication to keeping nuclear weapons out \nof the wrong hands. So we denied our best friends the right to enrich \nuranium, and we are getting ready to give it to our worst enemy. This \ndeal will, in effect, end the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty for the \nworld, because we can never deny anybody the right to enrich uranium in \nthe future.\n  With that, I urge the rejection of this deal.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nMcDermott).\n\n[[Page H5955]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, by now, I should be used to the wild and \nspurious charges my Republican colleagues will level at the \nadministration when they know they are about to lose a big battle.\n  This is an extremely well-conceived arms agreement that does exactly \nwhat needs to be done when it comes to preventing Iran from getting a \nnuclear weapon, if it is enforced. There is not an argument or an \nobjection against it that has not been debunked by actual regional and \nnuclear experts on both sides of the aisle. And yet not a single \nRepublican in the entire United States Congress is willing to consider \nthe deal's exceptional merits--not a single one. Now, that is politics; \nthat is not policy. Instead, we have spent 2 days watching the \nRepublicans trip over themselves on how best to unanimously disapprove \nof this deal.\n  If we disapprove, where does it lead? You heard: either to war or \nlet's go get another deal. That is not going to happen. Everyone has \ntold us that is not going to happen. It is the same neocons that have \nled us into 15 years of war in the Middle East that now want us to \nleave the thing open with Iran; don't settle it.\n  We have seen Secretary Kerry and Secretary Moniz go toe-to-toe with \nthe Iranians for months. Enduring the through-the-night meetings and \ncountless strained arguments, our diplomats ultimately delivered the \nmost far-reaching nuclear agreement in history. There is nothing that \ncompares with what we have here. That is real leadership.\n  Of course, we have seen the shameful campaigns of misinformation and \nvitriol before--ObamaCare. If you were to play the ObamaCare arguments, \nthey are the same ones that you are hearing today: Fear; fear, folks; \nyou are going to lose your doctor; you are going to lose everything. \nAnd yet we now have it in place, and 20 million people have more health \ncare. Now we are seeing it again.\n  A Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, said it best:\n\n       Credit goes to the man who is actually in the arena, whose \n     face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives \n     valiantly; who at best knows, in the end, triumph of high \n     achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least \n     fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall not be \n     with these cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor \n     defeat.\n\n  The President has gone out on the line. He has listened to this stuff \nfor 2 years and came back with an agreement. You have got experts in \nIsrael, you have got experts around the world saying that this is a \ngood deal. Now, imagine if we were making this agreement 70 years ago \nwith the Japanese. We had been at war with them. We wouldn't have the \nsame arguments.\n  Vote against this bill.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I want to underscore the point the gentleman from Illinois made a few \nminutes ago. This deal effectively shreds the bipartisan Non-\nProliferation Treaty, a bipartisan accomplishment, an accomplishment \nthat has served to curtail proliferation for 50 years now.\n  As a consequence of this action, for the first time, we are going to \nmake an exception for Iran, an exception that everyone else is going to \ndemand; and we are going to see an arms race, if this deal goes \nthrough, not just in the Middle East, but one that is going to threaten \nthe wider world as well.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong \nopposition to the President's nuclear agreement with Iran. It is not \ngood for America or her allies.\n  The administration would have us believe that the only alternative to \nthis deal is war. Those of us saying this is a bad deal are not \nadvocating for war. We are advocating for a better deal, one that \neffectively prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon now, 15 years \nfrom now, and into the future.\n  Instead of preventing a nuclear weapon-capable Iran, this deal allows \nIran to keep its nuclear infrastructure; gives Iran billions of dollars \nin sanctions relief to promote terrorism and instability throughout the \nregion; does not allow for anytime, anywhere inspections; lifts the \narms embargo, allows Iran to acquire intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles; and does nothing to free the four American hostages being \nheld in Iran.\n  Quite simply, this is a bad deal that aims to solidify a legacy \nrather than prevent a nuclear weapon-capable state sponsor of \nterrorism.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this deal.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan).\n  Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to compliment all of my \ncolleagues for all the time that everyone has spent going through the \nclassified documents, listening to the hearings, listening to the \nambassadors from all the other nations, listening to people on every \nside of this issue.\n  The decision that we have to make right here today is what are the \nconsequences, ultimately, of this decision. And the fact is we have \nlearned that Iran is only several weeks away from the possibility of \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon. Those are the hard, cold facts that we \nhave been told. They haven't, because of the sanctions and the \nrestrictions that are in place. They have enough fissile material to \nmake 8 to 10, maybe as many as 12 nuclear weapons.\n  So what does this deal do? What makes them give up 98 percent of that \nfissile material? They won't have enough to build one bomb if this \nagreement is fully implemented. It makes them get rid of two-thirds of \nthe centrifuges. They will not be able to develop one bomb if this deal \nis implemented.\n  If this deal is implemented, we retain the support of the \ninternational community, all of whom are committed to seeing to it that \nIran does not have a nuclear weapon. And for those who prefer a \nmilitary option, it is not taken off the table.\n  We need to remind ourselves that until all of these conditions are \nmet, none of the sanctions are lifted. They can be snapped back in a \nminute. We have got 24-hour, 7-days-a-week camera inspection. We have \nunprecedented inspection.\n  If they violate this agreement, we will know about it. We can snap \nback the sanctions. And for those who want a military option, that is \nstill on the table.\n  This agreement gives peace a chance. This agreement gives diplomacy a \nchance. It is something that we can ill afford. The opposite may very \nwell be something that forces us into another war in the Middle East, \ncosting us trillions in treasury, costing us blood, and creating the \nprospects of a confrontation that is unimaginable and unacceptable.\n\n  We must give diplomacy a chance. That is what this agreement is all \nabout, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. \nWomack).\n  Mr. WOMACK. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the last few days, our Nation has heard from its \nelected Representatives on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, \naffectionately known as the Iran nuclear deal. I stand here today to \nadd my name to the list of Members who recognize what a terrible deal \nthis is and the grave danger a ``yes'' vote creates for humanity.\n  It has been said by most that this will be one of the most important \nvotes a Member will cast in his or her term in Congress. I agree.\n  It has been said by many that it paves the way for a nuclear-armed \nIran. I agree.\n  It has been said by many that lifting of sanctions will further \ndestabilize an already troubled region. I agree.\n  And it is indisputable, Mr. Speaker, as most have admitted, that Iran \nis the largest state sponsor of terror. I could go on and on: self-\ninspections, ballistic missiles, retention of centrifuges, side deals.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not just a bad deal. It is unconscionable that \nwe would consider anything that leaves a path for Iran to possess a \nweapon, as this agreement does.\n  A ``yes'' vote, Mr. Speaker, will be on the wrong side of history. I \nurge my colleagues to stand with the American people, defeat the \nresolution, and stop this very bad deal.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, with all the rhetoric invoked around this\n\n[[Page H5956]]\n\nagreement, I am reminded of what President Ronald Reagan--since his \nname was used just a few moments ago by the leader--told Soviet leader \nMikhail Gorbachev in November of 1985 when they discussed the nuclear \narms reduction. Go back to history and not have selective history. \nPresident Reagan said this: ``I bet the hard-liners in both our \ncountries are bleeding when we shake hands.''\n  If that doesn't resonate, what will?\n  And when the United States struck an agreement with the Soviet Union \n2 years later to reduce the size of our Nation's nuclear arsenals, \nPresident Reagan received much criticism, including, as conservative \ncolumnist George Will put it, for accelerating--listen to this--``the \nmoral disarmament of the West by elevating wishful thinking to the \nstatus of political philosophy.''\n  Almost 30 years later, we see that President Reagan's actions were \nnot a capitulation to an entrenched enemy, but instead the \nunderpinnings of a larger strategy that reduced the nuclear threat.\n  This agreement should not be judged on its ability to curb Iran's \nhateful rhetoric or its role in destabilizing the Middle East, because \nthat was never the goal of the agreement.\n  No agreement can be perfect, but I am not convinced that a better \ndeal--which exists only in the abstract at this point--will materialize \nif Congress were to reject the one before us.\n  Rejecting this agreement, Mr. Speaker, would require the world's \nlargest economies, who are party to this multilateral agreement, to \nfollow our lead and reimpose sanctions.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nCostello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this is a bad deal. Even \nmany of those who have found a way to justify voting for this deal can \nsee that it is a bad deal. This deal enables Iran more money to fund \nterror, accumulate more power, and it will lead to a nuclear arms race \nin the Middle East--and those points aren't disputable.\n  This deal authorizes Iran so much control over the inspection process \nthat it is not possible to say that this deal provides the level of \nverification that even the administration demanded up until a few \nmonths ago.\n  Why do I say that? Because we can't even see what the inspection \nprocedures are other than that Iran gets to inspect itself. There is \nnot accountability to Iran in this deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am perplexed how one can vote for this deal without \nknowing what the actual inspection and verification procedures are. We \nare sacrificing our strength and leverage to the unknown.\n  What is known is that the statements coming out of Tehran over the \npast week reinforce that they cannot be trusted, that they will play \ngames, and that their motives are evil and their terrorist activities \nwill continue.\n  Vote ``no'' to this deal.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member \nfor doing the work necessary in a bipartisan way to inform the American \npeople, as well as our body, of the concerns here today. So I rise \ntoday in strong and bipartisan opposition to the President's dangerous \ndeal with Iran.\n  This one-sided deal gives Iran virtually everything it wants, \nultimately paving the way for them to develop a nuclear weapon and \nfurther destabilize the Middle East. It gives the Iranians billions in \nsanctions relief that will be used to finance terrorism. It gives Iran \n24 days to cover its tracks before inspectors are allowed in. It even \nincludes secret side deals that the President, Congress, and the \nAmerican people have not seen.\n  Meanwhile, four Americans tragically languish in Iranian prisons, \nincluding one Michiganian.\n  Mr. Speaker, at moments like this, party politics must take a \nbackseat to the safety of the American people. I urge my colleagues to \nstand with our ally, Israel. Stand for security. Stand for peace. Stand \nfor America. Don't reward Iran for spreading terrorism, abusing human \nrights, and holding Americans hostage.\n  Reject this deal, and let's demand the right one.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nRokita).\n  Mr. ROKITA. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, a constituent, Ms. Debora Avgerinos, visited me the \nother day. She owns a restaurant in Brownsburg, Indiana, and she was \nperplexed about this agreement.\n  One of the things she mentioned was that in her restaurant OSHA, the \nEPA, and anyone else from the Federal Government can come and inspect \nher at any time with no notice. Such is the case with this upside-down \nadministration. Our own Americans can be inspected at any time.\n  Yet, when it comes to the world's biggest sponsor of terrorism, we \ncan't inspect them at all. We have to go through a third party and wait \nat least 24 days. Common sense turned upside down. Except in this case, \nMr. Speaker, it is with grave danger to Americans and grave danger to \nour friend, Israel.\n  Now, the President said it is either this deal or war, and, in fact, \nthere is no other deal, and I think that is patently false. In fact, I \nbelieve that this deal will, in all likelihood, bring war.\n  And why do I think that?\n  Well, we are putting $150 billion back in the hands of Iranians, and \nI want to know: Who here thinks that they are going to build hospitals? \nWho here thinks they are going to use that $150 billion to help \nIranians?\n  They are going to use it for ``death to America.''\n  Please vote against this deal.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maine \n(Mr. Poliquin).\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, the Iranian Government has American blood \non its hands. It vows to kill as many more U.S. citizens as it can; it \nis committed to destroying Israel; and it funds, trains, and arms \nterrorists throughout the Middle East.\n  This nuclear deal with Iran does not dismantle their program. It \nrewards Iran with $100 billion in cash and frozen assets, and there are \nno anytime, anywhere inspections. In 5 years, Iran can develop or buy \nconventional weapons, and in 8 years, it can buy or develop an \nintercontinental ballistic missile.\n  Now, some Members here in the House and in the Senate hope that these \nradical mullahs will abandon their quest to become a military power. I \nsubmit to you, Mr. Speaker, that hope is not a national security \nstrategy, especially against those who wish to kill us.\n  Mr. Speaker, the best way to protect our homeland and to keep us safe \nis to reject this deal.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, just over a half a century ago, John \nF. Kennedy, in an era of difficult engagements with the Soviets, said: \n``Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to \nnegotiate.''\n  President Obama's diplomacy with Iran is grounded in strength and \nrealism, but it is animated by something all too rare in foreign \nrelations: hope. This is a strong deal that represents our best hope \nfor lasting security and peace.\n  As a veteran, I stand with our President and support this deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, President Reagan walked away from a bad deal in Iceland. \nHe walked away, and then he applied pressure; and as a consequence of \nthat pressure, he then got a good deal.\n  In the case of this administration, they did not walk away from a bad \ndeal during the interim agreement. As a matter of fact, this \nadministration rejected the stronger pressure that this House passed, \nwith a vote of 400-20, and held that bill up in the Senate during its \nnegotiations in the prior Congress and did not give us the leverage we \nneeded for a good deal. But that is still available to us.\n  Frankly, we all have experience with North Korea. We remember what \nhappened. But Iran won't have to cheat like North Korea did to get \nclose to a bomb, and that is because the essential\n\n[[Page H5957]]\n\nrestrictions on Iran's key bomb-making technology expire. They sunset \nin 10 to 15 years. After these restrictions expire, Iran will be left \nwith an internationally recognized, industrial-scale nuclear program--\nand that is what the President concedes. As the President said of his \nown agreement, in year 13, 14, 15, Iran's breakout times would have \nshrunk almost down to zero.\n  A former State Department official testified to the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee that this sunset clause is a disaster. It will enable the \nleading state sponsor of terrorism to produce enough material for \ndozens of nuclear weapons, all under the terms of the agreement.\n  As another expert witness pointed out, the bet that the \nadministration is taking is that in 10 or 15 years, we will have a \nkinder, gentler Iran. But we are not going to have a kinder, gentler \nIran because we are releasing to Iran $100 billion in immediate \nsanctions relief. That is the down payment. And Iran is guaranteed in \nall of this a reconnection to the global economy.\n  Now, the point I want to make to the Members here is that that does \nnot go to the average Iranian. It is the Quds Forces; it is the IRGC; \nit is the clerics that took over the major corporations in Iran; they \nare the ones that are going to receive that $100 billion, and we \nalready know the impact of that. It is going to solidify the Supreme \nLeader's grip on power. That is why he did the deal, to keep his \nrevolution intact.\n  We had the bottom falling out of the price of oil. We had \nhyperinflation in Iran. We were in the position, had we exerted the \nadditional pressure, to force a real choice between economic collapse \nand actual compromise on this program rather than what we got.\n\n  But, by removing economic sanctions, the President is withdrawing one \nof our most successful peaceful tools from confronting the regime; and, \nas a result, 200 retired generals and admirals concluded this agreement \nwill enable Iran to become far more dangerous.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think this is a terrible deal. This administration has \nmade a lot of mistakes when it comes to foreign policy. This has got to \nbe the worst one because this deal will not stop Iran from getting a \nbomb. This deal will all but guarantee it.\n  We went into these negotiations saying that Iran had to eliminate its \nnuclear program, all of it, full stop. Now, they are saying that was \nunrealistic, too unreasonable, too pie-in-the-sky.\n  And we are handing over hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions \nrelief. So Iran gets billions of dollars in exchange for what? For \ntaking apart some--not all, just some--of its nuclear program?\n  And then, in 10 or 15 years, all of these limits expire. In other \nwords, they are getting something for essentially nothing. It is a \nsteal. And that is if they don't cheat.\n  Now, the administration says that this deal will bring about \nunprecedented transparency. We will get regular access, they say. We \nwill see what Iran is up to, they say. But if the inspectors think \nsomething is up, Iran has 24 days to cover its tracks and, in some \ncases, Iran's own inspectors will get to collect the evidence.\n  Finally, against all of the advice from our military, we are going to \nlet Iran buy ballistic missiles in just 8 years. Mr. Speaker, you only \nbuy ballistic missiles if you are looking to build a bomb.\n  I get why Russia and China like this idea. They get another big \ncustomer. But I don't, for the life of me, understand why we would ever \nagree to this.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President is taking a huge gamble here. He thinks if \nwe make nice with the Iranian regime they will change their ways. Bring \nthem into the global economy, and they will become more like us.\n  Now, I think the Iranian people, they want democracy, they want \nfreedom. But we are not talking about the Iranian people here. We are \ntalking about an extremist regime that is unaccountable to their own \npeople.\n  This is a regime that chants ``death to America.'' This is a regime \nthat funds terrorism all around the world. This is a regime that has \ncalled for wiping Israel off the map.\n  I am all for diplomacy, but I'm not for rewarding a rogue regime.\n  I would also point out that the sanctions we are lifting will let \nEuropean and Asian companies build up Iran's economy, and they will \nmake the regime even stronger. And should Iran start to cheat--which \nthey have a pretty darn good track record of doing so--it will be that \nmuch harder to put back in place the sanctions. Our trading partners, \nthey will feel the pinch, and they won't want to hold this regime \naccountable.\n  So I want to stress how fervently I oppose this deal. I know the \nPresident may have already lined up enough support to save his deal, \nbut with this vote--with this vote--we need to send a message to both \nIran and to the world: The regime may have bamboozled this \nadministration, but the American people know that this is a rotten \ndeal.\n  And I fear that, because of this deal, the Middle East and the world \nat large will only become a much, much more dangerous place.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Van Hollen), the ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my friend, Mr. Levin.\n  Mr. Speaker, this agreement represents the best path to achieving our \ngoal of preventing Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon, and it \nadvances the national security interests of the United States and our \nallies, including Israel.\n  Mr. Speaker, for years, the Congress, the President, our European \npartners, and the international community have imposed a series of \ntough economic sanctions on Iran with the goal of preventing Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon. Those sanctions brought Iran to the \nnegotiating table and I commend President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and \nthe entire team, along with our P5+1 partners, for their efforts to \nnegotiate an agreement to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.\n  The question for Members of Congress, who will vote on this \nagreement, is whether it achieves its stated goals.\n  After the JCPOA was submitted to Congress on July 19, 2015, I \ncarefully reviewed all of its terms, attended the classified briefings \nand numerous presentations, and reviewed the transcripts of all the \nhearings that have been held in both the House and the Senate. I also \nmet with opponents and supporters of the agreement before announcing my \ndecision on July 30, 2015, the day after the final hearings before the \nCongressional August recess. While I respect the opinions of those on \nboth sides of this issue, I concluded that this agreement advances the \nnational security interests of the United States and all of our allies, \nincluding our partner Israel. This agreement is the best path to \nachieve our goal--that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon. Indeed, I \nfirmly believe that, should Congress block this agreement, we would \nundermine that goal, inadvertently weaken and isolate America, and \nstrengthen Iran.\n  The benefit of any agreement must be measured against the real-world \nconsequences of no agreement. Many forget that when these negotiations \nbegan in earnest two years ago, Iran was a threshold nuclear weapons \nstate and remains so until and unless this agreement is implemented. As \nPrime Minister Netanyahu warned at the United Nations in 2012, Iran was \na few months away from having enough highly enriched uranium to produce \nits first bomb. Today, prior to the implementation of this agreement, \nit has a nuclear stockpile that, if further enriched, could produce up \nto 10 bombs. It currently has installed nearly 20,000 centrifuges that \ncould convert that fuel into weapons material. Indeed, many analysts \nbelieve that the combination of Iran's nuclear stockpile and its \ncentrifuges would allow it to produce enough weapons-grade nuclear \nmaterial for a bomb in two months.\n  In addition, Iran has been enriching some of its nuclear material at \nits deep underground reactor at Fordow, a very difficult target to hit \nmilitarily. Moreover, Iran was in the process of building a heavy-water \nreactor at Arak, which could generate plutonium to be used for a \nnuclear weapon. Finally, Iran has been operating for years under an \ninadequate verification regime that increases the risks of a covert \nprogram going undetected.\n  This agreement blocks all of these paths to acquiring weapons-grade \nnuclear material and puts in place an inspection system that assures \nthe detection of any violation and future dash to acquire a nuclear \nweapon. The Interim Agreement has already neutralized Iran's stockpile \nof highly enriched uranium that Prime Minister Netanyahu highlighted in \nhis speech. This final agreement will significantly scale back the \nremainder of its program. Iran's\n\n[[Page H5958]]\n\nstockpile of enriched uranium will be cut from 9,900 kg to 300 kg, and \nthat remainder will be limited to low-enriched uranium that cannot be \nused for a weapon. In addition, the agreement removes two-thirds of \nIran's installed centrifuges. No enrichment activities may be conducted \nat Fordow for a period of 15 years, and the facility at Arak will be \npermanently converted to one that does not produce weapons-grade \nplutonium.\n  Taken together, these measures will extend the breakout time from \nabout two months to at least a year and put in place layers of \nverification measures over different timelines, including some that \nremain in place permanently. It is generally agreed that these measures \nwould allow us to detect any effort by Iran to use its current nuclear \nfacilities--Natanz, Fordow, or Arak--to violate the agreement. The main \ncriticism with respect to verification is that the agreement does not \nsufficiently guard against an effort by Iran to develop a secret \nuranium supply chain and enrichment capacity at a covert place. \nHowever, the reality is that the agreement permanently puts in place an \ninspection mechanism that is more rigorous than any previous arms \ncontrol agreement and more stringent than the current system. The \nagreement ultimately requires inspections of any suspected Iranian \nnuclear site with the vote of the United States, Britain, France, \nGermany, and the European Union. Neither the Chinese nor the Russians \ncan block such inspections in the face of a united Western front. Are \nwe really better off without this verification regime than with it?\n  In exchange for rolling back its nuclear program and accepting this \nverification regime, Iran will obtain relief from those sanctions that \nare tied to its nuclear program. However, that relief will only come \nafter Iran has verifiably reduced its nuclear program as required. \nMoreover, if Iran backslides on those commitments, the sanctions will \nsnap back into place. The snapback procedure is triggered if the U.S. \nregisters a formal complaint against Iran with the special commission \ncreated for that purpose. In addition, those U.S. sanctions that are \nnot related to the Iranian nuclear program will remain in place, \nincluding U.S. sanctions related to Iran's human rights violations, \nsupport for terrorism, and missile program.\n  There are some who oppose the agreement because it does not prevent \nIran from engaging in adversarial actions throughout the Gulf, the \nMiddle East, and elsewhere. That conduct, however, was never within the \nscope of these negotiations nor the objective of the international \nsanctions regime aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nweapon. President Reagan understood the distinction between changing \nbehavior and achieving verifiable limits on weapons programs. He \nnegotiated arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, not because \nhe thought it would change the character of ``the Evil Empire'' but \nbecause limiting their nuclear arsenal was in the national security \ninterests of the U.S. and our allies. That reality is also true today. \nAn Iranian regime with nuclear capability would present a much greater \nthreat to the region than an Iran without one. In fact, today, as a \nthreshold nuclear weapons state, Iran wields more influence than it \nwill under the constraints of this agreement. That is why our focus has \nappropriately been on reining in the Iranian nuclear program.\n  The lifting of the sanctions will certainly give Iran additional \nresources to support its priorities. Given the political dynamic in \nIran, some of those additional resources will likely be invested to \nimprove the domestic standard of living. But even if all the resources \nwere used to support their proxies in the region, respected regional \nobservers agree that they are unlikely to make a significant strategic \ndifference. Moreover, any effort by Iran to increase support for its \nproxies can be checked by the U.S. and our allies through \ncountermeasures. Finally, it is clear that any alternative agreement \nopponents seek would also result in the lifting of the sanctions and \nfreeing up these resources.\n  In my view, opponents of the agreement have failed to demonstrate how \nwe will be in a better position if Congress were to block it. Without \nan agreement, the Iranians will immediately revert to their status as a \nthreshold nuclear weapons state. In other words, they immediately pose \nthe threat that Prime Minister Netanyahu warned about in his U.N. \nspeech. At the same time, the international consensus we have built for \nsanctions, which was already starting to fray, would begin to collapse \nentirely. We would be immediately left with the worst of all worlds--a \nthreshold nuclear weapons state with diminished sanctions and little \nleverage for the United States.\n  I disagree with the view that we can force the Iranians back to the \nnegotiating table to get a better deal. All of our European partners \nhave signed on to the current agreement. Consequently, the U.S. would \nbe isolated in its quest to return to negotiations. And in the unlikely \nevent that we somehow returned to negotiations, the critics have not \npresented a plausible scenario for achieving a better agreement in a \nworld where fewer sanctions means less economic pressure.\n  The bottom line is that if Congress were to block the agreement and \nthe Iranians were to resume nuclear enrichment activities, the only way \nto stop them, at least temporarily, would be by military action. That \nwould unleash significant negative consequences that could jeopardize \nAmerican troops in the region, drag us into another ground war in the \nMiddle East, and trigger unpredictable responses elsewhere. Moreover, \nthe United States would be totally isolated from most of the world, \nincluding our Western partners. The folly of that go-it-alone military \napproach would be compounded by the fact that such action would only \ndeal a temporary setback to an Iranian nuclear program. They would \nlikely respond by putting their nuclear enrichment activities deeper \nunderground and would likely be more determined than ever to build a \nnuclear arsenal.\n  We don't have to take that path. This agreement will give us a long \nperiod of time to test the Iranians' compliance and assess their \nintentions. During that period, it will give us a treasure trove of \ninformation about the scope and capabilities of the limited Iranian \nnuclear program. Throughout that period and beyond, we reserve all of \nour options, including a military option, to respond to any Iranian \nattempt to break out and produce enough highly enriched material to \nmake a bomb. But we will have two advantages over the situation as it \nis today--a more comprehensive verification regime to detect any \nviolation and a much longer breakout period in which to respond.\n  As former Secretary Clinton has indicated, the fact that we have \nsuccessfully limited the scope of Iran's nuclear program does not mean \nwe have limited its ambitions in the region. We must continue to work \nwith our friends and allies to constantly contain and confront Iranian \naggression in the region. The United States and Israel must always \nstand together to confront that threat. The fact remains that Iranian \nsupport for their terrorist proxy Hezbollah continues to destabilize \nLebanon and poses a direct threat to Israel, as does its support for \nHamas. We must do all we can to ensure that our ally Israel maintains \nits qualitative military edge in the region, including providing \nincreased funding for Israel's Arrow anti-ballistic missile and Iron \nDome anti-rocket systems. Consideration should also be given to \npreviously denied weapons if a need for such enhanced capabilities \narises. We must always remember that some of Iran's leaders have called \nfor the destruction of Israel and we must never forget the awful past \nthat teaches us not to ignore those threats.\n  The threats Iran poses in the region are real. But all those threats \nare compounded by an Iran that is a threshold nuclear weapons state. \nThis agreement will roll back the Iranian nuclear program and provide \nus with greater ability to detect and more time to respond to any \nfuture Iranian attempt to build a nuclear weapon.\n  For all of the reasons given above, I've concluded that this is an \nhistoric agreement that should be supported by the Congress.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  For far too long, we faced the nightmare of Iran with nuclear bombs. \nImpacted by heavy sanctions, Iran finally agreed to negotiate, led by \nthe United States and five other nations. After agreeing on a \nframework, which Iran complied with, the parties completed the much-\ndetailed Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  When I issued my statement of support for the JCPOA 6 weeks ago, its \nfate was uncertain. What decisively turned the tide was the impassioned \nleadership of the President with Secretaries Kerry and Moniz, combined \nwith a momentous outpouring of support outside the political realm from \na vast array of scientific experts, experienced diplomats, key figures \nfrom all religious faiths, a wide variety of military leaders, and \ninformed expressions from major former governmental figures of the \nhighest integrity, including Colin Powell and Brent Scowcroft.\n  It also became increasingly clear that there was no other workable \nalternative. This point was reinforced by the joint statement yesterday \nfrom British Prime Minister Cameron, French President Hollande and \nGerman Chancellor Merkel. They said, among other points:\n\n       This is not an agreement based on trust or on any \n     assumption about how Iran may look in 10 or 15 years. It is \n     based on detailed, tightly written controls that are \n     verifiable and long-lasting. Iran will have strong incentives \n     not to cheat: The near certainty of getting caught and the \n     consequences that would follow would make this a losing \n     option.\n\n  It is now absolutely clear that the JCPOA will go into effect, \nrequiring the initial set of detailed obligations\n\n[[Page H5959]]\n\nthat Iran must fulfill. It is, therefore, time to go on.\n  This institution, which has been a major center of attacks on the \nJCPOA, would hopefully have those who opposed now join with those who \nsupported the agreement and work together to rekindle the kind of \noverall bipartisanship that Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan urged \nshould apply to key foreign policy issues as they ``approached the \nwater's edge.''\n  Surely this kind of rekindled bipartisanship needs to be undertaken \nin particular to take steps to deepen support for Israel's security, to \nfight and defeat terrorism, and to rekindle efforts for viable peace \nnegotiations.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 3461, which is a vote of \napproval for the comprehensive agreement that would prevent Iran from \ngetting a nuclear weapon.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on H.R. 3460, which would suspend the \nPresident's authority to waive sanctions and, in effect, prevent him \nfrom implementing the comprehensive agreement.\n  I close. It is, indeed, time to move on and to take the next steps. \nFailure to do so but, instead, to perpetuate partisanship will, I \nstrongly believe, be counterproductive for any who try it and for our \nentire Nation. We can and we must do much better.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins), a \nmember of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, sanctions are about more than nuclear weapons. They are \nabout the principles and values America holds dear.\n  Iran continues to hold American prisoners hostage, sponsor terrorism \naround the world, and American soldiers have died because of the \nterrorist actions of Iran. And just this week the Iranian Supreme \nLeader said that Israel will be destroyed within 25 years.\n  Now, every lawmaker must ask: Are we willing to put $150 billion into \nthe hands of an Iranian regime who chants ``Death to America'' and \nwants to eliminate Israel from the Earth?\n  We must ask: Are we willing to risk American lives on the promises of \na leader who believes those same American lives are worth nothing?\n  I refuse to sit idly by while this administration leaves the safety, \nstability, and security of everyone everywhere at the whim of Iran, \nwhose neighbors fear them and allies consist of the Assad regime and \nHezbollah. This agreement with Iran would threaten all that we hold \ndear.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join the bipartisan opposition against \nthe Iran deal and, instead, support the security of America above the \ndangerous desires of Iran.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) who, to put it mildly, is a \nsenior member of our committee.\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, my fellow Members, this is a historic \noccasion for the House and a very emotional time for me because, \nunfortunately, I have known war. I have known the horrors of war.\n  And I speak for all of those that have had this horrendous experience \nto say that we should always give diplomacy a chance before we put any \nAmerican in harm's way.\n  I don't think any of us, with any degree of certainty, have any idea \nwhether this agreement is going to hold or if we can contain the \ncriminal, inhumane ambitions of the leadership in Iran.\n  What we do know is that the international powers not just of China, \nnot just of Russia, but of the United Kingdom, of France, of Germany, \nand the thinking of the United States of America, truly believe that \nthis is the best possible way to avoid war.\n  It would seem to me that now is not the time for us to engage in \nexchanges that separate and bring us apart as a Nation. The rules of \nthe House and the Senate make it abundantly clear that, whether you \nlike it or not, this is going to become the policy of the United States \nof America. This will not be the policy of President Obama, of \nDemocrats or Republicans, but the policy of our great Nation.\n  It pains me, as I am about to leave service in this august body, that \nwe have people in this Chamber that have such hatred and disdain for \nthe leadership of this country that they would put this feeling above \nwhat is the best policy for the security of this great, beloved Nation \nof mine.\n  I know that, if the President of the United States was able to walk \non water, there would be people in this Chamber that would say: See, we \ntold you that he couldn't swim.\n  And so what I am saying----\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. RANGEL. I don't think I can do that. Because the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Ryan) said that China and Russia are supporting this \nbecause they want to sell arms to Iran.\n  I think that was despicable because that includes the United Kingdom, \nthat includes France, that includes Germany, that includes people that \nare talking about that this is the best way that we are able to do \nthis.\n  So what I am saying is this: 14 years ago a terrible thing happened \nto my country, to my city, when terrorists struck on 9/11. And now we \nhave the opportunity to bring our country together the way we did then. \nFourteen years ago, there were no Republicans. There were no Democrats. \nThere were Americans that would say we have to come together.\n  We are not going to change this agreement. This is the policy of the \nUnited States of America--or soon will be. Should we not be saying: \nWhat is the enforcement? What are we going to do? What happens if they \nviolate it?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. RANGEL. I thank the ranking member.\n  Are we here to embarrass Presidents, Republicans, and Democrats or \nare we here to preserve the dignity and the integrity of the United \nStates of America, no matter who is the President?\n  If ever there was a time for us to come together and support the \npolicy, the time is now.\n  Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, the oldest trick in the book, if you cannot win a debate \non the merits, is to impugn the other person's motives.\n  People who are opposing this agreement, whether they be Republicans \nor many of the Democrats who are opposing this agreement, are opposing \nthis agreement because it is a terrible agreement, and there is no \nother reason.\n\n\n                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind all persons in the \ngallery that they are here as guests of the House and that any \nmanifestation of approval or disapproval of proceedings is in violation \nof the rules of the House.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black), a member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, this nuclear deal isn't much of a deal at \nall. It is a gift to the Iranian regime.\n  For starters, we gave them permanent sanctions relief to the tune of \n$150 billion in exchange for temporary enrichment restrictions.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Ayatollah calls the United States the Great Satan, \nand just this week he said that Israel will not exist in 25 years.\n  Imagine the evil that this regime can carry out when they cash in \ntheir billions. Under this agreement, Iran will undoubtedly become the \ncentral bank of terror.\n  What is more, with this deal, we shrugged off the opportunity for \ntrue ``anytime, anywhere'' inspections. Instead, we gave Iran an \nopportunity of at least 24 days to slow-walk investigations of their \nnuclear sites and conceal signs of noncompliance.\n  Even worse, under a secretive side deal that was not transmitted here \nto Congress, we have learned that Iran will be allowed to self-inspect \na key military base.\n  So to be clear, Members of this body who vote for this agreement will \nbe voting for a deal that they have not seen in full.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am not prepared to tell the Tennesseans that I \nrepresent\n\n[[Page H5960]]\n\nthat I voted for an agreement with the world's leading state sponsor of \nterrorism without knowing every last detail. We cannot and should not \nleave anything to chance when it comes to the security of America and \nour allies.\n  I will be casting my vote on behalf of Tennessee's Sixth District \nagainst this dangerous deal, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Lewis), another valued member of our committee.\n  Mr. LEWIS. I thank my friend, the ranking member, for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of diplomacy and a pathway to peace.\n  For many months I thought long and hard about this decision. I \nattended briefings, read the documents, and met with citizens of my \ndistrict. I even had a long executive session with myself.\n  I reflected on the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., when he \ncalled upon us to rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but \nbeautiful, struggle for a new world. The way of peace is one of those \nimmutable principles.\n  And after much study, thought, and reflection, I believe that it is a \ngood deal. No, it may not be perfect. But do not let the perfect be the \nenemy of the good.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  I remember standing on this very floor several years ago and speaking \nagainst the war in Iraq. I said it then, and I will say it again today: \n``War is messy; it is bloody; it destroys the hopes, the aspirations, \nand the dreams of a people.''\n  The American people--and people around the world--are sick and tired \nof war and violence. We do not need more bombs, missiles, and guns. \nWhen you turn on the news, when you read the newspaper, you see a mass \ndislocation. Too many people are suffering, and many are desperate for \na chance at peace.\n  I believe in my heart of hearts that this may be the most important \nvote that we cast during our time in Congress. To put it simply, it is \nnonviolence or nonexistence.\n  It is my hope that my vote today, along with the votes of others, \nwill be a downpayment for peace towards a world community at peace with \nitself.\n  Maybe with this deal, we will send the message that we can lay down \nthe burdens and tools of war. Maybe we can come together as a family of \nhuman beings.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a moral obligation, a mission, and a mandate to \ngive peace a chance. Give peace a chance.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to \nthe distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner), the Speaker of the \nHouse.\n  Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, later today, we are going to \ncast two votes. These votes will be amongst the most consequential \nvotes that we will cast--some of us--in our careers.\n  Our Founding Fathers charged both the President and the Congress with \nproviding for the common defense for good reason. It is the core \nresponsibility of our Federal Government. It is the key to our freedom \nand for all of our opportunities.\n  That is why, at the front of the oath every Member takes, it states: \n``I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.''\n  As we consider this nuclear agreement with Iran, it is our duty to \ndetermine whether it will keep America safe.\n  Sadly, this deal is far worse than anything I could have imagined. \nWhy? It is because the President and his negotiators broke every one of \ntheir promises.\n  Does this deal dismantle Iran's nuclear program or shut off their \npath to a nuclear weapon as they promised it would? No. Instead, it \nallows Iran to keep thousands of nuclear centrifuges spinning, as they \nare today. Within 10 years, in the best case, it allows Iran to achieve \na nuclear status.\n  Was this agreement built on verification? No. It appears a side deal \nwill trust Iran to self-inspect a key site where the regime conducted \ntests on nuclear detonators. Of course, we haven't seen that actionable \nside deal, and we don't know if there are any other secret components.\n  Does this agreement allow inspectors to have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 \naccess as they promised it would? No. Inspectors will have to wait up \nto 24 days for access to suspicious sites.\n  Will sanctions snap back? No. The administration admits that nothing \nat the UN happens in a snap.\n  Does it shut down Iran's ballistic missile program as they promised \nit would? No. Actually, the agreement lifts the arms and missile \nembargoes in 5 and 8 years, respectively, and it allows Iran to build \nICBMs capable of delivering a nuclear warhead right here at the United \nStates of America.\n  Does this agreement affect Iran's status as the world's leading \nsponsor of terror? Yes, it actually does. It hands Iran billions of \ndollars to support more of their terrorist activities around that part \nof the world, and it gives amnesty to the shadow commander responsible \nfor the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq.\n  This is all without Iran cheating. That is right; this is such a bad \ndeal that the Ayatollah won't even have to cheat to be just steps away \nfrom a nuclear weapon.\n  Today, we are going to cast two votes. These votes are aimed at \nstopping President Obama from unilaterally lifting sanctions on Iran \nand ensuring accountability.\n  My colleagues, in pursuing this deal with Iran, President Obama \nrefused to listen. He ignored the concerns of the American people, \nnational security experts, and a bipartisan majority here in the \nCongress. Now, he is preparing to try and force this deal over our \nobjections.\n  Never in our history has something with so many consequences for our \nnational security been rammed through with such little support.\n  Today is September 11. It is a day for all Americans to come together \nand for us to keep the oath we swore to our Constitution. Our fight to \nstop this bad deal, frankly, is just beginning. We will not let the \nAmerican people down.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to \nthe gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our leader, who, indeed, \nas she goes to speak, has been our leader on this effort.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank him for his leadership, for the courage it took for him and the \nhumility to listen and to learn what was in this legislation and this \nagreement. That is something that I commend the Members of the House \nfor doing, to listen and to learn.\n  Our distinguished Speaker just referenced the oath of office that we \ntake when we become Members of Congress. It is a vow that we make to \nthe American people, to protect and support our Constitution and our \nresponsibility to protect and defend the American people.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, we will vote on an agreement to make America \nsafer--indeed, to make the world a safer place--so say the nuclear \nscientists and the diplomats, so say the military and security leaders \nof both parties or of no party, so does the faith community beseech us \nto do.\n  This morning, Father Conroy offered a prayer to God to ``help the \nMembers of this House to recognize that you are with us in our \ndeliberations.'' Indeed, as we cast our votes on this historic \nagreement, we are thankful to God, that God was with us to, again, give \nus the humility to learn and the courage to act; and for that, we \nshould all be grateful.\n  It is important to note that support for this agreement, as I have \nsaid, comes from both sides of the aisle. More than 100 former \ndiplomats--Democrats and Republicans and ambassadors, et cetera--wrote:\n\n       In our judgment, the agreement deserves congressional \n     support and the opportunity to show it can work. We firmly \n     believe that the most effective way to protect U.S. national \n     security and that of our allies and friends is to ensure that \n     tough-minded diplomacy has a chance to succeed before \n     considering other more risky alternatives.\n\n  Thirty-six generals and admirals wrote: ``There is no better option \nto prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon. If the Iranians cheat''--as the \nSpeaker suggested they might--``If the Iranians cheat, our advanced \ntechnology, intelligence and the inspections will reveal it, and U.S. \nmilitary options remain on\n\n[[Page H5961]]\n\nthe table. And if the deal is rejected by America, the Iranians could \nhave a nuclear weapon within a year. The choice is stark.''\n  What is mysterious to me is that when our colleagues come to the \nfloor and say, under this agreement, Iran can be a nuclear power in 10 \nor 15 years, so we should reject this agreement, no. Without the \nagreement, they are a threshold nuclear power right now and can have a \nweapon within months or a year. It seems to me the choice is clear, as \nthe generals and admirals pointed out.\n  It is also interesting to note that our distinguished Speaker pointed \nout some shortcomings, in his view, in the agreement. That is disagreed \nwith by the best nuclear physicist, who wrote to congratulate the \nPresident on the agreement. Now, these are Nobel laureates, and these \nare engineers, nuclear physicists, who work and specialize in nuclear \nweapons research and development.\n  They said: ``We consider that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \nthe United States and its partners negotiated with Iran will advance \nthe cause of peace and security in the Middle East and can serve''--\nthis is really important--``as a guidepost for future non-proliferation \nagreements.''\n  They went on to say: ``This is an innovative agreement, with much \nmore stringent constraints than any previously negotiated non-\nproliferation framework.''\n  That is why they were congratulating the President of the United \nStates.\n  I mentioned the prayer of Father Conroy this morning. I also, this \nmorning, saw in The Washington Post that the Prime Minister of the \nU.K., David Cameron; the French President, Francois Hollande; and \nGerman Chancellor, Angela Merkel, wrote an op-ed that said: ``This is \nan important moment. It is a crucial opportunity at a time of \nheightened global uncertainty to show what diplomacy can achieve.''\n  These heads of state went on to state: ``This is not an agreement \nbased on trust or on any assumption about how Iran may look in 10 or 15 \nyears. It is based on detailed, tightly written controls that are \nverifiable and long-lasting.''\n  They said: ``We condemn in no uncertain terms that Iran does not \nrecognize the existence of the state of Israel and the unacceptable \nlanguage that Iran's leaders use about Israel. Israel's security \nmatters are, and will, remain our key interests, too.''\n  Prime Minister Cameron, President Hollande, and Chancellor Merkel \nthen said: ``We would not have reached the nuclear deal with Iran if we \ndid not think that it removed a threat to the region and the non-\nproliferation regime as a whole . . . We are confident that the \nagreement provides the foundation for resolving the conflict on Iran's \nnuclear program permanently. That is why we now want to embark on the \nfull implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.''\n  Today, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the agreement that \nenhances our vigilance and strengthens our security.\n  I just always am fond of quoting a story of Solomon in the Bible. \nWhen King David died and Solomon was to become king, he was uncertain \nas to his ability to be king in terms of his wisdom and the rest. He \nprayed to God and prayed that God would give him the wisdom because \nDavid was such a great king and how could he say to God, I am going to \nbe the king of your people, help me with wisdom?\n  God came to him in the night, and he said: Solomon, because you did \nnot ask for longevity, because you did not ask for great riches, \nbecause you did not ask for vengeance upon your enemies, I will give \nyou more wisdom than anyone has ever had; and you will be renowned for \nwisdom, the Solomon of wisdom which sprang from humility, the humility \nto pray for enlightenment, for knowledge, for wisdom, for judgment.\n  That humility is so essential in the job that we do here. We don't \nhave foregone conclusions. That is why I am so proud of my Members who \nspent so much time studying this issue, not only reading the agreement \nand the classified sections and the rest, but seeking answers, having \ninformation, seeking validation from generals and admirals and \nscientists and leaders of other countries as to what their actions \nwould be should we, unfortunately, reject this, which happily we will \nnot do today.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  They had the humility to open their minds to learn, and when they \nlearned, they had the courage to take action where some others of their \nfriends may not have arrived yet because they did not have the benefit \nof all of this information. Wherever Members come down on this issue, \nwe know one thing--that we have to come together in the end to protect \nour country and to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I say, mostly of my own experience, that I have had decades of \nexperience in tracking Iran and its nuclear ambitions. I have served \nlonger than anyone--more than two times more than anyone--on the \nIntelligence Committee, so I know of what I speak. I went to the \nIntelligence Committee to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and that gave me some judgment as to what the President \nbrought back in this agreement. Still, I was subjected to the harshest \nscrutiny as to, from my experience, if I thought that this was the best \npossible route we could achieve.\n  We mustn't judge agreements by what they don't do but respect them \nfor what they do do; and what this does is to make our country safer, \nthe region safer, and our friends in Israel safer as their own national \nsecurity experts have attested.\n  So I thank you, my colleagues. I thank you for listening, for \nlearning, for coming to whatever conclusion you came to, but for \nunderstanding that, at the end of the day, we have respect for each \nother's opinions and a regard for our responsibilities to our people, \nto the people in the region, to our friend Israel, and also a global \nresponsibility.\n  I join the nuclear physicist in congratulating President Barack Obama \nfor his great leadership and for giving us this opportunity.\n  Today, we will not just be making history as the approval of the \nagreement goes forward. We will be making progress for the cause of \npeace in the world.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), a distinguished member of the \nWays and Means Committee.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. I thank Chairman Ryan.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Democratic leader just recalled the invocation, that \nof invoking God's presence, and she said that we had prayed for wisdom, \nand she called us to act humbly.\n  So the question is: Are we willing to submit ourselves to the \ncollective wisdom of a majority of this body and to a majority of the \nother body? I would suggest a majority of this body and a majority of \nthe other body think this is a bad idea.\n  She also admonished us that we should listen and learn. It is not a \nbad idea, so let's listen to what is in the bill, itself. The bill, \nitself, gives $150 billion in sanctions relief to the Iranian \nGovernment.\n  The question is: What do we expect with $150 billion? Is it all going \nto go to pave roads? Is it going to go to build schools in Tehran? Is \nit going to fix water systems? I do not think so, and neither does \nPresident Obama. Listen to his own words.\n  This is Barack Obama:\n\n       Let's stipulate that some of the money will flow to \n     activities that we object to. We have no illusions about the \n     Iranian Government or the significance of the Revolutionary \n     Guard.\n\n  Listen to National Security Adviser Susan Rice when she says:\n\n       We should expect that some portion of that money would go \n     to the Iranian military and could potentially be used for all \n     kinds of bad behavior that we have seen in the region up \n     until now.\n\n  Let's listen to those words. They are clear. They are obvious.\n  So now think in terms of percentages of $150 billion. Is it going to \nbe half? Is it going to be a quarter? Is it going to be 10 percent? Is \nit going to be 1 percent--1 percent of that money--$1.5 billion? Doing \nwhat--funding Hamas? funding Hezbollah? killing Americans? Let's listen \nand let's learn.\n  Now, my friend from New York said this is definitely the policy of \nthe United States. Definitely. It is a fait\n\n[[Page H5962]]\n\naccompli. There is really no reason to have this debate and this \ndiscussion. It is all over according to his world view. I don't buy it. \nI don't buy that for a second. I am not going to lay down here and let \nthe President of the United States run roughshod in his probably--let's \nthink about it. Is this just a bad idea, or is this the worst bill \never? the worst idea ever? I think it wins the ``worst idea ever'' \naward.\n  Mr. Speaker, it was a week ago when it was crazy talk as to the idea \nthat the President of the United States had standing, and it was crazy \ntalk a week ago that the House of Representatives had standing in the \ncourts. Now, do you know what the courts have said? The House has \nstanding.\n  So, as to the notion that this is all done and that this is just a \nsettled case, it is not. I think we have got to be very, very clear \nabout what is going on, and we need to listen, and we need to learn, \nand we need to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, our Speaker stood before us a few \nminutes ago and sounded a somber, serious note. I am sorry the process \nthat we are going through does not reflect that somber, serious \nattitude. It is sad that it has come to this: a parody of what could \nhave been a week-long, thoughtful, thorough debate about our \nrelationship with Iran, which Republicans, instead, have turned into an \nincoherent, partisan shouting match. It ignores the reality, the \ncomplexity, and the opportunity.\n  There has been no discussion, for example, about how America \nseriously mismanaged our relationship with Iran since we helped the \nBritish overthrow their popularly elected government in 1953 and \ninstalled the Shah as dictator; how we backed the murderous Saddam \nHussein's war against Iran that cost up to 1 million lives, and we \nlooked the other way when he used poison gas--a real weapon of mass \ndestruction; how we labeled them the ``axis of evil'' when they were \nworking with us in a post-Taliban Afghanistan. It is amazing that the \nmajority of Iranian people still likes us.\n  Now, I strongly oppose the current Iranian leadership; but, for \nyears, I have been working for a diplomatic solution with other \ncountries because sanctions only work when other countries join us. \nWell, they did, and we have an opportunity today to enforce a \nnonnuclear future for Iran.\n  The Republican talking point is, somehow, they are going to get $150 \nbillion. That talking point, however, ignores the reality. Those five \npowerful countries that joined with us, that help get the agreement, \nthey are going to walk away if America walks away from the sanctions \nthey have imposed on Iran if America walks away from the deal. As \nmultilateral sanctions will dissolve, Iran will get its money anyway \nand nuclear weapons, if it wants, in a year or two. It will be the \nUnited States and Israel that will be isolated, and the world will be \nless safe.\n  These are some of the reasons that the major independent experts have \nsaid the Iran Nuclear agreement is the best alternative for the United \nStates. Not a perfect agreement, but the best agreement. Let's use all \nof our time and energy to make this agreement work and to strengthen \nrelationships in the Middle East to avoid more mistakes currently \nchampioned by the same people who gave us the disastrous Iraq war.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a distinguished member of the \nWays and Means Committee.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a horrible deal. In any deal, you never get what \nyou deserve. You get what you negotiate. Let me give you a contrast \nbetween what two Presidents say when they talk about deals.\n  President Obama has told America that it is either this agreement or \nwar. President Reagan said there is no argument over the choice between \npeace and war, but there is only one guaranteed way you can have peace, \nand you can have it in a second--surrender.\n  Now I want you to let your mind drift back to 14 years ago, on a \nmorning very eerily like today, when America awoke, and some Americans \nwere going off to work in the World Trade Center, when some Americans \nwere going off to work at the Pentagon, and when some Americans boarded \nflights for destinations that they thought they were going to get to. \nThree thousand Americans said good-bye that morning to their families \nand their loved ones, thinking that they would see them again, never \nknowing that they would never be able to say that again, would never be \nable to kiss them good-bye, would never be able again to celebrate a \nbirthday or any other meaningful event in their lives because of an act \nof terrorism.\n  Flight 93. By the way, it was United Flight 93. Thirty-seven \npassengers and seven crew members boarded the airplane destined for San \nFrancisco. That is not where the plane landed. That plane is embedded \nin a smoldering crater in the peaceful countryside of Shanksville, \nPennsylvania, because of terrorists. The members of that flight crew \nand those passengers performed the greatest act of religious sacrifice \nthat you can do. They gave up their lives for the lives of their fellow \nAmericans. They walked away from futures filled with promise and \ndecided it was more important at that moment to sacrifice themselves.\n  How in the world can we sit in America's House--and I speak to you \ntoday not as a Republican but as an American. My friends, as we let our \neyes fill with tears over the great loss that day and as our ears pick \nup on the message from our enemies in the East of ``death to Israel,'' \n``death to the Great Satan,'' ``death to America,'' let us resound with \nlong and lost strength and temerity and say: ``Listen. Never again. \nNever again. Never again.'' Let those words echo forever and ever, not \nonly in your ears but in your hearts. Do not cave in. Do not sacrifice \nthe safety, the security, and the stability of 330 million Americans \nfor the legacy of one man.\n  That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. That is \nnot who we will ever be.\n  My friends--and I mean, sincerely, my friends--and my fellow \nAmericans, vote against the greatest betrayal we have ever seen in this \ncountry. This is not a deal that protects America. It is unenforceable. \nIt is unverifiable. This is just a horrible deal.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I pause for a minute.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, as the last speech indicates, it is hardly \nby chance that the House Republican leadership has scheduled these \nvotes on 9/11--votes on an agreement to prevent Iran from developing a \nnuclear weapon--ever.\n  The justifiable fear of another terrorist attack and the justifiable \noutrage about the terrorist attack of 9/11 have been exploited before \ntoday. They were exploited to justify the disastrous invasion of Iraq. \nWhile few Americans today will recall that, actually, after 9/11 there \nwas some early support in Iran against al Qaeda terrorism, few can \nforget the oft repeated and rather deceitful warning that promoted the \nrush to war in Iraq: ``We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom \ncloud.''\n  Once again, the specter of this mushroom cloud is being raised with \nthose who would interfere with an international, diplomatic success--an \nagreement that would avoid putting us on another path to war. The same \nkind of folks who urged us to rush into Baghdad are the same folks who \ntold us back before we even had this agreement that it wouldn't work \nand that we ought to begin bombing in Tehran and in the surrounding \narea. They are the same folks who said that it would only take a few \ndays of bombing and it would all be over. It is the same poor logic \nthat took us into a disaster in Iraq, which cost so many families the \nultimate sacrifice and the waste of over $1 trillion.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  This is not a debate about the Twin Towers. It is a debate, though, \nthat would be a twin wrong if we follow the same approach we took the \nlast time.\n  I have supported sanctions against Iran.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman.\n\n[[Page H5963]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. DOGGETT. I have supported them at each opportunity, but this is \nnot about sanctions. It is about a last-ditch effort to undermine a \ndiplomatic victory.\n  Those who reject this victory are weak on alternatives. They talk \nabout a ``secret.'' The biggest secret is what they would do other than \nbomb first and ask questions later.\n  The director of the Mossad, the Israeli CIA, says we are putting in \nplace a verification system, which is second to none and has no \nprecedent.\n  Ultimately, reason will prevail this week in Congress. The President \nwill be sustained, and families here and in Israel will be safer.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Reed), a member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I have listened to this debate. I have read \nthis agreement. I heard my colleague from Illinois say something that \nresonates with me.\n  We should listen. First and foremost, we should listen to the \nAmerican people. They are overwhelmingly saying: This is dangerous. \nReject this deal. Let's listen to the leaders that say this puts us in \nmore jeopardy of going to war.\n  We all want peace. There is not a human being in America that wants \nto go to war. To classify us on this side of the aisle as having a \ndesire to go to war, shame. But you will get peace through strength, \nand you need to put the American citizens first.\n  What about our four fellow American citizens that are sitting in an \nIranian jail right now and the President said: We tried to negotiate \nit, but they wouldn't talk to us? Well, then you walk away.\n  What about the families that are represented in the $47 billion worth \nof judgments that have been filed against Iran because they suffered \nterrorist acts at the hands of Iran and we are going to give $150 \nbillion to Iran without paying those fellow American citizens, those \nfamilies who suffered and lost dear loved ones? Stupidity. American \ncitizens always must be first.\n  Iran has raised no confusion as to what its intention is here. It \nwants a nuclear weapon. It wants to destroy Israel. It wants to destroy \nAmerica. Listen to their own words. If you do, we would say we want \npeace, but it will be on our terms from a position of strength.\n  Vote ``no'' on this deal.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nCrowley), another distinguished member of our committee.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mike Kelly is a good man. I like Mike. I admire him. But \nI think he did a disservice to the House and to this debate by bringing \nup the issue of 9/11.\n  I do thank him for honesty for at least showing that that is what \nthis is all about, having this debate today and this vote today to stir \nthe emotions of the American people.\n  My emotions are always stirred on this day. Fourteen years ago, I \nknew people who died that day. My cousin died. My friends died. I don't \nneed to be reminded of that. But it will not cloud my decisionmaking on \nthis important issue.\n  Today I stand in support of a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. \nThis has been a difficult decision for me, and I know it has been for \nmany of my colleagues as well.\n  There are those who came out against this deal before you even read \nit. But for those of you who took the time to read the agreement and \ncame to a different conclusion, you have my deep and profound respect \nbecause we both share the same goals.\n  After carefully studying this agreement, I believe it is important to \ngive diplomacy the opportunity to succeed. The agreement takes \nimportant steps to address Iran's nuclear program.\n  Under this agreement, both the current uranium and plutonium paths to \na bomb are addressed and all of Iran's operating uranium enrichment \nwill be centralized into a single facility that is penetrable by U.S. \nair power.\n  This agreement does not constrain the United States from bolstering \nour allies and aggressively pushing back against Iran's other nefarious \nactivities.\n  There is more we can do and must do, including strengthening Israel, \nJordan, and our other allies in the region. Israel is the only country \nbeing threatened with annihilation. I know that. So it needs and \ndeserves a quantitative and qualitative military advantage.\n  And if this deal doesn't work or Iran's leadership somehow gets the \nidea that they can attack us or wipe out our friends, the United States \nand our allies will have the capability, the will, and the power to \nconfront Iran's nuclear program and destroy it.\n  We have the best military in the world. We have the best intelligence \nservice in the world. America will always be prepared.\n  The fact is no one here can predict whether Iran will give up its \nprogram, not Republicans nor Democrats. If they don't, we have options. \nBut we can do this and give this plan the opportunity to work, and I am \nprepared to do that.\n  Now, after all this discussion and talk about bipartisanship, a real \nprofile in courage would be for one of you to support your President, \none Republican to stand and support your President.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Thirteen years ago, I stood here in the House of \nRepresentatives and I gave the benefit of the doubt to the then-\nPresident, and he took us to war. I will give today the benefit of the \ndoubt to your President to take us to peace.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Brady), a distinguished member from the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I didn't take an oath of office to \ndefend my President. I took an oath in office to defend my country.\n  The world is a dangerous place, and nothing makes it more dangerous \nthan a nuclear-armed Iran. This isn't a Republican versus Democrat \nissue. This is true security versus false security at a critical moment \nin world history.\n  I have read the agreement, and I have studied it. You have got to ask \nyourself three key questions: Does this stop Iranian's nuclear \ncapability for the long term? No. Does it stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons in the Middle East? No. More importantly, does this make \nAmerica and our allies like Israel safer? The answer is no. And even \nsupporters believe that to be true. No.\n  America deserves, Israel deserves, our world deserves, an agreement \nthat dismantles Iran's nuclear capability, not just delays it for a \nsmall while at best.\n  That is why I oppose this agreement. It makes our country and our \nallies at risk. That is why I support stopping the President, \nsuspending the President, from lifting the sanctions in this agreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 12\\3/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold), a distinguished member of the Ways \nand Means Committee.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I have had an opportunity to listen to the \ndebate. Some of the things that are going on, yes, they are heated.\n  But as we look at this historic agreement--my good friend from New \nYork just asked: Will you stand with your President? I have stood with \nthe President before.\n  I think it is also important that we take a look at this agreement. \nThis is a historic mistake. This is one that will jeopardize the safety \nand security of the United States.\n\n  And I want to echo that this is a bipartisan opposition. So this is \nnot about left versus right. This is about right versus wrong.\n  Ultimately, when I tuck my children in bed at night, a 13-year-old, \nan 11-year-old and an 8-year-old, and I look into the faces of those \nthat are here, these young Americans, and I wonder what type of country \nthey will inherit with a nuclear-armed Iran, for me, that is \nunacceptable.\n  Our stated objectives, our goals, were to make sure that Iran never \nhas the ability to achieve a nuclear weapon. And, yet, this agreement, \naccording to Bob Menendez, all but preserves it, a nuclear-armed Iran, \none that shouts\n\n[[Page H5964]]\n\n``death to America.'' They want to wipe Israel off the face of the map.\n  In this agreement, the ballistic missile embargo is lifted in 8 \nyears, an arms embargo in 5 years.\n  My friends, what do you use a ballistic missile for? I would argue it \nis not to drop leaflets. It is not for humanitarian purposes. It is to \nhave a reign of terror in the United States of America. For me, that is \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  Again, I don't care where you come from, what district you are in, \nthis is about will we be safer. And the answer is simply no.\n  I believe that this agreement ultimately will be an arms race in the \nMiddle East. We have talked about France. We have talked about the U.K. \nWe have talked about Germany.\n  Has anybody asked the neighborhood? Has anybody asked Saudi Arabia or \nthe UAE or Egypt or Israel? The answer is no because they are uniformly \nagainst this because they know Iran's ultimate goal is to not only \ndevastate that region, but to devastate the United States of America.\n  This is one of the things that, again, must unite us. This is not \nabout partisanship.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. DOLD. This is not about partisanship. Please hear me. We don't \nwant to bring up 9/11 in the sense that we want to do it on this day, \n9/11.\n  But I do think that it does smack of the idea that we never want to \nsee that dirty bomb that comes into a container ship, that goes into \nNew York, Miami, or Washington, D.C. Because you know what? No one \nwants to relive what happened on that day 14 years ago.\n  Yet, if we do not step up in a united front and stop this, my fear is \nthat we will relive that day again. That, for me, is unacceptable. I \nimplore you all, my colleagues, my friends, to stand up against this \nawful historic mistake.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Tom Price), the distinguished member of the Budget \nCommittee and member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this week Iran's Supreme \nLeader, Ayatollah Khamenei, the person with whom President Obama and \nhis administration say they have reached an agreement that we should \nsupport, doubled down, once again calling the United States the Great \nSatan.\n  And he further declared, after negotiations, there will be nothing \nleft of Israel in 25 years and, until then, jihadi morale will leave \nnot a moment of serenity.\n  This is the very man that the President of the United States is \nblindly trusting if we endorse this deal.\n  Sadly, this administration has folded on every single red line and \npoint of leverage that the United States had.\n  There are no ``anytime, anyplace'' inspections. There is no \naccountability for past Iranian nuclear activities. Conventional \narmament bans will be lifted. Ballistic missile bans will be lifted.\n  To put it plainly, Mr. Speaker, this deal paves a shiny yellow brick \nroad for Iran to spread Islamic extremism, death, and destruction \naround the world, not to mention an unprecedented nuclear arms race \nacross the entire Middle East.\n  We should have made sure that not a single resource or benefit \nreceived by Iran funds Islamic terrorism. We should have made sure that \nIran publicly accepts Israel's right to exist, that genocide is \nunacceptable, that stated goals of wiping entire groups of people and \nnations off the Earth is unacceptable.\n  At the very least, we should have made certain that four American \nhostages, including a Christian pastor being held in Iran, were \nreleased. Of course, not a single one of these objectives were \nachieved.\n  The administration thought that compelling Iran to renounce nuclear \nholocaust or Islamic terrorism or genocide were simply far too \nunreasonable to request.\n  If this deal goes through, time will surely demonstrate that it will \nbe a shameful stain in the history of the world.\n  Now, we pray that terrible ramifications do not come to fruition. \nHowever, if the past is prologue, this agreement may very well make any \nfurther action or concerns voiced by anyone too little, too late.\n  A nuclear Iran spells nothing but disaster. For safety at home and \nabroad, this agreement must be rejected.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a distinguished member of our committee.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, after listening to this \ndebate, I commend President Obama and Secretary Kerry for their \nleadership and resolve in crafting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction reached between the P5+1 nations and Iran. I do so because this \nis a plan which promotes peace and security, not war or the continuous \nthreat of war.\n  Yes, no agreement is perfect, and no agreement will fully satisfy \neveryone, but I can tell you that, for me and the constituents of the \nSeventh District of Illinois, we say let's give peace a chance. We say \nlet's support the position of our President, but we also say let's \nsupport the position of our experts, let's support the position of our \nallies, let's heed the words of the prophets who say, ``Come and let us \nreason together'' or we shall all be ``utterly destroyed by the edge of \nthe sword.''\n  Yes, we say let's support the most rational, the most logical, the \nmost comprehensive, and the most effective path to peace that we know. \nYes, it is not about supporting the position of any single individual, \nbut it is about supporting what is good for America. It is about \nsupporting what is good to help stabilize our world so that we can \nexist with the idea that peace is, indeed, possible and war is not \ninevitable.\n  Yes, I support the President.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith), another distinguished member of \nthe Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition \nto lifting economic sanctions on Iran. Throughout August, I spoke with \nmany Nebraskans all across my district at public meetings. In addition \nto their frustration over the reach of the Federal Government, the most \ncommon concern they shared with me involved the Iran deal.\n  The ramifications of this agreement will impact not only our \ncountry's future, but also, I believe, the stability of the world. I am \nopposed to this deal and believe Congress must reject it and allow U.S. \nnegotiators to go back to the table.\n  Permanently lifting economic sanctions on Iran, as this deal does, \nwould allow global financial resources to flow into a country still \nincluded on our list of state sponsors of terrorism. Not only does this \ndeal end long-held sanctions, it also lifts arms embargoes, as we have \nheard.\n  The conventional weapons embargo ends in 5 years under this \nagreement, and the ballistic missile ban is lifted in 8 years. We \nshould be mindful of our closest ally in the region, Israel, whose \nleaders continue to gravely warn us of the dangers of trusting the \nIranian regime.\n  The President has said our options are either accepting this deal or \ngoing to war. I think that rhetoric is irresponsible. Economic \nsanctions have served as one of the most effective peaceful methods of \nsuppressing the Iranian regime. When our national security is on the \nline, reaching no deal is certainly better than advancing a bad deal.\n  Congress must stop this bad deal and pursue a stronger agreement \nwhich enforces greater accountability measures on Iran and prioritizes \nthe safety of our country and our allies.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains for both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 6\\3/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Dingell).\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, first, I rise with so many of my \ncolleagues today in remembrance of one of the worst days in our \nNation's history. It is a solemn day of remembrance and prayer for \nthose who lost their lives on that fateful day.\n\n[[Page H5965]]\n\n  As Americans, we must be united as a nation in fighting terrorism, \nwhich we know remains a threat every single day in this country. \nSeptember 11 is a day burned in the hearts and souls of all Americans, \nand we must work hard together--together--to ensure that we never \nwitness such a horrific tragedy in our homeland ever again.\n  We all agree, never again. I say that, like my colleague from New \nYork, Mr. Crowley, as a woman who lost a cousin in a terrorist act and \nwatched a woman I love never recover from her son's death. We all care.\n  Congress and this country, as a whole, have a responsibility to work \nwith nations across the world in pursuit of peace. My district is home \nto one of the largest populations of Arab Americans in the country who, \nlike so many of us, came to the United States as immigrants. They are \namong the most patriotic Americans I know. They are proud to be \nAmericans and have made numerous contributions to this great Nation. \nToday, I ask you to also remember this.\n  I rise in support of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Like so \nmany, it was not an easy decision, and it was made with the utmost \nrespect for my colleagues and friends on both sides of the aisle. This \nprocess has shown me that, no matter what decision one reaches on this \nissue, almost everyone shares the same concerns, and they have been \nnamed and reviewed many times, so I am not going to go over them.\n  What I do want to say is--and we have said many times--it is not \nbased on trust. It is based on verification. That is the last point I \nwant to address today.\n  Congressional oversight of the Iran deal will not end with this vote. \nIn fact, it will just be the beginning. This effort must be bipartisan, \nand I hope it will be divorced from the acrimonious politics that have \ndominated too much of this discussion\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentlewoman.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle: let's work together for peace in the Middle East and across \nthe globe.\n  Senseless politics and inflammatory rhetoric only complicate an \nalready difficult decision. September 11 should be a day that we use to \nremind us of what binds us together, the values we share, the love of \nAmerica that every one of us in this institution has, and let's work \ntogether to protect this Nation we so dearly love.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), another distinguished member of \nthe Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker and Members, military leaders, national \nsecurity experts, diplomats, administration officials, Democratic and \nRepublican Members of Congress all agree that sanctions against Iran \nhave worked.\n  Several years ago, 400 Members of Congress in this body--a huge \nbipartisan majority--voted to increase sanctions on Iran because they \nrecognized that smart, targeted sanctions would curtail the Iranian \neconomy and help unite the world against the Iranian nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n\n  Desperate for sanctions relief, Iran came to the negotiation table. I \nsupport diplomatic efforts and was hopeful that the President would be \nable to bring back a good deal. In fact, 365 Representatives--84 \npercent of the House--sent a letter to the President, saying we could \naccept a deal that accomplished four things: had a long-lasting deal \nthat ensured that Iran had no pathway to a bomb; that it fully \ndisclosed the military aspects of its program; that we had anytime, \nanywhere inspections; and that we would address Iran's ballistic \nmissile capabilities and its destabilizing role in the region.\n  Sadly, none of these principles were met under this deal.\n  The President has claimed that this deal is the strongest \nnonproliferation agreement ever negotiated, but that just isn't true. \nIn our nonproliferation agreement with Libya, we demanded that they \ncompletely eliminate centrifuges, halt all advanced centrifuge research \nand development, that they completely eliminate their enriched uranium \nstockpile, that they give unfettered access to the IAEA, and that they \ncompletely eliminate their long-range missile program, and that we also \nwould ratify the strictest safeguards regime, known as the additional \nprotocol.\n  Under this agreement, Iran doesn't have to do any of this. Will a \nnuclear Iran make the world a safer place? Instead of giving the \nworld's largest state sponsor of terrorism hundreds of billions of \ndollars and more intercontinental ballistic missile technology and \nconventional weapons, we should demand a better deal.\n  The President should be working with Congress in a bipartisan way \nbecause the world deserves a verifiable, enforceable, and accountable \nagreement that enhances safety, stability, and security.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally).\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of those who do not \nhave a voice today in this debate, and that is the over 500 servicemen \nand -women who died in Iraq because of the export of vehicle-borne IED \ntechnology by Iran, by the brutal terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani who \nused money from Iran--and he will be getting more money in order to \nexport with the sole purpose to kill American troops--and the thousands \nwho were wounded.\n  I deployed to this region six times in my military career, and our \nmilitary is concerned about this administration turning their back on \nthe men and women who died and the strength that they need in order to \nkeep that region safe and secure. This is a slap in the face to those \nwho paid that sacrifice.\n  Qasem Soleimani is a brutal man. We have studied him throughout my \nentire military career. He is exporting terror all over the region and \nnot just in the region. He is responsible for deaths in places like \nIndia and Latin America. He is funding money to the Assad regime--over \n250,000 dead--Hezbollah and Hamas.\n  I sat a few weeks ago on the edge of the Gaza Strip, where thousands \nof rockets were launched last summer, killing innocent civilians in \nIsrael. Israelis have 7 to 30 seconds to run to shelter when these \nrockets are coming. They are funded and exported by Qasem Soleimani and \nIran. We stood up on the northern border near where Hezbollah, funded \nby Iran, is stockpiling over 100,000 rockets, ready to launch at the \nIsraeli people.\n  This is a dangerous deal. This is not about a choice between this \ndeal or war. Those of us who served in the military, we want war less \nthan anybody else. We know the price. We want diplomacy. Those \nsanctions were working. We just cranked them up in the last 18 months.\n  They are cash-strapped in Iran. They are fighting in between the \ndesires in their different factions of how they are going to use that \nmoney to continue to move their nuclear program forward or export \nterror. We had them exactly where we wanted, and then we gave up.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds \nto the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, if we give them these funds, with the arms \nembargo and the ICBM embargo, it is going to be a more dangerous \nmilitary action, and more American lives will be lost. It is not this \ndeal in war. This will deal in, potentially, war.\n  On behalf of our American troops, I would ask you to please vote \nagainst this deal. It is dangerous for the many reasons my colleagues \nhave mentioned, but do it on behalf of those who gave the ultimate \nsacrifice.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have had a vigorous debate. This agreement is going \ninto effect. As we have debated here this morning, that is a fact. This \nis the challenge before this body, and that is whether we will try to \nrecapture some real bipartisanship or we essentially will forfeit it.\n  There is work to be done implementing this agreement. That is \nacknowledged by all. The question is whether we will join together to \ntry to\n\n[[Page H5966]]\n\nmake it work, an agreement that I support, but I think the same \nresponsibility is incumbent upon those who oppose it; or, as the \nSpeaker says, they have just begun to fight.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  That, I think, is the wrong approach, in a very important way--both \nas to this agreement but also beyond--because there is work to be done \nin terms of efforts to reinforce security in the Middle East, \nespecially for Israel. There is work to be done in the Middle East and \nbeyond in terms of fighting terrorism. There is work to be done outside \nof the Middle East--everywhere--in terms of terrorism.\n  And so I think it is a deep mistake to leave this moment here, with \nthis agreement going into effect, saying the fight will continue. No. \nThe fight should be with all of us together to make this work and to \naddress the continuing challenges that face this country in the Middle \nEast and beyond.\n  So I close with everybody else who has worked so hard on this and who \nhas come to a conclusion on our own. But I think the tenor here \nsometimes is deeply troubling, and I think the Speaker's statement that \nthe fight has just begun--over what? I hope not over the effort to \ncontinue the flames of partisanship that sometimes have captured this \ndebate and before.\n  We all took the pledge. We have a solemn obligation, I think, to work \ntogether. And I think it would be a deep mistake to have it forfeited \nfor reasons of political advantage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that we believe that the President has \nexceeded his authority in so many ways, that he has stretched the \nseparation of powers on lots of issues; and on most of those issues, I \nbelieve we can fix those problems. On most of those issues, whether it \nis regulations or domestic laws, I believe we in this body, with the \nnext administration, will have with the power and the ability to fix \nthis. This is one where I don't think we can.\n  I think he has stretched the Constitution, because this should be a \ntreaty. This is an executive agreement. When asked why, they said: \nWell, we couldn't pass a treaty.\n  So much for the Constitution that we all swore to uphold.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't think the President is going to get the legacy \nthat he thinks he is going to get or that he is hoping he is going to \nget.\n  I will insert in the Record a letter from 190 former military \nofficers. It says:\n\n       This agreement is unverifiable. As military officers, we \n     find it unconscionable that such a windfall could be given to \n     a regime that even the Obama administration has acknowledged \n     will use a portion of such funds to continue to support \n     terrorism.\n                                                  August 25, 2015.\n      Hon. John A. Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader.\n       Dear Representatives Boehner and Pelosi and Senators \n     McConnell and Reid: As you know, on July 14, 2015, the United \n     States and five other nations announced that a Joint \n     Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) has been reached with \n     Iran to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. In our \n     judgment as former senior military officers, the agreement \n     will not have that effect. Removing sanctions on Iran and \n     releasing billions of dollars to its regime over the next ten \n     years is inimical to the security of Israel and the Middle \n     East. There is no credibility within JCPOA's inspection \n     process or the ability to snap back sanctions once lifted, \n     should Iran violate the agreement. In this and other \n     respects, the JCPOA would threaten the national security and \n     vital interests of the United States and, therefore, should \n     be disapproved by the Congress.\n       The agreement as constructed does not ``cut off every \n     pathway'' for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. To the \n     contrary, it actually provides Iran with a legitimate path to \n     doing that simply by abiding by the deal. JCPOA allows all \n     the infrastructure the Iranians need for a nuclear bomb to be \n     preserved and enhanced. Notably, Iran is allowed to: continue \n     to enrich uranium; develop and test advanced centrifuges; and \n     continue work on its Arak heavy-water plutonium reactor. \n     Collectively, these concessions afford the Iranians, at \n     worst, a ready breakout option and, at best, an incipient \n     nuclear weapons capability a decade from now.\n       The agreement is unverifiable. Under the terms of the JCPOA \n     and a secret side deal (to which the United States is not \n     privy), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be \n     responsible for inspections under such severe limitations as \n     to prevent them from reliably detecting Iranian cheating. For \n     example, if Iran and the inspectors are unable to reach an \n     accommodation with respect to a given site, the result could \n     be at least a 24-day delay in IAEA access. The agreement also \n     requires inspectors to inform Iran in writing as to the basis \n     for its concerns about an undeclared site, thus further \n     delaying access. Most importantly, these inspections do not \n     allow access to Iranian military facilities, the most likely \n     location of their nuclear weapons development efforts. In the \n     JCPOA process, there is substantial risk of U.S. intelligence \n     being compromised, since the IAEA often relies on our \n     sensitive data with respect to suspicious and/or prohibited \n     activity.\n       While failing to assure prevention of Iran's nuclear \n     weapons development capabilities, the agreement provides by \n     some estimates $150 billion dollars or more to Iran in the \n     form of sanctions relief. As military officers, we find it \n     unconscionable that such a windfall could be given to a \n     regime that even the Obama administration has acknowledged \n     will use a portion of such funds to continue to support \n     terrorism in Israel, throughout the Middle East and globally, \n     whether directly or through proxies. These actions will be \n     made all the more deadly since the JCPOA will lift \n     international embargoes on Iran's access to advanced \n     conventional weapons and ballistic missile technology.\n       In summary, this agreement will enable Iran to become far \n     more dangerous, render the Mideast still more unstable and \n     introduce new threats to American interests as well as our \n     allies. In our professional opinion, far from being an \n     alternative to war, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \n     makes it likely that the war the Iranian regime has waged \n     against us since 1979 will continue, with far higher risks to \n     our national security interests. Accordingly, we urge the \n     Congress to reject this defective accord.\n           Sincerely,\n       Admiral David Architzel, US Navy, Retired; Admiral Stanley \n     R.

This is a regime that funds terrorism. It said \nnothing about stopping further terrorism. It lifts the bans on \nconventional weapons so they can arm back up. It lifts the bans on \nintercontinental ballistic missiles. The only reason you have an ICBM \nis to put a nuclear weapon on it. It guarantees that Iran becomes a \nnuclear power, and it gives them $150 billion upfront to finance it.\n  About a decade ago, I was in Kuwait in a tank graveyard. I spent the \nmorning walking through acres of destroyed M1 Abrams tanks, Humvees, \nMRAPs, and they had the same kind of signature blast--a hole ripping \nright through it, killing whoever was inside, our soldiers.\n  Then, we went up to Baghdad and met with one of our senior \ncommanders, a great general named Ray Odierno, and we asked: What is \nkilling all of our servicemembers? What is doing this?\n  EFPs, explosively formed penetrators.\n  He got one of them that they had confiscated and showed us what it \nwas, a highly sophisticated machine explosive device with wiring on it \nthat said ``Made in Iran,'' brought by a gentleman named Soleimani. And \nwe are lifting the sanctions on them.\n  This is not a vote for some person's legacy. This is a vote to put \nyourself on the right side of history. Vote to kill this agreement.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy) to inquire of the majority leader the schedule for the week \nto come.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday and Tuesday, no votes are expected in the \nHouse. On Wednesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 \np.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m.\n  On Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon \nfor legislative business.\n  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. \nLast votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.\n  Members are advised that, given the shortness of the week due to the \nJewish holiday, Members should be prepared for a full legislative day \non Friday.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntoday.\n  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 758, the Lawsuit Abuse \nReduction Act of 2015, sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith. This \nbill will ensure that innocent Americans are protected against \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider two measures that respond \nto the horrific videos released throughout the summer on Planned \nParenthood practices. The first is H.R. 3134, sponsored by \nRepresentative Diane Black, which places a 1-year moratorium on funding \nto Planned Parenthood while Congress investigates these videos.\n  Three committees in the House are currently looking into Planned \nParenthood activities, funding, and adherence to the law.\n  The second will be a bill sponsored by Representative Trent Franks, \nwhich adds criminal penalties to people who violate the Born Alive Act, \nfor medical providers who fail to provide medical care to a baby who \nsurvives the abortion procedure.\n  Americans are rightfully outraged by what was depicted in these \nvideos, and Congress and the American people have a right to know \nexactly what is happening.\n  These two critical bills will ensure that we get all the facts and \nprotect those who cannot protect themselves.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for the information.\n  I would just observe that we share the view of the--you used the term \n``horrific'' videos. As I understand it, these videos are heavily \nedited. I don't want to get into debate about them; we will have that \ndebate next week, but we are certainly concerned about, as the \ngentleman knows, 97 percent of the health care delivered by Planned \nParenthood has nothing to do with the issues raised in the video, \nedited or not.\n  We would hope that we could come to an agreement on making sure that \nthose healthcare services that are provided to literally thousands and \nthousands of women are not interrupted, but I understand that we will \nhave that debate next week.\n  Mr. Leader, you do not include in your schedule a continuing \nresolution for the funding of government. As the gentleman knows, we \nhave essentially, as I count it, 5 full legislative days left. We have \n8 or 9 days left, but there are many partial days.\n  We have 5 full legislative days left before the government runs out \nof authority and funds to continue. As the gentleman knows, I have been \nurging the majority leader and your side of the aisle to enter into \ndiscussions on levels of funding and funding itself.\n  We suspended the appropriations process approximately in the middle \nof July when the Interior bill was pulled from the floor. Presumably, \nit was pulled because there was a possibility of amendments being \noffered regarding the Confederate battle flag, but notwithstanding \nthat, half the appropriation bills have not been brought to the floor. \nNo appropriation bills have passed the Senate.\n  I have been urging, for at least 2 months now, that we have \ndiscussions. I discussed with Mr. Van Hollen today there have been no \ndiscussions between Mr. Van Hollen and Mr. Price with reference to a \nresolution of the funding levels for a CR or the length of term of the \nCR.\n  I had an opportunity to talk to Ranking Member Nita Lowey today of \nthe Appropriations Committee. She informs me that there have been no \nsubstantive discussions between herself and Mr. Rogers and that Mr. \nRogers, in fact, has no indication of what funding levels will be going \nforward or what a CR would look like or the length of period of time it \nwould be for.\n  In addition to that, I have discussed with the leader's office, \nLeader Pelosi's office--and I know that neither my office nor Leader \nPelosi's office have been in discussion either with\n\n[[Page H5970]]\n\nthe Speaker's office or your office in a substantive way with how we \nmight be moving forward on a CR.\n  I, frankly, thought that this coming week would be the week for us to \nconsider a continuing resolution so that given the very, very short \nnumber of days available in September for us to meet, that there would \nbe time for the Senate to receive a continuing resolution for us to \nconsider that and pass it so that we would not, again, confront a \ncrisis of confidence, a crisis in terms of ongoing government \noperations, but also a crisis of confidence not only in our country, \nbut around the world that the United States of America could manage its \nfinances in a responsible way.\n  With that said, Mr. Majority Leader, can you share with us some \ninsight? Again, I know that it is not on the schedule, and this is \nabout scheduling, but we have 5 full days and 3 partial days and a \nninth day which the Pope is going to be here, and I know we will be \nhaving votes on that day, but we have such a minimal time before the \ngovernment runs out of authority and funding for its operations that it \nseems to me that it is critical that today or tomorrow or Monday, we \ndecide how we are going to proceed.\n\n  I will be pleased to yield to my friend, the majority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As the gentleman knows, the fiscal year does end on September 30. As \nthe gentleman knows, we have had this discussion often because our \nintention was always to solve this problem very early. As history \nshows, this is the earliest we have ever started the appropriation \nprocess for Congress.\n  I had grave concern during the summer, reading many of the headlines \nfrom some on your side of the aisle and over on your side of the aisle \nin the Senate, that it was a strategy to make sure the appropriation \nprocess would not work.\n  When votes came to the floor, very strongly, you were able to hold \nmany of your Members. Counterpart with the number two on the Senate \nside, Senator Schumer, his whole strategy for the summer, he was much \nmore effective where none of them came up.\n  We know the number of days we have left. We are continuing \nconversations on government funding, and we will inform Members when \naction is scheduled in the House.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Leader, there are 5 days--full days--left to go. You \nare right; we have been discussing this for some period of time, but \nwith all due respect to any strategy that we have, you only brought six \nbills to the floor and passed six bills through this House, and that is \nonly half of the appropriation bills.\n  The MilCon bill got 255 votes; the Energy and Water, 240; the \nLegislative Branch, 357; the Commerce, Justice, Science, 242; T-HUD, \nwhich we didn't like and, apparently, a lot of your Members didn't like \neither, 216 votes; and the Defense bill, 278 votes.\n  There was nothing on our side that stopped the appropriations process \nfrom going forward. You chose not to bring six of those bills to the \nfloor. I don't take any blame on our side of the aisle, whatever our \nstrategy might be.\n  Our strategy has been consistent with, very frankly, the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee strategy, and that is to have funding \nlevels on both the defense and nondefense side of the ledger which were \nrational and reasonable.\n  I repeat ad nauseam, as you know--and you are tired of hearing me \nrepeat it, I am sure--Mr. Rogers' comments that the sequester levels \ngiven to the Appropriations Committee to meet their responsibilities \nwere ill-conceived and unrealistic. That is Mr. Rogers' quote, not \nmine, not our strategy.\n  That was what the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on your \nside of the aisle characterizes the funding levels that you have \nprovided the committee for--I don't mean you individually--the House \nhas provided the chairman with to write his bills up.\n  As a result of being unable to do that, every time you brought a bill \nto the floor, it has gotten a majority of the votes. Forget about us. \nWe can't control. We have 188 Members. You can pass anything you want.\n  The appropriations bill process came to a dead halt for two reasons. \nNumber one, it is because there are no negotiations for a well-\nconceived and realistic alternative to sequester. That is what Hal \nRogers says--not me--your chairman.\n  I continue to be extraordinarily disappointed that we have not \nundertaken any discussions--I mentioned Mrs. Lowey on the \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Van Hollen on the Budget Committee, \nLeader Pelosi's office, my office--any discussions which have allowed \nus to come to some agreement so that we might in a bipartisan way move \nforward.\n  Now, I understand there are a lot of members on your side of the \naisle who won't vote for anything if it funds Planned Parenthood. I get \nthat. They don't come close to making the majority of this House.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Until such time as we start acting with the majority's will \nprevailing as opposed to a faction's prevailing, I think we are going \nto be in this gridlock that is undermining the confidence of our \ncountry, of our government, and of our international partners.\n  I would hope that, in the next, perhaps, few days, Mr. Leader--and I \nam prepared to spend time today, this weekend, Monday, and Tuesday--I \nknow we are not coming back until Wednesday--to try to work with you \nand with the relevant committees, with the Speaker, and with the leader \nof my party to try to get us to a point where we can do exactly what \nyou want to do and what we want to do, and that is not have this \ngovernment by crisis that we have now. This is the third time on an \nunrelated issue where there has been a problem with funding government \nas is our responsibility at whatever levels we agree upon. I would hope \nthat we could pursue those discussions. I have been urging that for \nmonths now, and we haven't done that.\n  You also did not mention something that I have discussed with you and \ndiscussed with the Speaker that I bring up all the time. As a result of \nour failure to fund the Export-Import Bank and to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank, we are losing jobs, and we have lost a substantial \nnumber of jobs already. Speaker Boehner indicated in a quote not too \nlong ago that, in fact, there are thousands of jobs on the line that \nwould disappear pretty quickly if the Ex-Im Bank were to disappear.\n  Essentially, in terms of new loans and new products that could be \nsold abroad, the Ex-Im Bank has disappeared as of July. I have had \ndiscussions with the Speaker, and I think he has been quoted publicly \nas saying he thought the Ex-Im Bank was, in fact, in some form, going \nto be considered on the floor this month.\n  I ask my friend, the majority leader, as it is not on the schedule, \nbut, again, it is not as if we have months to go--we have 5 days to \ngo--before the end of the fiscal year and that funding for the Ex-Im \nBank expires. Can the gentleman tell me whether there is any \npossibility of that being considered within the next 5 or 8--if you \nwant to count 8--legislative days we have left in this month?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  I would not feel these colloquies were complete if I did not get this \nquestion. I admire the gentleman's consistency in asking it, but my \nanswer remains just as consistent. There is no action scheduled in the \nHouse on Ex-Im.\n  Mr. HOYER. With that answer, the gentleman can be assured that I will \nkeep asking the question, and I keep asking the question not to vex the \nmajority leader. I keep asking the question because the Speaker and I \nagree that we are losing jobs. We are putting ourselves in a \nnoncompetitive position with the rest of the world.\n  By not bringing this up to the floor, Mr. Leader--I haven't counted \nspecifically, but I will bet you, however, that there are over 275 \nvotes on this floor to pass a reauthorization and extension of the \nExport-Import Bank. The failure to bring it to the floor is not because \nit doesn't enjoy a majority of support--it does. When it last came to \nthe floor--when Mr. Cantor and I worked on the legislation and brought \nit to this floor--it got well over 300 votes. Now, I understand there \nare some in your party who don't like it; but, very frankly, we have \ngot to get over, because some in your party don't like\n\n[[Page H5971]]\n\nthings, that we gridlock the Congress of the United States and make \nAmerica uncompetitive and undermine confidence in this country.\n  Yes, Mr. Leader, you are very tolerant, and I will keep asking the \nquestion because I think it is critical for our economy, and it is \ncritical to get us off this gridlock where a small minority of the \nCongress of the United States is holding good policy hostage.\n  Now, let me also ask you: On October 29, the highway bill will lose \nits authorization, which we have been extending in very short periods \nof time. The gentleman knows no Governor, no mayor, no county \ncommissioner, no contractor can possibly plan infrastructure \nimprovements--highways, bridges, sewer systems, whatever--on the basis \nof 90-day or 60-day extensions of authority and funding.\n  The gentleman didn't mention it. It is not coming up next week. I \nunderstand that we have a longer time--but not a long time--between now \nand October 29 when the highway bill will expire. As the gentleman, I \nam sure, knows and agrees, the failure to do that will have a \nsignificant adverse effect on jobs for Americans and a significant \nadverse effect on the infrastructure of this country.\n  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not he expects a highway bill to \ncome to the floor anytime within the timeframe prior to October 29?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As the gentleman did mention, the highway program is currently \nauthorized through the end of October. The relevant committees are at \nwork--I met with them today--developing the best path forward, and I \nwill keep you apprised, as well as the Members, and I expect it to be \ndone before the deadline.\n  Mr. HOYER. That is good news that the highway bill, at least, will be \ndone before the deadline.\n  I will tell my friend, like the majority leader, I had a discussion \ntoday with Mr. DeFazio, who is the ranking Democrat on the relevant \ncommittee, Mr. Shuster being the chairman. I know they have had some \ndiscussions, but I also know that they are not very close to an \nagreement. I know that neither one of them likes the Senate bill that \nwas sent to us. The majority leader and I had discussions on that. We \ndidn't take that up. I thought that was probably the right thing for \nthe majority leader to do, to not take it up.\n  Again, the majority leader says he is engaged. I would hope he uses \nhis good office to get us to a place where we can pass a bill in a \nbipartisan fashion as, during my 34 years, has normally been the case. \nThat extends for a significant period of time--no less than 5 years--at \nlevels that are necessary to meet the infrastructure needs of this \ncountry, both from an economic standpoint and a national security \nstandpoint.\n  I yield to my friend if he wants to say anything further. If not, Mr. \nSpeaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5971-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2015, TO TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, \n       2015; AND HOUR OF MEETING ON WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nrecognition of National Suicide Prevention Week.\n  Unfortunately, in the past several years, we have witnessed an \nincrease in suicides among our Active-Duty members of the Armed Forces \nand our veterans populations.\n  Prior to my tenure in Congress, I served nearly three decades \naddressing the mental health needs of individuals who have suffered \nlife-changing disease and disability. This is an issue I remain \npassionate about, particularly when addressing the mental health of \nthose who place their lives on the line in serving this great Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I remain confident this body can do right by our \nservicemembers and veterans. A part of that is advancing the Medical \nEvaluation Parity for Servicemembers Act, which is intended to improve \nsuicide prevention by instituting a mental health assessment for all \nnew military recruits, which will then be used as a baseline throughout \ntheir military careers. This was included in the 2016 National Defense \nAuthorization.\n  Our dedication to this cause is the least we can do for those who \nhave sacrificed so much for their Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5971-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMEMORATING THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN LOST ON 9/11\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the brave men \nand women lost on September 11.\n  Last week, I visited a windswept meadow in Somerset County, \nPennsylvania, just outside my district, which, until 14 years ago, had \nlittle meaning for this country.\n  At 10 a.m. that day, the quiet of that field was shattered as 40 \nAmericans successfully thwarted an attack on the Nation's capital. \nThey, like 2,700 other individuals that day, lost their lives as a \nresult of acts of raw evil. Quiet has returned to that field, but, \ntoday, there exists at the site a memorial and a new visitor center \nthat opened yesterday.\n  I visited the site last week, and it amazed me how fresh the memories \nof that horrible day remain. The remembrances are unforgettable, from \nthe timeline embedded within the walk that follows Flight 93's path--\n8:46 a.m., 9:03 a.m., 9:37 a.m.--to the words of the passengers from \nphone calls that were made that day.\n  Let's draw inspiration from the brave sacrifices made by so many \nAmericans that day; and let's, today, renew the commitment we all felt \nin the days after September 11 to reinvigorate, heal, and strengthen \nour Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5971-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               IRAN DEAL\n\n  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, on this day, the 14th anniversary of the \nterrible attack of 9/11/2001, I rise to strongly oppose the deeply \nflawed, dangerous, and unacceptable deal that President Obama has \nstruck with the Islamic Republic of Iran and its leader, Ayatollah \nKhamenei. To even stand here in the people's House of the greatest \nnation on Earth and discuss this course of action taken by the \nPresident is both shameful and embarrassing for our country.\n  The Islamic Republic of Iran is the world's leading sponsor of \nterrorism. They have the blood of thousands of American soldiers on \ntheir hands. They lead chants of ``death to America,'' whom they call \nthe Great Satan, and burn our flag in their streets. They declared just \nlast week, with certainty, that Israel, whom they call the Little \nSatan, will be wiped off the map in no less than 25 years.

Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nFranks) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, coincidental to the message or \nthe speech that I am about to give, I am reminded, as so many of you \nare, that this is September the 11th and 14 years ago terrorists, in an \nevil, devastating act against our country designed to destroy us as a \npeople, attacked the very fabric of the Nation and killed almost 3,000 \ninnocent Americans.\n  I pray for their families, and I pray for those who loved those \npeople and still feel the loss within their souls today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also believe that one of the best ways we can honor \nthe people who lost their lives that infamous day is to remember that \nthe price of freedom has always been eternal vigilance.\n  We still face a world where jihad has designs on destroying this, the \ngreatest and freest republic in the history of the world.\n  And in the name of those we have lost, in the name of those \ngenerations still to come, God help us to be vigilant people, as \nAmericans.\n  Mr. Speaker, the blood, sacrifice, and noble principles of millions \nof gallant souls across America's history have made this Nation the \nunipolar superpower of the entire world. Our international policies now \nsignificantly impact the peace and security of the entire human family.\n  The very first responsibility of this Nation's government and \nespecially its Commander in Chief is to protect America's national \nsecurity. The only two ways we have to do that is to prevent any enemy \nor potential enemy from having the intent and capacity to do us harm. \nWe must make sure that, if there is an enemy with the intent to do us \nharm, that they do not have the capacity to proceed.\n  The intent of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been crystal clear \nsince they took and held 52 American hostages 444 days at the beginning \nof their radical revolution those 36 years now ago. They have ever \nsince been waging war on America and their own neighbors.\n  But the only way the Iranian leaders can ever truly achieve their \nultimate goal is to become a nuclear-armed nation.\n  Consequently, they have proceeded inexorably in that direction both \nsecretly and openly and obviously for decades until America and the \nWestern world came together with resolutions, sanctions, and warnings \nof military intervention to halt and dismantle this unspeakably \ndangerous threat. This pressure finally brought Iran to the negotiating \ntable.\n  But now, instead of increasing and using that pressure, President \nBarack Obama has completely ignored the original commitment that the \nsanctions would only be dismantled when Iran's nuclear weapons program \nwas dismantled.\n  The President blindly accepted whatever deal Iran put on the table \nand completely forgot who was at the other end of that table.\n  Mr. Obama then proceeded to capitulate on every redline and minimum \nrequirement that both he and the United Nations had previously \nrequired.\n  The President has now squandered away every form of leverage we had \nagainst this theocratic radical regime, which has broken every promise \nit has ever made to us.\n  And what did we get in return, Mr. Speaker? We got an insane rope-a-\ndope, duplicitous, unverifiable, astonishingly unenforceable deal. We \ngot a deal that legitimizes and empowers the most prolific state \nsponsor of terrorism in the world.\n  It obligates America to lift all sanctions, lift bans on Iran's \nimports of weapons and ballistic missile programs. It allows Iran a \nprotected protocol to enrich uranium and research even more advanced \ncentrifuges.\n  It gives them tens of billions of dollars with which they can \ncontinue to spread their terror and destabilizing expansionism \nthroughout the word.\n  It allows them to continue their human rights abuses, including \nillegally holding American citizens hostage. And it allows them to keep \ntheir entire nuclear infrastructure.\n  All the while, the Supreme Leader and ultimate authority in Iran is \npublicly reaffirming his hatred toward the United States and publicly \nleading throngs of his supporters in shouting ``Death to America'' and \n``Death to Israel.'' Unbelievable.\n  Mr. Speaker, Bill Clinton made a far better deal than that, and the \nresult was that the police state of North Korea proceeded to develop \nnuclear weapons only a few years later.\n  Some of our most loyal allies live under that nuclear threat to this \nday. Now this deal will place America and our vital ally, Israel, under \nthat same nuclear threat tomorrow.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the Iranian mullahs were intently listening when Barack \nObama proclaimed before the United Nations that no nation has the right \nto pick and choose what nations have nuclear weapons. But I remind him \nthat Iran is a nation that has threatened to destroy America and \ndestroy Israel.\n  These same mullahs were watching as Barack Obama knowingly stood by \nand idly watched as thousands of innocent civilians in Iraq were either \nbutchered, tortured, raped, beheaded, crucified, or burned alive by \nISIS. They then knew they had nothing to fear from Barack Obama.\n  So the jihadist leaders of Iran came to the nuclear negotiating table \nwith nothing and walked away with everything.\n  These are the same Iranian mullahs that openly bragged how their \nbounties and weapons have killed hundreds of American Marines and \nsoldiers on the battlefield, shattering their families in an \nunbelievable way.\n  What will these leaders do if they have nuclear weapons? \nInexplicably, instead of making sure they never get a nuclear weapon, \nBarack Obama's politically motivated peace-in-our-time capitulation \nempowers the most dangerous sponsor of terrorism on this Earth and \nplaces them on the path to obtain an entire nuclear arsenal.\n\n[[Page H5973]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, unless this Congress or the next President is able to \nstop this madness, Barack Obama will be on trajectory to be remembered \nas the father of the Iranian atomic bomb and the one who ultimately \nnuclearized the entire Middle East, and our children will start down a \npath that leads through the shadow of nuclear terrorism.\n  And whatever the costs there might have been to prevent Iran from \ngaining nuclear weapons will pale in comparison to the costs of dealing \nwith a nuclear-armed Iran. We must not let that happen, Mr. Speaker.\n  Astonishingly, Democrat Senators are now arrogantly filibustering any \nattempt for the Senate to reject this inexpressibly dangerous deal.\n  It is time for the majority leader of the Senate to use the nuclear \noption in the Senate rules to bring this inexpressibly dangerous \nnuclear deal with Iran to the Senate floor and vote on and reject it as \nthe treaty that it actually embodies under the Constitution of the \nUnited States. If Republicans do not use the nuclear option in our \nrules, Iran may some day use their nuclear option against our Nation.\n  It is September 11, Mr. Speaker. God help us to remember. For the \nsake of our children and future generations, God help this Congress to \nreject this treacherous deal and God help us all to focus on the \nunspeakable importance of the coming elections in America.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/11/house-section/article/H5973-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed bills of the following titles in which the \nconcurrence of the House is requested:\n\n       S. 1461.
