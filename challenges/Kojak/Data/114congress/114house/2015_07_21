BUSH SPEAKER'S FEE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, July 9, I saw a report on ABC \nNews that former President George W. Bush charged $100,000 to speak at \na charity fundraiser for military veterans wounded in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I was disappointed to learn that a President who sent \nthousands of Americans to die in an unnecessary war justified by \nmanipulated intelligence would charge a fee to speak at a fundraiser \nfor wounded veterans.\n  ABC also reported that, in addition to charging $100,000 to speak at \nthe charity: ``The former President was also provided with a private \njet to travel to Houston at a cost of $20,000.''\n  Further, ABC News reported: ``One of the wounded vets who served on \nthe charity board told ABC News he was outraged that his former \ncommander in chief would charge any fee to speak on behalf of men and \nwomen he ordered into harm's way.\n  `` `For him to be paid to raise money for veterans that were wounded \nin combat under his orders, I don't think that's right,' said former \nMarine Eddie Wright.''\n  Eddie Wright, Mr. Speaker, lost both hands in a rocket attack in \nFallujah in Iraq in the year 2004.\n  This is so disappointing and outrageous. These veterans have been \nseverely wounded, and the President that led us into an unjustified war \ncharges $100,000 to be in their presence. That is wrong, Mr. Speaker. \nThat is really, really wrong.\n  Many of these wounded veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan live in the \nThird District in North Carolina, which I have the privilege to \nrepresent. For years, I have felt deep regret over my vote to go into \nIraq; and to atone for that, I have publicly and privately apologized \nand signed over 11,000 letters to families who lost loved ones in \nAfghanistan and Iraq because of my mistake. President Bush and Vice \nPresident Cheney have never publicly apologized to the families for the \nunnecessary war they began.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think my friend Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who was \nchief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, was right \nabout the Iraq war. On MSNBC a couple of months ago, Colonel Wilkerson \nstated: ``The intelligence was fixed, and everyone should know that by \nnow. It was a failure of the intelligence agencies, but it was also a \nfailure of the political people who manipulated the intelligence \nfailure to their own benefit.''\n  He further stated: ``It destroyed the balance of power in the Gulf \nand produced what we have today, the chaos we have today: al Qaeda in \nIraq--never there until we invaded; ISIS--never there until we invaded; \nthe mess we have in Yemen. Everything that's happening in the Middle \nEast today can be attributed to our having destroyed the balance of \npower that we had carefully maintained for a half a century with the \ninvasion in 2003. It was a disaster.''\n  I have a lot of respect for Colonel Wilkerson because he is telling \nthe truth when he made this statement to MSNBC.\n  Let me repeat the words of Marine Eddie Wright, who lost both hands \nin Iraq: ``For him,'' President Bush, ``to be paid to raise money for \nveterans that were wounded . . . under his orders, I don't think that's \nright.''\n  Mr. Speaker, it is not right; and I will add my own thoughts and use \nthe word ``shameful,'' that the former President and his \nadministration, who created an unnecessary war and sent our troops over \nthere to die and also to be wounded, should not charge one dime to go \nhelp them out now.\n  So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will ask God to bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5299-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5299-H5300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE CHATTANOOGA 5\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a gunman with a heart fatally bent on \nmischief and with malice aforethought unleashed hell in Chattanooga \nlast Thursday. The killer shot up an Armed Forces recruiting center and \nthen drove to a Navy Reserve center and continued his shooting spree. \nFive warriors were caught in the gunman's furious rampage and were \nkilled. The killer, who once followed an al Qaeda cleric online, \nwounded three others.\n\n[[Page H5300]]\n\n  To kill the very people who devote their lives to keeping our country \nsafe is ironically and tragically sad. They were fathers, boyfriends, \nsons, brothers, and friends whose lives were robbed.\n  The fallen were:\n  Gunnery Sergeant Thomas J. Sullivan, United States Marine Corps. He \nwas from Massachusetts. Tommy, as his buddies and family called him, \nwas deployed twice during the Iraq war and received two Purple Hearts. \nHe had been enlisted for almost 18 years. The Sullivan family owns a \nlocal bar and restaurant in Springfield, Massachusetts, and pictures of \nred, white, and blue ribbons memorialize the veteran on the \nrestaurants's Facebook page. He was an avid Boston sports fan who loved \nBoston-based bands and musicians. A friend said: ``He was a short guy, \nbut his personality was a lot bigger than his height. You couldn't just \nnot like Tom.'' He was 41.\n  Lance Corporal Squire ``Skip'' Wells, United States Marine Corps. He \nwas from Cobb County, Georgia, and the service was in his blood. He was \na student attending Georgia Southern University when he decided to \nfollow in the footsteps of his family and enlist. God and country \nflowed deep in his veins. On Thursday, Skip had been texting with his \ngirlfriend of 2\\1/2\\ years about her upcoming visit to Chattanooga. The \nlast text he sent her was two words in capitalized letters that read, \n``active shooter.'' She tried desperately to reach him, but she did not \nlearn about the murders until the next day. He was in his early \ntwenties.\n  Sergeant Carson A. Holmquist, United States Marine Corps. A patriotic \noutdoorsman from a small town in Grantsburg, Wisconsin, he joined the \nMarines right out of high school and was taken to the battlefields in a \nforeign land. He was deployed to Afghanistan twice as part of Operation \nEnduring Freedom. It was reported that he was so proud of being a \nmarine that, when he finished boot camp, he went right back to the \nsmall town of Grantsburg to visit his high school, dressed in his \nMarine uniform. He and his wife had a young son and were expecting \nanother. He was 25.\n  Staff Sergeant David A. Wyatt, United States Marine Corps. He was a \nnative of Russellville, Arkansas. He was a husband and a father. He \nserved one tour of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was \ndescribed as a leader, a mentor, quick to help, and was easy to \napproach. Wyatt was a father who was overjoyed about the upcoming birth \nof his second child. He also planned to serve at least 20 years in the \nmilitary. He was 35.\n  Petty Officer Second Class Randall Smith, United States Navy. He was \na former high school baseball star from Paulding, Ohio, joined the Navy \nin 2010. He was a pitcher for the Paulding High School Panthers, and he \naccepted a scholarship to play baseball at Defiance College in Ohio. \nAfter a shoulder injury, Smith decided to forego sports and serve his \nNation. He was a father and a husband. He had three little girls. \nAccording to his Facebook page, he was a passionate sports fan. He was \npassionate about the United States Women's Soccer team and their World \nCup win. He had even a love for the Houston Astros. He was 26.\n  Good men, good warriors, good Americans--all died before their time. \nThis was a senseless and callous act of hate.\n  Even though these military facilities in Chattanooga are riddled with \nbullet holes, they are still a steadfast symbol of the patriotism of \nour military.\n  There are not enough tears or words to convey the sorrow that has \nengulfed this Nation. These volunteers that serve our country are the \nbest that this Nation has, and we continue to mourn their loss and pray \nfor their families and friends.\n  Ronald Reagan said it best: ``We will always remember. We will always \nbe proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.''\n  The Chattanooga 5.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5300-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5300-H5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CARING FOR OUR VETERANS HERE AT HOME\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize \nJohn Enstrom of Elk River and the Disabled Veterans of America \norganization for all the incredible work they have done and continue to \ndo for our Nation's veterans.\n  On August 5, John is hosting a charity fishing event in Ramsey, \nMinnesota. He is hosting the event for disabled American veterans. \nAlong with friends and volunteers, John plans to bring 150 wounded \nveterans to a private lake for a great day of fishing, games, and \nsimply enjoying the great Minnesota outdoors.\n  Our veterans have stood for our country's freedom and individual \nliberty, all the while putting their lives on the line. Disabled \nveterans have sacrificed in order to protect and serve our great \nNation.\n  It is an extraordinary kind of person who cares for others so deeply. \nI would like to thank John and the Disabled Veterans of America not \nonly for all the work they have done for this event, but for also \nrecognizing that veterans need and deserve to be cared for once they \nreturn home.\n\n\n               Small Community Banks Harmed by Dodd-Frank\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the fifth \nanniversary of Dodd-Frank to share a story from a small community bank \nthat has three locations in my district. This bank is struggling due to \nthe additional regulation that Dodd-Frank has imposed on them.\n  They were forced to hire a full-time compliance director in addition \nto retaining two outside compliance firms. This has cost the bank \nnearly $100,000 more a year. In addition, numerous other staff members \nnow have to take time away from revenue-generating activities to \nsatisfy the compliance regulations of Dodd-Frank.\n  They told me: ``Compliance has always been a cost that is just a part \nof our business. However, since Dodd-Frank, this cost has expanded \ngreatly. Unfortunately, since there is no offsetting revenue for the \nexpanding cost, we are forced to consider passing on costs to our \ncustomers with additional fees.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say this is an isolated occurrence, but a \nrecent study shows that Dodd-Frank has added 61 million hours of \npaperwork and more than $24 billion in final rule costs for the \nfinancial industry in this country. Nationwide, we have lost \napproximately 1500 community banks already.\n  The 5 years since Dodd-Frank was signed into law have been marked \nwith 5 years of failure.\n\n\n          Undefeated Season Ends with State Championship Title\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and \ncongratulate the Anoka-Hennepin Mustangs for being named the 2015 \nMinnesota State champions in physically impaired adapted softball.\n  Comprised of students from Andover, Anoka, Blaine, Champlin Park, and \nCoon Rapids, these players were a force to be reckoned with at this \nyear's State championship tournament. Having earned the number one \nseed, the Mustangs went into the tournament boasting 11 wins, with more \nthan 167 runs scored during this season.\n  With the momentum of an undefeated season, the Mustangs cruised to \nvictory at the recent State championship. After scoring nearly a dozen \nruns and completing a few notable double plays, the Mustangs won the \nchampionship game with an 11-8 victory over the Rochester Raiders. Even \nmore impressive, the Mustang championship win ended a 6-year winning \nstreak for the previous defending champions.\n  I ask that this body join me in congratulating these tremendous \nathletes.\n  Well done.\n\n\n                      Siding with American Farmers\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support \nof the House Agriculture and the Energy and Commerce Committees' \nactions on the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015, of which I \nam a cosponsor.\n  Biotechnology is nothing new. Norman Borlaug, a researcher and legend \nin my home State, was the ``father of the Green Revolution'' while at \nthe University of Minnesota due to his groundbreaking work on high-\nyield crops that have fed billions of people around the globe.\n\n[[Page H5301]]\n\n  American farmers already deal with heavy compliance regulations to \nensure that our food is safe to eat. Families must know that Borlaug's \nincredible accomplishment and the hard work of the American farmer is \nnot in vain.\n  It is no surprise that I am not a fan of the Federal bureaucracy, but \non this issue we must stand with American farmers on the health and \nsafety of our food. We should move in the right direction, and the \nHouse should pass this bipartisan legislation that will create a \nvoluntary label that supports farmers and American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5301-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n            41ST ANNIVERSARY OF TURKEY'S INVASION OF CYPRUS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Bilirakis) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark an anniversary that \nhas pained the Cypriot and Hellenic communities for 41 years.\n  On July 20, 1974, 41 years ago yesterday, in blatant violation of \ninternational law, Turkey invaded Cyprus and captured much of the \nnorthern part of the island.\n  Since the invasion, Turkey has occupied nearly 40 percent of Cyprus. \nThey inhabit homes previously owned by Greek Cypriots, forcibly \nrelocating 160,000 Greek Cypriots and infusing the island with hundreds \nof thousands of Turkish settlers. Another 1,500 Cypriots remain missing \nsince the 1974 invasion, including four Americans whose remains have \nnot been located.\n  Religious artifacts and cultural relics have been destroyed in the \nwake of the Turkish Army's invasion and, after 41 years of \ndisplacement, are now lost to time. Hundreds of churches and \nmonasteries have been shamefully desecrated, losing all sense of their \nhistoric and religious significance.\n  Cyprus has been a steadfast ally, and Cypriots deserve an end to this \nsenseless division.\n  With negotiations underway again for reunification, let's hope this \ntime next year we will be celebrating the end of this illegal \noccupation. As it builds, Turkey cannot be allowed to stonewall this \ndemocratic process any longer.\n  Today the United States stands in a unique role as a friend of both \nCyprus and Turkey. As an honest broker to both sides, we can help them \nto see that a unified future for Cyprus is far more promising than the \npresent.\n  The United States' relationship with all its allies--Turkey \nincluded--must be based on shared values and mutual respect. At the \ncore, the rule of law must be respected above all else.\n  Forty-one years of illegal occupation is 41 years too long. Cyprus \nhas long been a strong and faithful ally of the United States, and we \nowe our support for both peace and the end of this illegal occupation.\n  I encourage the Cypriot leaders to keep up the hard work of unifying \na people divided for over a generation. Many hard issues remain, but, \nhopefully, this will be the last year we acknowledge this illegal \noccupation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5301-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5301-H5302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ELDRIDGE WILLIAMS, TUSKEGEE AIRMAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Emmer of Minnesota). The Chair \nrecognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of one of \nmy constituents, Lieutenant Colonel Eldridge Williams, a Tuskegee \nAirman who passed away this month at the age of 97.\n  Born in Texas in 1917, Lieutenant Colonel Williams graduated from \nXavier University in 1942 and immediately applied for the Army flight \nprogram. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in Miami Beach in \n1942.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Williams trained Tuskegee Airmen who flew overseas \nto escort bomber planes across Europe. Though he didn't make it \noverseas, he flew at the Tuskegee Institute and trained other pilots \nuntil the end of World War II. He continued to serve during the 1948 \nBerlin Airlift and the Korean war.\n  In 1949, Mr. Williams moved to Richmond Heights, a community in South \nMiami-Dade established for Black servicemen returning from the war. Mr. \nWilliams taught physical education at Richmond Heights Middle School \nand was soon after promoted to administrator, serving as director of \ndesegregation for Miami-Dade County Public Schools. He retired from the \nschool system in 1985, but remained committed to overseeing programs \naimed at assisting kids that had dropped out of school.\n  President George W. Bush presented Mr. Williams and the other living \nTuskegee Airmen with a Congressional Gold Medal in 2007. This was an \nhonor long overdue to these trailblazing heroes.\n  On behalf of a grateful Nation, I send my deepest condolences to Mr. \nWilliams' loved ones and the many lives touched by his positive \ninfluence. May they take solemn pride in a life well lived.\n\n\n                FIU Veterans and Small Farmers Outreach\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nFlorida International University and their outreach to those in our \nagriculture community.\n  I recently learned of a new program created by FIU to give veterans, \nalong with minority and women farmers, the opportunity to expand their \nknowledge of the agriculture business.\n  The Veterans and Small Farmers Outreach program will provide direct \nbenefits to not only our brave men and women returning from harm's way, \nbut also to the countless small farms in Homestead, an agriculture-\nfocused community in south Florida.\n  The students currently enrolled in the Veterans and Small Farmers \nOutreach program at FIU have the opportunity to learn more about \ntending crops and raising livestock through apprenticeships throughout \nMiami-Dade and Broward Counties.\n  I am confident these students will soon enter our workforce and be \nproductive members of the agriculture community. We will all truly \nbenefit from the fruits of their labor.\n  I thank FIU for their continued innovation in bettering the south \nFlorida community and wish only the best of luck to the hard-working \nstudents of this newly created program.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my \nserious concerns over the Iran deal that was recently announced.\n  So far, it appears that this agreement is bad for the United States \nand bad for our allies in the region. As I have said before, a weak \ndeal that gives Iran any possibility of achieving a nuclear weapon is \nunacceptable.\n  Key components of the nuclear program are still in place. Iran will \nstill be allowed to have centrifuges and continue research and \ndevelopment on them. The Natanz and Fordow facilities will remain in \nplace to purportedly continue their nuclear activities for peaceful \npurposes.\n  In addition to these troubling facts, the Iranian regime is going to \nreceive an exorbitant amount of money that they will undoubtedly use, \nat least in part, to fund Hamas and Hezbollah.\n  Mr. Speaker, from what I can tell, this deal does not prevent Iran \nfrom having the parts needed to reach the nuclear threshold capability \ndown the road and it will boost the regime's ability to support terror \nin the region.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to continue to carefully monitor this \nsituation and consider the security interests of the United States and \nour allies as we continue analyzing this deal.\n\n\n                    Eagle Scout Rank Congratulations\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate two \nstudents from my district, Daniel Auster and Sebastian Torra, who have \nboth achieved the rank of Eagle Scout with Troop 69 of Homestead, \nFlorida. This prestigious accomplishment has only been achieved by 4 \npercent of Boy Scouts nationwide.\n  Daniel was the first scout in Troop 69 to attain an Eagle Palm pin in \nthe last 15 years. His fellow troop member, Sebastian, completed 173 \nvolunteer hours at Jack D. Gordon Elementary School for his Eagle Scout \nproject, both impressive accomplishments.\n  Daniel and Sebastian are exemplary of the Boy Scout slogan ``Do a \ngood turn daily.'' I applaud their hard work and dedication to achieve \nthis honor. They truly embody the Boy Scouts' commitment to our \ncommunity. I am always pleased to see young people with such dedication \nto giving back and making our neighborhoods better.\n\n[[Page H5302]]\n\n  Once again, congratulations to Daniel and Sebastian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5302-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Yadkin Valley Motor \nCompany in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, which recently celebrated \nits 100th anniversary.\n  It is the oldest Ford dealership in the Carolinas and 20th oldest out \nof about 3,100 Ford dealerships nationwide.\n  A.F. Kilby was the first of four generations of Kilbys to sell Fords \nat Yadkin Valley. His son, Andrew ``Bud'' Kilby, and grandson, John \nKilby, Sr., now own the dealership.\n  At 89 years old, Bud still works at the dealership 6 days a week. \nJohn serves as general manager. And his son, John Kilby, Jr., is a \nsalesman and Internet manager.\n  In May, more than 1,500 people turned out for a special car show \nmarking the 100th anniversary. Several hundred vehicles, including a \nnumber of antique Fords, participated.\n  Congratulations to the Kilby family and everyone at Yadkin Valley \nMotor Company on this significant milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5302-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REAUTHORIZE THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I met with business owners and the \nChamber of Commerce back home in Michigan to discuss what actions we \ncan take here in Congress to create jobs and to boost our economy.\n  One action that came up is that Congress could immediately act to \nbring up legislation to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  It was clear to these businessowners Michigan jobs are at risk if Ex-\nIm is permanently shuttered. This bank, the Ex-Im Bank, supports over a \nmillion U.S. jobs, thousands of small businesses, across the country.\n  Sadly, the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which has been \nsupported for over 80 years by Democrats and Republicans in this House \nand in the White House, has become a victim of Washington's partisan \ngridlock, and it is Michigan's businesses and workers and workers all \nacross this country that are paying the price for Congress' \nunwillingness to take this up.\n  Nearly every developed country, including China, has an export credit \nagency of some type. Ex-Im cannot be allowed to expire. American jobs \nare at risk.\n  Let's reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5302-8", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Iranian nuclear deal has been \napproved by the U.N. Security Council by a vote of 15-0.\n  But wait. Isn't Congress supposed to vote on approval or disapproval \nto make it binding on America? Yes. But the administration, ignoring \nCongress' future vote, went to get the U.N. approval anyway. But this \ndeal is bad for the world and the United States.\n  The United States foreign policy used to be that Iran would never \nhave nuclear weapons. That has changed.\n  This deal legitimizes nuclear weapon development in 10 years. It \nallows the lifting of conventional arms embargo in 5 years. It allows \nIran to develop ICBM capacity in 8 years. It immediately gives Iran \nbillions of dollars, money that I believe will be used to give to \nterrorist groups, since Iran is the number one state sponsor of \nterrorism in the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United Nations doesn't control my vote. The people \nof Texas do. The people I represent think this is a bad deal and don't \nwant the United States to be a part of this Iranian nuclear weapon \ndevelopment fiasco. And that is the way I will vote, whether the U.N. \nor the administration likes it or not.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5302-9", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OLDER AMERICANS MONTH\n\n  (Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, this month is an opportunity to celebrate \nsome critical programs. The Older Americans Act celebrated its 50th \nanniversary this past Tuesday. Medicare and Medicaid turn 50 later this \nmonth. And Social Security turns 80 in August.\n  But it is also a time to reframe how we look at aging in this \ncountry. With Americans living longer and healthier lives, we need to \ncreate a new paradigm that ensures older Americans are living longer \nwith the highest quality of life for the longest time possible.\n  Doing this means we help our aging population feel part of the \ncommunity, provide opportunities for them to stay physically and \nsocially active, and maintain a serious purpose of life and a zest for \nlife.\n  I came to Congress to protect Medicare and Social Security. They are \nbedrock programs that seniors depend on for a safe, healthy, and secure \nretirement.\n  As we celebrate the anniversaries this year, we need to improve and \nstrengthen these programs to better meet the needs of our seniors. We \ncan start by expanding Medicare to cover things like hearing aids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5302-10", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5302-H5303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FLYING TIGERS\n\n  (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. CHABOT.

A group \nof American volunteers answered the call and joined up with Taiwan's \nAir Force to become one of the most important elements in the ultimate \ndefeat of the Japanese invaders.\n  It is fitting that we recognize the role of the Flying Tigers and \nTaiwan's Air Force in holding off the onslaught that U.S. military \nforces eventually rolled back.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Flying Tigers held the fort until our Nation was \nable to gather our strength. For this, we are eternally grateful.\n  We remember. We are grateful.

Mr. Speaker, it is the most trying times that bring out \nthe best in people. West Virginia has faced high water and floods over \nthe past few weeks. Recently there was an act of heroism in Wood County \nthat deserves recognition on the House floor.\n  On their way home on Sunday, 15-year-old Brant Freeland and his \nmother pulled over to wait out high water blocking the road. Brant \nnoticed a car caught in the rising water ahead of him. Not thinking \ntwice, Brant bolted from his car to see if someone was inside.\n  There he found 69-year-old Connie Boggs trapped inside with the water \nrising. He wrenched open the door and got her to safety.\n  Connie said, ``If it wasn't for Brant, I would more than likely have \ndrowned.''\n  For his part, Brant said the last thing on his mind when he entered \nthe water was being a hero. ``I was just worried about saving that \nlady's life. That is all.''\n  Brant did more than that. He showed us the kind of courage that is \ntoo often missing these days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5303-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHATTANOOGA 5\n\n  (Mr. ZINKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. ZINKE.

Mr. Speaker, Americans do not agree with the \nPresident's executive order giving amnesty to 5 million immigrants who \nare in the U.S. illegally, and they especially do not agree with \nHillary Clinton's plan to legalize even more.\n  A recent Rasmussen poll found that a majority of Americans, 63 \npercent, now think gaining control of our border is more important than \nlegalizing those already in the United States.\n  Earlier this month Rasmussen reported that a majority of Americans \nbelieve illegal immigration increases the level of serious crime in \nAmerica.\n  Tragically, the death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco serves as a \nreminder of how the administration's failed policies have endangered \nthe lives of innocent Americans.\n  Instead of putting the safety of Americans first, the administration \nhas often given a free pass to violent criminals who cross our border \nillegally.\n  The administration should listen to the American people. Securing our \nborders should be its first priority, not giving amnesty to those who \nare here illegally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5303-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Benishek) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto\n\n[[Page H5307]]\n\nadd extraneous material on H.R. 2256, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2256, as amended, the Veterans Information \nModernization Act.\n  I developed and introduced this legislation following an oversight \nhearing in January where the subcommittee attempted to determine the \ncost and value of the care that the Department of Veterans Affairs \nprovides to our Nation's veterans.\n  Through the course of that hearing, it became painfully obvious that \nVA leaders were unable to provide basic information about, for example, \nhow much the VA spends on a single patient encounter in a VA primary \ncare clinic.\n  As a doctor who served veterans at the Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical \nCenter in my hometown of Iron Mountain, Michigan, for 20 years, it is \nunbelievable to me that the VA either does not have or is unwilling to \nshare key information about the care that it provides.\n  The Congressional Budget Office testified in January that the VA ``. \n. . provided limited data to Congress and the public about its costs \nand operational performance.''\n  The CBO went on to state, ``. . . if this data was provided on a \nregular and systemic basis, it could help inform policymakers about the \nefficiency and cost-effectiveness of VA's services.''\n  Similar sentiments about the need for the VA to be more forthcoming \nwere echoed at that hearing by witnesses from the American Legion and \nthe Independent Budget.\n  We are all too well aware of the many--seemingly endless--scandals \nthat have plagued the Department over the last year and a half. A lack \nof transparency is at the heart of all of these scandals, and one of \nthe keys to overcoming them is requiring the Department to regularly \nprovide specific information about the care that the VA provides.\n  H.R. 2256, as amended, would accomplish that goal by requiring the VA \nto submit an annual report to Congress regarding the provision of \nhospital care, medical services, and nursing home care by the VA health \ncare system.\n  The report would encompass critical information about the operations \nof the Veterans Health Administration, including data regarding access, \nquality, workload, patient demographics and utilization, physician \ncompensation and productivity, purchase care, and pharmaceutical \nprices.\n  The VA would also be required to detail third-party billings and \ncollections, including information on both small and large claims. This \nwould ensure that the growing disparity between the amounts that the VA \nbills for and the amount that the VA collects is accounted for and that \nthe VA receives every available dollar that it is owed and uses it to \nimprove the services that the VA provides. Many of the data points \nincluded in this report are already provided by the Department of \nDefense for TRICARE.\n  The regular receipt of this information would allow Congress, \nveterans, and the American taxpayers to make better informed decisions \nabout the services that the Department is offering and to assist in \ncreating the VA healthcare system that our veterans truly deserve.\n  Other provisions included in the Veterans Information Modernization \nAct would broaden the VA's definition of a ``homeless veteran'' to \ninclude veterans and their families who are fleeing violent homes, \nimprove the VA's processes for tracking and procuring biological \nimplants, and establish a commission to examine the VA's mental health \ntreatment model and the benefits of incorporating complementary and \nalternative treatments.\n  I would like to offer my sincere gratitude and appreciation to my \nfriends and colleagues--Congressman Gus Bilirakis, Congressman Phil \nRoe, and Congresswoman Janice Hahn--who have sponsored provisions of \nthis bill.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Miller; Ranking Member Brown; \nCongresswoman Julia Brownley, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nHealth; and all of the members of the Subcommittee on Health on both \nsides of the aisle for their hard work and leadership on this bill.\n  I am proud to say that this bill, which was reported favorably out of \nthe full committee earlier this summer and is fully offset, is \nsupported by many veteran service organizations, including the American \nLegion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Concerned Veterans for \nAmerica, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nVeterans Information Modernization Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2256, the Veterans Information \nModernization Act, as amended.\n  This bill does a number of things to improve access and quality of \nservices to our Nation's veterans. This bill requires the Secretary to \nsubmit an annual report on the Department's furnishing of hospital \ncare, medical services, and nursing home care to veterans.\n  One of our priorities on the committee is to ensure that safe, \nquality health care is provided to veterans and their families. This \nreport will assist us in our oversight duties of the Department.\n  This bill expands the definition of a ``homeless veteran'' to include \nveterans fleeing from domestic violence. As you know, veterans who \nexperience domestic violence are considered at high risk for \nhomelessness. This is a very vulnerable population, and anytime we find \na barrier to care, we should remove it.\n\n  Further, one of my biggest priorities as ranking member is to ensure \nthat we provide safe, quality housing for homeless women veterans.\n  Women veterans are an underserved population, and there is a serious \nlack of housing options for those who become homeless.\n  There is an even greater crisis in attempting to find housing for \nwomen veterans who have children. This is largely due to the fact that \nmany facilities do not allow women and children to be in the same \nfacilities as men. This must be corrected immediately.\n  I have encountered several women--those who have been forced to live \non the streets--in weekly motels and in other housing places that are \nnot fit to live in due to domestic violence.\n  This is completely unacceptable. We should be working closely with \nthe VA and HUD to ensure that there is transitional and emergency \nhousing available for women veterans during their greatest time of \nneed.\n  This bill addresses gaps in the identification, tracking, and the \nprocurement of biological implants at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  Finally, this bill would establish a commission to examine the \neffectiveness of the evidence-based therapy model for treating \nveterans' mental health illnesses.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir interest and support of veterans' issues.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my colleague and friend and the \nvice chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2256, the Veterans \nInformation Modernization Act.\n  This bill makes positive, bipartisan reforms to the VA, which has \nbecome the hallmark of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  We have such a good committee, Mr. Speaker. I am particularly pleased \nabout the inclusion of my bill, H.R. 271, the Creating Options for \nVeterans Expedited Recovery Act, better known as the COVER Act.\n  Last year the Veterans' Affairs Committee held a hearing regarding \nveterans' access to the VA's mental health services. At the hearing, we \nheard from the mothers and fathers of deceased veterans.\n  I remember vividly how hearing their testimony moved me. I can't \nremember another instance when the Veterans' Affairs Committee room was \nso quiet and solemn as on that day.\n  Statistics show that one in five veterans who serves in Iraq and \nAfghanistan has been diagnosed with post-\n\n[[Page H5308]]\n\ntraumatic stress. Now we must responsibly ask ourselves: Are we doing \nenough when it comes to addressing mental health in our veteran \npopulation?\n  Recent data has shown that every day in this country approximately 18 \nto 22 veterans take their own lives. This statistic answers the \nquestion I posed earlier. It is obvious more needs to be done.\n  Far too often we have heard of situations in which our veterans are \nbeing overprescribed opioids and antipsychotics. While traditional \nforms of therapies may work for some, tailoring therapies to the \nveterans and finding the balance between traditional and complementary, \nalternative treatments could be the difference in saving lives.\n  Late last year I met with a veteran who was able to tell me just how \nmuch alternative treatments have improved his life. His treatment plan \nto address his PTS and physical injuries consisted of over 30 different \npills every day. He told me how much this affected him. He said he felt \nhopeless and wasn't quite himself anymore.\n  He then decided to take control of his life again and looked for an \nalternative. He found an alternative treatment in training and in \ncaring for a service dog.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Now, his treatment includes one multivitamin, one other medication, \nand a four-legged companion that never leaves his side.\n  The COVER Act is the next piece in a working formula to heal our \nveterans, mentally and physically. It will pave the way toward the \ninclusion of these complementary alternative therapies at the VA.\n  These therapies include, but certainly are not limited to, service \nanimal therapy, yoga therapy, acupuncture, equine therapy, and \naccelerated resolution therapy. Mr. Speaker, I have heard the stories \nfrom these veterans, and these therapies really work. They need access \nto these therapies. At a recent town hall, I even heard about the \nbenefits of martial arts. The martial arts were treating PTS.\n  Mr. Speaker, when treating mental health issues, one size does not \nfit all. Please support this good bill.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), my colleague and a fellow physician \non the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. \n2256, as amended, which includes a bill I introduced, H.R. 1016, the \nBiological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act.\n  A frightening January 2014 GAO report found that the VA does not use \na standardized process for tracking biological tissue from a cadaver to \na living donor veteran patient. In the event of a recall, it would be \nvirtually impossible to track down which patient had received \ncontaminated tissue. GAO also found that the Veterans Health \nAdministration does not always ensure it is purchasing tissue from \nbiological implant vendors that have registered with the FDA and does \nnot maintain an inventory system to prevent expired tissue from \nremaining in storage alongside unexpired tissues.\n  The GAO and Veterans' Affairs Committee staff have discovered that VA \noften uses a loophole that allows it to purchase biological implants on \nthe open, unregulated market, which it does in 57 percent of its \nbiological implant purchases. This bill would require the procurement \nof biological implants from vendors on the Federal supply schedules \nwhich have been appropriately vetted. For biological implants not on \nthe Federal supply schedule but requested by clinicians, my bill \nrequires justification and approval of open market purchases under the \nFederal acquisition regulation on a case-by-case basis rather than \nsimply granting a blanket waiver.\n  This bill would also direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nadopt FDA's unique device identification system for labeling of all \nbiological implant tissue and implement an automated inventory system \nto track the tissue from donor to implant recipient. This legislation \nwould also require all biological implant tissue to be procured through \nvendors that are registered with the FDA, accredited by the American \nAssociation of Tissue Banks, and use FDA's unique device identification \nsystem.\n  The 6 million veterans served annually by VHA deserve the highest \nstandard of patient care in the Nation. Implementation of H.R. 2256 \nwould help establish the VA as an industry leader in biologic implant \nsafety and accountability.\n  I want to thank the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee staff \nfor their help in developing this legislation which truly puts veterans \nfirst.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's support, \nand I again encourage all Members to support H.R. 2256, as amended.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2256, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1557, introduced by my friend and \nranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. \nCummings of Maryland. He has done yeoman's work on this content. I was \nproud to join him as a cosponsor of this important piece of legislation \nthat will help many of our Federal workers as they go through their \nwork in knowing they have even more protections.\n  The Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2015 strengthens \naccountability within our Federal workforce. The bill does so by \nimproving agencies' processes for reporting instances of workplace \ndiscrimination and retaliation. It also requires agencies to create a \nsystem to track complaints of discrimination and retaliation from \nbeginning to end.\n  The bill ensures that agencies report to the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission whether disciplinary action has been taken \nagainst an employee for discrimination or retaliation. It requires \nagencies to provide electronic notification to employees when such an \naction occurs.\n  The bill requires agencies to post additional information about \ndiscriminatory practices on their Web site. It also requires that \nadverse actions taken against any employee for discrimination or \nretaliation be included in that individual's personnel file.\n  Combined, these provisions bring additional transparency and \naccountability to the Federal civil service and will help diminish \ninstances of discrimination and retaliation within our government. \nObviously, those things can't stand.\n  The bill also makes agency Equal Employment offices a direct report \nto the agency head. This is an important step and a good portion of the \nbill that is being brought forth today. This change will help ensure \nthat employees feel safe and comfortable when reporting discriminatory \nor retaliatory actions.\n  Finally, H.R. 1557 makes clear that employees can report waste, \nfraud, and abuse within their agency to Congress, the Office of Special \nCounsel, or the inspectors general.\n  Federal employees are essential in exposing wrongdoing within the \ngovernment. An agency should never have the ability to tell a \ngovernment employee that he or she cannot report waste, fraud, or abuse \nto Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, or the inspectors general. \nThe bill reinforces that obstructing an employee's communication with \nCongress and other watchdogs is against the law.\n  We should be encouraging open communication between Federal employees \nand Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, and the inspectors general \nto protect the integrity of our government and the taxpayers.\n  I want to again thank Mr. Cummings for his leadership and work on \nthis bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1557.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As the author of the Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act, I would \nlike to thank Chairman Chaffetz and his staff for working with me in \ndrafting this bipartisan legislation. I also appreciate the chairman's \nsupport for this bill during the committee's consideration this past \nMarch.\n  I thank Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton for cosponsoring the \nbill. As a former Commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, her expertise in employment law is unparalleled in \nCongress.\n  I also appreciate the support of Representatives James Sensenbrenner \nand Sheila Jackson Lee, who cosponsored the bill.\n  I especially want to thank Tanya Ward Jordan, Paulette Taylor, and \nall the members of the Coalition 4 Change, also known as C4C, for their \ninvaluable assistance on this legislation.\n  I am also grateful that this bill has strong support of the Make It \nSafe Coalition.\n  Both C4C and the Make It Safe Coalition are dedicated to ending \ndiscrimination and retaliation against whistleblowers in the Federal \nworkplace, and I applaud their leadership and their hard work.\n  The Federal EEO programs are critical to ensuring that Federal \nworkplaces are free from discrimination and that any barriers impeding \nfairness in personnel decisions are identified and eliminated. These \nprograms exist to ensure that our Federal workplaces uphold the \nguarantee of equal opportunity. That is the right of every citizen in \nthis great country.\n  If discrimination occurs, these programs must be able to investigate \nand adjudicate employee complaints impartially and in a timely manner.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  In fiscal year 2012, Federal employees and job applicants filed \nnearly 16,000 complaints alleging that they had been victims of \ndiscrimination. Although the vast majority of Federal workplaces are in \ncompliance with current EEO requirements, some Federal agencies have \nfailed to meet the standards of a model EEO program.\n  For example, in 2014, the EEOC issued a report on the Social Security \nAdministration that made 12 findings regarding Social Security's \nfailure to maintain a model EEOC program, ensure efficient management \nof the various stages of the complaint process, provide uniform \ntraining to ensure equal opportunities, and implement effective and \nefficient antiharassment policies and procedures. The EEOC made more \nthan 60 recommendations for reform of that one program alone.\n  My bill would require that EEO programs operate independently of an \nagency's human resources or general counsel offices and that the head \nof the program report directly to the head of an agency. This would \nensure that effective implementation of the EEO program is prioritized \nat the highest level of an agency and that program's sole purpose is \nensuring equal opportunity for all employees.\n  H.R. 1557 would also strengthen the accountability mechanisms that \nare central to the effectiveness of the EEO process. This legislation \nwould expand the notifications that agencies are required to provide \nwhen discrimination is found to have occurred and would require \nagencies to track and report whether such findings have resulted in any \ndisciplinary action.\n  Finally, the act would prohibit the use of nondisclosure agreements \nthat restrict an employee from disclosing to Congress, the office of \nspecial counsel, or an inspector general any information that relates \nto any violation of law, rule, or regulation or instance of waste, \nfraud, or abuse.\n  According to the 2014 Federal employee viewpoint survey, only 60 \npercent of Federal employees agreed that they could ``disclose a \nsuspected violation of any law, rule, or regulation without fear of \nreprisal.''\n  As I often say, we are better than that. Employees need to have \nconfidence that they can report an act of discrimination without \nsuffering retaliation, and they need to know that such reports will be \nthoroughly, fairly, and timely investigated and adjudicated.\n  The Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2015 will strengthen \nexisting requirements to ensure that Federal EEO programs meet these \nstandards and that agency management of the EEO process follows the \nbest practices available.\n  Again, I take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to thank Chairman Chaffetz. This \nwas truly a bipartisan effort. We saw a problem, and we put our heads \ntogether and tried to address it. I would urge all Members of the House \nto vote for it.\n\n[[Page H5311]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me rise today to thank both the \nchairman and the ranking member of this committee, Mr. Chaffetz and Mr. \nCummings, for their leadership on a very important issue, which I rise \nto be part of and with a little history on this issue with the earlier \npassage of the No FEAR Act so many years ago.\n  I support this legislation which ensures agencies effectively \nimplement their Equal Employment Opportunity, or EEO, programs and that \nFederal employees are never prevented from disclosing discriminatory or \nwasteful actions to Congress, the office of special counsel, or \ninspectors general.\n  How important is that? We have a history of addressing workplace \nequality, and that is why I sponsored similar legislation with the No \nFEAR Act, which was first introduced in Congress in 2002. This was \nprevious legislation that had a sense of Congress provision, whereas \nthis particular legislation further strengthens the responsibilities \nand rights of employees.\n  The No FEAR Act set the precedent for imposing additional duties upon \nFederal agency employers, intended to reinvigorate their longstanding \nobligation to provide a work environment free of discrimination and \nretaliation.\n  On October 2, 2000, the House Science Committee held a hearing \ndealing with actions at one of our agencies. Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo \nhad been in my office repeatedly. I mention her name because of her \ncontinued vigilance in speaking about issues dealing with \nwhistleblowers. In actuality, this one involved a $600,000 jury \ndecision against the EPA for race and sex discrimination under title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  As we all listened in this hearing, it was clear that what we wanted \nto do was prevent retaliation, which we see in this legislation here \ntoday. I am grateful that we now have a roadmap for dealing with \nindividuals who want only the best for our government.\n  I can give some of the names as an example: Mark Felt, the FBI agent \nknown as Deep Throat during the Watergate scandal of the 1970s; Frank \nSerpico, a New York police officer who confronted his department for \nthe rampant corruption the leadership let take place; Jeffrey Wigand, a \ntobacco executive who admitted that tobacco companies knew they were \nputting addictive chemicals into their cigarettes; and, of course, \nSherron Watkins, an executive of the Enron Corporation.\n  Of course, these individuals come from different walks of life, but \nthe whole idea is to make sure that we, as Members of Congress, \nrecognize that whistleblower activities or actions are clearly a part \nof good government.\n  According to the 2014 Federal employee viewpoint survey, only 60 \npercent of Federal employees agreed that they could ``disclose a \nsuspected violation of any law, rule, or regulation without fear of \nreprisal.''\n  I know that your committee, Mr. Chaffetz and Mr. Cummings, is really \nthe front line of providing this forum; and I am glad to be able to \njoin you as a member of the Homeland Security Committee and Judiciary \nCommittee to, again, emphasize the importance of safe and \ndiscrimination-free workplaces.\n  I am grateful, again, to have had the opportunity firsthand to listen \nto at least one of our whistleblowers who only wanted to be able to \nhelp establish a workplace that was free of discrimination and fear.\n  Again, I want to make mention of Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, a dedicated \nFederal employee who worked so very hard.\n\n                     [From NPR.org, Sept. 6, 2011]\n\n                High Price of Blowing the Whistle on EPA\n\n       Marsha Coleman-Adebayo earned a doctoral degree from the \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and worked with the \n     United Nations before joining the Environmental Protection \n     Agency in 1990. During her time at the U.N., she also \n     developed an expertise in African developmental issues.\n       During her tenure at the EPA, Coleman-Adebayo says she \n     requested that the agency devote attention to environmental \n     problems in South Africa that were allegedly caused by an \n     American company. She says that the agency reneged on \n     promises to investigate the matter, and the harder she pushed \n     for change, the more she faced a backlash from her superiors.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I make mention that we passed the No \nFEAR Act with a number of Members.\n  As we have noted a number of whistleblowers who were actually Persons \nof the Year on Time Magazine, I join my colleagues in supporting the \npresent underlying legislation and ask all Members to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an original co-sponsor and strong \nsupport of H.R. 1557, the ``Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act of \n2015.''\n  I support this legislation because it ensures agencies effectively \nimplement their Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) programs and that \nfederal employees are never prevented from disclosing discriminatory or \nwasteful actions to Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, or \nInspectors General.\n  Let me express my thanks to Ranking Member Cummings for introducing \nthis critical legislation that is essential to ensuring that our \nfederal workplaces are free from discrimination, and that any barriers \nimpeding fairness in personnel decisions are identified and eliminated.\n  We have a history of addressing workplace equality and that is why I \nsponsored similar legislation when the No Fear Act was first introduced \nto Congress in 2002.\n  The No Fear Act set the precedent for imposing additional duties upon \nFederal agency employers intended to reinvigorate their longstanding \nobligation to provide a work environment free of discrimination and \nretaliation.\n  If you would allow me I would like to put a face on this problem.\n  On October 2, 2000, the House Science Committee held a hearing \nentitled ``Intolerance at EPA--Harming People, Harming Science?''\n  Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, an EPA whistleblower, won a $600,000 jury \ndecision against EPA for race and sex discrimination under title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  During that hearing, then-chairman of the Science Committee \nCongressman Sensenbrenner illuminated the dangerous precedent set by \nthe EPA, stating, ``While EPA has a clear policy on dealing with \nemployees that discriminate, harass and retaliate against other EPA \nemployees, no one apparently involved in the Coleman-Adebayo or Nolan \ncases have yet to be disciplined by EPA.''\n  Mr. Speaker no employee should fear voicing their concerns in \nreference to a safer more work conducive environment.\n  We often look at individuals or groups who step forward as \nwhistleblowers.\n  This term has been used with a negative connotation to describe \ninsubordinate employees, but history has shown us that whistleblowers \nare often heroes that have shed light on employers' illegal practices \nand as a result made the workplace better for future employees.\n  Mark Felt, the FBI agent known as deep throat during the Watergate \nScandal of the 1970s.\n  Frank Serpico, New York police officer who confronted his department \nfor the rampant corruption the leadership let take place.\n  Jeffrey Wigand, a tobacco executive who admitted that tobacco \ncompanies knew they were putting addictive chemicals into their \ncigarettes.\n  And Sherron Watkins, an executive of the Enron corporation who was \nvital in exposing the financial lies and frauds of the company.\n  All these individuals stood up against well-established corporations \nand agencies even when others doubted their claims.\n  We must protect these types of acts in Federal offices and \nsuccessfully implement the Equal Employment Opportunity Programs (EEO).\n  Mr. Speaker, in a sense every Member of Congress is a whistleblower \nfor the people in that uncovering and correcting problems in the \nagencies that administer the laws is an essential part of our oversight \nresponsibilities.\n  According to the 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, only 60 \npercent of federal employees agreed that they could quote, ``disclose a \nsuspected violation of any law, rule or regulation without fear of \nreprisal.''\n  We must do better and ensure employees have confidence that they can \nreport an act of discrimination without suffering retaliation.\n  Employees need to know that EEO reports will be thoroughly, fairly, \nand timely investigated and adjudicated.\n  H.R. 1557 would require that EEO programs operate independently of an \nagency's human resources or general counsel offices.\n  This bill requires the head of the program report directly to the \nhead of an agency and the act would prohibit the use of non-disclosure \nagreements that restrict an employee from disclosing to Congress, the \nOffice of Special Counsel, or instance of waste, fraud or abuse.\n  As a senior member of the Committees on Homeland Security and the \nJudiciary, and as\n\n[[Page H5312]]\n\nRanking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security, and Investigations, I understand the importance of \nsafe and discrimination free workplaces.\n  In conclusion, let me express my appreciation again to Ranking Member \nCummings for introducing this legislation and Chairman Chaffetz for \nshepherding this bill to the floor.\n  By strengthening existing requirements to ensure federal EEO programs \nmeet high

DOC. NO. 114-49)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was read and, together \nwith the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs and ordered to be printed:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to transnational \ncriminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581 of July 24, \n2011, is to continue in effect beyond July 24, 2015.\n  The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations \nhave reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of \ninternational political and economic systems. Such organizations are \nbecoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; \nthey are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign \ngovernments and the international financial system, thereby weakening \ndemocratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining \neconomic markets. These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent \ncivil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other \ndangerous persons.\n  The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations \ncontinue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, \nI have determined that it is necessary to continue the national \nemergency declared in Executive Order 13581 with respect to \ntransnational criminal organizations.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, July 21, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5312-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

REVOCATION OR DENIAL OF PASSPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS \n                   AFFILIATED WITH FOREIGN TERRORIST \n                   ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       The Act entitled ``An Act to regulate the issue and \n     validity of passports, and for other purposes'', approved \n     July 3, 1926 (22 U.S.C. 211a et seq.), commonly known as the \n     ``Passport Act of 1926'', is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO DENY OR REVOKE PASSPORT.\n\n       ``(a) Ineligibility.--\n       ``(1) Issuance.--Except as provided under subsection (b), \n     the Secretary of State may refuse to issue a passport to any \n     individual whom the Secretary has determined has aided, \n     assisted, abetted, or otherwise helped an organization the \n     Secretary has designated as a foreign terrorist organization \n     pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1189).\n       ``(2) Revocation.--The Secretary of State may revoke a \n     passport previously issued to any individual described in \n     paragraph (1).\n       ``(b) Report.--\n       ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary of State refuses to \n     issue or revokes a passport pursuant to subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall, not later than 30 days after such refusal or \n     revocation, submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate a report on such refusal or \n     revocation, as the case may be.\n       ``(2) Form.--The report submitted under paragraph (1) may \n     be submitted in classified or unclassified form.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 days to revise and extend and to include extraneous materials on this \nmeasure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  International travel by terrorist recruits poses a deadly and growing \nthreat. It is estimated that ISIS alone has drawn 20,000 foreign \nfighters into Syria and Iraq.\n  Extremist groups in Libya, Yemen, and elsewhere also draw foreigners \ninto their deadly campaigns. These include thousands of westerners, \nprimarily from Europe, but also a couple of hundred people from the \nUnited States so far.\n  The threats are as real as today's headlines: British officials today \narrested a man for plotting attacks on U.S. military personnel there in \nBritain and for planning to travel to Syria to join ISIS, along with \nhis uncle.\n  If they are successful in traveling, these foreign fighters receive \nterrorist training and they hone their skills\n\n[[Page H5313]]\n\nthere on the battlefield. Some have even appeared as executioners in \nISIS' gruesome propaganda videos. If they return home, hardened \nfighters come back more hateful, certainly more deadly.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  The killing of four U.S. marines and one sailor in Chattanooga, \nTennessee, last Thursday; the attempted attack in Garland, Texas, in \nMay; and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing all demonstrate that the \nUnited States is not immune from lone wolf and small-scale attacks of \nthe type that ISIS and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula continue to \ncall for.\n  Surprisingly, the statutory authority to prohibit such travel in \nsupport of designated terrorist groups hasn't kept pace with the \nthreat. I want to thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs \nSubcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, Judge Ted Poe \nof Texas, for his work in introducing H.R. 237, the Foreign Terrorist \nOrganization Passport Revocation Act, as a critical countermeasure.\n  This bipartisan and commonsense bill grants the Secretary of State \nthe authority to refuse or revoke a passport to any individual whom the \nSecretary determines has helped a designated foreign terrorist \norganization in realizing its jihadist ambitions.\n  Such authority is not currently spelled out in statute, but depends \non interpretation of Federal regulations, and this legislation will \nwrite it into permanent law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just note that the text before us today grants \npermissive authority to the Secretary and, thus, the discretion to \navoid interfering with law enforcement or intelligence activities that \nmight be compromised if such a revocation were mandatory.\n  While we, of course, expect that the Secretary of State will exercise \nthis authority within the bounds of constitutional due process, the \nbill also requires a report to Congress whenever such authority is used \nto help ensure oversight and to provide transparency.\n  Individuals who actively support designated terrorist organizations \nmust be stopped from traveling abroad to learn how to kill Americans \nand our allies. Spelling this out clearly in permanent law will help \nprevent misguided individuals from getting further radicalized abroad, \nwhich leads to terrorist attacks on the homeland.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nPoe) and his 10 bipartisan cosponsors for their work in bringing the \nbill forward, and this measure obviously deserves our support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2015.\n     Hon. Ed Royce,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing with respect to H.R. 237, \n     the ``FTO Passport Revocation Act of 2015,'' which was \n     referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n       As you know, H.R. 237 contains provisions that fall within \n     the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary. As \n     a result of your having consulted with the Committee and in \n     order to expedite the House's consideration of H.R. 237, the \n     Committee on the Judiciary will not assert is jurisdictional \n     claim over this bill by seeking a sequential referral. \n     However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding and \n     agreement that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary with respect \n     to the appointment of conferees or to any future \n     jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in \n     the bill or similar legislation.\n       I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding with respect to H.R. 237, and would ask \n     that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be \n     included in the Congressional Record during Floor \n     consideration of H.R. 237.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                 Committee on Foreign Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2015.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 237, the FTO Passport \n     Revocation Act of 2015, and, on the basis of agreed edits in \n     the suspension text of the bill, for agreeing to forgo a \n     sequential referral request so that it may proceed \n     expeditiously to the Floor.\n       I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure \n     does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, or prejudice its jurisdictional \n     prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the \n     future.\n       I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 237 into our \n     Committee Report and into the Congressional Record during \n     floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your \n     cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to \n     continuing to work with the Committee on the Judiciary as \n     this measure moves through the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Edward R. Royce,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong \nsupport of H.R. 237, as amended, and I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation authorizes the Secretary of State to \ndeny the issuance of or revoke the passport of an individual who is \naffiliated with or providing assistance to a designated foreign \nterrorist organization.\n  I would like to thank the author of this legislation, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Poe), for his leadership on this issue and for working \nwith us in a bipartisan manner.\n  Mr. Speaker, as Chairman Royce said a few moments ago, this is a \ncommonsense bill. It is a reasonable step our government can take to \naddress the rise of the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS, while acting \nwithin our authority to deny or revoke passports for those who are \naffiliated with or are aiding, assisting, or abetting an organization \nthat the Secretary has designated as a foreign terrorist organization.\n  Whether you call them ISIS or ISIL or Daesh or their latest preferred \nterm, the Islamic State, one thing is quite clear: this organization \nhas captured large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria with lethal \nefficiency.\n  This brutal terrorist group has engaged in mass executions, targeted \nreligious minorities, raped and enslaved women, destroyed priceless \nhistorical treasures, and effectively redrawn the borders of the Middle \nEast.\n  With its extensive propaganda efforts, including the sophisticated \nuse of social media, ISIS has recruited tens of thousands of foreign \nfighters--reportedly more than 1,000 a month--including a significant \nnumber from Europe as well as some, remarkably, from the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, this flow of foreign fighters is a serious threat, \nespecially with U.S. passport holders among them. The Foreign Affairs \nCommittee has held hearings looking at the impact of ISIS and its use \nof foreign fighters. Our colleagues and constituents alike are very \nconcerned about what might happen when these fighters return home, \nradicalized by ISIS ideology and armed with the knowledge of \nbattlefield tactics.\n  H.R. 237, the FTO Passport Revocation Act, would address this problem \nby authorizing the Secretary of State to deny passports to known \nmembers or supporters of ISIS and other terrorist groups. It would \nallow the Secretary to revoke the passports of those who have already \nleft the United States so they are unable to return and sow terror here \nat home.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States has a strong national security \ninterest in defeating ISIS. I support the various lines of effort to \ncounter the terrorist group, cracking down on ISIS' finances, \ncountering their propaganda efforts, and stopping the flow of foreign \nfighters. To be clear, this legislation will not solve the problem of \nforeign fighters in Iraq and Syria, but it is a sensible and important \nstep in the right direction.\n  Many of our coalition partners, including France, Britain, and \nAustralia, have already taken steps to restrict or revoke passports for \nISIS supporters. We must use all the tools at our disposal for \nprotection of our homeland.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Poe), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nTerrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade and author of this important \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page H5314]]\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and \nRanking Member Engel. Also, I want to thank the cosponsors of this \nlegislation--as mentioned earlier, it is an equal number of Republicans \nand Democrats--but especially Brad Sherman and William Keating on the \nminority side.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2015, the Director of National Intelligence, James \nClapper, said that 180 Americans have tried to go fight in Syria, \neither for ISIS, Al Nusra, or some other Islamic extremist group. There \nmay be more; we don't know.\n  Americans citizens fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq are real, \ndangerous threats to the United States. These individuals are receiving \ntraining that makes them capable of sophisticated terrorist attacks, \nand they put themselves under the command and control of leaders in \nforeign places and leaders who want to attack the United States.\n  This is not unique to the United States. As the chairman has \nmentioned earlier, the West--European countries--have this as a \ntremendous problem where their citizens go and fight in Syria; they are \ntrained, and they come back and cause havoc in these countries in the \nWest.\n  It is not a hypothetical threat in the U.S., either. Moner Mohammad \nAbusalha was the first American to carry out a suicide bomb attack in \nSyria. Before he did so, he returned home to Florida as a fully trained \nterrorist. Our government had absolutely no idea. He was also a card-\ncarrying member of al Qaeda, aligned to the Al Nusra front. \nFortunately, he did not carry out an attack on the United States, but \nhe could have.\n  Last September, ISIS announced a shift in strategy. Instead of using \nAmericans to win in Syria, it called upon Americans to attack the \nUnited States after being trained in Syria. In an audiotape, one of \ntheir leaders was heard saying: ``Rig the roads with explosives for \nthem. Attack their bases. Raid their homes. Cut off their heads.''\n  He is talking about Americans killing Americans who have been \nradicalized by ISIS.\n  Earlier this year, Mr. Speaker, a 23-year-old Somali American man \nfrom Columbus was indicted on charges of supporting terrorists. He was \ntrained in Syria and told by a cleric to go back to the United States \nand carry out an attack. That is the first time we have caught someone \nwho was specifically told to go back home and attack the United States.\n  These traitors who have turned against America and joined the ranks \nof foreign radical terrorist armies should not be allowed to come back \nin to the United States, unless it is in handcuffs.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 237, the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport \nRevocation Act, is a critical bill at a critical time. This bipartisan \nbill grants the Secretary of State the authority to revoke or deny U.S. \npassports of individuals who support designated foreign terrorist \norganizations.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court has ruled in Haig v. Agee that the \nSecretary of State has the authority to revoke a passport when the \nnational security of the United States is threatened. We are not \ntalking about citizenship; we are talking about revocation of a \npassport. This bill does not deal with the issue of citizenship.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, there is a due process available for those who \nwish to challenge the Secretary of State's decision. Under existing \nregulations, a person is entitled to a hearing within 60 days of \nreceiving notice that that passport is being revoked.\n  Foreign fighters are flowing into Iraq and Syria by the thousands. \nSome of them are Americans. We must stop these outlaws from coming back \nto the United States and committing crimes against us.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  ISIS is absolutely a barbaric regime that cannot be negotiated with \nand must be defeated. They literally want to return civilization back \ncenturies and centuries.\n  It is hard for me and I think it is hard for almost any American to \nimagine what could possibly be going through the mind of a U.S. citizen \nwho would be attracted to go over there and make common cause with \nISIS.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the son of an immigrant who knows the sacrifices his \nfather and grandparents made to come to this country, the fact that \nsomeone would actually jeopardize the most valuable thing they have, \ntheir American citizenship and their U.S. passport, to join ISIS is \ncompletely unfathomable.\n  We absolutely have to give our Secretary of State this authority. \nISIS sadly presents a real threat both abroad and at home. This is a \ncommonsense measure that we can take, and we must absolutely take it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I will just quote the Bureau of Counterterrorism, Mr. Speaker. They \nsay that the rate of foreign terrorist fighter travel to Syria exceeded \nthe rate of foreign terrorist fighters that travel to Afghanistan, \nPakistan, Iraq, Yemen, or Somalia at any point in the last 20 years.\n  Individuals drawn to the conflict were diverse in their socioeconomic \nand geographic backgrounds, highlighting the need for comprehensive \ncountermessaging and early engagement to dissuade vulnerable \nindividuals from traveling to join the conflict.\n  The bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 237, is a necessary \naddition to our national defense. It creates an important deterrent, \nand it reduces the ability of terrorists to travel.\n  I, again, thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Poe, and the ranking \nmember, Mr. Keating of Massachusetts, and the bipartisan cosponsors of \nthe bill before us today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the measure, and I yield back \nbalance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 237, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5314-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, last Thursday was a very difficult day \nin my beautiful hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was a day of \nhorror; it was a day of terror, and it was a day like no other I have \nlived in my life.\n  Today, I am joined in this great House by my colleagues from the \nTennessee delegation. Chattanooga is my hometown. A lone gunman--a \nterrorist, an evil man--killed five wonderful United States \nservicemembers, four marines and one sailor. At two locations in \nChattanooga, he opened fire. There was devastation; there was death, \nand there was horror, and I am so deeply saddened.\n  Before I ask Members for a moment of silence, I am going to ask this \ngreat House--the people's House--for something special because, through \nall the carnage in the face of evil, I saw Chattanoogans come together \nwith good. In the face of despair, I saw Chattanoogans come together \nwith hope.\n  I saw something in my darkest hour; I saw the greatness in America. \nCatholics, Protestants, Jews, Whites, Blacks, and Latinos came \ntogether. We prayed together. We hoped for better days together. We \nhonored the men and women who serve us in all of our branches together. \nI feel for our great marines. I feel for our Navy in these difficult \ntimes.\n  Let me tell you this: the Chattanooga Police Department selflessly \nshowed up and fought this terrorist and killed him. Hamilton County \npolice were there. While a brave sailor tried to cling to life, I saw \nthrongs of doctors and nurses at Erlanger hospital giving their best \nskills to try to save this man. Sadly, they were unsuccessful.\n  This is a day I never want to see again. I ask you that we resolve to \nkeep all American servicemen and -women safe here on American soil. We \nmust do that. We owe that to those five wonderful lives that we lost, \nall precious.\n  I am going to ask for all of us to be Chattanooga strong. I am going \nto ask all of us to please come together as Americans.\n  I will read the name of those five outstanding folks: United States \nMarine Gunnery Sergeant Thomas J. Sullivan; United States Marine Staff \nSergeant David Allen Wyatt; United States Marine Sergeant Carson Allen \nLouis Holmquist; United States Marine Lance Corporal Squire Kimpton \nPaul Wells; and United States Navy Petty Officer Second Class Randall \nSmith.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in honor of these great \nAmericans.\n  The SPEAKER. The House will observe a moment of silence.\n\n[[Page H5316]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5316-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 VETERANS INFORMATION MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER.

This \nattack isn't about the trumped-up claims in the video.\n  It is about the same tired efforts to make it harder for women from \nevery walk of life and every corner of the country to make the health \nchoices that work for them.\n  It is sad that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so \nquick to hop on that bandwagon.\n  Enough, Mr. Speaker.

You \nhave heard about their ability to keep their nuclear infrastructure, \nall these hugely problematic provisions.\n  Interestingly, we talk about if Iran violates the deal, we can snap \nback economic sanctions. In fact, Iran can snap back in a nuclear \ndirection.\n  Here is what the agreement says: Iran has stated that, if sanctions \nare reinstated, in whole or in part, Iran will treat that as grounds to \ncease performing its commitment under this JCPOA, in whole or in part.\n  That means, if Iran cheats and we go to penalize them, Iran is \nreserving the right to simply go back to producing nuclear weapons.\n  We have been told that no deal is better than a bad deal.

His days with us are numbered.\n  I know that many Members hold memories of Lou, and there will be many \ntributes paid to Congressman Louis Stokes of Ohio. Without question, \nhis service was legendary, along with his brother, who became the first \nAfrican American mayor in our country, the city of Cleveland.\n  If we look coast to coast, the people of Ohio are walking in prayer \nwith the Stokes family now.

Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight with deep \nsadness at the loss of my friend, Mike McElroy, the mayor of Decatur, \nIllinois, just last week.\n  Mike was not just my friend. He was a friend to so many, and he led \nthe City of Decatur through some very difficult times to where Decatur, \nmy former hometown, as a student at Millikin University, has been able \nto see the progress that many envisioned 26 years ago when Mike and his \nwife, Lynn, made Decatur their hometown.\n  Mike is going to be remembered not only as a friend of mine, but a \nfriend to the entire community, be it the YMCA that he served on the \nboard of directors, St. Teresa school that he was so active in, or the \nmany other community efforts that he was a part of.\n  ``Tuna,'' as he was known, is going to be missed by all, but \nespecially missed by me. Mike was an early supporter of mine and a \nfriend when I didn't have as many friends in that town as I started my \njourney that ended right here on this House floor when I was sworn in a \nfew short years ago.\n  Tuna, you left this Earth way too early. My heartfelt condolences go \nout to the entire Decatur community, who will miss you, and, most \nimportantly, to your wife, Lynn, and your son, Matt.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the fifth \nanniversary of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, the financial crisis of 2007 was not an accident and not \nan unavoidable by-product of free markets. It was a mistake, a mistake \ndriven by ideologically driven deregulation.\n  Countries which maintained adequate capital requirements did not \nsuffer a financial crisis. Countries which maintained an adequately \nregulated primary and secondary mortgage market did not suffer through \na housing bubble.\n  In response to the crisis, taxpayers stepped in and saved the global \nfinancial system by stabilizing the marketplace and staving off a \nsecond Great Depression through economic stimulus.\n  To ensure that taxpayers would not be on the hook for the \nirresponsible actions by some on Wall Street, the Dodd-Frank Act \nrequired that financial institutions hold adequate capital against the \nrisks they take and take responsibility for the risks that they sell \ninto the market. The Dodd-Frank Act has unquestionably made our markets \nsafer and more stable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5317-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5317-H5318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PIONEER DAY\n\n  (Mr. STEWART asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. STEWART.

In doing so, they \nsuffered incredibly, hunger, cold, disease, exhaustion, the death of \nloved ones. My own ancestors were among the many who did suffer.\n  Once they arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, they worked tirelessly to \ntake the desert and to make it bloom into the thriving communities we \nhave today. My, how things have changed.\n  Utah is considered the best managed State. They are considered some \nof the finest and highest quality-of-life communities. They are one of \nthe best States to do business.

We were blessed with \nmy grandmother for 77 years. But LaVerne, in northern California, we \nwere blessed with for 100 years.\n  So LaVerne's loss indeed makes a big ripple. She made a big ripple in \nher life with all the people she touched and her love of music.\n  Indeed, she was a talented musician and freely gave her time and her \ntalent for decades through teaching music at Yuba College, \nparticipating in Handel's Messiah for almost 75 years and playing the \norgan at Marysville's First Presbyterian Church for 20 years.\n  Indeed, when we lose somebody, we have what we call a celebration of \nlife. Her celebration of life was last November when she reached her \n100th birthday, and she had the best party I have ever seen with an \norchestra, cellos, and everything. She got on the keyboard herself and \nshowed us what 100 years of life and vigor in northern California looks \nlike.\n  We will miss her, but we will always smile when we think of LaVerne \nGrell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5318-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5318-H5319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1930\n                      PLANNED PARENTHOOD PRACTICES\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ALLEN.

Just \ntoday, another video was released showing a senior Planned Parenthood \nofficial make flippant comments about receiving money for the organs of \naborted babies.\n  The practices brought to light in these videos and reports are \nshocking and sickening.

It profits from the pain of abortion, and now it \ntraffics in baby parts.\n  How much more do we have to know to awaken us, awaken our conscience \nas a nation, to the gruesome realities again of this taxpayer-funded \norganization?\n  So I am pleased that my colleagues have gathered tonight to talk more \nin depth about this, but also to highlight the fact that we are all \ninterested in ongoing congressional investigations to determine what \nefforts, what laws, or what new steps need to be taken to ban the \nunethical and dehumanizing practice undertaken by Planned Parenthood.\n  We must challenge this assault on human dignity, especially to \nprotect the most vulnerable members of our society.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, for 30 years, Planned Parenthood has worked \nto dehumanize the babies that they have aborted, claiming that these \nlittle babies were just clumps of cells, just clumps of tissue; but \nthrough the recent videos that have come out, they have, in essence, \nadmitted what we have known all along--that these are actually little \nhumans. These are little babies, and their organs are being harvested \nfor profit: little baby heads and little baby livers, little baby \nhearts and little baby lungs--little baby lungs that will never have an \nopportunity to cry, little baby lungs that will never be used to learn \nhow to speak, and little baby lungs that will never learn to sing \nbecause they have been killed in the womb.\n  These are little babies that are so well developed that they can \nsurvive outside the womb. These little babies feel pain in the \nabortion. These are little ones who, again, don't have lobbyists in \nthis town that work for them. They are voiceless, they are defenseless, \nand so often they are powerless.\n  But this House is coming together tonight in extraordinary form to \nmake sure that these little ones are not forgotten, because we are \nstanding up for them to make sure that their lives matter because in \nAmerica we believe that all lives matter, whether you are born or \nunborn. So I am proud to be part of this Special Order tonight. I am \nproud that we have so many Members who want to come down and speak on \nthis important topic.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), \nwho has been such a leader in the pro-life movement.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Duffy. Thank you for yielding \nto me and for your leadership on this extremely important human rights \nissue.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2011, an undercover videotape sting operation by Live \nAction exposed several Planned Parenthood affiliates who are eager, \nready, and willing to facilitate secret abortions for child sex \ntrafficking victims--some as young or younger than 14--to get them on \nthe streets again.\n  As the prime author of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of \n2000, the landmark law that seeks to protect victims, mostly women and \nchildren, I found the on-the-record willingness of Planned Parenthood \npersonnel to exploit young girls and partner with sex traffickers to be \nabsolutely appalling. Watch the video yourself on liveaction.org.\n  In 2012, Live Action released another sting operation video, part of \na series called ``Gendercide: Sex Selection in America,'' showing \nPlanned Parenthood staff advising undercover female investigators how \nto procure sex selection abortions. Caught on tape, Planned Parenthood \ntells the investigator to wait until the baby is 5 months along to get \nan ultrasound that will reveal the sex of the child, then, if it is a \ngirl, kill it.\n  Planned Parenthood is okay with terminating the girl child in its \nhuge network of clinics simply because she is a girl. What a dangerous \nplace for little girls.\n  Now we have learned that Planned Parenthood is trafficking in baby \nbody parts and intact organs like livers and hearts, charging up to \n$100 or more per body part. Not only has Planned Parenthood killed over \n7 million innocent babies in their chain of abortion mills, about \n330,000 children per year, but now shocking new undercover videos by \nthe Center for Medical Progress show high-ranking Planned Parenthood \nofficials explaining how they market and profit from the sale of the \norgans of their victims and how doctors maneuver deadly abortion tools \nto ensure--they call them graspers--intact organs.\n  In one clip, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, senior director of Planned \nParenthood Federation of America's medical services and a late-term \nabortionist herself, explained:\n\n       We have been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, \n     because we know that, so I am not going to crush that part. I \n     am going to basically crush below, I am going to crush above, \n     and I am going to see if I can get it all intact.\n\n  Dr. Nucatola says on camera:\n\n       I would say a lot of people want liver; and for that \n     reason, most providers will do this case under ultrasound \n     guidance, so they will know where they are putting their \n     forceps.\n\n  In other words, crush the baby to death, but do it in a way that \npreserves certain organs and body parts for sale.\n  Dr. Nucatola even suggests and is caught on tape talking about \ncreating a menu.\n  Today, another new devastating video by the same organization shows a \nPlanned Parenthood Federation top doctor, Dr. Mary Gatter, offering to \nuse a ``less crunchy technique'' to get more intact organs and baby \nbody parts.\n  Less crunchy? Like Dr. Nucatola, Dr. Gatter is nonchalantly talking \nabout crunching--that is, crushing--babies to death in ways that are \nmore likely to preserve body parts and intact organs. This is \nunconscionable, it is inhumane, and it must stop. I am glad that the \nHouse Republican leadership has called for full investigations into \nthis dehumanizing practice.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nHensarling), the chairman of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership \ntonight especially, of all times.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is our highest ideal as Americans that every human \nlife is endowed with dignity and has value. As Americans, we have a \nshared responsibility to protect the innocent and defend the rights of \nthose who are unable to defend themselves. But rather than protecting \nand defending this dignity, Planned Parenthood is seemingly attempting \nto cash in on it.\n  Recently, shocking and appalling videos have come to light exposing \nsenior employees at Planned Parenthood casually discussing both the \nharvesting and selling of organs of aborted children. These videos \nportray a chilling transactional approach to ending human life.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a matter of morality, history, science, reason, and, \nmost importantly, my personal faith, I can come to no other conclusion \nbut that every human life begins at conception and every human life is \nworthy of protection.\n\n[[Page H5320]]\n\n  Psalm 139:13 says:\n\n       For You created my inmost being; You knit me together in my \n     mother's womb.\n\n  What God has knit together, apparently Planned Parenthood wishes to \ncrush. But that is not my word, Mr. Speaker; that is their word. You \nhave heard it spoken on this House floor as Senior Director of Medical \nServices at Planned Parenthood said:\n\n       We have been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, \n     because we know that, so I am not going to crush that part.\n\n  I am not sure I have ever repeated such vile and cruel words on this \nHouse floor before, Mr. Speaker; and whether one considers themselves \npro-life or pro-choice, I would hope that every American believes that \nharvesting and trafficking baby organs violates the sanctity to which \nevery child created in the very image of God is entitled to.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I add my voice thanking our leadership of this \nCongress for calling on investigations of these horrific acts, and I \ncall on the Obama administration to denounce them and find a way to \nstop these gruesome practices.\n  Almost every day, Mr. Speaker, we hear somebody utter words on the \nHouse floor, ``We must do something for the least of these.'' Truly \nunborn life is the least of these. So let's start tonight and hold life \nprecious.\n\n  Mr. DUFFY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, many of us have seen it, a recently \nsurfaced, horrifying video that provides evidence that Planned \nParenthood employees participate in the harvesting of fetal body parts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in absolute disgust. Not only is Planned \nParenthood profiting from abortions, but this video shows a top Planned \nParenthood executive discussing how best to procure and sell specific \norgans from these defenseless, aborted babies' bodies.\n  As a father and a grandfather, I find these acts unconscionable and \nbarbaric. We have a moral responsibility to ensure that these acts are \nfully investigated and that Planned Parenthood is held accountable for \ntheir actions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Fred Upton of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee and Chairman Bob Goodlatte of the Judiciary \nCommittee for taking immediate action and announcing their respective \ninvestigations into this horrific practice.\n  Mr. Speaker, I cannot fathom why taxpayers' hard-earned dollars are \nprovided to organizations that actively allow such gruesome practices \nto occur.\n  In 2013, abortions made up 94 percent of Planned Parenthood's so-\ncalled pregnancy services--94 percent. Prenatal care and adoptive \nreferrals accounted for only 5 percent and half, or 0.5 percent, \nrespectively. Yet taxpayer funding accounts for 41 percent of Planned \nParenthood's overall revenue.\n  We must act now to prevent even a single dime from going to \norganizations such as Planned Parenthood that flaunt such blatant \ndisregard for human life, and we need colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to step up and join us in this effort.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to one of the leaders on this \nissue, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend, \nCongressman Duffy, for leading this effort and leading this Special \nOrder today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my continued outrage at, now, \ntwo abhorrent videos that have been released in the last week in which \ntwo Planned Parenthood senior doctors describe the process by which \nthey and their coworkers kill unborn children and harvest their organs \nfor sale.\n  Like many Americans, I was shocked not only by what I learned about \nPlanned Parenthood's standard practices, but by the cold, callous \nindifference in which its medical leadership detailed the barbaric \nmurder of society's most vulnerable children.\n  In the United States, we provide protections for the least among us \nin numerous ways from medical research, to welfare programs, to \nhealthcare assistance; yet here, we stand on the floor of the United \nStates House of Representatives to discuss whether the sale of human \nbody parts harvested from aborted children violates basic human dignity \nand perhaps even the law.\n  Mr. Speaker, the question that strikes me today is not whether this \npractice is immoral or illegal--for surely no Member of Congress or of \nhumanity can, in good conscience, claim that we support these heinous \nactivities--instead, I am left considering what could we have done or \nperhaps what should we have done to protect women and innocent children \nfrom this outrageous practice. I am left to think what kind of Nation \nallows these heinous acts to continue.\n  We are the United States of America, a country founded on the belief \nthat each individual holds dignity and worth in the eyes of our \ncreator. If Planned Parenthood is discovered to have been altering \nabortion procedures so as to sell human baby hearts, livers, lungs, \nbrains, and other organs, then they have violated their own guidelines \nas well as Federal laws from partial-birth abortion to the sale of \nhuman organs. It will be up to Congress to intervene on behalf of the \nthousands of unborn children.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is clear to me that there is a prevailing attitude \ninside Planned Parenthood that is so disgusting, so horrifying, and so \ndisturbing that it warrants a congressional investigation and action.\n  I thank House leadership and our chairman for opening up this \ninvestigation and for following our request into this unconscionable \nactivity now.\n  I want to thank the Members of the Missouri State legislature, my own \nhome State of Missouri, who have committed to investigating Planned \nParenthood in the State of Missouri, assuring Missourians that our laws \nprohibit these unthinkable acts, and hold Planned Parenthood \naccountable for any wrongdoing.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a duty as elected Representatives to the United \nStates to stand up for the most vulnerable among us, to lend a voice to \nthe voiceless, and stand up for injustice. I will continue to fight for \nthe day when abortions and the atrocities associated with it are not \nonly illegal, but unthinkable.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's powerful \ncomments. She is right, we do need an investigation: Federal, State, \nFBI, and DOJ.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. \nBlack).\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, Planned Parenthood has blood on its hands. Over the last \nweek, we have seen multiple videos showing its employees brazenly \ndiscussing the harvesting of aborted babies' tissues and organs, but \nthe truth is Planned Parenthood's culture of depravity runs much deeper \nthan these couple of videos.\n  In my home State of Tennessee, Planned Parenthood, the supposed \nchampion of safe abortions, sued to overturn our State's informed \nconsent and mandatory licensing laws, measures that were put in place \nto protect women's health and safety.\n  When I authored an amendment to our State constitution allowing \nlegislators to reinstate these protections, Planned Parenthood ran an \nill-fated smear campaign attempting to confuse the facts and turn \nTennesseans against the measure.\n  You see, Planned Parenthood doesn't empower women; it deceives them \nat their most difficult and vulnerable moments. It values convenience \nover truth and profit over life. As a nurse, I have seen the big \nabortion industry's shameful tactics with my own eyes. That is why, for \n2 years now, I have sponsored the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition \nAct to address one of Planned Parenthood's largest government revenue \nstreams. I continue to urge passage of this legislation, but in light \nof these videos, we must take the fight a step further.\n  For these reasons, I have just introduced the Defund Planned \nParenthood Act of 2015, legislation that would enact an immediate \nmoratorium on all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood while Congress \ncarries out a full investigation.\n  I eagerly await the findings of this forthcoming investigation, but \ndo you know what, Mr. Speaker, no matter what it reveals, here is the \ntruth: Planned Parenthood has made a business out of destroying that \nwhich God\n\n[[Page H5321]]\n\nhas created. It performs over 327,000 abortions a year, all while \nreceiving roughly $500 million in annual funding from the taxpayer \ndollar.\n  The one-sided relationship between Planned Parenthood's ever-growing \nbank account and American taxpayers must be severed.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments and \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. \nFoxx), one of our House leadership team Members.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for \nyielding time and leading this Special Order.\n  I rise today to join my colleagues in bringing attention to \nallegations of serious misconduct by the country's largest abortion \nprovider, Planned Parenthood.\n  There are no words to properly convey my grief and deep disgust at \nthe cavalier way in which Dr. Deborah Nucatola details how she \nstrategically crushes the tiny bodies of innocent, unborn children in \norder to harvest and sell their organs.\n  Perhaps most disturbing is what Dr. Nucatola doesn't say. While she \narbitrarily assigns monetary values to the hearts, lungs, and livers of \nthese children, she recognizes no value in the lives of those being \naborted.\n  Mr. Speaker, I recently received a letter from a nurse who has \nassisted with abortions and witnessed firsthand the horrific nature of \nwhat that procedure entails. She told me that most women have no idea \nthat they are subjecting their unborn children to such ghastly methods.\n  Many of our colleagues in this House find it uncomfortable to talk \nabout the issue of abortion, and I agree that it is difficult to \nconsider and discuss these horrific practices, but the heinous nature \nof the methods used by Planned Parenthood is precisely why we, as a \nNation and as a Congress, must confront it.\n  These revelations merit a serious look at the practices of Planned \nParenthood, and I support fully the robust oversight and investigations \nbeing pursued by the House Judiciary and Energy and Commerce \nCommittees. It is my hope that their investigations will shed much-\nneeded light on the organization's gruesome methods and will lead to \nimportant reforms that end these practices and stop the flow of \ntaxpayer resources that support them.\n  Few things demean the sanctity of human life more than elective \nabortion. One day, I hope that a culture of life will take hold in the \nUnited States and that all children will be protected under the law. \nHowever, until that day comes, it remains my solemn duty to stand up \nfor life. Regardless of the length of this journey, I will continue to \nspeak for those who cannot.\n  Mr. DUFFY. We appreciate your voice being lent to the unborn.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. \nHerrera Beutler).\n  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  It is with a very heavy heart that I take to the floor today to speak \nout against what really I think anybody who saw it or witnessed the \nvideo or read the transcripts felt, which is outrage. For those of you \nwho were able to stomach watching these videos, you were left with many \nshocking questions about an organization that appears to callously \ncommodify human baby body parts.\n  The first video showed a senior Planned Parenthood official \ndescribing how to place medical forceps on a baby during an abortion in \norder to best harvest specific organs. She bartered over prices for \nthese little human parts. She did it over a casual lunch.\n  Sadly, there are voices that defend Planned Parenthood and its \npractices. They minimize this as an isolated innocent by one individual \nand sought to move on as quickly as possible; but then came, today, a \nsecond video, and we can only guess that there are more to come.\n  The likelihood that these are two isolated incidents with two \nindividuals that don't represent Planned Parenthood's values, but \napproach the business of selling body parts seemingly without feeling \nin the exact same way, I am not buying it.\n  I believe this body has a duty to investigate, regardless of where \nyou stand on pro-life or pro-choice. Given the history of Federal \nfunding to Planned Parenthood, we have to ask these questions: Is \nPlanned Parenthood profiting from the sale of human baby body parts? \nAre the clinics' patients being asked if they are willing to donate? Do \nthey know that the doctor who is performing their abortion could be \nprofiting? Do they know whether or not this increases pain for their \nunborn baby during an abortion? Are these facilities abiding by State \nlaws with regard to late-term and partial-birth abortions?\n  Gosh, I ask this because it sure seems like they want babies in the \nlater second and third trimesters because anybody who has been a mom or \nhas followed this journey knows that that is when organ development \nreally strengthens and grows.\n  If you are just trying to profit, you want the organ that is best \ngoing to function, whether it is for research or whatever. I think we \nneed to find out what they are even using this for. I want to know who \nis buying these baby parts. That is the other piece that this body \nneeds to investigate and find out.\n  Planned Parenthood has always purported to provide a necessary \nservice for women's health; but I ask: Is this even safe? How long does \nthis prolong a procedure? Is it really the motivation for their \npractices? Not if you follow the money--one of the doctors who was \ndescribing this, basically a harvesting doctor, joked she wants a \nLamborghini.\n  Like a lot of things, following the money does lead to answers, and \nthis body is going to find out. Clearly, Planned Parenthood doctors are \nreceiving and filling requests for hearts, lungs, lower extremities, \nand livers, a request that is unfortunately and apparently common.\n  I have never taken to the floor of this House to express outrage over \nthis issue, but today, I do, and it is time for answers.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I think America, with these videos, feels \nthat very same outrage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and I thank all of our \ncolleagues that are here to talk on this extraordinary issue that has \nstunned us all.\n  Last week, in the wake of the first video, Planned Parenthood \nresponded by forcefully and categorically denying that the organization \nsells body parts of aborted babies for profit. The tone of Dr. Deborah \nNucatola describing the way in which babies' organs are harvested and \nsold was unfortunate, they said, but there is nothing to see here.\n  Well, just this afternoon, as I was sitting on the plane to come back \nto Washington, I watched the second video that has been released, \nshowing a different senior official at Planned Parenthood discussing \nthe same thing.\n\n  Dr. Mary Gatter, president of Planned Parenthood's Federation of \nMedical Directors' Council is shown negotiating prices for the tissue \nand even joking about her poor negotiation abilities, but that she \nwanted to settle on the prices soon because she wants a Lamborghini.\n  Once again, the candid words of top Planned Parenthood officials \nbelieve the public spin on their PR teams--they felt like this was \nnecessary to get what they wanted in order to make a profit. What we \nhaven't heard from Planned Parenthood is a response to perhaps the \nbiggest revelation, that its providers alter abortion procedures in \norder to gain access, as my colleagues have already discussed in great \ndetail.\n  What I found really stunning about Dr. Mary Gatter's comments that \nshe made today is she discusses deliberately breaking the rules in \norder to obtain intact organs. She considers out loud on this video how \nto alter the abortion process to get intact baby organs. She said, We \nneed a less crunchy option--this is sick to hear those words come from \nmy mouth, that we need a less crunchy option when we are talking about \na baby; this violates their rules--she says, as long as we do it in a \nway that doesn't cause more pain.\n  These doctors sure sound like they know that there is a competitive \nblack market at play and are willing to engage in illegal activity to \ntap into it. This is sickening, and it will not go unaddressed.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  I said last week to my colleague--and I will say it again--that I do \nnot care\n\n[[Page H5322]]\n\nhow much weight Planned Parenthood throws around this town. They are \nnot above the law.\n  If Planned Parenthood really has nothing to hide, then these \nofficials will have no problem with a complete investigation. It is our \nresponsibility to protect those who cannot defend themselves and to \nstop illegal activity when we see it.\n  That certainly seems to be what is happening here, and I thank all of \nmy colleagues for standing up for the unborn.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think it is a good point to make that there should be \na set cost for these body parts. There should be costs of storing and \ntransporting, but there should be no extra cost, and there should be no \nnegotiation.\n  Yet, if there is a black market and if markets are demanding certain \nprices because they are making a profit off of it, you are going to \nmaybe have $30 for one and $100 for another based on the black market.\n  I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker).\n  Mr. WALKER. I thank Representative Duffy for his leadership on this \nmatter.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight I join my colleagues in speaking out against the \nbarbaric and heinous actions we all witnessed in an undercover video in \nwhich Planned Parenthood was caught selling the body parts of aborted \nchildren.\n  In 2013, Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions and received \nover a half billion dollars--$500 million--in taxpayer funding.\n  Ironically, it was in 2013 that President Obama became the only \nsitting President to ever address this organization. May I remind you \nthat it was at this address that the President made the decision to \ninvoke God's blessings on these hideous activities.\n  The mask is now coming off an organization that barters the very \nparts of a baby in a manner that most Americans find appalling.\n  So many of us here are parents. We have watched in awe at the \nultrasound images of our children. We have seen their little hearts \nbeat and have marveled at God's creation in how fearfully and \nwonderfully they are made.\n  How can we stand idly and not speak out for these lives, the very \nleast of these? That is why I have taken immediate action by joining in \na letter with several of my colleagues, speaking out against Planned \nParenthood's evil and depraved actions, and fully support a \ncongressional investigation into this organization.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Congresswoman Black's bill, \nthe Title X Abortion Provider Act. We must stop now these organizations \nfrom receiving a single taxpayer dollar through the Title X program.\n  I urge the Senate to act quickly to pass the House's legislation that \nensures no taxpayer dollars are used for abortions, H.R. 7, the No \nTaxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure \nAct of 2015.\n  May God give us continued courage to seek justice, to love mercy, and \nto speak out for those who cannot speak for themselves.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee \n(Mrs. Blackburn), one of the most powerful voices in the House, \nspecifically on the life issue.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman. And I thank the gentleman for \nhis leadership in organizing this hour.\n  Mr. Speaker, we come to the floor tonight as mothers and grandmothers \nand dads and granddads, and we come with such heavy hearts and with \nsuch a burden for what we have found out, for what we have seen, and \nfor what has been made public about Planned Parenthood.\n  I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I thought it was very interesting \nthat the head of Planned Parenthood came out this week and said, ``Oh, \nwe think there are more videos to come.''\n  That is because they know they have been caught, and they know they \nare guilty, and they know what they have done; but no amount of trying \nto go out and push it to the side is going to push this to the side.\n  That is why our committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, \nis taking up an investigation. We are already working on this.\n  We are pushing forward to get the witnesses before us and to exercise \nthe appropriate oversight that is there for us to do.\n  Planned Parenthood does get Federal taxpayer dollars. The problem is \nmoney is fungible. And when you see what has been carried out in these \nvideos--in their own words what they describe--you know how destructive \nthat process is.\n  As Mr. Walker just said, Planned Parenthood conducts over 300,000 \nabortions a year. They are the Nation's largest abortion provider. \nTheir focus is no longer family planning or women's health. It is \nabortion.\n  What we have found out is that, through this sector of their business \nthat is focused on abortion, they have now moved even further away, and \nthey are into selling body parts--harvesting and selling body parts.\n  We have heard the Members speak so eloquently to this, and I know, \nMr. Speaker, people can hear the emotion in our voices and in our \nhearts, because this is a subject you don't think about discussing on \nthe House floor, but it is one that has been left for us to oversee.\n  They talk about procuring these body parts. In their own words, they \ntalk about setting the price, negotiating, dealing with the tissue \nbrokers. These are the most abhorrent and inhumane statements and words \nand conduct.\n  The conduct and the demeanor of these individuals on those videotapes \ncannot be denied and the casual nature with which they discussed this, \nas if it is routine. It is an expected part of their business. That is \nwhy we are moving forward to investigate them. That is why we feel \nfunding should be restricted.\n  Over 65 percent of the American people, Mr. Speaker, are against the \nuse of taxpayer funds for abortion, and it is time for us to deal with, \nto hold accountable, to restrict, and to put some barriers around what \nhas been happening with Planned Parenthood. It is an investigation we \nwill pursue until we know the truth and have every element of truth.\n\n  Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentlewoman's wonderful comments.\n  When you talk about the casual nature, you talk about doing \nprocedures that are less crunchy. What are we talking about, less \ncrunchy? We are crunching human bones. That is what they are actually \nsaying in that videotape.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. We are talking about setting the price for this.\n  Mr. DUFFY. For crunching bones.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. It is just their routine nature. This was not the \nfirst time they had done this. In listening to them, that is made very \napparent.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am now proud to yield to the gentlewoman from North \nCarolina (Mrs. Ellmers), one of my good friends.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin \nfor holding this very important Special Order.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who are here today talking about this \nvery important issue.\n  It is not the first time that we have come together to talk about the \nimportance of protecting life, the lives of those who are yet to be \nborn.\n  I can't even begin to tell you how disgusted I am, how nauseous I am \nright now, that we are having this discussion about the sale of baby \nbody parts and that Planned Parenthood so values the organs of the \nunborn and, yet, so devalues the life of the unborn.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart in sharing these \nconcerns with my fellow colleagues. We now know about the two videos \nthat have been released, the first video showing the senior director of \nthe medical services at Planned Parenthood, who was bragging in \ngruesome detail of how this group harvests and sells fetal organs.\n  She described how they take particular care of the baby's organs. If \nonly this group were just as devout in showing so much care, time, and \nattention to the life of the baby.\n  In the second video are details of how the health of the mother is \npurposefully put in jeopardy to yield pristine, viable organs.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is sickening. This is all for a price, a price \nwhich is being negotiated. Regardless of whether you\n\n[[Page H5323]]\n\nare a pro-life individual or a pro-choice individual, you have to be \nabsolutely appalled at this.\n  As a nurse, a mother, and one who believes that the life of the yet \nto be born should be protected, I can't begin to understand how someone \ncan recount these appalling details in such a nonchalant manner unless \nthis has become routine.\n  As Representatives, it is our job to protect the rights of women. It \nis our job to protect the rights of the unborn. This horrific \nrevelation warrants a response from Congress, and I am proud to be on \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee to begin this investigation.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments, and I look \nforward to an aggressive investigation by the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).\n  Mr. GIBBS. I thank the gentleman for holding this Special Order \ntonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, last week millions of Americans saw the horrific video \nin which a top Planned Parenthood doctor detailed the gruesome nature \nof abortion procedures. Dr. Deborah Nucatola's casual conversation \nabout crushing the body of an unborn child is nothing short of \nbarbaric. What is worse is the negotiation of the price of the remains \nof the unborn child.\n  In a second video, which was released today, Dr. Mary Gatter \nnegotiates the price of fetal remains, discusses a ``less crunchy'' \nprocedure to preserve body parts, and jokes about needing to purchase a \nLamborghini from the profits of those organ sales.\n  But this is not a joke. Profiting from the sale of human organs is \nillegal and so is changing a procedure specifically for organ \nharvesting.\n  This is a terrible reminder of what an abortion really is, ending the \nlife of a child. If harvested organs are so valuable, how valuable is \nthe child? Is the value of a child's life not greater than the sum of \nhis or her parts? How long will we, as a Nation, continue to allow such \nheinous, despicable acts?\n  May these revelations on video serve as an opportunity for all \nAmericans to reflect on the precious nature of life and how we treat \nthe unborn, who are truly the most vulnerable and innocent among us.\n  I thank Speaker Boehner and the Judiciary and Energy and Commerce \nCommittees for opening investigations to determine what, if any, \nFederal laws were broken as a result of these awful practices.\n  The House must not provide any Federal funds to Planned Parenthood \nwhen they condone and profit from these actions.\n  I call on the President to denounce these practices, and I urge my \ncolleagues in the House to support the elimination of Federal funding \nfor Planned Parenthood.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I couldn't agree more with the gentleman from Ohio in \nregard to taxpayer funding being used for abortion.\n  I think so many Americans are outraged by Planned Parenthood and the \nabortions, but, now, specifically by these videos that have come to \nlight. I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his continued \nleadership on this critical matter of life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today sickened and angered by yet another report \nshowing what Planned Parenthood's limitless disregard for the unborn \nchild is.\n  Watching senior Planned Parenthood executives discuss the sale of \naborted babies' body parts while they casually dine is beyond \nrevolting. This callous barbarism should have no place in civilized \nsociety.\n  I am also troubled to have discovered that some of these abhorrent \ntransactions may have taken place in my home State of Colorado.\n  Reports surfaced last week revealing that Colorado State University \nappears to have violated State law by purchasing aborted baby body \nparts from a California affiliate of Planned Parenthood.\n  If true, these actions would appear to violate a law that was created \nby a bill that I introduced and that became law during my time in the \nColorado State Senate, a bill prohibiting the purchase of fetal tissue \nfrom an abortion.\n  I have sent a letter to the university and have demanded an \nexplanation. Further, I have provided a copy of the letter to Colorado \nAttorney General Cynthia Coffman, and I have urged her office to launch \na full investigation.\n  These troubling revelations exposing the monetization of fetal organs \nfurther demonstrate the need to fully defund Planned Parenthood.\n  It is unacceptable that we continue to force taxpayers to subsidize \nthis corrupt organization that disregards the dignity of human life \nwhile seeking to extract monetary gain from its destruction.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Mr. DUFFY. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), one \nof my colleagues on Financial Services, one of our chairmen who has \nbeen doing fantastic work and a champion for life.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. I, too, thank my friend and colleague from \nWisconsin for his leadership on this and so many others.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just wish the American people could be here on this \nfloor right now and feel the passion, the frustration--honestly, the \nanger. I especially want to address my female colleagues who have been \nhere and have had the courage to come and take a stand. That isn't \nalways done.\n  I think it was especially hard a little earlier as we were doing 1-\nminutes seeing a colleague, watching a 1-minute address from an \napologist of Planned Parenthood calling these horrors trumped up--\ntrumped up--disgusting, frankly. It is just amazing. This is one of the \nreasons why I voted, along with a number of my other colleagues, the \nvast majority of my colleagues on the Republican side, to defund \nPlanned Parenthood. Forty-one percent of their total revenue is \ntaxpayer dollars, $1.5 billion in 2011 to 2012.\n  We must never forget that we are not just talking about numbers on a \nspreadsheet. We are talking about unborn children, not lab specimens. \nWe are talking about human lives. We must continue to fight for every \nunborn child here just because of their intrinsic worth, not because of \na spreadsheet or some sort of price list that Planned Parenthood or any \nother organization has put together.\n  We must continue that fight, and especially when there are so many \nother options, that adoption option that is out there. When you see the \nwork being done by crisis pregnancy centers like in my area, the \nLakeshore Pregnancy Center, or the right-to-life organizations or any \nof those others that are out there in the trenches praying for, working \nfor not just those children but, frankly, the parents that may be \nmaking a bad decision.\n  We must continue to fight for the unborn here in Congress. I know I \npledge to do that; I know so many of my other colleagues do, too. We \nmust promote that culture of life and strong families in west Michigan, \nin this Nation, and around the world.\n  I would just like to again thank my colleagues for calling attention \nto this horrific, horrific act that has been going on.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. This debate has \nbeen going on for some time. Not long ago there was a debate between \nRick Santorum and now Senator Boxer, and during that debate Senator \nBoxer was talking about life beginning when you take your baby home \nfrom the hospital. I mean, some of the viewpoints on the other side are \nabsolutely outrageous. It just shows there is a lot of work to do.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) to talk \nabout this important issue.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for his leadership \nand hosting this Special Order tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is vital that we have this extremely important \nconversation concerning the unborn. While this topic is very difficult \nto discuss, it is something we must talk about and recognize in order \nto stop the unspeakable horrors currently taking place.\n  Last week and this morning, new videos were released detailing how \nPlanned Parenthood harvests and sells the body parts of aborted \nchildren. For decades, Planned Parenthood employees have tried to \ndiminish the humanity of the unborn by belittling them to blobs of \ntissue. However, this video is\n\n[[Page H5324]]\n\nevidence that Planned Parenthood knows that these are not simply blobs \nof tissue, but actual human beings that have tiny lungs, livers, and \nbeating hearts.\n  We need to get our priorities straight. In the video the Planned \nParenthood doctor callously describes altering abortion procedures by \ncrushing a baby's body in order to preserve certain organs for \nharvesting. She says: I am going to basically crush below; I am going \nto crush above.\n  This is human life we are talking about. We cannot stand by while \naborted baby parts are being sold for profit. This morning's video \nshows another Planned Parenthood doctor shamelessly haggling over the \nprice of aborted baby body parts. She discusses how the price could \nchange based on the volume and developmental stage of the aborted \nbabies.\n  While I am pleased that there are Federal and State investigations \nunderway, I believe more needs to be done. Planned Parenthood has \nreceived over $200 million in Federal funds since 2012. It is clear \nthat Planned Parenthood places profit--not women's health and safety--\nahead of all else, and they must be stopped.\n  I urge support for Congresswoman Black's legislation that prohibits \nall Federal funds to Planned Parenthood. Federal dollars cannot \ncontinue to flow to any entity that has such a blatant and heartless \ndisregard for human life.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentlewoman's powerful words.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I begin my prepared remarks, I want to say \nsomething to my mom, Jeanne Weber, in Pearland, Texas.\n  Mom, thanks for being pro-life. Thanks for cradling even the very \nthought of me in your heart and mind before I was conceived; and, Mom, \nthanks for cradling me in your womb and then later in your bosom and \nthen in your lap, and all my young years. I love you, Mom. Thank you.\n  Mr. Speaker, I cannot tell you how deeply disturbed I am by these \nvideos that have been unearthed showing employees of Planned Parenthood \nselling body parts of aborted babies.\n  It has long been my mission to fight against any organization that \nwill not protect the unborn. As a member of the Texas statehouse, I \nvoted alongside other Texas House conservatives to defund the Planned \nParenthood in Texas to ensure that taxpayer money would not be used on \nthese ghastly abortion procedures.\n\n  Now, as a Member of Congress, Mr. Speaker, I have fought alongside my \ncolleagues to protect the unborn and the sanctity of life. On May 13, \nthe House voted in strong support of my good friend Representative \nTrent Franks of Arizona's legislation, H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn \nChild Protection Act, a crucial piece of pro-life legislation that bans \nthe murder of babies who are at least 5 months old in the womb and can, \nindeed, feel the excruciating pain of dismemberment and a ghastly death \nthat Planned Parenthood would perpetrate on them.\n  In 2013, we saw the horror of Dr. Gosnell, and now we see the real \ndisturbing practices of Planned Parenthood and their black market sale \nof body parts of aborted babies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I only ask this: How can organizations put a price on \ntissues, limbs, and livers, and then not acknowledge that there is life \nat the time of conception? No price can be placed upon the worth of \nseeing a child born and take its first breath.\n  And, Dad, before I go, thank you for standing alongside Mom and being \npro-life. I love you both.\n  Mr. DUFFY. The gentleman's remarks were well said. Aren't we all \ngrateful that our parents were pro-life? It gives us a chance to be on \nthis floor and express our views.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), \nthe chair of our Conference but, more importantly, a mother.\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to join in expressing \nappreciation to Congressman Duffy, the gentleman from Wisconsin, for \nbringing us all together tonight on this very important issue and what \nhas recently been uncovered through the videos featuring senior level \nPlanned Parenthood officials admitting to unethical, potentially \nillegal procedures.\n  It is really unthinkable to most of us. It is unthinkable not just \nbecause of their cold, nonchalant attitude toward ``crunchy \nprocedures,'' but because these videos highlight that we have allowed \nthe debate on women's health to get horribly skewed. Anyone watching \nthese videos can say the American people must have answers.\n  This isn't women's health. This is an agenda. It is an agenda that is \ndriven by monetary gain, not the best interests of women. Abortion \nproviders should not get to hide behind the foil of health care to get \naway with unspeakable acts.\n  The practices described in these videos are despicable, and Planned \nParenthood must be held accountable. If a hospital were even allegedly \ninvolved in any kind of illegal activity, we wouldn't hesitate for a \nsecond to haul them before a committee. Abortion providers should be no \ndifferent.\n  Policymakers who are serious about protecting women and families \nshould be invested in getting to the bottom of these statements made by \nPlanned Parenthood. I applaud our committees for launching inquiries \ninto Planned Parenthood practices and procedures. The American people \nmust have answers.\n  Mr. DUFFY. Absolutely. I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman and appreciate his \nleadership in this Special Order.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand with my colleagues here tonight in \nmutual condemnation of Planned Parenthood and their horrific practices. \nLike so many others, I likewise have just been horrified, deeply \ndisturbed by the flippant comments made by an executive at Planned \nParenthood.\n  It is bad enough knowing that this organization performs over 300,000 \nabortions every year, but it is another whole matter to come to the \nrealization that they are also engaged in trafficking human baby parts. \nIt is absolutely unconscionable.\n  I believe that all life is sacred and needs to be protected. I \ncommend my colleagues for stepping up and calling for a congressional \ninvestigation against Planned Parenthood. I also say a huge thank you \nto Governor Deal from my own State for, likewise, calling for an \ninvestigation of Georgia to see that infant organs are not for sale in \nthat State.\n  Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. It is time that Planned Parenthood be \nheld accountable for these despicable acts.\n  I again just say thank you, and I am honored to stand with my \ncolleagues here this evening as we stand for life; and at the same time \nthat we try to prevent these abysmal practices from marring our \ncollective consciences, I plan to continue to champion life. It is just \nabhorrent that there would be any organization trying to make a profit, \nan industry for profit out of the sale and trafficking of baby human \nparts.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I yield to the gentleman from Texas, Dr. Babin.\n  Mr. BABIN. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my outrage over the recent disclosures \nof Planned Parenthood's deliberate efforts to harvest tissue from \naborted babies. The practices described by Planned Parenthood officials \non these videos are simply despicable, unspeakable, and barbaric. The \nlighthearted tone of Dr. Deborah Nucatola, the Senior Director of \nMedical Services for Planned Parenthood, as she talked about how much \nfetal tissue parts were worth while eating salad and drinking wine only \nadds words of insult to this atrocity.\n  A video released just today shows Dr. Mary Gatter, another high-\nranking Planned Parenthood official, again discussing fetal tissue \npayments. Gatter describes using a less crunchy technique to yield as \nmuch and many body parts as possible for more money to buy herself a \nLamborghini. This is inhumane. As a health provider myself, I condemn \nit in the strongest terms. I hope the relevant medical licensing boards \nin their States disqualify her and Dr. Nucatola from ever practicing \nmedicine again.\n  It is a national disgrace that taxpayer dollars account for 41 \npercent of Planned Parenthood's revenue and that\n\n[[Page H5325]]\n\nover the past 3 years the organization has received $1.2 billion in \nfunding from Medicaid. All of this for an organization that performs \nmore than 300,000 abortions a year. American families should not be \nforced to pay the operating costs and salaries for abortion businesses, \nmuch less one that engages in fetal tissue trafficking.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  As an original cosponsor of Representative Black's Defund Planned \nParenthood Act, we are working to prohibit Federal funds from going to \nPlanned Parenthood or any entity that performs abortions. I call upon \nthe House and the Senate leaders to allow for its immediate \nconsideration and attach it to any must-pass bill.\n  I would like to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin and all of my \ncolleagues who are here tonight to speak on this important issue--and \nthe millions of Americans who are leading this effort in all 50 States. \nMay God bless all of you.\n  Mr. DUFFY. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold) for a \nfew comments on this important issue of life.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to insist Congress stop the \nimmoral and monstrous action being taken by Planned Parenthood in any \nway possible, and that includes making sure no more Federal dollars go \nto this organization.\n  Today, we learned about a second video from yet another Planned \nParenthood senior official who was recorded haggling over the price of \nbody parts from murdered children and bumping up the price while joking \nshe needed a new Lamborghini. It is disgusting.\n  The first video, leaked on July 14, showed Planned Parenthood's \npractice of aborting babies and selling their organs. This behavior \nviolates every moral and ethical code that I can think of.\n  I was disgusted by the video showing a senior official enjoy lunch \nwhile discussing how easy it is to kill a child by crushing their heads \nin order to harvest the fetal organs.\n  We must do more to create a culture that embraces life. If you are \npregnant and seeking family planning services from Planned Parenthood, \nyou are 42 times more likely to receive an abortion than prenatal care \nor an adoption referral.\n  This isn't about women's health. It is about feeding an abortion \nmill. To me, it is unbelievable that taxpayer dollars continue to \nsupport this evil organization. Planned Parenthood's entire business \nmodel is centered around providing abortions, not giving quality \nmedical care to women who need it.\n  According to the Susan B. Anthony List, Planned Parenthood Clinic \nDirector Abby Johnson has written that she was given an ``abortion \nquota'' and was even told by her superiors to double the number of \nabortions to bring in more revenue.\n  It is not just abortions that are offensive about this organization. \nPlanned Parenthood has also fought against mandatory reporting when \nthey discover children are being sexually abused. Employees have \nacknowledged aiding and abetting human sex trafficking of young girls \nunder the age of 14.\n  It is time we give those who need it better access to real women's \nhealth care. We must defund Planned Parenthood now and use that funding \nto assist women who need real health care.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have been talking about this too long. It is time to \nstop supporting a group who callously murders innocent and helpless \nchildren and sells their organs and calls it reproductive health care.\n  Mr. DUFFY. As we are about to close this hour, we have had a chance \nto hear from so many members of the House Conference who have spoken \nout on behalf of the unborn, those little babies that don't have a \nvoice to speak for themselves, and I know in the next half hour we are \ngoing to have Mr. Franks from Arizona continue this conversation with \nso many more of our members who want to be heard on this important \ntopic.\n  I just want to close with this. The Democrats talk so often about \nwhat big hearts they have. They talk about how compassionate they are \nfor their brothers and sisters and their neighborhoods. The bottom line \nis, when you watch these videos and you see the harvesting of organs, \nthe pain of little babies, I call on my friends across the aisle to \nshow that compassion for the unborn and those voiceless little ones who \nneed a voice to stand up for them and defend them at this very \nimportant time.\n  There has been a time in our past, Mr. Speaker, where powerful people \ndetermined that there was a class that was less than human, and it is a \nblack spot on our history.\n  Today, there is a group in this House that has advocated that there \nis a class in this country that is less than human. Yes, they may not \nhave a voice, but that does not make them less than human. And I am so \nproud of our team for standing up today to make sure that we fight for \nthose people because they are not less than human. They deserve the \nright to life, and they deserve to have a defense.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/house-section/article/H5325-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5325-H5328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONDEMNING THE ACTIONS OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ratcliffe). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Franks) for 30 minutes.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and insert extraneous material on the topic of my Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I would first count it a \nprivilege to yield to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).\n  Mrs. NOEM. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on an issue that has weighed very \nheavy on my heart; in fact, it has kept me awake at night for many \nnights.\n  Two videos have recently come out showing senior Planned Parenthood \nexecutives and doctors callously discussing abortion procedures and the \ncosts of that fetal tissue from aborted babies.\n  It has turned my stomach to hear these people at Planned Parenthood. \nThey claim to act in the best interest of women, but instead they talk \nabout compensation for tiny organs from aborted babies.\n  I find myself asking: How did we get here? How did this great country \nthat was founded on Biblical principles get to a place where we have \nfederally funded organizations like Planned Parenthood who claim to \ncare for women and provide health care for them instead deceive people \nand use those dollars to end lives--end lives of our future women that \ncould potentially lead this country--and then turn around and sell \ntheir body parts to put even more dollars in their pocket?\n  It reminds me of the Edmund Burke quote that says: ``The only thing \nthat is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do \nnothing.''\n  And today, we have seen many good men and women come to this House \nfloor and say that we will not ``do nothing.'' We have pushed on this \nissue before, but we are going to push even harder. We are going to \ntalk even more. We are going to talk to people and have uncomfortable \nconversations about what is going on at Planned Parenthood.\n  We are going to fight until we end the Federal dollars that flow into \ntheir bank accounts. We are going to fight until we make sure that our \nbabies and our children are protected, whether they are born or unborn, \nand that every life is sacred; that we honor those Biblical principles \nthat this country was founded on.\n  Not only is what Planned Parenthood has been doing disgusting, but it \nraises questions about potential illegal behavior. Profiting from fetal \ntissue donation is illegal under Federal law, and so is altering \nprocedures based on fetal tissue donation.\n  So I have joined many of my colleagues here in the House, and we have \nasked our leadership team for an immediate investigation into Planned \nParenthood and all of their practices. They need to be punished for \nwhat they have been doing.\n\n[[Page H5326]]\n\n  All lives matter, including the unborn. We need to do all we can to \nprotect the most vulnerable among us.\n  The world can be a very dangerous place, and it is dangerous because \nof the evil that is going on, but I believe it is much more dangerous \nwhen you have people who look on and do absolutely nothing to protect \nthose among us.\n  The duplicity of this organization needs to stop; and as long as \nFederal dollars flow to this organization, we all need to feel \nresponsible and do all that we can to end it.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, as profoundly tragic as it is, no one should have been \nsurprised by the recent revelations that Planned Parenthood is \nharvesting and selling the body parts of little babies. They have so \nrepeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity. They \nhave always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in \nhuman history, and Planned Parenthood is the number one advocate of \nkilling more than 3,000 little unborn American babies every day. These \nrecent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the \nNation's largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard \nfor the sanctity of innocent human life.\n  It beggars incredulity that this Congress continues to give hundreds \nof millions of dollars of taxpayer money--against the taxpayers' \nwishes, Mr. Speaker--to a heartless organization like Planned \nParenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing \nof innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time \nthroughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason.\n  This body recently passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection \nAct that would, except in rare circumstances, protect both mothers and \ntheir little pain-capable unborn babies entering their sixth month, Mr. \nSpeaker, of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of Planned \nParenthood and evil monsters like Kermit Gosnell.\n  If the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act had already been law, \nit would have saved the lives of thousands of late-term, pain-capable \nbabies every year, and it would have made it much harder for Planned \nParenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn \nchildren since they simply would not have had as many of the more \nmature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no question whatsoever that Planned Parenthood \nbrazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little \nbody parts. It is an unspeakable disgrace that the Obama Justice \nDepartment will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look \ninto these unconscionable acts, but if this Congress and the American \npeople now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious \nevil, we do so at our moral peril.\n  If the conscience of this Nation is to survive, it is now vital for \nthe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to become law. The House \nhas already passed this critically important and timely legislation. It \nis now time for the Senate to do the same. We must not let the \ncontinuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of \nkilling late-term, pain-capable babies and selling their body parts go \nunanswered.\n  Mr. Speaker, supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades \nto deny that unborn babies ever feel pain--even those, they say, at the \nbeginning of the sixth month of pregnancy--as if somehow the ability to \nfeel pain magically develops the very second the child is born.\n  Mr. Speaker, almost every other civilized nation on this Earth \nprotects pain-capable babies at this stage and at this age, and every \ncredible poll of the American people shows that they are overwhelmingly \nin favor of protecting these children. Yet we have given these little \nbabies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the \nprotection we have given farm animals under the Federal Humane \nSlaughter Act. It is a tragedy that beggars expression.\n  The voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little \nones as freedom of choice, especially the ones who profit from it, Mr. \nSpeaker, will be very shrill and loud. But when we hear those voices, \nwe should all remember the words of President Abraham Lincoln, when he \nsaid: ``Those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves; \nand, under a just God, can not long retain it.''\n  Mr. Speaker, for the sake of all of those who founded and built this \nNation and dreamed of what America could someday be, and for the sake \nof all those who since then have died in darkness so Americans can walk \nin the light of freedom, it is so very important that those of us who \nare privileged to be Members of this Congress pause from time to time \nand remind ourselves of why we are really all here.\n  Mr. Speaker, do we still hold these truths to be self-evident? Mr. \nLincoln called upon all of us, Mr. Speaker, to remember that \nmagnificent Declaration of Independence by America's Founding Fathers \nand ``their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the Divine \nimage and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on, and \ndegraded, and imbruted by its fellows.''\n  He reminded those he called posterity--that is us, Mr. Speaker--that \nwhen in some distant future some man, some factions, some interest, \nshould set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that ``their posterity''--that \nis us, Mr. Speaker, ``might look up again to the Declaration of \nIndependence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers \nbegan.''\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Thomas Jefferson, whose words marked the beginning of this Nation \nsaid:\n\n       The care of human life and its happiness and not its \n     destruction is the chief and only object of good government.\n\n  The phrase in the Fifth Amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution, \nMr. Speaker. It says:\n\n       No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property \n     without due process of law.\n\n  The 14th Amendment says:\n\n       No State shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the \n     equal protection of the laws.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of all Americans and their \nconstitutional rights, especially those who cannot protect themselves, \nis why we are really all here.\n  Mr. Speaker, not long ago, I heard Barack Obama speak very noble and \npoignant words that, whether he realizes it or not, apply so profoundly \nto this subject. Let me quote excerpted portions of his comments.\n  He said: ``This is our first task, caring for our children. It is our \nfirst job. If we don't get that right, we don't get anything right. \nThat is how, as a society, we will be judged.''\n  President Obama asked: ``Are we really prepared to say that we are \npowerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard? \nAre we prepared to say that such violence, visited on our children year \nafter year after year, is somehow the price of freedom?''\n  The President also said, ``Our journey is not complete until all our \nchildren are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm. That is \nour generation's task,'' he said, ``to make these words, these rights, \nthese values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness real for \nevery American.''\n  Mr. Speaker, never have I so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken \nby President Barack Obama as those I have just quoted.\n  How I wish Mr. Obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts \nand our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves, in the \ncore of our souls, why these words that should apply to all children \ncannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children. Are \nthere any children more vulnerable than little pain-capable babies \nbefore they are even born?\n  Mr. Speaker, it seems that, somehow, we are never quite so eloquent \nas when we decry the crimes of past generations; but, oh, how we often \nbecome so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the \nworst of atrocities in our own time.\n  As Americans, in the land of the free and the home of brave, we now \nlive in a day when monsters like Kermit Gosnell snip the spinal cords \nof born babies and Planned Parenthood that, for financial gain, uses \npartial-birth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of \ninnocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born.\n\n[[Page H5327]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, what we are doing to these little children, the least of \nthese, our little brothers and sisters, is real. The President knows \nthat, and all of us here know that in our hearts.\n  Medical science, regarding the development of unborn babies, \nbeginning at the sixth month of pregnancy, now demonstrates irrefutably \nthat they do, in fact, experience pain. Many of them cry and scream as \nthey are killed, but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal \ncords instead of air, we can't hear them.\n  It is the greatest human rights atrocity in the United States today, \nand for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while \nPlanned Parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered \nchildren is to desecrate everything that America was meant to be and \nfor those noble Americans who died to make it come to be.\n  Abraham Lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel, Mr. \nSpeaker, and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this \n     Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite \n     of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, \n     can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which \n     we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the last \n     generation.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, these are, indeed, days that will be considered in the \nannals of history and, I believe, in the councils of eternity itself. \nThis bloody shadow has loomed over America for too long.\n  It is time for the Senate to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child \nProtection Act because, in spite of all the political noise, protecting \nlittle pain-capable unborn children and their mothers is not a \nRepublican issue; it is not a Democrat issue; it is a test of our basic \nhumanity and who we are as a human family.\n  It is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up \nwith our technology. It is time for Members of the United States \nCongress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting \nthose who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here.\n  It is time for all Americans, Mr. Speaker, to open our eyes and our \nhearts to the humanity of these little unborn children of God and the \ninhumanity of what Planned Parenthood is doing to them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arizona (Mr. \nFranks) for yielding me time, but also your longtime steadfast, \nearnest, and passionate leadership on this issue. It is much needed, \nespecially in light of what we have seen this past week.\n  We hear the euphemisms, the terms that are used talking about the \nunborn humans, the unborn babies. We hear terms like cell masses, cell \nclumps, specimens, calvaria when referring to a baby's head. A \ncalvarium, is this even a term anybody in real life uses, especially \nwhen applied to an unborn baby's head? Is this a word that would apply \nto what ISIS does in beheading humans around the world?\n  We don't use euphemisms like that. Why would we apply this to the \nunborn? These euphemisms disappear when there is a value assigned to \nthe parts that can be harvested from the unborn. We hear descriptions \nof the techniques in this harvesting actually on the video that we have \nbeen hearing about and seeing, less crunchy techniques. The callousness \nof a terminology like that, less crunchy techniques, in order to \npreserve more parts for harvest.\n\n  Are we talking about cheese puffs here? No; yet that is how callous \nthis is. We talk about the price of parts in these videos. They have a \nvalue in this market they are talking about. Are we talking about cuts \nat a butchers' convention in pricing these parts? This is what it is \nlike.\n  It is unconscionable, Mr. Speaker, how callous, how base these terms \nare when we are talking about the unborn. We hear about how, for this \nprocess to happen, that consent is required. Well, who is being \nconsented on this? The unborn donor, do they have a say in this? \nObviously not.\n  Mr. Speaker, and for all Americans, this issue is now right out in \nfront of everyone in bright, vivid, bold, blood red colors for all to \nsee what the attitude is, what the modus operandi for Planned \nParenthood is and has been and will continue to be unless this body \ndoes something about it.\n  We are right to call for investigations to get to the bottom if there \nis criminal activity here of what we have seen and is alleged with \nthese videos. We are right to move forward with Mrs. Black's bill, \nshould these come true. Even beyond that, for years, the millions of \ndollars that have been given to this organization, Planned Parenthood, \nto do what they do, it is time to defund them.\n  It also is time to move on my colleague from Arizona Mr. Franks' \ncarefully crafted and obviously correct bill on the Pain-Capable Unborn \nChild Protection Act because what kind of a country are we, what kind \nof a society are we to continue to allow these things to happen and not \ntake action?\n  I call on the Senate to take that bill up and pass it and put it on \nthe President's desk, and he can explain to the American public his \nposition on this issue.\n  As we review, again, the grisly tactics of Planned Parenthood and \nothers that would do as they do and the recent criminal prosecution of \nKermit Gosnell--who isn't that much different than what we are talking \nabout right here--if we don't take action, then we should be ashamed \nbecause, for all of us, the Lord is watching what we do.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg), a grandfather, a father, and a lover of \nchildren.\n  Mr. WALBERG. I thank the gentleman for the opportunity tonight to \ntalk to this issue.\n  I, too, stand in full support of passage of the Pain-Capable Unborn \nChild Protection Act and ask the Senate to reach down deep into their \nconsciences, their hearts, their emotions.\n  So often, we don't talk about that on the floor of this august body, \nthe House of Representatives, but that is where it ought to flow \nbecause, indeed, we here, both in the House--the people's House--and \nthe Senate, were sent to represent people, people of a great nation, \npeople of a blessed nation, a nation that has honored the worth, the \npurpose, and the value of life itself since its inception.\n  We were formed of people with great ideals; great value; great \ncourage; and, indeed, formed with their blood given for the rights and \nfreedoms of all individuals. For us to concern ourselves with \nprotecting the most innocent among us, even those that are among us in \nthe womb, I think of my new granddaughter in the womb right now, in my \ndaughter's body, waiting for, in just a month and a half, the \nopportunity to breathe air itself and become a functioning human being \ncared for, growing and ultimately becoming all that God intended for \nher. I would say the same for any human being, born or unborn, that we \nmust protect.\n  Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the gentleman from Arizona for his \ncourage to push for this, with unwillingness to bend and bow under \nthose that would say: Oh, get over it; stop defending something that is \nindefensible.\n  I would say thank God for defending something that is totally \ndefensible.\n  As was mentioned earlier, we were founded on principles, principles \nthat were firm and correct. The Founders and Framers long understood \nthe power of truths versus human wisdom, truths and wisdom that said:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are \n     created equal and endowed by their Creator, by their Creator \n     with certain unalienable rights, among them the right to \n     life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  John Adams said, ``Our Constitution was made only for a moral and \nreligious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any \nother.''\n  And, indeed, what we have seen in videos in recent days, has \nevidenced that, when you step out of that moral principle, you go into \nthings unthinkable and grotesque.\n  It has been said that righteousness exalts a Nation, but sin is a \nreproach to any land. How could we not feel reproached in looking at \nvideos of a licensed doctor who is willing to take and sell body parts \nand to countenance pain as something that is just part of the process \nand to be totally unconsidered?\n\n[[Page H5328]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I spent a good deal of my early adult life in the \npulpit, ministering to people from an authority far greater than this \ngovernment or even this Constitution, the greatest document on the face \nof this Earth, manmade.\n  But the psalmists said, ``Behold, children are a gift of the Lord. \nThe fruit of the womb is a reward.'' That is true. Certain commentators \nwill denigrate me for bringing up these truths, and so be it. But they \nare truths.\n  Jeremiah, the prophet, speaking of God, said, ``Before I formed you \nin the womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I set you apart.''\n  The psalmist David, who became King David, said, ``For you formed my \ninward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb.''\n  Does that sound like what that doctor was doing in the womb, weaving, \ncarefully forming? No. She was destroying. We must fight back against \nthat evil.\n  He want on to say, ``I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully \nand wonderfully made. Wonderful are Your works, and my soul knows it \nvery well. My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret \nand skillfully wrought in the depths of the Earth. Your eyes have seen \nmy unformed substance. And in Your book were all written the days that \nwere ordained for me when, as yet, there was not one of them.''\n  I thank the gentleman from Arizona. I thank him for his courage and \nstanding for life itself and acknowledging the fact that the Creator \nhas formed something of greatness.\n  And we must not stand in the way, but do everything possible to \nreject the pain, to reject the defeat, to reject the conquering of the \nhuman spirit beginning right in the womb.\n  May God help us in this country to repent, to seek his healing, to do \nright, and to spare the innocent among us.\n  Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. Speaker, my time is nearly gone. And I suppose I take great heart \nfrom what I have heard here tonight because it seems to mirror history \nitself.\n  When people of goodwill finally saw the victims in tragedies and \nrecognized them as fellow human beings, their hearts and minds began to \nchange.\n  Mr. Speaker, I feel like the winds of change are beginning to blow \nhere. I feel like people are starting to ask the real questions.\n  And I know that, when we talk about abortion, it seems like all of \nthe rules change. Sometimes you wonder if the furniture is going to \nstart floating in the room when you hear some of the arguments.\n  But the real question is: Does abortion take the life of an innocent \nchild? If it doesn't, Mr. Speaker, I am willing to stop talking about \nit.\n  But if it really does take the life of a child, then those of us in \nthis Chamber standing in the seat of freedom of the greatest Nation in \nthe history of the world also stand in the midst of the greatest human \ngenocide in the history of the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I feel like America is finally beginning to see through \nsome of the facade of the abortion industry and Planned Parenthood's \nobfuscation.\n  But I have another fear, and that is that sometimes we have seen such \nhorrors lately--the Kermit Gosnell clinic that snipped little babies' \nspines, the killing of children that are late-term, pain-capable--that \nrecognition is beginning to seep through the conscience of America.\n  But I paraphrase an old saint quote that said vice is an evil which \nis so frightening and mean that to be hated means only to be seen, but \nseen too often with its familiar face, first we endure and then we pity \nand then we embrace.\n  One of the great weaknesses of mankind is that sometimes, when we see \nevil often enough, we become desensitized to it. Planned Parenthood and \nthe abortion industry has shown us so much evil in recent decades that \nI wonder if we are becoming a little calloused to it.\n  Do you ever wonder, Mr. Speaker, or ask yourself: Are we really \nkilling more than 3,000 unborn children every day? Are we really \nstaining the very foundations of this Nation with the blood of our own \nchildren?
