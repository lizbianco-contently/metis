The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today is primary day in the Mid-Atlantic \nand Northeast States, the so-called Acela Primary, the five States all \nserved by Amtrak.\n  Fortunately, we are going to get a break, briefly, from a primary \nseason that is truly cringe-worthy.\n  But for hundreds of people who were privileged to watch high school \nstudents from across America participate in the We the People \nconstitutional competition, there is hope.\n  These teenage scholars, most not old enough to vote or to drive, \ncompete in a contest demonstrating their knowledge of the Constitution \nand democratic principles as well as their ability to think on their \nfeet.\n  At a time when civics education doesn't appear to be a priority for \nmost of American education, this shows the appetite and the capacity to \nfill that gap.\n  I have more than a little hometown pride in this undertaking. The \nClassroom Law Project has been a priority of my family for years and \ncontinues to be so.\n  For the last 4 years, two public high schools in Portland, Oregon, \nhave alternated the National Championship, with Lincoln High School \nfinishing first in 2012 and 2014 and Grant High School in Portland \nwinning the national trophy in 2013 and 2015.\n  This year Oregon was able to send both teams to the national finals, \nand the pattern continued, as Lincoln won its third trophy in 5 years \nand Grant, given an opportunity to compete, finished third, an \nunprecedented accomplishment for one town's high schools.\n  This amazing success speaks to the dedication of the young scholars \nand the amazing support of their families that was evident in the \ncompetition, the finals of which were held here in our Nation's \nCapital.\n  Both teams have a core of volunteer coaches who are lawyers and \njudges, citizens who focus on these kids and civics. They care deeply.\n  Having watched one of these young scholars several years ago in our \nhousehold, I can testify to the intensity, the depth, and the passion \nfor the Constitution and for our government.\n  Time doesn't permit me to recognize all these outstanding young \npeople and their mentors, the team that brought them here, but I must \nacknowledge the presence and advocacy of Peyton Chapman, the principal \nof Lincoln High School, their main coach, Steve Griffith, \nrepresentative of all these amazing adults who invest so much in the \nyoung people, and Instructor George Ten Eych, because all of these \nprograms rely on a dedicated professional in the classroom to make it \nhappen.\n  I had an opportunity on the floor of the House to meet with both of \nthese teams late last week. Listening to their comments and questions, \nI celebrated their insights and hard work, their commitment, even as I \nwish we could have all of them on the floor of this House to elevate \nthe discussion and deliberation, and I think they would add, frankly, \nto the decisionmaking.\n  But until their time will come--and it can't come soon enough--in the \nmeantime, we celebrate five consecutive National Championships for two \npublic high schools in Portland, Oregon.\n  Congratulations, Lincoln Cardinals, on your championship, and Grant \nHigh School, finishing third. Together, you have dominated this elite \ncompetition for 5 consecutive years.\n  Congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1947-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1947-H1948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL DRUG TAKE-BACK DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, many people have unneeded \nor expired medications in their medicine cabinets. It can be hard to \nknow how to dispose of these medications properly.\n  On Saturday, April 30, we have an opportunity to safely dispose of \nunused, expired, or unwanted prescription medications. Saturday is \nNational\n\n[[Page H1948]]\n\nDrug Take-Back Day, where you can take medicines to an official drop-\noff site to have them disposed of responsibly.\n  This is a no-questions-asked chance to clean out your medicine \ncabinets and improve the safety of your own homes.\n  West Virginia and this Nation are in the grips of a drug epidemic, \nand it will take all of us working together to solve this problem. Each \none of us can do our part. While it may seem like something small, \nsafely disposing of unused medicines and medications is one of these \nmeasures.\n  Drug Take-Back Day is a chance for our communities to come together \nand show that we are united in combating the drug epidemic. Small \nefforts can make a huge difference.\n  Please go to DEA.gov and find a local Drug Take-Back Day location \nnear you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1948-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under his strong \nleadership, the district had many achievements, including ranking among \nthe top 15 percent in the State for reading and math scores.\n  As a testament to Dr. Behle's hard work, the school board reluctantly \naccepted his resignation before making the statement: ``This is a great \nloss to the district, and if at any point you change your mind, don't \nhesitate to let us know.''\n  His service to our community will surely be missed, and we thank him \nfor his years of commitment to generations of St. Michael-Albertville \nstudents and their parents.\n  Enjoy your retirement, Dr. Behle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1948-7", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FLINT, MICHIGAN\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, so far this House of Representatives has \ndone nothing to help the people of my hometown of Flint, Michigan. I \nleft Flint this morning, and I left behind a city of 100,000 people who \nfor 2 years now have not been able to drink the water coming out of \ntheir tap.\n  It is a disaster, it is a public health crisis, and it demands a \nresponse not just from the State government, which clearly is \nprincipally responsible for what happened. The people of my hometown \nare American citizens and have a right to have their national \ngovernment, the Federal Government, step in and help them in the moment \nof their greatest need.\n  This is the job of the United States Congress. We have legislation \nthat would provide relief to the people of Flint rather than arguing \nover blame. That will come in time. There has been plenty of time \ndevoted to that subject.\n  The legislation that I offer would have the Federal Government and \nthe State government equally share in the cost of putting this \ncommunity back together and getting the people in Flint, Michigan, \nsomething that every American ought to be able to get up in the morning \nand take for granted, and that is that the water they drink is clean, \nsafe, and will not make them sick. It is time for this House to act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1948-8", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE CYBERKIDS PROGRAM AT BETHLEHEM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. FOXX.

I had the honor of signing the legislation, and \nthe students held a mock press conference to discuss the new law.\n  The aptitude these students showed during my visit was impressive and \ninspiring, and I commend everyone involved in this innovative \neducational program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1948-9", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2016.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GARRETT. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4096, the Investor \nClarity and Bank Parity Act. I want to thank the primary sponsors of \nthe legislation--the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) and the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers)--for their work in bringing this very \ntechnical, yet needed, legislation to the floor of the House today.\n  Mr. Speaker, during this time of divided government, it may come as a \nsurprise to some that the Committee on Financial Services has generated \na significant amount of bipartisan legislation since the beginning of \n2015. In fact, this Congress our committee has approved over 70 bills, \nwith the vast majority of these receiving bipartisan support, and in \nmany cases unanimous support.\n  I am pleased that we are able to bring to the floor today a number of \nbills that received the backing of both Republicans and Democrats out \nof our committee. One of these bills is the Investor Clarity and Bank \nParity Act, which passed out of the committee by a voice vote.\n  What does that bill do?\n  Well, this bill corrects a statutory error made in section 619 of \nDodd-Frank, more commonly known as the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule \nlimited the ability of bank holding companies or their affiliates to \ninvest in hedge funds or private equity funds, collectively known as \ncovered funds.\n  Now, we had a number of debates in our committee as to the general \nwisdom of the Volcker Rule and whether it actually reduces systemic \nrisk and protects taxpayers or not. I think one thing we can all agree \non is that so long as section 619 is the law of the land, Congress \nshould do what it can to limit any negative and unintended consequences \nof the Volcker Rule.\n  Because of the way that Dodd-Frank was drafted, a bank or one of its \naffiliates was prohibited from sharing its name with a covered fund \nthat it was invested in. By disallowing a covered fund to share a name \nwith the sponsoring entity, this provision of the Volcker Rule could \nactually lead to more and widespread investor confusion about who is \nactually managing the assets of that particular fund.\n  As Jeffrey Plunkett of Natixis Global Asset Management told our \nsubcommittee at a hearing back in February, he said: ``We believe that \ncompliance with the name-sharing prohibition of the Volcker Rule . . . \nrisks confusion among investors and burdens firms that are affiliated \nwith banks, leading to a lack of transparency for clients.''\n  So the fix envisioned here today in H.R. 4096 is really a simple one. \nIt allows a covered fund to share its name with a sponsoring entity in \norder to provide clarity and transparency to the investor.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4096.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I also rise to support H.R. 4096 for the exact reasons that Mr. \nGarrett just pointed out. I would like to be as clear as I can. I am a \nstrong proponent and supporter of the Volcker Rule, and I would not \nsupport anything that would undermine that rule. That is not what this \ndoes. This is simply a clarification of an item that was never \nintended. Even as a supporter of that rule, this is not the outcome we \nintended. It is simply to clarify naming abilities by certain entities.\n  I want to be also clear that nothing in this provision would allow \nsomething like the Bank of America Fund. You still cannot name it after \na bank. These are subsidiaries of some banks. In this particular case, \nNatixis happens to be located in my district. They are the ones who \nbrought this issue to my attention. They also happen to be affiliated \nwith Loomis Sayles.\n  Loomis Sayles is not a bank, but it is an affiliate of a bank. \nTherefore, Loomis Sayles would not be allowed to say this is a Loomis \nSayles item. They have to call it some funny name, ABCD Fund or \nwhatever it might be. That was never the intention of the Volcker Rule.\n  The Volcker Rule was to make sure that the finances of this country \nand this world are as stable as possible so that people couldn't have \nconflicts of interest and on and on and on. This is a technical \namendment, something that I strongly support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as the gentleman has yielded back, \nhas no other speakers, I don't believe that we have any other speakers \non this side of the aisle.\n  I will close by saying thank you to the gentleman for working with us \non this and a bunch of other legislation I also hope to bring to the \nfloor sooner rather than later. I encourage Members on both sides of \nthe aisle to support this bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude any other extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5019, the Fair Access to \nInvestment Research Act of 2016. I want to thank the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill), who will be speaking in a little bit, for his \ndiligent work on this piece of legislation, as well as for his valued \nwork and his input that he has brought all\n\n[[Page H1951]]\n\nyear long to the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government \nSponsored Enterprises.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the most positive developments in our economy \nover the last several decades is what has been dubbed the \n``democratization'' of our capital markets. Because of the advances in \ntechnology and market competition, more Americans than ever have the \nability to take control of their own investments and have access to \nproducts that used to be reserved for the rich and the professionals.\n  The $200 trade has now become the $7 trade, and many investment funds \nhave become more cost-effective over the years as well. One of these \nproducts is the exchange-traded fund or the ETF.\n  What are ETFs?\n  Well, ETFs are securities made up of a basket of stocks or bonds and \nwhich trade over an exchange like an individual stock. Because of their \ndiversity and cost-effectiveness, they have become increasingly popular \nwith investors. In fact, ETFs now hold roughly $2 trillion in assets, \nand some 5.7 million households hold ETFs as part of their investment \nportfolio.\n  That being said, unfortunately, due to a longstanding technicality in \nsecurities law, there is a dearth of research on ETFs' availability to \ninvestors, depriving them of valuable information they need to make \ntheir informed decisions. The SEC, in the past, has provided safe \nharbors under securities law for brokers that provide research reports \nfor listed stocks or corporate debt.\n  Despite this and despite broad public support, the SEC has not \nprovided a similar safe harbor for ETF research reports. Because of \nthis, brokers are hesitant to publish reports out of fear for legal \naction either from the SEC or another private party.\n  So we have this today, the Fair Access to Investment Research Act, \nwhich would correct this anomaly by providing a safe harbor for ETFs \nsimilar to the ones that currently exist for equities or corporate \ndebt. This is a simple, yet much-needed, piece of legislation to help \ninvestors, particularly your mom-and-pop type investors, to understand \nmore about the products that they are putting their hard-earned money \ninto.\n  Again, I thank Mr. Hill not only for his work on this legislation \nbut, truly, for all the expertise and advice that he has brought to the \ncommittee this session.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Delaware (Mr. Carney), the primary Democratic sponsor of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. CARNEY. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Capuano) for yielding me this time. I would also \nlike to thank all those who have worked hard to improve this bill. I \nwould like to recognize and thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. \nHill) for introducing this legislation. I appreciate his continued \nwillingness to work with me on this important issue and to fine-tune \nthis bill to address concerns that we have heard, particularly from \nMembers on this side of the aisle.\n  The FAIR Act has a very simple purpose, to provide investors better \naccess to research on exchange-traded funds and other similar products. \nETFs are one of the fastest-growing investment vehicles in the market. \nNet assets in ETFs have grown from $102 billion in 2002 to $1.8 \ntrillion in 2014. The number of ETFs on the market has increased 23 \npercent over the same period of time, but compared to other asset \nclasses, there is limited research about them available. As interest in \nETFs continues to grow, we need to make sure that investors have access \nto reliable information on these funds and on their underlying \ninvestments.\n  The SEC has been looking at expanding a safe harbor for ETF research \nfor over 15 years, and every time this issue has come up before the \nSEC, it has received favorable feedback. In fact, during the \nSubcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises \nhearing, there was unanimous agreement among the witnesses--which is \nnot easy to come by in our subcommittee--that the SEC should promulgate \na rule providing a safe harbor for ETF research.\n  Since this legislation was originally introduced, a lot has gone into \nimproving it. We have worked very closely with Ranking Member Waters, \nthe SEC, and FINRA to ensure this legislation does what it is intended \nto do. We have taken their suggestions to improve numerous provisions \nof the bill, and I want to thank Mr. Hill again for his flexibility in \ndoing that.\n  This new version reflects a year of collaboration among Democrats, \nRepublicans, and the regulators. The finished product is a clarified, \nmore effective version of the original bill. I am proud to say I \nbelieve that we have arrived at an agreement that works for everyone.\n  Again, I would like to thank Mr. Hill for his leadership on this \nissue. I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his \nleadership of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government \nSponsored Enterprises. I appreciate greatly the kind comments, \nsponsorship, and good work of my friend, the gentleman from Delaware \n(Mr. Carney).\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 5019, the FAIR Act, Fair \nAccess to Investment Research Act. This bill is similar to a bill that \nI introduced with Mr. Carney that passed the House as a part of H.R. \n1675 and passed our committee by a strong bipartisan vote.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  As my friend from Delaware said, we have worked diligently to improve \nthis legislation and we have worked carefully with our colleagues in \nthe minority to make sure that this bill fully represents the \nbipartisan consensus on the intent of the FAIR Act.\n  This bill is very simple: it allows broker-dealers involved in a \ndistribution to issue research reports on the rapidly growing medium of \nthe exchange-traded funds, or the ETF, market.\n  Since I started my most recent investment firm in the late 1990s, I \nhave personally seen the ETF market grow from about 100 funds and $100 \nbillion in assets to over 1,400 funds and nearly $2 trillion in assets. \nAnd some reports predict an additional $1 trillion might shift into \nETFs should the Department of Labor's recent fiduciary rule actually go \ninto effect.\n  Further, today's ETFs frequently are more complicated and require \nmore analysis on the part of investors. Yet despite their rapid \nappreciation and growth in popularity and increasing importance to \nretail investors, most broker-dealers do not publish research on ETFs \ndue to anomalies in the securities laws and regulations that Mr. \nGarrett so ably discussed.\n  Throughout this process, there has been essentially universal support \nfor increasing investor knowledge and access to information on ETFs--\nthat a safe harbor in this regard simply makes good sense.\n  As Mr. Carney said, this issue is not unfamiliar to the Commission, \nas it has been raised both to the SEC and by the SEC several times over \nthe past 17 years, most recently in 2004.\n  As a part of its Securities Offering Reform proposal, the Commission \nrequested comment on whether ``reliance on proposed rule 139 should be \npermitted if the issuer is an open-end management investment company or \nother investment company.'' The comments were universally supported, \nbut the rule was never adopted.\n  Given the importance of ETFs to today's market, steps to facilitate \nresearch and allow investors access to this useful information is long \noverdue.\n  The FAIR Act directs the SEC to provide a safe harbor for research \nreports that cover ETFs so that these reports are not considered \n``offers'' under section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. This mirrors \nother research safe harbors implemented by the SEC for other \ncategories.\n  The bill also helps the SEC organize, in my view, its ``50 front \nburners'' and holds it accountable to follow Congress' direction by \nrequiring the Commission to finalize rules within 180 days or an \ninterim safe harbor will take effect until the rule is proposed and \nfinalized. With close to 6 million U.S. households holding ETFs, \ninvestors need access to this research to be\n\n[[Page H1952]]\n\nbetter informed and make better long-term investment decisions.\n  Again, I would like to thank the chairman, Mr. Carney; Mrs. Maloney, \nthe ranking member; and all of the staff on both the majority and \nminority side for working to develop this commonsense proposal to \nprovide more information to American investors. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support this commonsense bill.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, having no further speakers at this time and \nappreciating the fact that this prioritizes the 50 front burners at the \nSEC, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 5019.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Ross) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Providing American homeowners and businessowners more affordable \nconsumer options in the flood insurance marketplace has been one of my \ntop priorities since I was elected to Congress to represent central \nFlorida and the Tampa Bay region in our Nation's Capital. Private \ncompetition in this market will lead to greater innovation and more \naffordable and comprehensive policies for consumers.\n  We have seen numerous floods devastating communities across the \ncountry in recent years, most recently in Houston, and last August in \nmy very own congressional district. Every State and every congressional \ndistrict is at risk for flooding. With hurricane season just a few \nweeks away from beginning, it is time for Congress to take action to \nbenefit and better protect consumers.\n  Unfortunately, regulatory barriers and the bias of regulators \nfavoring National Flood Insurance Program policies have prevented the \ndevelopment of a private flood insurance marketplace. This was not the \nintention of the Biggert-Waters Act. Rather, it was an unintended \nconsequence.\n  With that in mind, I worked with my colleague from across the aisle, \nRepresentative Patrick Murphy, to introduce H.R. 2901, the Flood \nInsurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation will remove the unnecessary regulatory barriers and require \nFederal agencies to accept private flood insurance that complies with \nthe laws and regulations of the State of an insured property.\n  Under current law, consumers are limited to the coverage options \nprovided by the NFIP. For example, an NFIP policy only covers up to \n$250,000 of damages related to a residential home. In addition, an NFIP \npolicy does not cover a homeowner's living expenses, such as temporary \nhousing, if they are displaced as a result of a flood. In the case of a \nbusiness, an NFIP policy does not provide coverage for the financial \nlosses suffered by businesses as a result of a flood.\n  While the NFIP is limited in what their policies can cover, the \nprivate sector is not. The private sector will provide more incentives \nfor property owners to invest in mitigation and resiliency. Ultimately, \nthis increased emphasis on mitigation will benefit homeowners and \ntaxpayers alike. Studies have shown that, for every $1 of investment in \nmitigation, communities see a savings of up to $4 in government-funded \ndisaster relief.\n  I want to take a moment and thank Chairman Hensarling and my \nsubcommittee chair, Blaine Luetkemeyer, for their support of this \nlegislation and their leadership on this important issue. I also want \nto thank the ranking member, Maxine Waters, for working with my staff \nand me through this entire process.\n  This legislation is supported by a number of stakeholders, from the \nRealtors, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, to a \nbroad coalition of taxpayer advocates, environmental groups, housing \norganizations, and mitigation advocates.\n  On March 2, 2016, the legislation passed out of the House Financial \nServices Committee by a vote of 53-0. With such strong bipartisan \nsupport, I am encouraged Congress is taking such an important step on \nbehalf of consumers not only in Florida, but across the country.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in passing \nthis commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will encourage the \nexpansion of a well-regulated, more affordable private flood insurance \noption for homeowners.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 2901, and I want to \ncongratulate Mr. Ross and Mr. Murphy for coming up with a piece of \nbipartisan legislation.\n  I want to be clear that the issues surrounding flood insurance are \ndifficult and complicated, and there are differences of opinion as to \nhow much of a role private insurance can play. This bill threads that \nneedle.\n  This bill says we all agree that there is more role for private \ninsurance and we should remove any barriers that might be there so that \npeople can be better served and have better competition. I think this \nbill does a pretty good job doing that.\n  I don't think private insurance is ever going to--I am not sure that \nis possible, but it is a different debate--take the place of national \nflood insurance. And we are working on that. Mr. Ross has been a great \nleader on that, as has Mr. Murphy. I want to thank them and \ncongratulate them, and I look forward to working with them further to \ndo more as we move forward.\n  This particular bill is one good step in the right direction, and I \nwant to congratulate the two authors and thank them for their \nleadership. I look forward to supporting this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce).\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation, \nthe Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act.\n  Since its inception back in 1968, the National Flood Insurance \nProgram was never intended to cover policies that the private sector \nwas able and willing to underwrite. In fact, one stated goal for the \nprogram was ``the Federal Government would create an opportunity for \nprivate industry to obtain . . . experience in operating a flood \ninsurance program . . . and that sometime in the future, the program \ncould become an all-private program.''\n\n  Nearly 50 years have passed and, to no one's surprise, private sector \nflood insurance risk modeling and analytics have dramatically improved.\n  While this House may not be ready to take up complete privatization, \nit is time to provide a role for the private market to underwrite \nprimary flood insurance policies. Passage of this bipartisan bill means \nmore consumer choice, more market competition, and more product \ninformation. Consumers, for the first time, will be able to shop for a \nflood policy that fits their particular needs.\n  This bill also has the added benefit of decreasing the aggregate \nflood insurance exposure to the Federal Government and decreasing the \npotential for a future taxpayer-backed bailout, which is very, very \nimportant.\n  So I commend both gentlemen for their work on this important issue, \nand\n\n[[Page H1954]]\n\nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), my good friend.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for \nyielding time to me.\n  You might wonder: Why is someone from New Mexico even speaking about \nflood insurance problems? We get about 9 inches of rain a year in my \ndistrict. Also, it is the high desert. They call it that because we \nbegin at around 3,500 feet of elevation and work up from there.\n  The way the National Flood Insurance Program has worked out in the \npast is that people are required, because they happen to be in a flood \nplain--and we are not dealing with whether or not they should be in a \nflood plain; we are dealing with the fact that they get no competitive \nbids--to only get the one government-size bid. And that is never very \nfunctional.\n  So the most egregious circumstance that exists is one that one of my \nconstituents mentioned. He said: I live at the top of a 7,000-foot \nmountain. The water is down here at about 4,000 feet, 3,000 feet below \nme, and I have to buy flood insurance.\n  Well, the fact that he has to buy flood insurance is egregious \nenough, but the fact that he has to live and pay premiums based on the \nactuary standards that might exist in Florida is the egregious part. \nWhat it does is keeps houses from selling and people from being able to \nbuy houses in New Mexico because they have been defined as being in a \nflood plain.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  If the market were out there, there would be companies that say: \nWait. That guy is never going to flood. I can charge him a minute \namount and still make money on his policy.\n  Yet, nothing like that exists. So we find ourselves paying to the \nsame standards as the people in Florida pay when we get 9 inches of \nrain a year.\n  So I really appreciate the gentleman's attempt to bring some \ncompetition into the workplace. I appreciate Mr. Capuano's support of \nthe bill, Mr. Murphy's underlying co-sponsorship.\n  I am here to support heartily H.R. 2901, the Flood Insurance Market \nParity and Modernization Act.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, you learn something new every day. I am one \nof those people. I never expected a guy from New Mexico to be speaking \non the flood insurance bill.\n  I thank Mr. Pearce for educating me even further.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Capuano) for his efforts and leadership in this \nregard.\n  Look, this isn't the be-all-to-end-all, but it is the best first step \nthat we can have as a Congress to make sure that we give our consumers \naffordable options in flood insurance.\n  As we address the reauthorization of the Biggert-Waters Act next \nyear, this will provide a bridge for bringing the private sector back \ninto the market to show that they are willing to assume some of this \nrisk to the benefit of the consumers.\n  There are quite a few groups out there that support this particular \nlegislation. To name a few, that includes the Reinsurance Association \nof America, National Multifamily Housing Council, National Apartment \nAssociation, National Taxpayers Union, American Insurance Association, \nNational Association of Realtors, Mortgage Bankers Association, and R \nStreet.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join \nus and overwhelmingly pass this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hill). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) that the House suspend \nthe rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2901, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1954-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1954-H1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. GIBBS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on H.R. 223, as amended.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to bring up H.R. 223, the \nGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016, introduced by my Ohio \ncolleague, Congressman Dave Joyce, on the floor today.\n  The Great Lakes are an important resource for the United States. More \nthan 30 million people live in the Great Lakes region, and the lakes \nhelp support over $200 billion a year in economic activity.\n  The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force of Federal agencies was \ncreated in 2004 by executive order to help ensure coordination between \nthe Federal, State, and private parties protecting and restoring the \nGreat Lakes.\n  In 2010, the task force released an action plan as part of the Great \nLakes Restoration Initiative to accelerate efforts to protect and \nrestore the Great Lakes.\n  Under the Initiative, the Environmental Protection Agency \ncollaborates with other Federal partners, including the Great Lakes \nInteragency Task Force, to select the best combination of projects and \nactivities for Great Lakes protection and restoration.\n  In September of 2014, the Federal agencies released an updated Action \nPlan II, which summarizes the actions that the Federal agencies plan to \nimplement during fiscal years 2015 through 2019.\n  The Action Plan aims to strategically target the biggest threats to \nthe Great Lakes ecosystem and to accelerate progress toward long-term \ngoals.\n  H.R. 223 will formally authorize the Great Lakes Restoration \nInitiative for 5 years and modifies the program based on \nrecommendations that the Committee received from stakeholders, \nhearings, and the GAO reports on EPA's activities during multiple years \nof oversight.\n  The bill is a positive step forward for the Great Lakes region and \nthe United States as a whole as we continue to prioritize protection \nand restoration of one of our Nation's most valuable resources.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 223, the Great Lakes \nRestoration Initiative Act of 2016. This bill extends the Great Lakes \nRestoration Initiative, a program which has had bipartisan support \namong the Great Lakes delegation for 5 years.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives David Joyce, Dan \nLipinski, and Rick Nolan, for their hard work and effort to extend the \nauthorization of appropriations for this program through fiscal year \n2021.\n  These and other members of the Midwest delegation worked diligently \nto get this legislation to the floor for consideration. I want to thank \nthem all for a job well done.\n  It accelerates efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes, the \nlargest system of surface freshwater in the world.\n  Through unprecedented Federal agency coordination and the development \nof partnerships with the Great Lakes States and local communities, the \ninitiative has already funded more than 2,000 projects to improve water \nquality, protect and restore native habitats, and prevent and control \ninvasive species in the Great Lakes.\n  Mr. Speaker, legislation similar to this bill was included in the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. However, that authorization \nwas only for 1 fiscal year. This legislation provides for a full 5-year \nreauthorization.\n  That timeline is necessary to allow many longer term projects to be \nplanned, capitalized, and completed.\n  Further, this bill will allow States and local communities to \ncoordinate their efforts to combat harmful algal blooms in the Great \nLakes for the first time.\n  The harmful algal blooms that shut down the drinking water system in \nToledo, Ohio, for 3 days in 2014 and that re-emerged in 2015 are still \nfresh in our memories.\n  For this reason, I am pleased that this legislation includes the text \nof H.R. 1923, sponsored by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), to \nrequire EPA to appoint a Federal coordinator to work with the Federal \nagencies, the States, the tribes, and other stakeholders to address the \nrecurring challenges of algal blooms in the Great Lakes.\n  This coordinator will ensure that GLRI funds are utilized in the most \nefficient and effective way to reduce nutrients finding their way into \nthe lakes.\n  Lastly, this bill includes a savings clause to clarify that the GLRI \nauthorization does not expand the regulatory authority of EPA related \nto restoration of the Great Lakes.\n  I did not advocate for this provision. However, let's make it clear \nhere today on the floor that this language should not be interpreted as \npreventing EPA or other Federal agencies from continuing to utilize \ntheir existing authorities to address ongoing water quality challenges \nfacing the lakes.\n  Accordingly, this bill should help ensure that the Federal \ndepartments are able to fund work using all the existing tools in the \ntoolbox that cause harmful algal blooms and other pollution and prevent \nAsian carp from invading the lakes, which would be a disaster, and \nclean up areas of concern and other high-priority threats.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 223.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Ohio\n\n[[Page H1956]]\n\n(Mr. Joyce), who has been a strong advocate for the protection of the \nGreat Lakes and a sponsor of the bill.\n\n  Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 223, the \nGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016.\n  First, I want to thank my good friend, Bob Gibbs of Ohio, for helping \nme to shepherd this legislation through the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Shuster for lending a hand and \nproviding guidance on this.\n  Now, I know I may sound like a broken record, but one of the greatest \nnatural resources and economic powerhouses we have in the United States \nand the world, for that matter, is the Great Lakes.\n  I think the resource is incredibly important because, in the future, \nfreshwater is going to be the new gold. And, if you believe that like I \ndo, you understand why the Great Lakes are so important.\n  Let me give you a few quick facts about this treasure. The Great \nLakes contains one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water.\n  The Great Lakes contain about 85 percent of the fresh surface water \nin North America.\n  In the U.S., the Great Lakes account for 95 percent of the fresh \nsurface water. That is a lot of fresh water.\n  If you took the water and spread it evenly across the Continental \nUnited States, the Great Lakes would submerge our country under 9\\1/2\\ \nfeet of water.\n  These lakes provide more than 35 million people with their drinking \nwater. These Great Lakes support more than 3,500 species of plants and \nanimals.\n  Studies have shown that more than 1\\1/2\\ million jobs are connected \nto the five lakes, and they generate $62 billion in wages.\n  Now, I know I have uttered those facts around the Capitol like a \nbroken record since I got here, as have others, but these are powerful \nin telling our story.\n  An investment in protecting this national treasure is a small down \npayment in protecting the drinking water for millions of people.\n  This legislation will continue to make sure that we look at these \nGreat Lakes as a national treasure and coordinate our investment in \nprotecting them. Please stand with me today in sending a message to \nprotect and preserve our Great Lakes.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Ryan).\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I also \nthank my colleagues from Ohio. This has been one of the true bipartisan \nissues that we have dealt with.\n  So I would like to thank Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Joyce, Ms. Kaptur, Marcia \nFudge, Jim Renacci, also, Pete Visclosky, and Chris Collins.\n  As you just heard from Mr. Joyce, the Great Lakes are a huge issue. \nBut, also, for us, Lake Erie is a huge issue. My legislation was put \ninto this bill to require the EPA to appoint a coordinator to address \nthe issue of harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes.\n  We have so many groups that are interested, but we need the EPA to \nhelp coordinate. Our friends helped get this language into this bill, \nand I am deeply grateful for that.\n  These harmful algal blooms affect over half a million Ohioans. It did \nin 2014. Lake Erie provides clean drinking water for approximately 3 \nmillion Ohioans, many of them up and around the Cleveland and Toledo \nareas.\n  In August 2014, we had an environmental disaster caused by a harmful \nalgal bloom that left nearly 500,000 residents of Toledo and the \nwestern basin without safe drinking water for 3 days.\n  Lake Erie's tourist industry generates $12.9 billion in visitor \nspending, including 119,000 jobs, and contributes $1.7 billion in \nFederal, State, and local taxes.\n  This crisis just continues to build, and it is critical that we start \nworking together to come up with a plan to stem the growing tide.\n  The Great Lakes' abundance of fresh water is a vital resource and a \nstrategic advantage, and it is critical that we do everything in our \npower to combat the threats to the Great Lakes that threaten the health \nand well-being of Ohio and other States surrounding the Great Lakes.\n  So we must do everything we can. This language helps to make that \nhappen. This language will ensure that there is a coordinator at the \nEPA to work with the appropriate Federal, State, local, tribal, and \nforeign governments to address this critical issue affecting the State \nof Ohio.\n  As we see the changes in our economy and as we see what is happening \nout west, we are reminded every single day how critical and how lucky \nwe are, those of us who live in the Great Lakes region, to be able to \naccess this fresh water.\n  So, again, I thank my friends from Ohio. I thank Mr. Shuster from \nthis committee, Mr. DeFazio, and others who helped make this happen and \nfor including this language in the bill.\n\n     Hon. Tim Ryan,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Ryan: We write in support of H.R. 1923, \n     your bill requiring the administrator of the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency to appoint a Great Lakes \n     Harmful Algal Bloom Coordinator, which is now part of H.R. \n     223, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2015. \n     Thank you for your leadership and for being a champion for \n     our Great Lakes, particularly Lake Erie.\n       Currently there are many efforts underway to reduce the \n     number of harmful algal blooms throughout the Great Lakes, \n     such as in Lake Erie, Saginaw and Green Bays, and Fox River. \n     These efforts, however, are not always coordinated to \n     leverage resources and share vital information. Appointing a \n     coordinator ensures resources are used effectively and \n     efficiently and that federal, state, and local agencies, \n     tribal governments, universities and non-governmental \n     organizations are working collaboratively to reduce \n     phosphorus flowing into the Great Lakes. The first step is a \n     coordinator to ensure everyone is working together to address \n     these complex issues.\n       A coordinator could not come quickly enough. Lake Erie is \n     the canary in the coal mine of what is to come for freshwater \n     bodies if the nation does not solve this problem. In 2015, \n     Lake Erie experienced a HAB that stretched from Michigan to \n     well past Cleveland and was the biggest bloom on record. In \n     2014 and 2013, residents in the Toledo area and Carroll \n     Township, respectively, went without tap water because of the \n     toxins produced by these blooms.\n       As you know, over 30 million people rely on the Great Lakes \n     for their drinking water. We must take action now because the \n     longer we wait, the more serious and expensive this problem \n     becomes.\n       Please let Kristy Meyer with the Ohio Environmental Council \n     know how we can be helpful in seeing this vital piece of \n     legislation become law.\n           Sincerely,\n       Heather Taylor-Miesle, Executive Director, Ohio \n     Environmental Council; Jill Ryan, Executive Director, \n     Freshwater Future; Molly Flanagan, Vice President, Policy, \n     Alliance for the Great Lakes; Cheryl Nenn, Riverkeeper, \n     Milwaukee Riverkeeper; Carol A.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Miller), who has fought for years to protect the Great \nLakes.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. I thank the chairman for yielding the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my very, very, strong support \nfor H.R. 223, which is the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of \n2016.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Actually, as the chairman has said, protecting and preserving the \nGreat Lakes has always been a principal advocacy for myself in all the \nyears that I have been in public service, way before I came to the \nCongress.\n  I actually grew up on the Great Lakes. I still live on the Great \nLakes. My family was in the marina business, so for us, the lakes were \nmore than just a source of recreation, they put food on the table for \nmy family. Like so many from the region, the Great Lakes are such a \nvery proud, proud part of our heritage and of our identity.\n  Our Great Lakes, as has been said, generate billions of dollars each \nand every year through the fishing and shipping industries and \nrecreational activities. They account for 85 to 90 percent of this \ncountry's freshwater drinking supply and over 20 percent worldwide. \nThere is actually more freshwater under the polar icecaps, but you \ncannot get at it. You can't get at it to drink it. You can get at the \nGreat Lakes. That is why we are always wanting to protect the Great \nLakes.\n  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, we have not been the best stewards of \nthese magnificent lakes, and we owe it, I think, to future generations \nto help assure that they are protected and that they are preserved as \nwell. One of the ways to do that, I believe, is through continued \nfunding and support of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.\n  For years, the administration has proposed budgets that include cuts \nof millions of dollars to the GLRI, but it is Congress--this Congress--\nthat has always stepped in to recover this funding. That is just one of \nthe reasons that I support this bill, because it does authorize funding \nat the essential levels--$300 million--for the next 5 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will also join my colleagues in pointing out that this \nis truly a bipartisan effort, as you can tell from the people that are \non the floor this morning talking about this. Most of us are from the \nGreat Lakes, whether it is Ohio, Michigan, or some of the other Great \nLakes States. But it is not just a regional jewel, just a regional \ntreasure, the Great Lakes are a national treasure and deserve to be \nprotected in that way.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the years I have seen firsthand the impact that \nGLRI is having on our lakes, whether that is dredging, or beach and \nshoreline restoration, fighting invasive species, all of these projects \nare so critical.\n  Just last fall I was delighted to be part of the unveiling of $20 \nmillion of GLRI grants for the Clinton River Restoration. The Clinton \nRiver, which flows through a major metropolitan area in southeast \nMichigan, is in desperate need of restoration. So this funding will go \na long way in ensuring that the Clinton River is no longer an area of \nconcern and has a thriving ecosystem and a watershed.\n  Mr. Speaker, God gave us these magnificent, magnificent Great Lakes \nthat have provided us with so much, but we need to be better stewards \nof them. Quite frankly, we have a lot of making up to do to Mother \nNature--a lot of making up. I believe this bill goes a long way in \nbringing the necessary attention and the resources to a problem that we \nhave long ago identified and need to address.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I strongly support H.R. 223, the Great Lakes \nRestoration Initiative Act, and I urge all my colleagues to support it \nas well.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member, for \nyielding. I also want to thank the folks on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir great work on this Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, \nparticularly my colleague from Michigan, Congresswoman Miller, who just \nspoke and who will be leaving Congress at the end of this year. She has \nbeen a defender of the Great Lakes for her entire time here. I think it \nis a fitting part of her legacy that this legislation, hopefully today, \nwill pass this House of Representatives.\n  Mr. Speaker, being from Michigan and being a part of the Great Lakes, \nreally growing up around the lakes and in the lakes gives us a lot of \npride in my home State. It is the greatest freshwater source, surface \nfreshwater source on the planet, and provides drinking water to over 30 \nmillion Americans.\n  It is a great economic resource as well with great benefits to our \nentire Nation. It supports millions of jobs, and billions of income \nevery year is derived from the dependence that we have on this great \nresource. It supports commerce, agriculture, transportation, and \ntourism. It is home to over 3,500 species of plants and animals. It is \nan incredible ecosystem.\n  But we know that the threat to the lakes--the threats--multiple \nthreats to the lakes--are real. From invasive species like Asian carp \nto toxic chemical contamination and to habitat loss, we have to do \neverything we can within our power to protect the Great Lakes and \ncombat these really clear present threats.\n  So I am really proud in a very bipartisan fashion to support full \nfunding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to protect and \nrestore that which we have lost in the largest system of fresh water in \nthe world.\n  In the short time that the GLRI has been in place, we have made \nprogress--and we know that this is an effective program--addressing \nlongstanding environmental problems confronting the lakes. Over 2,500 \nindividual projects have already been implemented to improve water \nquality, to clean up contaminated shorelines, to protect and restore \nnative habitats and species, and to control invasive species.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here because we know we have to do more. I join \nmy colleagues in urging Congress to join us in supporting the economic \nand environmental health of the Great Lakes and making this a permanent \npart of American law.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just like to make a couple of closing comments. \nWe had some hearings in my subcommittee on this, and part of our \noversight responsibility is to make sure that taxpayer dollars are \nbeing spent the way they should be. We requested a GAO--a government \naccountability--report, and I am pleased to announce that the report \ncame back very favorable, that the monies to be invested to protect the \nGreat Lakes is being spent the way it is intended to be.\n\n  The only negative that was in the report--which is really minor--was \nthe agencies, the EPA needed to do a better job working together and \ncommunicating, and they already had started that when they got the \nreport. So I want to assure our fiscal hawks out there that this money \nis being spent the way it is intended by Congress, and we got that as \npart of our oversight duty.\n  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I urge our support of H.R. 223 and to \ncontinue to protect and enhance the Great Lakes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on S. 1523.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today we are here to reauthorize the National Estuary \nProgram found in section 320 of the Clean Water Act. Last June, here in \nthe House, we passed Mr. LoBiondo's H.R. 944, and today we are passing \nS. 1523, which was introduced by Senator Whitehouse.\n  Estuaries are unique and highly productive waters that are important \nto the ecological and economic bases of our Nation. Congress first \nauthorized the National Estuary Program in the 1987 amendments to the \nClean Water Act to promote the protection of nationally significant \nestuaries in the United States that are deemed to be threatened by \npollution, development, or overuse.\n  Unlike many of the programs under the Clean Water Act, the National \nEstuary Program is a nonregulatory program. Instead, it is designed to \nsupport the collaborative, voluntary efforts of Federal, State, and \nlocal stakeholders to restore degraded estuaries.\n  Using consensus building and a collaborative decisionmaking process \ninstead of a top-down driven regulatory approach, the National Estuary \nProgram has been effective at promoting locally based involvement. In \naddition, NEP leverages non-Federal money for restoration activities by \nproviding funding for the program.\n  In reauthorizing the National Estuary Program, S. 1523 makes prudent \nfiscal adjustments. The amendment to S. 1523 strikes the text of the \nSenate bill and instead uses the legislative text of the House-passed \nbill, H.R. 944. An agreement was reached to split the difference in \nauthorized appropriations levels of the two bills.\n  As amended, the bill reauthorizes section 320 of the Clean Water Act \nthrough 2021, at an amount of $26.5 million a year. This amount is \nconsistent with appropriations over the past 5 years and in recognition \nof the fiscal realities of today.\n  S. 1523 also directs more funds to where they need to be, the \nindividual estuaries in the program. The bill achieves this by reducing \nthe amount of discretionary funds made available to the EPA.\n  Finally, the bill allocates a portion of the eligible program funds \nfor competitive awards to Federal, State, and local stakeholders to \naddress certain high-priority estuary needs, including algal blooms, \nhypoxia, flooding, and invasive species.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of S. 1523.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the House is again considering legislation \nto reauthorize EPA's National Estuary Program. Last summer the House \napproved by voice vote a similar bill championed by my colleagues, the \ngentlemen from Washington (Mr. Larsen) and Florida (Mr. Murphy). I \nthank them for their hard work and dedication to produce this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Estuaries are integral to the health and vibrancy of our national \neconomy and environment. They are formed, as we all know, when fresh \nwater drained from land mixes with salty seawater, and they serve as a \nnesting and feeding grounds for many plants and animals that form the \nbasis of the aquatic food chain.\n  Estuaries also help to maintain healthy ocean and coastal \nenvironments by filtering out sediments and pollutants that flow \nthrough our rivers and streams before they reach the ocean. Moreover, \nduring storm and flood events, estuaries help defend our shores by \nsoftening the blow of storm surge.\n  More than one-half of our population lives in coastal areas, and \ncountless Americans depend on estuaries for storm and flood protection, \nand for the cultivation of their livelihoods. Estuarine habitats \nprovide for millions of jobs in our country and contribute trillions to \nour national economy every year. These jobs are created by commercial \nand recreational fishing and boating, as well as tourism and other \nforms of recreation taking place just off our shores. As one of my \ncolleagues noted during previous consideration of this legislation, \nrestoring our estuaries can create more than 30 jobs for every $1 \nmillion invested.\n  Regrettably, before we understood--fully understood--the \nextraordinary and irreplaceable value of estuaries, numerous activities \nwere undertaken that have led to the decline in the health of our \nestuaries, leaving these coastal areas of our country vulnerable to \npollution and more frequent and severe storm events. It is also \nundeniable that the population growth near estuaries has led to \nincreased storm water runoff and sewage discharges fed into these \nfragile environments. Simply put, estuaries are too ecologically \nimportant to leave their fate to chance.\n  With that in mind, today we consider S. 1523, desperately needed \nlegislation that will reauthorize EPA's National Estuary Program. Since \n1987, the National Estuary Program has operated at EPA in partnership \nwith State and local partners and has developed innovative solutions to \nlocal water quality problems in estuarine environments. This \nnonregulatory program currently works to improve the health of 28 \nestuaries across the country, including three estuaries in Northwest: \nPuget Sound, Tillamook, and Columbia River estuaries. These estuaries \nare of great support to my home State, Oregon, and our regional and \nnational economies.\n\n[[Page H1959]]\n\nRestoring and protecting these areas should be one of our highest \nconcerns.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill would ensure that logical \norganizations across the country in partnership with the EPA can \nprotect and restore estuaries for the benefit of future generations. I \nsupport passage of this legislation and hope that this is the last time \nthis House must act to send this important bill to the President.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 1523.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), who is a sponsor of the bill \nand has worked tirelessly to protect estuaries throughout the Nation.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank Chairman \nShuster, Chairman Gibbs, Ranking Members DeFazio and Napolitano, as \nwell as my colleagues Mr. Larsen, Mr. Posey, and Mr. Murphy of Florida \nfor helping to draft this legislation and reauthorization. We all share \nthe hope that this is the last go-around to get this done.\n  Estuaries across the country, including the Delaware Bay and Barnegat \nBay estuaries in my district, have immeasurable economic, ecological, \nand environmental benefit. They deserve continued congressional \nsupport.\n  This version of the National Estuary Program reauthorization is a \nbipartisan, fiscally responsible compromise with the Senate that \nreduces the authorization by $8.5 million. The important part is it \nultimately increases the amount of money each estuary program will \nreceive.\n  Unlike many programs under the Clean Water Act, the National Estuary \nProgram is a nonregulatory program, uniquely designed to support the \ncollaborative, voluntary efforts of Federal, State, and local \nstakeholders to restore degraded estuaries. Unfortunately, the NEPs \nhave been losing money due to increasing EPA administrative costs. We \nhave heard that before, but, in this particular case, it is really \nhurting.\n  To correct that, our legislation details precisely how the EPA is to \nspend the authorized and appropriated money. By setting limits of 5 \npercent for the EPA's administrative costs, we can guarantee 80 percent \nof the funding goes directly to the needs of the estuary and not \nbureaucratic salary and red tape.\n  Also, in this year's reauthorization, we have set aside 15 percent of \nthe funding for a competitive award program. This program seeks \napplications to deal with urgent and challenging issues that threaten \nthe ecological and economic well-being of coastal areas.\n  By structuring how the money is spent and lowering authorization \nlevels, this legislation strikes the right balance of fiscal and \nenvironmental responsibility. I want to thank my colleagues once again \nfor their strong support of this, and I urge all Members to support the \nbill.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important legislation \nto protect estuaries throughout the country.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1684.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, following the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989, \nCongress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA. The basic \npremise of OPA is that the party responsible for the spill is \nresponsible for all of the costs of cleaning up the mess.\n  The Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 reminded us of the impact a spill \nof its size can have on waters, coastlines, people, and our economy. It \nis important to note that these offshore facilities, as defined by OPA, \nare limited only to the navigable waters of the United States, and \nforeign rigs cannot be designated as responsible parties. Therefore, if \nthere were an oil spill originating in foreign waters, the most the \nresponsible party would have to pay to clean up American waters and \nshores is $150 million.\n  This issue is of particular concern to Gulf States. Mexico, Cuba, and \nthe Bahamas are actively looking at expanding their offshore drilling \noperations. Of particular concern is Mexico, which is looking into \nultradeep wells, exceeding 6,000 feet in depth. In 2012, Mexico's top \noil regulators said they were not prepared to handle a serious accident \nor major oil spill.\n  But it is not just the Gulf States that could be negatively affected \nby a spill. On the Canadian side of Lake Erie, offshore energy \nexploration is being conducted for natural gas. While Canadian law \nprohibits oil extraction from the Great Lakes, the risk of a spill \npersists. Again, under current law, the responsible party would only \nhave to pay a maximum of $150 million for cleanup.\n  In response to these concerns, my friend from Florida, Representative\n\n[[Page H1960]]\n\nPatrick Murphy, and I introduced the legislation that is being \nconsidered here today. The bill ensures that the responsible party, \nregardless of origin, pays for all American cleanup costs by applying \nOPA. This will also apply Clean Water Act penalties to the responsible \nforeign party.\n  I am proud that this legislation has broad bipartisan support and has \nbeen endorsed by environmental fishing and other groups that depend on \nthe water for their livelihoods. Our coastal communities need peace of \nmind that if they are harmed by a foreign spill, resources are \navailable to clean up their shores and help them recover. American \ntaxpayers should not have to foot the bill to bail out the mistakes of \nforeign companies.\n  I would like to thank and commend the Coast Guard and the majority \nand minority staffs of the committee, particularly John Rayfield and \nDave Jansen, for their work on this important legislation.\n  H.R. 1684 is a very straightforward bill that looks to hold the party \nresponsible for a foreign oil spill that affects U.S. waters or lands \naccountable. I urge all Members to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this noncontroversial \nlegislation that will clarify existing Federal authority regarding the \nliability for and enforcement of offshore oil spills originating from a \nforeign source outside the U.S. exclusive economic zone.\n  H.R. 1684, the Foreign Spill Protection Act of 2016, clarifies that \nowners and operators of oil production facilities located offshore and \noutside the United States are liable for cleanup costs and damages from \noil spills. These foreign entities are responsible for oil spills that \noriginate outside U.S. waters if they threaten or cause damage in the \nUnited States. The foreign entities would be subject to criminal and \ncivil penalties, Federal removal authority, and any State-authorized \nremedy currently allowed under Federal and State law.\n  I would like to commend the cooperation shown by the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure Chairman Shuster, Coast Guard and \nMaritime Transportation Subcommittee Chairman Hunter, and Ranking \nMember Garamendi in working out the final details of this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Deepwater Horizon disaster painfully reminded us of \nhow catastrophic an offshore oil spill can be, both in its geographic \nreach and in its environmental and economic costs.\n  The settled liability and enforcement regimes authorized under the \nOil Pollution Act and the Clean Water Act have proven themselves to be \ncomprehensive, durable, and effective. In the event of a spill, this \nresponse regime has ensured time and time again that the Federal \nGovernment has clear, unequivocal authority to respond to a spill, \nrestore the environment and communities harmed, and recover damages for \nthe harm caused. This legislation will in no way impede or change those \nindispensable authorities.\n  In closing, it is a helpful enhancement to clarify that spills \noriginating from foreign sources fall under this well-established legal \nregime. I ask Members on both sides of the aisle to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I would like to thank the ranking member, Mr. DeFazio, for his \nstatement and for his cooperation on this legislation. I also want to \nthank Chairman Shuster.\n  As the gentleman mentioned, the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee is oftentimes an example of how we can put politics aside to \nwork together and do good things for the American people. This \nlegislation is very important to my constituents in south Florida, in \nthe Florida Keys, and, really, to coastal communities all over the \ncountry. So I thank the gentleman for his statement. I thank everyone \nwho had a part in crafting this legislation.\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Murphy), who is vitally interested and \nconcerned about this legislation.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nFlorida and I thank the gentleman from Oregon for their tireless \nefforts to protect our environment. As the gentleman from Florida and I \nknow firsthand, so much of our economy is based on our environment. \nMaking sure that we have clean water and clean air is exactly what we \nneed to be focused on.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, ensuring the party \nresponsible for such oil spills is held liable. Hopefully, we get \nbipartisan support going forward. I thank the two gentlemen for their \nwork putting this forward.\n  I would also like to rise today in support of H.R. 2901, the Flood \nInsurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. I was proud to put this \nbipartisan legislation forward with my good friend, another gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Ross) to clarify that private flood insurance may be \nan available option for homeowners to satisfy mandatory coverage \nrequirements under the National Flood Insurance Program. For Florida \nhomeowners, this is a win-win, giving them more options for flood \ninsurance coverage and using new competition to drive down prices and \nexpand coverage options for consumers.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program is an important tool that \nempowers and protects homeowners all across America. The Biggert-Waters \nAct of 2012 took an important step in opening up the market and \nallowing private flood insurance policies to satisfy mandatory coverage \nrequirements under the program.\n  However, as we have learned, sometimes even the best laid plans can \nhave unintended consequences. With a lack of clarity as to which \nprivate flood insurance policies are allowed in the program, the market \nhas not been able to expand, and consumers have been left with just one \nchoice to insure their properties from flood risk: the National Flood \nInsurance Program.\n  I recently heard from one of my constituents in Martin County, \nFlorida, about how the premium for just 1 year of flood insurance \ncoverage through the NFIP ended up being five times the price they \nexpected it to be. To make matters worse, the maximum coverage was only \nhalf of what they paid for the home itself; yet they were required to \npurchase the higher priced plan that did not provide the coverage they \nneeded because there were no other options.\n  This highlights the urgent need to allow competition in the flood \ninsurance marketplace to meet homeowners' needs and drive down costs. \nBut to do that, we must allow the States to license and regulate flood \ninsurance policies, exactly like homeowners insurance, car insurance, \nor health insurance.\n  Yet, almost inexplicably, Florida's private flood insurance market \nremains restrained because homeowners are not given the choice to look \nto private market policies for more flood insurance options. The bank \nwill not accept other policies because their regulators haven't \napproved them.\n  This bill will solve this problem by allowing State insurance \ncommissioners, who have long been considered by Congress as the most \nappropriate regulators of insurance, to certify private insurance plans \nto provide equivalent or better protections for flood insurance other \nthan the NFIP plan. Everyone I talk to agrees that Florida's insurance \ncommissioner is certainly better equipped to regulate flood insurance \nin our State than the Federal banking regulators.\n  By breaking this down, we break down a major barrier to marketplace \nexpansion. This legislation will foster more competition, greatly \nbenefiting homeowners across Florida and the Nation.\n  I thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman Hensarling, for his \nleadership on this issue. I also extend my deep gratitude to the \ngentlewoman from California, Ranking Member Waters, for her relentless \nadvocacy for consumers and for working with us to improve this \nlegislation and produce a solid, bipartisan outcome.\n  I appreciate all of my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee \nfor moving this commonsense measure forward with unanimous, bipartisan \nsupport.\n\n[[Page H1961]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  I am hopeful that today it will be passed by the full House with \nsimilar support and will be swiftly considered in the Senate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2901, the Flood \nInsurance Market Parity and Modernization Act.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 4820) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to use \nthe testimonials of former or estranged violent extremists or their \nassociates in order to counter terrorist recruitment, and for other \npurposes, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4820\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DIRECTIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n     incorporate, to the extent practicable, into Department of \n     Homeland Security efforts to combat terrorist recruitment and \n     communications the public testimonials of former violent \n     extremists or their associates, including friends and family. \n     Such efforts may include the following:\n       (1) Counter-messaging of foreign terrorist organization \n     communications and narratives.\n       (2) Related community engagement and public education \n     efforts.\n       (b) Coordination.--The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall, where appropriate, coordinate the efforts described in \n     subsection (a) with the heads of other Federal departments \n     and agencies, as appropriate, and, to the extent practicable, \n     engage nongovernmental and international partners in the \n     identification and use of testimonials described in such \n     subsection.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be \n     construed to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     collect testimonials directly from former violent extremists \n     or their associates, including friends and family.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. McCaul) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include any extraneous materials to the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act \nof 2016. I commend Mr. Fleischmann for offering this bipartisan \ncounterterrorism bill at a time when we are in the highest terror \nthreat environment since 9/11.\n  We have more than 1,000 homegrown terror investigations in all 50 \nStates, and we have arrested over 80 ISIS supporters in our country, \nmany for plotting attacks.\n  Terrorists are radicalizing our citizens online and across borders, \nwhich is why we need this legislation. It requires that the Secretary \nof Homeland Security use the testimonials of former extremists and \ndefectors to help stop terrorist recruitment.\n  President Obama himself--and I agree with him on this issue--argued \nlast year: We need to lift up the voice of those who know the hypocrisy \nof groups like ISIS firsthand, including former extremists.\n  He also noted: ``Former extremists . . . can be powerful messengers \nin debunking these terrorist ideologies.''\n  Our foreign partners are already using these types of testimonials \noverseas. So is our State Department. But we need to be doing this \ncounter-messaging here at home.\n  Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in front of my committee \nlast month: My priority has been focusing on communities that I believe \nare most vulnerable to the appeals from ISIS, al Qaeda, and other \nterrorist groups overseas who are actively targeting individuals in \nthese communities . . . This is as important as any of our other \nhomeland security missions.\n  I commend Secretary Johnson for his words and his work, but we are \nnot acting quickly enough. That is why this bill was one of the top \nrecommendations of the bipartisan task force we created last year to \nlook at this threat.\n  In their final report, the Democratic and Republican Members who led \nthe task force said America needed to launch a concerted effort to use \nthe testimonials of former extremists to combat terrorist propaganda.\n  This is from a Virginia defector. Just last month an ISIS defector \nfrom Virginia was picked up in Iraq. He said he wanted to send a \nmessage to the American people that life with ISIS was miserable and \nthat the group did not represent Islam. These are the types of voices \nwe need to amplify so as to keep others from making the same mistakes.\n  Some have argued that this bill limits the DHS in allowing it only to \ncounter-message groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, but that is simply \nfalse. In fact, at our markup, legislative counsel told the members: \n``The current language in the bill is extremely broad-based. It does \nnot place a limitation on anything.''\n  Although our bipartisan task force focused on foreign terrorist \nthreats, the bill gives the Secretary the flexibility to address the \nfull array of dangerous groups that threaten our people both here at \nhome and abroad. I am proud to say that the majority of Republicans and \nDemocrats on the House Homeland Security Committee support this \nlegislation.\n  Terrorists are recruiting our citizens at the speed of broadband. So \nwe can't move at the speed of bureaucracy. Today Congress has an \nopportunity to fight back. I urge all Members to join me in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist \nRecruitment Act of 2016.\n  It is troubling that some of my colleagues have circulated \nmisinformation about this bill. Let me set the record straight.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly told my committee \nthat H.R. 4820 is unnecessary insofar as the Department can already \nintegrate public testimonials of former terrorists and violent \nextremists into its efforts to counter violent extremism and terrorism.\n  In fact, yesterday I spoke with Secretary Johnson, and he reiterated \nthat DHS has the authority it needs to carry out its countering violent \nextremism efforts and that this bill is unnecessary.\n  I oppose H.R. 4820 today for the same reason I opposed it when it was \nconsidered earlier this month in committee. H.R. 4820 is nothing more \nthan a message bill, a bill that sends the message to DHS to focus its \ncounter-messaging efforts on foreign terrorist groups.\n\n[[Page H1962]]\n\n  Domestic terror groups, like foreign terrorist organizations, recruit \nand spread propaganda through social media and online platforms. This \nbill ignores the fact that domestic terror groups, like foreign \nterrorist organizations, kill Americans.\n  Since September 11, terrorists who have espoused their ideology of \nforeign terrorist organizations have been responsible for killing 45 \ninnocent Americans on U.S. soil. During that same period, members of \ndomestic terrorist organizations have murdered more than 48 Americans.\n  If you ask law enforcement leaders across this country what keeps \nthem up at night, they will likely say the prospect that there is a \nsovereign citizen group or militia plotting in their jurisdictions.\n  Just last month the Atlanta police chief testified before my \ncommittee that he is deeply concerned about homegrown extremists and \nmilitia activity. His testimony echoes the results of a recent survey \nin which 74 percent of law enforcement identified anti-government \nextremism as one of the three terrorist threats in their jurisdictions.\n\n  In the last 2 months, we have seen the development of domestic \nterrorists: an attack on police officers in Georgia by a self-appointed \nwizard of the Ku Klux Klan; the conviction by a Federal grand jury in \nMississippi of two members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Mississippi for \ntheir participation in various criminal acts, including those of drug \nproduction, trafficking, kidnapping, and murder; the indictment of two \nmembers of a sovereign citizen group in Columbus, Ohio, for building a \nbomb that was modeled after the suicide vests that were used in the \nNovember Paris attack; a four-count indictment against a member of a \nMichigan sovereign citizen group for selling women and children into \nsexual slavery. Such abusive activities are chillingly similar to those \nof ISIL.\n  In recognition of these facts, I, together with like-minded committee \nDemocrats, made multiple proposals during and after the markup to fix \nthe bill. We offered an amendment to define ``violent extremist'' to \nencompass not only those engaged in ideologically motivated \ninternational terrorism, but also in domestic terrorism.\n  It was rejected. We offered an amendment to insert ``domestic \nterrorist organization.'' It was also rejected. Even after the markup, \nwe made three more proposals to fix the bill. Each was rejected.\n  By refusing to include any mention of domestic terrorist \norganizations, H.R. 4820 represents a significant departure from the \nholistic, comprehensive approach that has been espoused by the Obama \nadministration to counter ideologically based violence.\n  Since 2011, with the publication of the ``Empowering Local Partners \nto Prevent Extremism in the United States'' strategy by the White \nHouse, Federal efforts to prevent such terrorism have been guided by \nthe recognition that violent extremists are inspired by a range of \nreligious, political, or other ideological beliefs.\n  The passage of H.R. 4820 would send the wrong message. As such, I \nurge a ``no'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Chattanooga, Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), the sponsor \nand author of the bill.\n  Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, \nH.R. 4820, the Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act.\n  I wish to thank Chairman McCaul and the members of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee for all of their hard work on this bill.\n  I will never forget the moment back in July--I was standing on this \nfloor--when I was told about the shootings at two military \ninstallations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the town in which I live and \nproudly represent. As many of you may remember, four marines and one \nsailor were killed in the attack while several others were wounded.\n  Just this past December, following the FBI investigation, Director \nJames Comey concluded that the shootings ``were motivated by foreign \nterrorist organization propaganda.''\n  Given the recent attacks in Chattanooga and San Bernardino, as well \nas in Paris and Brussels, we need to use every tool in the toolbox to \ncombat this new brand of extremism.\n  This bill implements one of the key recommendations made by the \nHomeland Security Committee's bipartisan task force, one that is \nspecifically designed to counter terrorism and foreign fighter travel.\n  This bill does not forbid DHS from countering all forms of extremism, \nbut the bill does provide examples of how DHS can fulfill the \nrequirement, such as counter-messaging foreign terrorist organizations, \nwhich are actively recruiting in our country at an alarming rate.\n  This bipartisan legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to amplify the testimonials of former extremists and defectors \nto fight the propaganda and the recruitment of terrorist groups like \nISIS.\n  Foreign terrorists are using technology to radicalize Americans at a \ntroubling pace, which continues to increase. More than 250 Americans \nhave traveled or have attempted to travel to fight with jihadists in \nSyria and Iraq, and the FBI says there are open counterterrorism \ninvestigations in all 50 States, mostly ISIS related. Many of these \nindividuals were pulled in by terrorist propaganda.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  ISIS is luring Americans with empty and false promises that do not \nreflect the true reality on the ground in places like Syria and Iraq. \nThe true reality centers on fear, suffering, and the murder of innocent \npeople throughout the region and around the world.\n  Several recent defectors from ISIS have admitted that joining the \ngroup was a terrible mistake. One young fighter said he found it very \nhard to live there and no longer believes the group represents their \nreligion.\n  We need to do all we can to amplify the messages from these \ndisillusioned terrorists who have firsthand experience with the evil \nand hypocrisy of these extremist groups.\n  The State Department and many of our key allies already utilize the \ntestimony of those disaffected by the true reality of these terror \ngroups, and the concept was also endorsed by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Homeland Security Advisory Council last spring.\n  Unfortunately, there may be partisan opposition to this bipartisan \nbill. The majority of the Homeland Security committee members, on both \nsides of the aisle, supported the bill in committee.\n  I will say it again: this bill received a majority of votes from both \nsides of the aisle in committee. Let's not put partisanship ever ahead \nof our Nation's security.\n  This is a commonsense measure to hinder those recruiting efforts of \ngroups like ISIS with the testimony of those who have seen the evil of \nthese groups firsthand.\n  I urge the support of my colleagues.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4820, \nthe so-called Combating Terrorist Recruitment Bill.\n  H.R. 4820 omits any mention of domestic terrorist organizations, a \nsignificant departure from the holistic, comprehensive approach that is \nadopted by the administration to counter ideologically based violence. \nThis bill isolates the enemy to be those who are Islamist, those who \nare foreign, and those who are being radicalized by foreigners.\n  How does this bill address the threat of terror from those who are \nnot just jaded jihadists, like this bill was initially titled, but, \nrather, a part of domestic militia or part of a rightwing, ultra-\nconservative, racist organization that wants to kill African Americans \nor other vulnerable populations?\n  A recent study by the Police Executive Research Forum and the \nTriangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security found that State and \nlocal law enforcement personnel are almost twice as concerned about \nrightwing and antigovernment terrorism as they are about the threat \nfrom al Qaeda, ISIS, and similar groups.\n  The concerns of State and local law enforcement about domestic \nterrorism are well placed. Within the last year, we have seen a \nrightwing terrorist kill\n\n[[Page H1963]]\n\nnine people at Mother Emanuel in Charleston and an anti-abortion \nterrorist kill three people at the Planned Parenthood facility in \nColorado.\n  Since the attacks of 9/11, within the United States, domestic \nterrorists have killed 48 people, more than those killed by foreign \nterrorist-inspired attacks.\n  Shouldn't we be concerned about those who have demonstrated the \ngreatest threat to our homeland in the last 15 years?\n  H.R. 4820 represents a marked departure from a national strategy to \ncombat terrorism and that recognizes that individuals who promote and \nuse violence against the U.S. are inspired by a range of religious, \npolitical, or other ideological beliefs.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). The time of the \ngentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 \nseconds to the gentlewoman.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. This bill only serves to perpetuate the stigma \nassociated with just one group of people who happen to practice Islam. \nIt does not recognize a full range of terrorist threats to our \nhomeland.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 4820.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Katko), the original cosponsor of the bill and the \nchairman of the bipartisan task force.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for \noffering this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, America continues to witness the largest convergence of \nradical Islamic threats in the history of our country.\n  More than any threat before, ISIS demonstrated an ability to \nradicalize individuals throughout the world by utilizing the Internet.\n  However, these individuals are met with the cold, hard reality that \nISIS does not offer luxury, happiness, or peacefulness. On the \ncontrary, these individuals are thrust onto the battlefield with little \nor no training and little or no regard for their lives.\n  Some, when faced with the truth, try to turn back. Among those who \nrecognize ISIS for the barbaric, destructive force that it is, some \nhave actually dared to speak out against them, using their experience \nto dissuade others from risking their lives in order to wage war on \ninnocent people.\n  One of these individuals was mentioned by my colleague, Chairman Mike \nMcCaul, and that individual grew up across the river from here in \nAlexandria, Virginia.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the efforts of our law enforcement and \nintelligence officials by supporting this bill. The Combating Terrorist \nRecruitment Act of 2016, of which I am a cosponsor, requires a \ndissemination of testimonials from ISIS defectors to help stop the \nradicalization of at-risk individuals.\n  This bill comes from the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist \nand Foreign Fighter Travel, of which I served as a Republican lead. \nUsing these testimonials would fill a gap that our bipartisan task \nforce identified in a bipartisan manner.\n\n  I thank Chairman McCaul, who has led this effort.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I certainly don't question the motivations \nof the gentleman who has sponsored this bill. He is a good man, a good \nAmerican, and loves his country, but I believe it is misdirected. I \nreally do.\n  In my hand, if you remember, there is a report from 2009, the \nbeginning of the Obama administration. All that work was done in the \nprevious administration on this report. The report is quite revealing.\n  Anybody who is on Homeland Security should read it because it tells \nus that we need not only to carry out the oath of office, half of it, \nbut we should defend the country against foreign intruders. Also, it \nsays in our oath ``domestic'' as well.\n  This report lays out very clearly what is going on in the United \nStates of America in our backyards. It was squashed.\n  I remember the day when a Democratic Secretary of the Homeland \nSecurity heard from me about it, that she should not have bent over \nbecause those on the other side wanted this report squashed.\n  There have been articles written since that time, 2009, of how it was \nsquashed. They didn't want the American people to read this. That is \nquite, quite a report.\n  So I rise in opposition, Mr. Speaker, to H.R. 4820. No one loves this \ncountry more than the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson). I am \nnot on that committee anymore, but no one respects it more than Bennie \nThompson.\n  Why is he opposed to this? Is he opposed to this because he doesn't \nlove his country as much as the folks on the other side of the aisle? I \ndon't think so. Does he oppose it because he didn't sponsor it? I don't \nthink so.\n  He opposes it because this excludes very specific things which we \nshould not exclude.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from \nNew Jersey an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. The House should not be picking and choosing what \nsources of terrorism the Department should focus on without taking into \naccount all the facts. The House continues to ignore the threats posed \nby violent extremism, which are not limited to a single ideology.\n  Eric Hoffer, in the book ``The True Believer,'' written many years \nago, said that extremism is inspired by a range of reasons, including \nreligious, political, or ideological beliefs. He says that these \nmovements, regardless of the motive or end goal, simply need isolated \nindividuals who are dispossessed in some way or other and need to feel \npart of something bigger than themselves.\n  Why don't we really get at the sources of the people who want to kill \nour kids and want to damage our properties, whether they come from afar \nor whether they are grown right here? Homegrown. Homegrown. And we are \nignoring it. The FBI reports that time and time again.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hurd).\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. ``It's not a revolution or jihad. It's a \nslaughter. I was shocked by what I did.''\n  ``I found it very, very hard to live there. ISIS fighters don't \nrepresent the religion. I don't see them as good Muslims.''\n  Mr. Speaker, those are the words of Americans who traveled overseas \nto fight alongside ISIS. They left home believing they were headed \ntoward a great adventure. They were promised glory and honor, but what \nthey found was death and a perversion of the religion they believe in.\n  These fighters were originally recruited to fight for ISIS through \nsocial media. Every day ISIS spreads their lies and propaganda, drawing \nin naive young Americans.\n  They do this in dozens of different languages, reaching people across \nthe world. Even while ISIS loses ground on the battlefield, they are \nworking hard to make it up in the digital sphere.\n  The Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act will allow us to take these \npowerful words of truth and use them to combat the lies that ISIS is \nspreading on social media.\n  Some may say this is unnecessary. Some may say: Why aren't we already \ndoing this? We aren't. That is why we need this piece of legislation.\n  This bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to use the \ntestimonials of former extremists and defectors as part of an ongoing \neffort to stop terrorist recruitment. These are individuals who have \nseen the brutality of terrorist groups firsthand and have rejected it.\n\n  This bill is not limited to specific groups. Let me repeat that one \nmore time: This bill is not limited to specific groups.\n  It gives our counterterrorism professionals the flexibility needed to \nfight back against extremists as the threat environment and terrorist \ntactics change.\n  It also requires DHS to coordinate these efforts with other agencies, \nnongovernmental organizations, and foreign partners so that we do this \nthe right way, finding the best outlets for undermining terrorist \npropaganda.\n\n[[Page H1964]]\n\n  The bipartisan Foreign Fighter Task Force I served on recommends that \nwe use these credible voices to fight against ISIS' online efforts.\n  The nonpartisan Homeland Security Advisory Council has urged DHS to \nuse the testimonials of former extremists in our counternarrative \nefforts. Our foreign partners are already using these tactics and \nfinding them effective.\n  Our young people are being targeted. We have the tools to help \nprotect them. These tools can stop others in our hometowns from making \na terrible mistake. We need to get in the online fight, but time is not \non our side.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the Combating Terrorist \nRecruitment Act. Having spent 9\\1/2\\ years as an undercover officer \nchasing terrorists across the world, there is no such thing as a silver \nbullet. We have to do this piecemeal, and this bill is one step going \nin that direction.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the ranking member on the House \nTransportation Committee.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as one who served from the \ncreation of the Homeland Security Committee until just a couple of \nyears ago.\n  I am concerned about what I am hearing here today on the floor, and I \nam surprised. Perhaps we should insert the word ``some,'' combating \nsome terrorist recruitment in 2016.\n  Now, the chairman said that DHS certainly has the flexibility to \naddress domestic terrorism. Well, that is true. But why leave out \nexplicit mention of domestic terrorism?\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Are you afraid of offending some rightwing nuts out there? What is \nthe deal?\n  Seriously, I just went through this in Oregon. I have been on the \nDepartment of Justice and the FBI for about 2 years: Go get Cliven \nBundy, get his cattle off the land, put the guy in jail.\n  They didn't do it. And what happened?\n  He taught his kids the way it was done. You show the government a \ngun, and they will run away, and you keep doing what you want, and you \ncan deny that the Federal Government has the right to own any public \nlands in this country and try and take them over for private \nindividuals.\n  Now, this is a serious threat. The Murrah building, there were no \nforeign terrorists involved, 168 dead, hundreds injured, and we can't \nexplicitly put into this bill all terrorism, including domestic \nterrorism.\n  I really fear that some are worried that some of these rightwing \nextremist groups out there might be offended if we were to say that \nthey are a threat to our Nation. Well, they are very much a threat, and \nthis bill omitting that should have this bill denied passage on this \nfloor and bring it back in a comprehensive way next week.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan).\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4820, the \nCombating Terrorist Recruitment Act authored by Mr. Fleischmann.\n  This bill is one step in implementing the recommendations of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security's Foreign Fighter Task Force. This \nbipartisan team was charged with studying how our government can combat \nWestern citizens who become radicalized and take up arms with \nterrorists. The President, senior national security officials, industry \nleaders, and experts have all expressed support for this concept.\n  While all self-radicalized terrorists deserve the consequences of \ntheir behavior, some realize just how profound they were mistaken after \nseeing the reality of life under ISIS. They sometimes recant and tell \nthe truth about the atrocities that they have witnessed or committed. \nThat is valuable information.\n  What this bill does is common sense. It directs the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to use testimony from these individuals as part of \nour efforts to combat violent extremists. President Obama himself \nstated that we need to ``lift up the voices'' of former extremists in \norder to expose the hypocrisy of ISIS, but this bill does not limit the \nDepartment's ability to countermeasure terrorist groups that threaten \nus no matter where they are located.\n  As we speak, ISIS is using social media and the Internet to \nradicalize young Americans who are vulnerable to a message of inclusion \nin a grand cause, no matter how sinister. Before they make a mistake \nthat could cause them and others their lives, let's take every \nopportunity to counter ISIS' poisonous narrative. To hear from others \nlike them who wanted to believe in ISIS and found the truth too late is \na tactic we should utilize.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, which received bipartisan \nsupport in committee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers \nand I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry).\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from \nTennessee for offering this bill, as well as Chairman McCaul for \nbringing it to the floor.\n  When the terrorists attacked in San Bernardino, many Americans said: \nWhat are we doing?\n  When you find out that these folks are trafficking on the Internet \nand messaging, they say: Where is our FBI? Where are the services \nprotecting us, and why aren't they doing everything they can?\n  This is one thing they can do is offer testimonials from people who \nhave been there who can give other people who might be interested in \njoining the truth. Yet there are some folks here who don't want to do \nthat. They are interested in misrepresenting this bill.\n  I want to remind everybody that this bill is the result of a \nbipartisan task force, a bipartisan task force, Member-led, that said \nwe need to do exactly this, and unanimously move this forward to the \nfull committee.\n  They say it is unnecessary. Well, if it is unnecessary, why isn't \nHomeland Security doing this already? Why not? How long are they going \nto wait?\n  They say that they offered amendments. Really? They offered \namendments?\n  They couldn't be bothered to answer the chairman's call when he said: \nHey, can you collaborate with us on this so we have a good bill that \neverybody is involved in.\n  They waited until the day of the markup, and then came in with a \nbunch of amendments and concerns. It was apparent that all they wanted \nto do was slow the process down and, as a matter of fact, move the \nprocess to some other date.\n  How long are we going to wait? Do you want to ask the relatives of \nthose who are killed by these people how long they want to wait? How \nabout the next ones?\n  Now, some on the other side have picked this up as this is a \npolitically motivated agenda. I say some because not all. As a matter \nof fact, many on the other side voted to move this bill right to the \nfloor where it is now.\n  I don't understand why they would want to have America be less safe. \nI don't understand, Mr. Speaker. We spent 4 hours--4 hours--going over \na two-page bill. Two pages. We entertained what they wanted to change, \nand we did make some changes, but it was apparent that all they wanted \nto really do was stall and stall and move this process forward down the \nline and never get to it.\n  Mr. Speaker, we don't have any choice. We have to move forward now. \nThose in opposition are simply willfully refusing to see what all \nAmerica sees. We need to address this threat immediately. It is a two-\npage bill, and it doesn't deny Homeland Security from doing anything \nthat it has already been doing.\n\n  As a matter of fact, these folks on the other side demanded at that \nmarkup--they demanded--that we say that Homeland Security must do this. \nAnd the chairman said: Okay, if you want to demand that they do it, we \nwill demand that they do it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we ought to make America safe and pass this \nbill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, from \nBoston to Charleston, we have seen individuals operating within our \ncommunities and living among us plot to cause mass harm in the name of \na violent extremist and hateful ideology. Today much has been made of \nthe fact that the FBI has open investigations of ISIL-inspired activity \nin all 50 States. Far less\n\n[[Page H1965]]\n\nattention has been given to the number of open investigations of anti-\ngovernment and militia groups, a number that grew by one-third in 2015 \nalone.\n  We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the threats posed by any \nterrorist group or organization, as the bill before us today would do. \nTherefore, it is imperative that DHS use testimonials from violent \nextremists involved in all forms of violent extremism. Public \ntestimonials can be a powerful tool to reach individuals who otherwise \nmight be susceptible to terrorist propaganda.\n  Given the diversity in the threat landscape that we face, it just \nmakes sense that any such effort should be comprehensive. \nUnfortunately, the bill's sponsors have decided that this bill should \nturn away from the comprehensive approach.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, let me indicate that the only real issue before \nus is the domestic aspect of terrorism. Domestic terrorist \norganizations have demonstrated time and time again, they have killed \nmore Americans here on our soil than foreign terrorists have. The \nreason we are in opposition is we don't recognize that in this \nlegislation. Our effort in markup, as well as here on the floor, is to \nmake sure that all of the bad people get recognized, those \ninternational and foreign, but also those who are domestic.\n  Some of us have lived in parts of the country where domestic \nterrorism was a way of life for a lot of us, and because of that, we \nare very passionate on that subject. The Charleston situation was very \nunfortunate. That was an act of domestic terrorism. There is no \nquestion about it.\n  So why wouldn't we want to add those kind of extremist activities in \nthis legislation so we can cover everyone?\n  That is really the opposition that we have had. For that reason, I \nurge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 4820.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAUL. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, Paris, Brussels, Chattanooga, San Bernardino. How many \nmore?\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time to act, and act today on this important \nlegislation that is bipartisan. It is important to point out--I know \nthe ranking member has good intentions, but our bill allows DHS to \ncombat terrorist recruitment by all dangerous organizations, as was \nbrought out at the markup.\n  The President's Homeland Security adviser, Lisa Monaco, said: ``Our \nefforts will be the most effective when they focus on amplifying \nauthentic voices,'' such as former violent extremists. These voices can \nconvince others from going down the path to violence.\n  The President's national security adviser, Susan Rice, added that \nthey are already amplifying the voices of ISIL defectors overseas. And \nshe explains that ``these voices are eroding ISIL's appeal.''\n  This countermessaging works, and it has worked for the State \nDepartment, but we are not doing it at home. We need to do it here at \nhome and not just overseas. That is why I urge strong support for this.\n  I don't understand after it being the product of a bipartisan task \nforce with bipartisan support out of the committee, the very week that \nthe Brussels attack occurred, we marked up this bill. Mr. Speaker, it \nis time to act. I urge passage of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. \n4820, the ``Combating Terrorist Recruitment Act of 2016,'' because \nregrettably the bill was not improved as I had hoped and expected \nbetween the Committee markup and, floor consideration.\n  Specifically, Section 2 of H.R. 4820, directs the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, inter alia, to employ ``Counter-messaging of foreign \nterrorist organization communications and narratives.''\n  However, the bill is silent on the issue of domestic terrorists and \nthe threat they pose to the safety and security of Americans.\n  This was a point raised by the minority members during the markup, \nbut an agreement could not be reached to include the words ``and \ndomestic terrorist'' in the bill.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and \nRanking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security, and Investigations, I appreciate the concerns the \nbill is intended to address but in my view the bill's scope is too \nlimited in view of the number and frequency of violent domestic \nextremist attacks such as the one occurring in the evening of June 17, \n2015 at the historic Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church \nin Charleston, South Carolina.\n  Combating violent extremism is too important to become the subject of \npartisan political disputes.\n  Instead, we should work together to find common ground that \nreconciles the competing interests of collective security and \nindividual liberties.\n  We must not focus on one religion as being a threat--this would be \nwrong and counterproductive.\n  Mr. Speaker, there have been other attacks by foreign and domestic \nviolent extremists.\n  The Fort Hood Texas attack committed by Major Nidal Malik Hasan, who \nopened fire and killed 13 U.S. military personnel.\n  The Boston Marathon attackers were two Chechen brothers Dzhokhar \nTsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev who carried out a bombing that took 3 \nlives and injured 264 others.\n  Later, the brothers killed university police officer Sean A. Collier.\n  On December 2, 2015, 14 people were killed and 22 were seriously \ninjured in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, which \nconsisted of a mass shooting and an attempted bombing.\n  The perpetrators, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, a married \ncouple living in the city of Redlands, who the San Bernardino County \nDepartment of Public Health training event and holiday party, of about \n80 employees.\n  This threat of attack by foreign terrorists on American soil is real \nand substantial and requires vigilance by the Administration and this \nCongress.\n  However, threats of domestic terrorist attacks are also real.\n  Mr. Speaker, we cannot be unmindful of the fact that since September \n2001, there have been 250 deaths at the hands of home grown violent \nextremists as opposed by 50 by foreign terrorists.\n  The seminal act of homegrown domestic terror occurred in 1995, when \nthe domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh detonated the truck bomb that \ndestroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 persons \nand injured over 680 people.\n  At the time, it is the largest loss of American lives at the hands of \na domestic terror group since the Civil War.\n  Today, the challenge is countering the messages of violent extremism \nno matter the source and not to fall for thinking that one type of \nviolent extremism is less of a threat than another type of violent \nextremism.\n  Radical and extremist groups, both domestic and international, \nsystematically prey upon the vulnerabilities of young persons by \noffering inducements such as financial assistance, familial-like bonds, \nor the promise of an exciting and heroic life.\n  In some cases, youth have been forcibly recruited or tricked into \nparticipating in terrorist activities, including suicide bombings.\n  The heinous attack in Mother Emmanuel Church was a defining moment in \nour nation's history for many reasons, but the final chapter will be \nwritten by those who are charged with keeping our nation and its people \nsafe while preserving the way of life that terrorist seek to change.\n  One of the enduring challenges for members of the Homeland Security \nCommittee is how we guide the work of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I hosted DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in Houston for two days of \ndiscussions, and tours that were insightful and probing on a range of \nregional and national homeland security issues.\n  The issue of violent extremism is one of several efforts that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has prioritized and begun efforts to \naddress both the international threat and the domestic threats.\n  DHS defines ``Domestic Terrorism'' as: ``Any act of violence that is \ndangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical \ninfrastructure or key resources committed by a group or individual \nbased and operating entirely within the United States or its \nterritories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist \ngroup.''\n  Groups and individuals inspired to commit terrorist acts are \nmotivated by a range of personal, religious, political, or other \nideological beliefs--there is no magic formula.\n  Further, the complexity of adding social media as a new source of \nrecruitment for violent extremists is complicating the efforts of law \nenforcement, domestic security and national defense.\n  The line between lawfully protected speech and activity that may be a \nthreat should be clearly defined by law.\n  Taking care to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights \nmeans that our system of laws must acknowledge that reading, writing, \nor speaking of one's views or beliefs even when they are unpopular is \nnot a crime.\n\n[[Page H1966]]\n\n  Hate speech is not a crime--while an act of violence motivated by \nhate is.\n  Violent extremist threats within the United States can come from a \nrange of violent extremist groups and individuals, including Domestic \nTerrorists and Homegrown Violent Extremists (HVEs).\n  The troubling violent nature of the attack at Mother Emanuel AME \nChurch, its location in the South, on a night devoted to prayer \nservices, by a young man still in his twenties awaken fears that many \nof us who represent majority minority congressional districts had hoped \nwere receding with the passage of time.\n  In the wake of the killings at Mother Emanuel in Charleston, several \nAfrican American Churches have fallen victim to fires.\n  Historically, African American churches are the center of religious, \nsocial, cultural and political life for the communities they serve.\n  Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, members serving in \nthis body were mindful of the history that we worked not to repeat.\n  Today, we are still working to assure the public that appropriate \nchecks must be made certain in how increased in government authority is \ncontrolled.\n  The demographics of young persons' becoming involved in terrorist \ngroups also appear to be changing.\n  In many cases the persons implicated are younger than reported in the \npast and there appear to be more female youth joining the ranks of \nterrorist organizations.\n  Additionally, more young supporters are coming from Western countries \nthat are further removed from actual conflict areas.\n  The Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas have recruited children as \nyoung as thirteen to be suicide bombers and children as young as eleven \nto smuggle explosives and weapons.\n  During 2003, thirteen-year-old twin sisters who had been recruited by \nal-Qaeda linked groups were caught attempting to commit a suicide \nbombing against Western businesses and local government buildings in \nMorocco.\n  Counter-recruitment and counter-radicalization initiatives should be \ntailored locally, and should engage members from across the community \nwho are in a position to address specific underlying factors or \nidentify potential radicalization indicators.\n  Counter-recruitment and radicalization initiatives must evolve with \nthe young audiences they are intended to reach, adapt along with the \nadversaries, incorporate new developments in technologies, and address \nchanges within environments where young persons are susceptible.\n  I encourage my colleagues to withdraw this bill and allow for it to \nbe considered under an open rule or for the bill to be sent back to the \ncommittee for further consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Perry). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) that the House suspend \nthe rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4820, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas \nand nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1966-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1966-H1969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SECURING AVIATION FROM FOREIGN ENTRY POINTS AND GUARDING AIRPORTS \n                 THROUGH ENHANCED SECURITY ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. KATKO.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I have come to appreciate the seriousness of the many \nthreats facing our transportation systems, I realize that one of the \nmost targeted and vulnerable points of attack exist for our \ninternational in-bound aviation. It is no secret that terror groups \nacross the world value the horrific symbolism of bringing down an \naircraft and are continuously plotting to take down planes. They \nrecognize that it is easier for them to attack an aircraft destined for \nthe United States from overseas rather than travel to the United States \nand then plot a domestic attack.\n  This understanding is nothing new. My own district of Syracuse, New \nYork, tragically learned of terrorists' determination to bring down \nairplanes when 35 Syracuse University students and students from other \nlocal universities, along with my close friend's sister, were killed in \nthe Lockerbie bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.\n  Now, with the horrific attacks in Belgium against two transportation \nmodes, including aviation, it has been reiterated that we must not wait \nfor such attacks to occur in the homeland. We must be as determined to \nmitigate the threat as extremists are in perpetrating their attacks \nagainst us. The Brussels attacks took place against the European \ncapital with one of the explosions occurring just a few blocks from the \nEuropean Parliament.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  I was near those sites not too long ago, where those explosions took \nplace, when visiting Brussels as part of a congressional delegation \nfocused on stemming the flow of ISIS-affiliated foreign fighters, so I \nam particularly reminded of how close to home such attacks really are.\n  While a number of security enhancements have been made in recent \nmonths by the Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security \nAdministration, and airlines, more must be done. SAFE GATES is an \nimportant, bipartisan bill which requires TSA's Office of Global \nStrategies to comprehensively assess its own mission needs, with the \nintent of directing resources in a more intelligence-driven, risk-based \nmanner.\n  Further, the legislation directs TSA to provide better communication \nand foster stronger partnerships with foreign partners and airlines in \norder to make sure that everyone with a stake in securing aviation is \naware of the serious threats facing our skies.\n  Lastly, the SAFE GATES Act authorizes the donation of critical \nsecurity screening equipment and bolsters TSA's authority to mandate \noverseas cargo security standards as a means of building capacity for \nthe security of aircraft headed for the United States.\n  Recently, our colleagues in the Senate added this language to \nauthorizing language for the Federal Aviation Administration. During \nthe amendment process, Chairman Thune of the Senate Commerce Committee \nadded the text of this bill, along with some additional provisions, to \npush TSA to work toward developing a new generation of security \nscreening checkpoints.\n  This provision incorporates critical stakeholder feedback by \nempowering the Aviation Security Advisory Committee to make \nrecommendations to the Administrator concerning checkpoints of the \nfuture. In preparation for bringing this legislation to the floor \ntoday, and in agreement with my Democratic colleagues, we have added \nthis thoughtful provision to our bill as well.\n  I would like to thank my bipartisan cosponsor, Congressman Keating, \nfor his unwavering support of this critically important legislation. \nMoreover, I wish to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. \nMcCaul, and the ranking member, Mr. Thompson, for moving this bill \nthrough committee so we can bring our efforts to bear on the House \nfloor today.\n  Lastly, I want to applaud Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson of \nthe Senate Commerce Committee for making sure that this bill text was \nadded as a security provision to the Senate's FAA legislation, and I \nlook forward to working closely with my Senate colleagues going forward \nto get this legislation to the President's desk.\n  This legislation stands as a testament to the rare ability of \nCongress to come together in a bicameral and bipartisan manner to make \nthe American people more secure. It also serves as a direct refute to \nthose terrorists plotting to harm the American people, the American \neconomy, and our right to move about freely without fear and without \nhindrance.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4698, the SAFE GATES Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us comes at a very important \ntime. Recent events have fueled increased interest in addressing \nterrorism threats at overseas airports. Just last month, a terrorist \ncell carried out three simultaneous, coordinated attacks on the \nBrussels airport and a major rail station that resulted in the death of \n32 people and injuries to over 300 people. At the airport, terrorists \nfilled large suitcases with nail bombs that were detonated in two \nseparate explosions on the public side of the airport. This\n\n[[Page H1968]]\n\nattack, in the heart of the European Union's capital, underscores the \nreality that the aviation sector continues to be a major terrorist \ntarget.\n  Previously, in February, a terrorist boarded a commercial aircraft \ndeparting from Mogadishu with a bomb concealed in a laptop. The \nterrorist detonated the bomb aboard the aircraft, killing himself and \ninjuring two others. Experts suggest that, had the terrorist detonated \nthe bomb at a higher altitude, the damage to the plane would have been \ncatastrophic and the aircraft would have been destroyed.\n  The deadliest aviation attack in recent memory took place in October \n2015, when Metrojet flight 9268, departing from Sharm el-Sheikh \nInternational Airport, was blown up over the northern Sinai. This \nhorrific tragedy resulted in the loss of 224 lives.\n  H.R. 4698 is responsive to these devastating incidents. It focuses on \nlast point of departure airports, or those airports that originate from \nforeign countries that fly to the U.S. nonstop, to airports within the \nU.S.\n  H.R. 4698 requires TSA to do a security assessment of these airports \nand take into account: the level of coordination and cooperation \nbetween the countries in which the airports are located and TSA; the \nintelligence capabilities of each country; information on the numbers \nof known or suspected terrorists transiting through such airports; and \nthe security screening capabilities at these airports.\n  The legislation also requires TSA to submit a plan to bolster and \nenhance security collaboration between the U.S. and its foreign and \ndomestic partners and authorizes TSA to donate security screening \nequipment to a foreign airport if it will reduce specific \nvulnerabilities to the security of the U.S. or U.S. citizens.\n  In addition to codifying TSA's efforts to bolster security at last \npoint of departure airports, H.R. 4698 also seeks to make enhancements \nto security screening at U.S. airports. Specifically, it directs TSA to \nrequest that the Aviation Security Advisory Committee develop \nrecommendations to make passenger screening processes more efficient \nand effective.\n  The areas that the ASAC would be considering include checkpoint \nconfiguration, technology innovation, and best practices within \naviation security.\n  As the lead author of legislation authorizing the ASAC, I strongly \nbelieve that this body, which is composed of key stakeholders from \nthroughout the aviation community, is a positive catalyst for \nimprovement within TSA.\n  Mr. Speaker, I close by saying that there is bipartisan support for \nthis legislation.\n  While on the subject of addressing overseas threats, I would note \nthat, in recent years, DHS has made great strides in pushing the \nborders out, that is, identifying and stopping overseas threats before \nthey reach our borders. Congress needs to support these efforts.\n  To that end, in the coming weeks, I will be introducing comprehensive \nlegislation to expand and strengthen DHS' overseas program aimed at \nvetting and screening travelers to the U.S. My legislation, entitled \nPushing Out America's Borders Act of 2016, seeks to accelerate DHS' \nefforts at expanding and establishing overseas posts for both CBP and \nICE to conduct critical traveler vetting and screening operations.\n  With the passage of H.R. 4698 today, the House is poised to raise the \nlevel of aviation security overseas. The next challenge for this body \nis to support DHS in its efforts to take more proactive approaches to \npushing out our Nation's border security.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Katko's cooperation in making sure that \nthis bill was brought to the floor. We had a couple of hiccups along \nthe way, but we worked them out. This is really how it should be done, \nand I appreciate the gentleman's help in getting us there.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. Threats to international-bound \naviation are proliferating every day, and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, TSA, and airlines need the adequate tools and authorities \nnecessary to ensure the safety and security of traveling Americans.\n  Without the authorities and oversight built into this legislation, I \nfear that Congress will not be doing all it can to stay ahead of the \npersistent threats posed by violent extremists. We have seen the threat \nthey pose in Brussels and in last year's attacks on airliners overseas. \nSo we must not wait to mitigate these threats until it is too late.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of \nCapitol Hill for working together to develop this important piece of \nlegislation. I again urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I want to thank the ranking member for his cooperation. Yes, we had \nsome hiccups, but that is part of the process. The fact of the matter \nis that we had a very good bill by working together and talking \ntogether. While the last colloquy on the last bill, H.R. 2820, showed \nwe do have differences, I dare say that on the Homeland Security \nCommittee we have far more agreements than we have disagreements, and I \nhope we can continue in that manner going forward.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4698, the \n``Securing Aviation from Foreign Entry Points and Guarding Airports \nthrough Enhanced Security Act of 2016.''\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, the \nRanking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security and Investigations, and a former chair of the \nHomeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Security, I have \nbeen committed to protecting and improving the security of our nation's \nairways.\n  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) needs all the \nsupport we can provide to aid them in protecting our nation against \nsecurity threats.\n  The critical work of TSA agents around the country provides security \nfor the nation's airports, maintains a security force to screen all \ncommercial airline passengers and baggage, and works with the \ntransportation, law enforcement and intelligence communities to ensure \nsafety.\n  In 2015, TSA officers screened 708,316,339 million passengers (more \nthan 1.9 million per day) at more than 450 airports across the nation--\nwhich is 40,780,330 million more passengers than for the same timeframe \nin 2014.\n  In addition to screening more than 708 million passengers last year, \nTSA officers also screened 1.6 billion carry-on bags, 432 million \nchecked bags and 12.9 million airport employees.\n  Obtaining critical information about TSA's procedures and planning \nwhile handling enhanced security screenings throughout the country will \nonly make us stronger and safer.\n  The Congressional District I represent in Houston, Texas is home to \ntwo of the world's busiest airports.\n  The Bush International and the William P. Hobby Airports are \nessential hubs for domestic and international air travel for Houston \nand the region.\n  Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through Bush International \nAirport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P. \nHobby (HOU).\n  IAH is the 11th busiest airport in the U.S. for total passenger \ntraffic with more than 650 daily departures.\n  Since January, IAH has seen a significant increase in both \ninternational and domestic travelers. International travel in the first \nhalf of 2015 increased by 3.9 percent compared to the same period last \nyear. More than 5.1 million international passengers boarded flights \nout of IAH.\n  It is estimated that at the current rate, IAH could see nearly 10.2 \nmillion international passengers by the end of the year.\n  In October 2015, in an effort to re-establish the airport's daily \ninternational air service, the William P. Hobby Airport opened a new \n280,000 foot complex that includes five gates for its international \nconcourse.\n  This addition is expected to support travel service for nearly 7,500 \ninternational passengers and 25 departing flights a day.\n  Enhanced security protects our economic interests, more importantly; \nimplementing this bill will protect our citizens.\n  H.R. 4698 will direct the TSA to conduct a comprehensive security \nrisk assessment of all last point of departure airports with nonstop \nflights to the United States.\n  H.R. 4698 will also require TSA to submit to Congress and the \nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) a plan to:\n  --enhance collaboration, coordination, and information-sharing about \ninternational-inbound aviation between the United States and domestic \nand foreign partners in order to enhance security capabilities at \nforeign airports,\n  --assess TSA ability to enter into a mutual agreement with a foreign \ngovernment entity to permit TSA representatives to conduct inspections \nof foreign airports without prior notice.\n\n[[Page H1969]]\n\n  Through H.R. 4698:\n  GAO will review TSA efforts to enhance security capabilities at \nforeign airports and secure international-inbound aviation.\n  TSA will submit to Congress a comprehensive workforce assessment of \nall TSA personnel within its Office of Global Strategies or whose \nprimary professional duties contribute to the TSA's global efforts to \nsecure transportation security, including whether they are assigned in \na risk-based, intelligence-driven matter.\n  TSA may donate security screening equipment to a foreign last point \nof departure airport operator if the equipment can be expected to \nmitigate a specific vulnerability to U.S. security or U.S. citizens.\n  TSA may evaluate foreign countries' air cargo programs to determine \nwhether they provide a level of security commensurate with that \nrequired by U.S. air cargo security programs.\n  Mr. Speaker, we cannot wait until our security is breached by \nterrorists before we act, otherwise we would not have learned the \nlessons of September 11, 2001.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Committee to join me in supporting this \nimportant step forward to protecting our airports.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia). The question \nis on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) \nthat the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4698, as \namended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1969-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1969-H1978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROMOTING RESILIENCE AND EFFICIENCY IN PREPARING FOR ATTACKS AND \n                     RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES ACT\n\n  Ms. McSALLY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3583, the Promoting \nResilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to \nEmergencies, or PREPARE Act, which I introduced during my tenure as \nchairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on \nEmergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications.\n  The PREPARE Act is part of the Committee on Homeland Security's \neffort to authorize and ensure the efficiency of the Department of \nHomeland Security's operations. The provisions of this bill were \ninformed by the subcommittee's oversight this Congress and discussions \nwith stakeholders.\n  This was a bipartisan process, and I am pleased that the \nsubcommittee's ranking member, Congressman Payne, joined me in \nsponsoring this bill. This bill is an example of how we should be \nworking together in Congress to get things done.\n  The PREPARE Act makes a number of improvements to the operations at \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of Health Affairs, and \nOffice of Emergency Communications. The bill authorizes, for the first \ntime, Operation Stonegarden, which provides grants to law enforcement \nagencies along the border to enhance border security. These funds are \nvital to the security of border communities, like the ones in my \ndistrict in southern Arizona.\n  We must ensure that grant programs like the State Homeland Security \nGrant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative are providing a \nreturn on investment and assisting in the closure of capability gaps. \nThat is why the bill requires FEMA to analyze data included in yearly \nState Preparedness Reports and Threat and Hazard Identification and \nRisk Assessments to gauge year-over-year improvements.\n  The bill also requires FEMA to share information on grants management \nbest practices with grant recipients so that they may benefit from \ninnovative practices used by other grantees. In addition, the bill sets \nthe period of performance for these grant programs at 3 years, to \nensure grant recipients have sufficient time to make sound investments.\n  To ensure FEMA is operating efficiently and effectively, the bill \nrequires the Administrator to designate an individual to serve as \nFEMA's chief management official and take steps to address the findings \nand recommendations of a number of GAO reports. The bill also requires \nFEMA to update its strategic human capital plan so it has the workforce \nit needs to complete its important mission.\n  It is vital that our Nation's first responders have the tools that \nthey need to communicate. That is why the bill seeks to ensure that the \nFirst Responder Network Authority and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity work together to secure the nationwide public safety broadband \nnetwork that is under development against cyberattacks.\n  After hearing much concern from first responders who rely on the \ntechnical assistance and programming of the Office of Emergency \nCommunication, the bill prohibits the Secretary of Homeland Security \nfrom reorganizing OEC without prior authorization.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  A 2015 GAO review of interoperability at the Department noted that \nCBP and ICE personnel reported the lack of interoperability along the \nborder resulted in missed apprehensions and jeopardized agent safety.\n  As a result, the bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to \nensure that DHS' radio users, such as Border Patrol agents, CBP \nofficers, and ICE agents receive ongoing training on the use of radio \nsystems, including interagency radio use protocols.\n  This provision builds upon legislation signed into the law by the \nPresident that requires DHS to develop a strategy to achieve and \nmaintain interoperability among its components.\n  To address the chemical and biological threats we face, the PREPARE \nAct authorizes responsibilities of the Department's Chief Medical \nOfficer and establishes a pilot program to provide anthrax vaccines to \nfirst responders on a voluntary basis.\n  I want to thank my successor, Chairman Donovan, for his leadership in \ncontinuing to shepherd the PREPARE Act to the floor today.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Shuster, Chairman Upton, and \nChairman Hensarling for working with us to advance this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, the PREPARE Act builds efficiencies and increases \ncoordination for preparedness improvements while providing greater \naccountability for taxpayers.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of \n           Representatives,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2016.\n     Hon.

In addition, the \n     Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on H.R. 3583 \n     and requests your support when such a request is made.\n       I would appreciate your response confirming this \n     understanding with respect to H.R. 3583 and ask that a copy \n     of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the \n     House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Homeland Security,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2016.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Upton: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 3583, the ``PREPARE Act.'' I appreciate your support in \n     bringing this legislation before the House of \n     Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce will forego consideration of \n     the bill.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at \n     this time, the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not \n     waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in \n     this bill or similar legislation in the future.

Michael McCaul,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Ford House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCaul: I am writing concerning H.R. 3583, \n     the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for \n     Attacks and Responding to Emergencies Act.\n       As a result of your having consulted with the Committee on \n     Financial Services concerning provisions in the bill that \n     fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to forgo action \n     on the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House \n     Floor. The Committee on Financial Services takes this action \n     with our mutual understanding that, by foregoing \n     consideration of H.R. 3583 at this time, we do not waive any \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or \n     similar legislation, and that our Committee will be \n     appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar \n     legislation moves forward so that we may address any \n     remaining issues that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. \n     Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of \n     an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving this or similar legislation, and \n     requests your support for any such request.\n       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter \n     confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 3583 and \n     would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this \n     matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor \n     consideration thereof.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Homeland Security,\n\n                                    Washington, DC. April 6, 2016.\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hensarling: Thank you for your letter \n     regarding H.R. 3583, the ``Promoting Resilience and \n     Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and Responding to \n     Emergencies Act.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this \n     legislation before the House of Representatives, and \n     accordingly, understand the Committee on Financial Services \n     will forgo action on the bill.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual \n     understanding that by forgoing action on this bill, the \n     Committee on Financial Services does not waive any \n     jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill \n     or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a \n     conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your \n     request to have the Committee on Financial Services \n     represented on the conference committee.\n       I will insert copies of this exchange into the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the \n     House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T. McCaul,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. \n3853, the Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks \nand Responding to Emergencies Act, and I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, the \nPromoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and \nResponding to Emergencies Act, also known as the PREPARE Act.\n  Before I begin, I would like to commend former Emergency Preparedness \nSubcommittee Chairperson McSally and Ranking Member Payne, Jr., for \ntheir close collaboration in developing this legislation.\n  H.R. 3583 is the product of extensive bipartisan oversight carried \nout by the subcommittee and will make communities better prepared to \nrespond to manmade and natural disasters.\n  In particular, this measure makes a number of improvements related to \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency's administration of the \nHomeland Security Grant Program, authorizes activities of the National \nDomestic Preparedness Consortium and the Rural Domestic Preparedness \nConsortium, and addresses ongoing interoperability challenges both \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security and the State and local \nlevel.\n  A provision I authored at the full committee to improve the Homeland \nSecurity Grant Program is also included. That provision directs FEMA to \nenter into a memorandum of understanding with the DHS' Office of Civil \nRights and Civil Liberties regarding policy and guidance in the Urban \nAreas Security Initiative and the State Homeland Security Grant \nProgram.\n  Under current grant guidance, grantees are permitted to use funding \nfor activities related to countering violent extremism.\n  By requiring FEMA to consult with DHS' Office of Civil Rights and \nCivil Liberties in developing its grant guidance related to CVE, we \nwill ensure that the activities carried out by the grantees do not \ntarget ordinary citizens simply because of their religion or ethnic \nbackground.\n  Additionally, to address shortcomings of the National Incident \nManagement System, commonly called NIMS, revealed at a series of full \ncommittee hearings examining the heroic response of the 2013 Boston \nMarathon bombings, the committee accepted an amendment I authored \nrequiring FEMA to review and revise NIMS once every 5 years.\n  Regular review of NIMS will ensure that its protocols are responsive \nto the current threat environment, incident management requirements, \nand lessons learned from previous incidents.\n  Finally, the bill includes important provisions to improve Federal \ninteroperable communications capabilities added by Subcommittee Ranking \nMember Payne, Jr.\n  To improve interoperable communications on the State and local level, \nH.R. 3583 includes Mr. Payne's Statewide Interoperable Communications \nAct, which facilitates coordination of emergency communication \npurchases and policies within a State.\n  The bill also addresses interoperability challenges at DHS by \nrequiring that the Undersecretary for Management verify that all radio \nusers at the Department receive initial and ongoing training in the use \nof DHS' radio systems.\n  I commend Ranking Member Payne, Jr., on his work on the bill and his \nongoing efforts to address the interoperability challenges that \ncontinue to hamstring Federal, State, and local first responders.\n  H.R. 3583 will go far in helping first responders do their job better \nand safer\n\n[[Page H1976]]\n\nand will make our communities better prepared and more resilient.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the PREPARE Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan), the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman McSally for yielding.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on \nEmergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in \nstrong support of H.R. 3583, the PREPARE Act, of which I am pleased to \nbe an original sponsor.\n  Introduced by the subcommittee's former Chairwoman, Representative \nMcSally, the PREPARE Act seeks to enhance accountability at the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, Office of Emergency Communications, and \nOffice of Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee \nis fortunate to work with a very engaged stakeholder community, and \nmany of the provisions of this bill were formed through hearings, \nbriefings, and meetings with those stakeholders.\n  For example, the bill sets the period of performance for a number of \ngrant programs at 3 years. We heard from numerous stakeholder groups \nthat FEMA's reduction of the period of performance from 3 years to 2 \nyears inhibited their ability to make meaningful grant investments.\n  I am pleased that FEMA has changed the period of performance back to \n3 years, and the PREPARE Act codifies that timeline.\n  The PREPARE Act prohibits FEMA from implementing its National \nPreparedness Grant Program proposal, which was widely opposed by first \nresponders.\n  It seeks to ensure greater outreach by the Department to law \nenforcement agencies through the Office of State and local law \nenforcement.\n  It prohibits the Undersecretary of National Protection and Programs \nDirectorate from reorganizing or changing the location of the Office of \nEmergency Communications without authorization of Congress.\n  Stakeholder groups such as the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, International Association of Fire Chiefs, Major Cities Chiefs, \nand National Sheriffs' Association have expressed their great concern \nabout the impact this proposed reorganization would have on the Office \nof Emergency Communications and its work with first responders to \nachieve and maintain interoperability communications.\n\n  It authorizes the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, which \nprovides vital training for first responders, and it authorizes a \nvoluntary anthrax vaccination program for first responders to help \nprotect those who protect us.\n  The PREPARE Act also includes flood insurance provisions of great \nimportance to my constituents. Superstorm Sandy devastated Staten \nIsland and South Brooklyn 3\\1/2\\ years ago, claiming dozens of lives \nand destroying thousands of homes.\n  Unfortunately, since then, my constituents have gone through the \nstorm after the storm. Damage inspectors shamelessly doctored their \nreports to blame pre-existing conditions for Sandy's destruction, \ncheating Sandy victims out of insurance proceedings they rightfully \ndeserved.\n  By applying lessons learned in the aftermath of that fateful day, \ntitle V of the PREPARE Act will make two important improvements to the \nNational Flood Insurance Program.\n  First, this legislation will empower and protect policyholders by \nrequiring engineers and inspectors employed to assess flood insurance \nclaims to provide policyholders with copies of the reports listing \nflood damage to their homes. This will prevent fraud and increase \nefficiency and transparency by giving policyholders more information \nabout their claims at a critical stage in the process.\n  Second, this legislation will improve the flood insurance claims \nappeal process by fixing an archaic and confusing court filing deadline \nthat prevents policyholders from using the FEMA appeals process for \nfear of missing their opportunity to seek relief in Federal court.\n  The bill will set a firm start date for the claim's statute of \nlimitations and pause the statute of limitations while policyholders \npursue their appeal at the agency level.\n  Ultimately, this legislation will reduce costly litigation, saving \ntaxpayers and policyholders money.\n  I am pleased to work with Chairwoman McSally and Ranking Member Payne \non this bipartisan legislation. I would like to thank Chairman McCaul \nand Ranking Member Thompson for their leadership in moving it forward.\n  I would particularly like to thank Chairman Hensarling and \nSubcommittee Chairman Luetkemeyer of the Financial Services Committee \nfor working with me to advance the flood insurance process reforms in \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 3583.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3583 seeks to resolve gaps in the Department of \nHomeland Security's efforts to build State and local capabilities to \nprevent, protect against, and respond to manmade and natural disasters.\n  Again, this bipartisan legislation is a product of careful oversight \nand significant stakeholder outreach. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe PREPARE Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support \nH.R. 3583.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nPromoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and \nResponding to Emergencies Act (PREPARE Act/H.R. 3583). In addition to \nenhancing accountability at the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(FEMA), the Office of Emergency Communications, and the Office of \nHealth Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), this \nlegislation makes critical reforms to the National Flood Insurance \nProgram's (NFIP) claims process.\n  Nearly three and a half years have passed since Superstorm Sandy \ndevastated New Jersey, New York, and other parts of the Northeast, yet \nthousands of victims are still fighting for fair and equitable \ntreatment from the NFIP. Following Sandy, these homeowners were further \nvictimized by the unconscionable misconduct of certain insurance \ncompanies and engineering firms who defrauded them, all of which was \nenabled by FEMA's inadequate control and oversight.\n  The Sandy Claims Review Process was launched after my colleagues and \nI pushed FEMA to reopen a robust and thorough claims process to review \nall potential Sandy-related underpayments. To date, over 19,000 NFIP \npolicyholders have entered the review process. More than 7,000 \npolicyholders have been offered additional claims payments, with over \n$46 million in actual payments made and over $89 million in proposed \npayments. Homeowners who pursued litigation outside of the claims \nprocess have received nearly $160 million in settlements.\n  Those who dutifully paid their premiums with the expectation that the \nNFIP would be there following a disaster deserve every penny owed to \nthem. The tens of millions of dollars paid out thus far should have \nbeen in the hands of policyholders years ago. These homeowners were \nbetrayed following Sandy, and reforms are necessary to restore consumer \ntrust and taxpayer confidence in the NFIP.\n  In a report released last month, the DHS Office of Inspector General \n(OIG) found that FEMA does not provide adequate oversight of its NFIP \nWrite Your Own (WYO) Program. As a result, FEMA ``is unable to ensure \nthat WYO companies are properly implementing the NFIP and is unable to \nidentify systemic problems in the program. Furthermore, without \nadequate internal controls in place, FEMA's NFIP funds may be at risk \nfor fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement.''\n   Of particular concern are altered or falsified engineering reports \nthat resulted in dramatically lower claim payments for Sandy victims. \nLast year, 60 Minutes' ``The Storm after the Storm'' reported on \nallegations of engineering reports receiving drastic alterations after \nbeing submitted to the insurer by the on-site engineer inspector. \nFEMA's then-Deputy Associate Administrator for Insurance told 60 \nMinutes that he was not going to ``conceal that fact that it happened. \nBecause in the last three weeks, I've seen evidence of it.'' This was \nsubsequently confirmed in delegation briefings I hosted with FEMA.\n\n[[Page H1977]]\n\n  Title V of the PREPARE Act will require any final engineering reports \nand/or claims adjustment reports--certified and free of alterations--to \nbe provided to the policyholder first, before any employer or agency. \nIt also amends the claims appeal process to provide policyholders with \nmore time to consider legal remedies. Together these provisions will \nhelp reform a fundamentally broken system and provide policyholders \nwith the transparency and fairness they are entitled to throughout the \nNFIP claims process.\n  FEMA must deliver on its promises. That begins with the completion of \nthe ongoing Sandy Claims Review Process and a resolution to Sandy-\nrelated litigation. Every suspected instance of fraud must be \ninvestigated and bad actors must be expelled. FEMA must closely monitor \nthe performance of specific inspectors and adjustors that may not be \nillegal, but simply shoddy and incompetent. The NFIP Transformation \nTask Force must continue its implementation of OIG's seven \nrecommendations to improve its oversight. Together with the PREPARE \nAct, these actions can restore accountability and ensure lasting \nreform.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3583, \nthe ``Promoting Resilience and Efficiency in Preparing for Attacks and \nResponding to Emergencies Act,'' also known as the ``PREPARE Act.''\n  I became Ranking Member of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee in \nthe beginning of 2013.\n  I took on that position because I represent the 10th Congressional of \nNew Jersey, which according to the New York Times, encompasses the two \nmost dangerous miles in America.\n  From major mass transit arteries and chemical facilities to homes and \nschools, my district is vulnerable to a variety of man-made and natural \ndisasters.\n  Our community's first responders must be prepared to respond to every \nworst-case scenario. That is why I was proud to work with Ms. McSally \nto author the ``PREPARE Act.''\n  In my capacity as Ranking Member of the Emergency Preparedness \nSubcommittee, I have had the opportunity to hear from first responders \nand emergency managers across the country, as well as doctors, public \nhealth experts, and individuals advocating to ensure the needs of \nchildren are incorporated into disaster response plans.\n  I am pleased to say that H.R. 3583 is responsive to the calls to \naction we have heard on the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee.\n  For example, the Subcommittee has conducted extensive oversight of \nprogress related to interoperable communications, and we have learned \nthat the important governance structures--developed with support of the \nInteroperable Emergency Communications Grant Program--have suffered \nsince the program was eliminated in 2011.\n  To preserve the progress States have made on emergency communications \nplanning and coordination, H.R. 3583 includes my Statewide \nInteroperable Communications Enhancement Act, which passed the House as \na stand-alone measure in July.\n  H.R. 3583 also includes language I offered to address communications \ntraining gaps at DHS by requiring all radio users to receive initial \nand ongoing training consistent with the DHS Interoperable \nCommunications Strategy, which was required under legislation I wrote \nlast year.\n  The ``PREPARE Act'' also makes important progress in the area of \nbiopreparedness, particularly related to improving how DHS manages its \nmedical countermeasures program and establishing a voluntary anthrax \nvaccination program for first responders.\n  To address concerns the Subcommittee heard from organizations like \nSave the Children related to the unique needs of children during \ndisasters, the Committee accepted an amendment I offered directing FEMA \nto appoint a technical expert to ensure that children are incorporated \ninto disaster preparedness, planning, response, and recovery \nactivities.\n  As the father of triplets, I have worked hard to improve the way the \nFederal government helps schools keep children safe during disasters \nand to address gaps in disaster planning that affect children. I \nappreciate the Committee's support for my efforts to ensure H.R. 3583 \nimproves the way the needs of children are integrated into emergency \nplanning.\n  Finally, the bill guarantees homeland security grant program \nrecipients three years to use their grant funds, which will help ensure \nthat limited funds are spent effectively and deliberately.\n  H.R. 3583 also includes common-sense provisions requiring grantees to \nhave maintenance plans in place before using Federal money to procure \nimportant emergency response equipment, directing FEMA to include grant \nmanagement best practices in its annual Notice of Funding Opportunity, \nand charging FEMA to provide information to Congress on how grant funds \nare closing capability gaps.\n  On the subject of the Homeland Security Grant Program, I would like \nto once again, on the record, voice my opposition to the funding cuts \nproposed in the President's FY 2017 budget request.\n  First responders across the country have made clear over and over \nagain that these important grant dollars are critical to building and \nmaintaining preparedness and response capabilities.\n  State and local governments are already struggling to absorb cuts to \nhomeland security grant funding that have occurred over the last \ndecade, and every first responder I have spoken to tells me that \nplanning, training, and exercise opportunities would further suffer \nwith more cuts.\n  I urge appropriators to reject the proposed funding cuts and to \nprovide additional funding to these grant programs.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to congratulate the former \nSubcommittee Chairman McSally on bringing this legislation to the \nfloor, and I thank her for working with me as she developed the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3583.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations, I rise in support of H.R. 3583, the PREPARE Act, a bill \nthat provides an important additional tool in preparing for attacks and \nresponding to emergencies.\n  I support this legislation, because it requires multiple emergency \nagencies to coordinate and improve overall preparedness for attacks and \nemergencies.\n  Specifically, H.R. 3583 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to \nrequire the Federal Emergency management Agency (FEMA) to enter into \nmemoranda of understanding with U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n(CBP), the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, the \nOffice of Intelligence and Analysis, the Office of Emergency \nCommunication (OEC), the Office for State and Local Law Enforcement, \nthe Countering Violent Extremism Coordinator, the Office for Civil \nRights and Civil Liberties, and other Department of Homeland Security \noffices and components to delineate their responsibilities for awarding \ngrants to:\n  Public Transportation Agencies to improve security under \nRecommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007.\n  High-risk urban areas and state, local, and tribal governments to \nprotect against terrorism under the UASI and the State Homeland \nSecurity Grant Program.\n  Implementation of Area Maritime Transportation Security Plans and \nfacility security plans, provide port security services, and train law \nenforcement personnel.\n  The PREPARE Act is a smart bill that will enable the Department of \nHomeland Security to establish a social media working group to identify \nand provide guidance and best practices for the emergency preparedness \nand response community.\n  The social media group will submit an annual report that includes:\n  A review and analysis of social media technologies used to support \npreparedness, response, and recovery activities.\n  A review of best practices and lessons learned.\n  Recommendations to improve DHS's use of social media technologies for \nemergency management purposes.\n  Recommendations to improve public awareness of the type of \ninformation disseminated through such technologies, and recommendations \non how to access such information during emergencies.\n  A review of available training for government officials.\n  A review of coordination efforts with the private sector to discuss \nand resolve legal, operational, technical, privacy, and security \nconcerns.\n  In today's increasingly advanced and complex technology, social media \nis easily and heavily utilized by terrorists as a dangerous recruiting \ntool.\n  Mr. Speaker, the PREPARE Act will equip the Department of Homeland \nSecurity with vital tools and resources to prevent and remove social \nmedia threats and recruitment tactics implemented by terrorist groups.\n  The PREPARE Act will further require FEMA to integrate the needs of \nchildren into its activities to protect against natural disasters, acts \nof terrorism, and other man-made disasters, including by appointing a \ntechnical expert to coordinate such activities.\n  This is a comprehensive bill that will protect all Americans in every \ncorner of this nation.\n  I urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 3583.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3583, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the\n\n[[Page H1978]]\n\nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1978-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1978-H1979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL BISON LEGACY ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) bison are considered a historical symbol of the United \n     States;\n       (2) bison were integrally linked with the economic and \n     spiritual lives of many Indian tribes through trade and \n     sacred ceremonies;\n       (3) there are more than 60 Indian tribes participating in \n     the Intertribal Buffalo Council;\n       (4) numerous members of Indian tribes are involved in bison \n     restoration on tribal land;\n       (5) members of Indian tribes have a combined herd on more \n     than 1,000,000 acres of tribal land;\n       (6) the Intertribal Buffalo Council is a tribal \n     organization incorporated pursuant to section 17 of the Act \n     of June 18, 1934 (commonly known as the ``Indian \n     Reorganization Act'') (25 U.S.C. 477);\n       (7) bison can play an important role in improving the types \n     of grasses found in landscapes to the benefit of grasslands;\n       (8) a small group of ranchers helped save bison from \n     extinction in the late 1800s by gathering the remnants of the \n     decimated herds;\n       (9) bison hold significant economic value for private \n     producers and rural communities;\n       (10) according to the 2012 Census of Agriculture of the \n     Department of Agriculture, as of 2012, 162,110 head of bison \n     were under the stewardship of private producers, creating \n     jobs and providing a sustainable and healthy meat source \n     contributing to the food security of the United States;\n       (11) on December 8, 1905, William Hornaday, Theodore \n     Roosevelt, and others formed the American Bison Society in \n     response to the near extinction of bison in the United \n     States;\n       (12) on October 11, 1907, the American Bison Society sent \n     15 captive-bred bison from the New York Zoological Park, now \n     known as the ``Bronx Zoo'', to the first wildlife refuge in \n     the United States, which was known as the ``Wichita Mountains \n     Wildlife Refuge'', resulting in the first successful \n     reintroduction of a mammal species on the brink of extinction \n     back into the natural habitat of the species;\n       (13) in 2005, the American Bison Society was reestablished, \n     bringing together bison ranchers, managers from Indian \n     tribes, Federal and State agencies, conservation \n     organizations, and natural and social scientists from the \n     United States, Canada, and Mexico to create a vision for the \n     North American bison in the 21st century;\n       (14) there are bison herds in National Wildlife Refuges and \n     National Parks;\n       (15) there are bison in State-managed herds across 11 \n     States;\n       (16) there is a growing effort to celebrate and officially \n     recognize the historical, cultural, and economic significance \n     of the North American bison to the heritage of the United \n     States;\n       (17) a bison is portrayed on 2 State flags;\n       (18) the bison has been adopted by 3 States as the official \n     mammal or animal of those States;\n       (19) a bison has been depicted on the official seal of the \n     Department of the Interior since 1912;\n       (20) the buffalo nickel played an important role in \n     modernizing the currency of the United States;\n       (21) several sports teams have the bison as a mascot, which \n     highlights the iconic significance of bison in the United \n     States;\n       (22) in the 2nd session of the 113th Congress, 22 Senators \n     led a successful effort to enact a resolution to designate \n     November 1, 2014, as the third annual National Bison Day; and\n       (23) members of Indian tribes, bison producers, \n     conservationists, sportsmen, educators, and other public and \n     private partners have participated in the annual National \n     Bison Day celebration at several events across the United \n     States and are committed to continuing this tradition \n     annually on the first Saturday of November.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT AND ADOPTION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN \n                   BISON AS THE NATIONAL MAMMAL.\n\n       (a) In General.--The mammal commonly known as the ``North \n     American bison'' is adopted as the national mammal of the \n     United States.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the \n     adoption of the North American bison as the national mammal \n     of the United States shall be construed or used as a reason \n     to alter, change, modify, or otherwise affect any plan, \n     policy, management decision, regulation, or other action by \n     the Federal Government.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I would prefer to have the primary sponsor \nof this bill, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), speak first.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and \nI thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, \nMr. Chaffetz.\n  Today I rise in support of the National Bison Legacy Act. This bill \nwill adopt the North American bison as the national mammal of the \nUnited States.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem) for \nher cosponsorship of this legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  The bison are dear to me because they have a historical and spiritual \nlink to the United States Colored Troops who were first organized in \n1863 to 1866 as the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the four all-Black \ninfantry regiments.\n  Despite facing relentless racism and woefully inadequate military \nsupplies, nicknamed the Buffalo Soldiers because of their tireless \nmarching and dogged trail skills, they had earned the name of the \nrugged and revered buffalo. By way of reference, my great-great-\ngrandfather and his brother were members of the Buffalo Soldiers after \ncoming out of slavery.\n  The North American bison is a unifying symbol in the United States. \nOnce numbering in the tens of millions, bison were nearly extinguished \nby the 1880s, with the travesty borne most by Native Americans whose \nfate was intertwined with the buffalo.\n  In 1905, visionary ranchers, tribes, industrialists, sport hunters, \nand conservationists joined President Theodore Roosevelt in a \nmonumental effort to reverse the American bison's demise. Now over 60 \ntribes are working to restore bison to over 1 million acres of Native \nAmerican lands. Bison production on private ranches is in its strongest \neconomic condition in more than a decade.\n  The National Bison Legacy Act enjoys broad bipartisan support in both \nChambers of Congress, as well as support from a coalition of over 60 \norganizations, including Native American tribes, ranchers, and \ngovernment agencies. The list keeps growing. I look forward to working \nwith all of you to make this bill become law and honor a great American \nicon, the bison.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time and ask unanimous \nconsent that the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) \ncontrol the remainder of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she may \nconsume to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).\n  Mrs. NOEM. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I support the National Bison Legacy Act because it \nis a very important bill to the tribes in my State and also to the \nheritage of South Dakota and the United States. It is a bill that I \nhelped Representative Clay of Missouri introduce, and I thank him for \nall of his hard work on the legislation. It has been a long process, \nbut we are finally here today to get it across the House floor.\n  I am thrilled to sponsor this bill with my colleagues, to raise up an \nenduring symbol of our Nation's Native American heritage, the American \nfrontier, and the resilience that has long distinguished America from \nothers around the globe.\n  The Tatanka is important both physically and spiritually in Native \nAmerican culture. These animals offered food, shelter, tools, and \nclothing. Native Americans could make soap from the fat and homes from \ntheir hides. Every piece was used, which is why bison were, and \ncontinue to be, a symbol of survival and a cultural example of how to \nlive in a healthy and productive manner. This bill recognizes that.\n  There are also lessons to be learned about resilience from these \nanimals.\n\n[[Page H1979]]\n\nBison roamed across most of North America before nearly being wiped \nfrom existence. Through the efforts of tribes, ranchers, \nconservationists, and others, the species has survived and can once \nagain be lifted as a literal and cultural example of productivity from \nwhich each of us can learn.\n  I am proud that my family has raised bison as well. They are majestic \nanimals that represent the Plains that we are so proud of and that I am \nso honored to represent today.\n  I want to thank the chairman and his staff for bringing this bill to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In conclusion, let me just say one of the most majestic animals on \nthe face of the planet is the American bison. You go to see it and you \njust sit in awe and you think of the rich history and the role that it \nhas played in our Nation. It serves as a symbol on two of our State \nflags, and it is the seal of the Department of the Interior.\n  I just want to say that I hope all Americans--especially the youth--\nget a chance to see one of the bison out in the wild. It was close to \nextinction, but it was brought back. There are hundreds of thousands of \nthem now. Whether you go to South Dakota or up to Yellowstone, Montana, \nthere are places where you can really see these bison out. It really is \nan amazing sight. I think it is appropriate that we move this bill \ntoday.\n  I want to thank Mr. Clay of Missouri and, in particular, Mrs. Noem of \nSouth Dakota for her recognizing the importance of this issue. I also \nwant to thank Mrs. Lummis of Wyoming. She offered an important \namendment that made an adjustment to the bill. I think this is a smart \nthing for the Congress to do, and I urge its passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2908, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1979-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1979-H1981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     VIRGIN ISLANDS OF THE UNITED STATES CENTENNIAL COMMISSION ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I prefer to have the gentlewoman from the \nVirgin Islands, who is the chief sponsor of this bill, speak first on \nthis issue.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nand thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on behalf of H.R. 2615, the Virgin \nIslands of the United States Centennial Commission Act. H.R. 2615 will \nestablish a short-term commission to research, plan, develop, and carry \nout activities related to the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands \nbecoming part of the United States.\n  The commission will revisit the history leading up to and directly \nfollowing the transfer of the islands from Denmark to the United \nStates. Its purpose will be to educate those unaware of that history on \na national level of the importance of the territories to the \ngeopolitical advancement of this great Nation.\n  The history of the Virgin Islands and its people is profound, Mr. \nSpeaker. It tells a story of a land so resource-rich and unique in its \ngeography that it was occupied by seven different nations. It tells the \nstory of a resilient people who insurrected slavery and colonial \noppression to achieve self-governance.\n  In 1493, when Christopher Columbus landed on the island of St. Croix, \nwhich was then called Aye Aye by its native inhabitants, it is the only \nplace in what is now the United States in which Christopher Columbus \nlanded, but it is also reported to be the first place that he met armed \nresistance. He renamed islands, part of a chain, the Virgin Islands.\n  In 1733, on the island of St. John, the slaves rose up, taking \ncontrol of the island for almost a year until European powers worked \ntogether and the Danish received the help of the French and Spanish \nArmada to help quell what would have been and was one of the first \nslave uprisings in the New World.\n  In the mid-1700s, a young boy on the island of St. Croix by the name \nof Alexander Hamilton received the support of merchant patrons on the \nisland who put together sufficient money to finance his travel and \neducation to the Colonies. He brought to the Colonies his understanding \nof finance and a monetary system learned from apprenticeship from those \nmerchants, as well as the unique accounting theories from the West \nAfrican slaves of the island.\n  Those economic gifts, along with his fighting spirit for revolution, \nliberty, and abolitionist fervor served him and this country well, as \nhe would soon become the first United States Secretary of the Treasury \nand creator of our modern financial system.\n  Virgin Islanders have played an integral role in the history of this \nNation well before we were even part of this country. From its \ninception and beyond, activists and politicians, David Levy Yulee, the \nfirst Jewish United States Senator; Denmark Vesey, leader of the \nCharleston, South Carolina, slave revolt; Judah Benjamin, Secretary of \nTreasury of the Confederate Army, are all Virgin Islanders.\n  William Leidesdorff, the founder of San Francisco, and Edward Wilmot \nBlyden, one of the founders of Liberia, are also from the Virgin \nIslands.\n  After purchase by the United States in 1917, the contributions of \nVirgin Islanders have continued through individuals like David Hamilton \nJackson, who was a staunch free press advocate and labor movement \nleader; Hubert Harrison, a key figure in the movement of the Harlem \nRenaissance; military veterans like Alton Adams, who was the first \nAfrican American naval bandleader; and General Samuel Ebbesen.\n  Ambassador Terence Todman and Congress of Racial Equality chief, Roy \nInnis, are Virgin Islanders. Actor Kelsey Grammer and future NBA Hall-\nof-Famer Timothy Duncan are all from the Virgin Islands.\n  The first female physician of this body as a Member of Congress, my \npredecessor, Donna Christensen, is a Virgin Islander.\n  During the time of exploration and slave trade, our geographic \nlocation made us a hub of Western Hemisphere commerce for several \ncenturies and served a crucial role in naval military activity in the \nCaribbean Basin.\n  So nearly a century ago, the United States purchased the Virgin \nIslands from Denmark for its geographic importance. On March 31, 2017, \nthe Virgin Islands of the United States will celebrate 100 years as a \npossession and part of the union of the United States.\n  This bill, H.R. 2615, establishes the Virgin Islands of the United \nStates Centennial Commission to research, plan, develop, and carry out \nactivities the commission considers appropriate to commemorate--and I \nsay commemorate, not celebrate--commemorate a more solemn and worthy \nendeavor, the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands of the United \nStates becoming an unincorporated territory of the United States.\n  Now, I have spent a lot of time talking about the Virgin Islands' \nhistory and people because at the time of its transfer nearly 100 years \nago, little thought was given to the history, and even less to the \npeople of the Virgin Islands.\n  As the Islanders during that time, my ancestors, my grandparents, \nwatched the Danish flag come down and the Stars and Stripes unfold and \nripple over the Fort in Christiansted and over many places in the \nVirgin Islands, they thought out loud: We knew what we had, but we \ndon't know what we are going to get.\n  Our elders and leaders hoped and believed that the purchase by the \nUnited States would herald greater opportunities and profound \nmodernization. Unfortunately, this has not happened.\n\n  It took a decade of petitioning and lobbying to be given citizenship, \nand we asked for--we asked for it and petitioned again to be part of \nthe draft.\n  What people willingly offer their sons to fight and die, except those \nwholly willing to be part of the entire American experience?\n  Even now we have greater casualties per capita than any other group \nin this Nation in a volunteer military and is an example in part of our \nvalor and patriotism.\n  Through passage of H.R. 2615, the commission will serve as a vehicle \nto begin the work to tell the story and serve to expose the aspirations \nand dreams of the American people who call the Virgin Islands home.\n  The commission will begin a national conservation, a discussion to \nassist in commemorating the great relationship between the United \nStates and its islands--its American islands.\n  The commission will allow a platform for meaningful dialogue around \nthe Virgin Islands' history with the United States, the genesis of the \nissues affecting the territory, as well as how we solve them.\n  This is an opportunity to engage lawmakers and our Nation around the \nchallenges and enormous opportunities present in the Virgin Islands--\nopportunities like our ports and transshipment position, our broadband \ncapacity, our intellectual and artistic pursuits, our university which \nserves as the only\n\n[[Page H1981]]\n\nHBCU in the Caribbean, and, most important, our people. Yes, the people \nstill waiting to be recognized and made whole in that transfer nearly a \ncentury ago.\n  As the Virgin Islands enters this next century under United States \njurisdiction, it will have continued relevance in the region as foreign \ninvestments, commerce, information technology, and maritime traffic \ngrow in the Caribbean. It is my hope and it is my dream that its people \nwill have greater relevance in this great Nation and that this \ncommission will show all the importance of that.\n  I would like to thank all of the members of the committee for \nsupporting this bill, voting it unanimously out of committee, and thank \nRanking Member Cummings and especially the chairman, Mr. Chaffetz, for \nworking with my staff and me on this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  This bipartisan commission, which will be comprised of House and \nSenate Members along with the administration and other officials, seems \nonly fitting, as the 100th anniversary comes only once.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2615.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  How can you reject that? She said it as eloquently and as \npassionately from her heart as you possibly could. I am pleased that we \ncould move this forward.\n  In short, this bill creates a bipartisan congressional commission to \nplan and carry out commemorative activities for the 100th anniversary \nof the Virgin Islands becoming an unincorporated territory of the \nUnited States. The transfer of the Virgin Islands from Denmark to the \nUnited States in 1917 was a significant historic and cultural event.\n  Under the bill, the bipartisan commission will develop, plan, and \nexecute formal commemorative activities to honor the rich heritage of \nthe Virgin Islands. The commission's goal is to highlight the cultural, \neconomic, and historical importance of the Virgin Islands. By \ncelebrating this anniversary, the commission also has the opportunity \nto educate the citizens about the history of the United States Virgin \nIslands.\n  The commission may solicit and accept gifts and donations to fund its \nactivities, but there is a prohibition, as the legislation bars any use \nof Federal funds.\n  Again, I thank our colleague, Stacey Plaskett, the Delegate from the \nVirgin Islands, for her passion and caring. It is one of the most \nbeautiful places on the face of the planet--second, of course, to \nUtah's Third Congressional District. But, nevertheless, I think that is \nwhy they accepted this. I hope everybody gets a chance to visit there.\n  My daughter--on a personal note--was able to work there this past \nsummer for 3 months. She thoroughly enjoyed the people, the culture, \nand the sheer beauty that is the Virgin Islands.\n  I look forward to supporting this piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2615, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1981-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1981-H1983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Limitation on administrative leave.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. \nPlaskett) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to\n\n[[Page H1982]]\n\nrevise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the \nbill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 4359 is a commonsense solution to address the misuse of \nadministrative leave for misconduct or performance issues.\n  Unfortunately, it has been commonplace for the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee to hear stories of Federal employees who \nremain on administrative leave for months, or years, at a time.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. The overwhelming majority of people who \nwork for the Federal Government are good, honest, decent, patriotic \npeople who care. They work hard, they are trying to serve their \ncountry, and they put in an honest day's work. But we do have some bad \napples. Every once in a while, they show up, and they start working for \nthe Federal Government. They create problems and they create mayhem.\n  Unfortunately, we have to tighten the rules surrounding their \nsituation because we have had a number of Federal employees that have \nremained on administrative leave sometimes not just for days, sometimes \nnot just for weeks. Sometimes this drags on for months and for years--\nyears--to be on administrative leave. While on administrative leave, \nthese employees receive full pay and benefits despite the fact that \nthey are not working. There are going to be extraordinary \ncircumstances, but this is happening far too often.\n  It is particularly difficult to understand how the IRS could, for \nexample, justify allowing Lois Lerner to sit on administrative leave \nfor 4 months before her retirement. She was an individual who abused \nher power as a Federal employee by engaging in the political targeting \nof American citizens.\n  But she is not alone. This is certainly not a bill just about her \nsituation. Every year, hundreds, if not thousands, of Federal employees \nare under investigation for significant misconduct and remain on \nadministrative leave for far longer than is necessary to complete an \ninvestigation.\n  One reason administrative leave has become such a significant problem \nis because agencies simply find it easier to keep an employee on \nadministrative leave. It is the path of least resistance. This means \nthat some individuals face little to no penalty for significant \nmisconduct and are all too often permitted to remain on administrative \nleave until they are able to retire.\n  Mr. Speaker, abuse of administrative leave is a real problem. H.R. \n4359 will protect American taxpayer dollars from being further wasted.\n  Consider one example highlighted by the inspector general for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, who found an employee earning $120,000 \na year annually while watching pornography on the job. This employee \nwas placed on administrative leave for a year--a year. I believe, in \nthis particular case, this person actually admitted to doing it. It \nwasn't just a casual oops. This person was watching for literally hours \nupon hours each day and admitted it. They put him on administrative \nleave, and this went on for a year.\n  Why should the American taxpayers have to pay for that? It is a clear \nwaste of our dollars. The American people deserve better, and so do the \nemployees who work around this person.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office report, the GAO, \nwhich reviewed the use of administrative leave between the years 2011 \nand 2013, 263 Federal employees were on administrative leave for more \nthan a year at the 24 agencies reviewed. GAO found that those \nindividuals on administrative leave cost the people, the American \ntaxpayers, more than $31 million.\n  Why should we have to pay for that? It is an astonishing amount of \nmoney to pay for Federal employees, and they are doing absolutely \nnothing. They can, essentially, go wherever they want to go, and it is, \nessentially, a paid vacation.\n  It also sends the wrong message to the hardworking Americans from \nwhom we levee taxes. We cannot use tax dollars to pay misbehaving or \npoor-performing Federal employees. There are often situations that come \nup where the employees need a fair chance to defend themselves. But \nagain, under this bill, it gives them plenty of time to do that. If \nthere needs to be an extension, there can be an extension; but if there \nis not timely disciplinary action, if any disciplinary action at all, \nfor their performance issues, the American taxpayers are left holding \nthe bag and the expense.\n  Mr. Speaker, agencies are abusing the system of administrative leave \nand failing to explain why.\n  In a report conducted by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, agencies \nwere found to be opaque about why they were using administrative leave, \nor completely nonresponsive, when Senator Grassley inquired about 58 \nemployees at the Department of Defense that they had on administrative \nleave for more than a year. Think about that. At the DOD, the \nDepartment of Defense, they had 58 employees who had been on \nadministrative leave for more than a year, and the Department of \nDefense just decided not to respond, just literally did not respond.\n  Mr. Speaker, I understand the need and utility of administrative \nleave. When used properly, administrative leave provides agencies with \nthe flexibility needed to better manage human resources and to get to \nthe bottom of certain situations, but it has become a tool that \nagencies hide behind with far too little oversight and accountability.\n  The shortcomings of the current system need to end, and this bill \nthat I am the chief sponsor of will curb these abuses. Specifically, \nthis legislation will limit the use of administrative leave for \nmisconduct or performance issues to 14 days per year in order to push \nagencies to complete their investigations quickly or to find acceptable \nalternate work for the individual to perform during such an \ninvestigation. This is fair to the employee, as well as the management, \nas well as the American taxpayers. Rather than allowing indefinite \nleave, agencies will have to take disciplinary action against bad \nactors, which will serve to bring greater accountability to the Federal \nworkforce.\n\n  The bill is also critical to protecting whistleblowers. The Office of \nSpecial Counsel, or the OSC, has a responsibility in the Federal \nGovernment to investigate potential reprisal and petition the Merit \nSystems Protection Board to stop retaliatory actions. However, being \nput on administrative leave does not constitute a personnel action that \nis reviewable by the OSC.\n  Thus, as long as a whistleblower is placed on administrative leave, \nhe or she is left in limbo at the discretion of the agency with no \nright to appeal their status. Because of this, I believe that the bill \nbefore us, H.R. 4359, will go a long way to help reducing retaliation \nand protect whistleblowers by barring agencies from leaving employees \non indefinite administrative leave.\n  Mr. Speaker, getting this legislation to the floor today, I am proud \nto say we have been able to work collaboratively in a bipartisan way. I \nparticularly want to thank Mr. Lynch of Massachusetts for his passion \non this issue and working with us. We incorporated some of those \nsuggestions into the bill today.\n  We have altered the bill to give the agencies the option to extend \nthe use of administrative leave beyond 14 days in discrete 30-day \nperiods. Under these provisions, the agencies will be required to \nreport to Congress after the use of the first 30-day extension, \ndetailing why the extension is necessary, the stage of any \ninvestigation against the employee, the reasons the employee cannot \nreturn to the workplace, as well as other pertinent information.\n  Again, I want to thank Mr. Lynch for his work on this legislation. I \nbelieve that this is a stronger bill and more fair to the employees. I \nthink it was an important step forward.\n  I thank Mr. Cummings, the committee as a whole, and the many members \nwho were involved in getting the bill to this point today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I think we can all agree that agency overuse of administrative leave \ncan be a problem and that we need to pursue ways that agencies can use \nadministrative leave more efficiently, while preserving due process \nprotections for Federal employees.\n\n[[Page H1983]]\n\n  I want to thank the chairman for working with the minority, and \nparticularly with Representative Lynch, to address our concerns that \nthe original bill could have encouraged agencies to suspend employees \nwithout pay and without due process.\n  The bill, as reported, would preserve the ability of an agency to \nplace employees on administrative leave in those exceptional \ncircumstances when they may pose a threat to safety, agency mission, or \ngovernment property. It would also allow the agency to consider the \nresults of a thorough and complete investigation prior to taking \ndisciplinary action. The bill, however, would not punish employees by \nstripping them of pay before allegations are properly adjudicated, \npreserving the principle that one is innocent until proven guilty.\n  The bill before us strikes the appropriate balance, we believe, \nbetween the need for stricter oversight of agency use of administrative \nleave and the due process rights of Federal employees. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4359.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 4359. We have \nworked in a good, bipartisan way. It is a good bill for the country and \nis good for the employees of the Federal Government.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House \nsuspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4359, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1983-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1983-H1984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OFFICIAL PERSONNEL FILE ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Review of official personnel file of former \n       Federal employees before rehiring\n\n       ``(a) If a former Government employee is a candidate for a \n     position within the competitive service or the excepted \n     service, prior to making any determination with respect to \n     the appointment or reinstatement of such employee to such \n     position, the appointing authority shall review and consider \n     the information relating to such employee's former period or \n     periods of service in such employee's official personnel \n     record file.\n       ``(b) In subsection (a), the term `former Government \n     employee' means an individual whose most recent position with \n     the Government prior to becoming a candidate as described \n     under subsection (a) was within the competitive service or \n     the excepted service.\n       ``(c) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe \n     regulations to carry out the purpose of this section.''.\n       (b) Application.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to any former Government employee (as described \n     in section 3330e of title 5, United States Code, as added by \n     such subsection) appointed or reinstated on or after the date \n     that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections of \n     subchapter I of chapter 33 of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n``3330e.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. \nPlaskett) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The vast majority of Federal workers are patriotic, they are honest, \nthey are decent, they work hard, they show up early, they do what they \nare supposed to do, and they are proud to serve their country and \nprovide their role in when they do. For that, we are very grateful.\n  But like any large group of people, there are some bad apples. If you \ngo through the barrel, you are going to find a few bad apples. We have \na responsibility to make sure that we weed those out. These individuals \nmust be treated fairly, but they must be held accountable. H.R. 4360 is \na bill that accomplishes this balance and that strengthens the \nintegrity of our civil service.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Under the current system, a loophole allows Federal employees who are\n\n[[Page H1984]]\n\nguilty of serious, but not necessarily criminal, infractions to leave \nFederal service before an investigation is completed and join a new \nagency without that new agency ever becoming aware of those previous \nissues. Unfortunately, in our work on the Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform, we have had some examples of this.\n  H.R. 4360 corrects this problem by requiring a notation to be made in \nthe employee's official personnel file if an investigation leads to an \nadverse finding against that person even if the employee has already \nresigned. For example, under the current system, Federal employees who \ncommit some form of misconduct or poor performance could resign from \ntheir positions and escape accountability.\n  This is exactly what occurred at the United States Patent and \nTrademark Office. As part of an investigation, the Department of \nCommerce, Office of the Inspector General requested that a patent \nexaminer attend a voluntary interview with the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral. However, 2 hours before the interview with the OIG, the patent \nexaminer resigned. In an instant message with a coworker, the examiner \nexplained that the union recommended that he resign in order to have a \nclean slate, with no record of conduct or performance issues, if he \napplied to work for another agency.\n  We cannot continue to have a system that creates loopholes for an \nindividual to elude accountability by simply having to submit a piece \nof paper on a napkin--or something as simple as that--and writing, ``I \nhereby resign,'' and then keeping his record clean so he can get \nanother job.\n  Mr. Speaker, another example is of a similar event that unfolded with \nan Interior Department employee who was under investigation for lying \nabout his education credentials. After being interviewed by the \nInterior Department's Office of Inspector General, this individual \nresigned from the Interior and later joined the Census Bureau; but when \nhe went over to the Census Bureau, the Census Bureau was unaware of the \nhistory until well after it had hired this person.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4360 remedies the scenarios I just discussed, \nthereby helping to protect agencies from making employment hires when \nhaving incomplete pictures of the individuals' backgrounds. This has \nhappened on several occasions. It is almost disappointing that one has \nto go forward and legislate this, but given that it is happening, it is \nthe responsible thing to do, and we have come together in a good, \nbipartisan way to make this happen.\n  Specifically under this legislation, separated employees will have \nnotations made in their official personnel files if they resign while \nunder investigation and if those investigations lead to adverse \nfindings. Additionally, if the individuals apply for other positions in \nthe Federal Government, those notations will follow them as agencies \nwill now be required to examine the personnel files of former Federal \nemployees during the hiring process.\n  Bad actors should not be able to resign from government service with \nclean slates and effectively dupe another agency that will then be \nhiring them. However, this bill also ensures that separated employees \nare provided the opportunity to contest the findings of an \ninvestigation. I think that is a fair and just way for them to be able \nto clean their records if they think that they have cases to be made. \nBy working closely with my Democratic colleagues, we were able to build \na process into this legislation that gives former employees a mechanism \nby which to fairly present their cases in the event an investigation \nleads to an adverse finding.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is also important to note that H.R. 4360 does nothing \nto diminish the rights or protections that are afforded to \nwhistleblowers. This is a bill to prevent individuals from maneuvering \nwithin the Federal Government in order to hide their misconduct. It is \nthat simple. I urge its passage.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 4360, the Official Personnel File Enhancement Act, addresses a \nlegitimate concern of employees who resign their positions during \npending investigations or adverse disciplinary actions and then reapply \nfor employment elsewhere in the Federal Government.\n  I think we can agree that measures need to be taken to prevent such \nincidents from happening in order to protect the integrity of the \nFederal workforce.\n  I thank Chairman Chaffetz for working with the minority and, \nparticularly, for working with Congressman Connolly from Virginia to \naddress our concerns with the original bill.\n  The introduced version of this legislation would have allowed an \nagency to put a permanent notation of an investigative finding in an \nemployee's file without giving the employee an opportunity to respond. \nThe bill, as reported, would preserve the principles of due process \nthat help to protect our Federal employees from arbitrary acts and \npolitical influence. It would provide a former employee with notice and \nopportunity to respond to an adverse investigative finding before a \nnotation is placed in the individual's personnel file. The legislation \nalso gives the individual the right to appeal the agency's decision to \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board, which we believe is the appropriate \nplace for that.\n  These due process protections are consistent with our Constitution \nand with the fundamental American principle that a person is innocent \nuntil proven guilty.\n  I understand that some concerns have been raised regarding how the \nlegislation would be implemented. We hope to address those concerns as \nthe bill moves forward in the legislative process.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4360.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 4360. I believe this is a good bill. We \nworked in a good, bipartisan way. It does make the system more fair and \nit makes it more accountable. It makes sure, for those who have adverse \nactions, that they can't simply skirt away from their responsibilities. \nIt does hold people accountable. To that effect, it is a good bill, and \nI urge its passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4360, the \nOfficial Personnel File Enhancement Act.\n  As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, myself and other \ncommittee members are constantly reading reports of and investigating \ninstances of employee misconduct and performance shortcomings. Yet too \noften, these investigations come up empty because the employee decided \nto resign or otherwise leave federal service before the investigation \nis over, thereby ending the investigation. I cannot tell you how \nfrustrating this is.\n  These investigations must be completed, and any employee seeking to \nreturn to federal service must have the results of that investigation \nas a part their record. We owe it to the American taxpayer to ensure \nthat the federal government only hires the most qualified and honorable \nemployees. H.R. 4360 will allow that to happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 4360, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1984-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1984-H1987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PROTECT AND PRESERVE INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTY ACT\n\n  Mr. ROYCE.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous material into the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I acknowledge the ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel from New York, for \nhis outstanding leadership on this legislation. With its passage today, \nhis H.R. 1493, the Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property \nAct, will head to the President's desk for his signature.\n  This is a critical measure. The Islamic State, or ISIS, continues to \nwreak havoc throughout Iraq and Syria. It is laying a path of death and \ndestruction in its wake, and it has inspired deadly attacks around the \nworld and deadly attacks here at home.\n  No offense is more appalling than the terrorists' complete disregard \nfor human life. As this body has recognized, ISIS is waging a genocide \nagainst religious minorities in the Middle East. I recently had the \nopportunity to talk to some of those Yazidi girls and Christian \nminorities about what they had been through, as well as to talk to \nSunni and Kurdish families. It has unleashed a campaign of sickening \nviolence against Muslims who do not share its radical beliefs and \nagainst the other religious minorities across the Middle East and \nbeyond.\n  Besides the human toll of ISIS' deplorable acts, we also mourn the \ntremendous loss of cultural heritage as these extremists loot and \ndestroy their way through ancient sites in the territories that they \nconquer. We have seen sickening footage of ISIS' drilling its way \nthrough priceless artifacts in Mosul and in its bulldozing of \nmagnificent Mesopotamian ruins in the 3,000-year-old city of Nimrud.\n\n[[Page H1986]]\n\n  ISIS claims the annihilation of cultural sites is meant to counter \nidol worship, but clearly these terrorists have another goal: to remove \nall traces of the region's rich and diverse religious and cultural \npast. It is in line with what the Nazis tried to do in burning the \nbooks across Europe in trying to burn history that predated them. By \neliminating all evidence of religious pluralism and by eliminating all \nevidence of humanity's common heritage, it is paving the way for its \nown horrifying brand of radical Islamist extremism.\n  The looting of antiquities is big business for ISIS. Experts estimate \nthat the group has earned millions of dollars from the sale of stolen \nartifacts every year, which are often peddled by middlemen in old-\nfashioned markets or online. Unfortunately, buyers in the U.S. appear \nto be a primary end destination for many of these pieces, as does \nEurope, as does Asia.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just returned from the Middle East. I was honored to \nspeak at the Iraq Museum in Baghdad about the need to counter ISIS' \ntrafficking of priceless antiquities. This region is steeped in history \nfrom the rise and fall of empires to the evolution of writing and \nmathematics and art. Much of this heritage remains at risk due to \nlooting by ISIS and, I should add, by other parties to the conflict in \nSyria, including the murderous Assad regime.\n  That is why last year, Ranking Member Eliot Engel and I introduced \nthis legislation, which will help the U.S. do its part to counter this \nblack market trade. Specifically, this legislation will prevent those \nantiquities that have been removed since the start of Syria's civil war \nfrom being sold or imported into the United States. This will reduce \nfunding to ISIS and will disincentivize future looting.\n  Again, I thank the ranking member, as well as Representatives Smith \nand Keating, for all of their work on this measure. I also acknowledge \nthe bill's Senate cosponsors--Senators Casey and Perdue and Grassley, \nas well as Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Cardin of the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations--whose leadership was instrumental to \nthis measure's passage by Mr. Engel in the Senate.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of this legislation.\n  First of all, I thank our chairman, Ed Royce, for his leadership on \nthe Committee on Foreign Affairs and for pushing this bill ahead. I \ndon't want to underestimate how important he has been in making sure \nthat this bill reaches the floor. I thank Congressman Chris Smith for \njoining me as a lead Republican cosponsor on this measure, and I thank \nour Senate colleagues for their work to help get us to this point.\n  This legislation is another great example of the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs' working across the aisle to get results because we believe, \nagain, that foreign policy should be bipartisan and that partisanship \nshould stop at the water's edge. When the House finishes its work on \nthis bill today, it will be on its way to the President's desk, and \nthat is something of which we should all be proud.\n  Mr. Speaker, since the time ISIS emerged as a factor in Iraq and in \nSyria, we have read reports, have seen images, and have watched videos \nof ISIS terrorists in their destroying of ancient structures and \nartifacts in the areas they control. It is actually heartbreaking. \nThese fanatics literally want to wipe away history. They want to \ndestroy any trace of culture or belief system that doesn't conform to \ntheir twisted ideology and twisted way of thinking, but that is not the \nwhole story.\n  ISIS has also seized on cultural artifacts as a funding source. If \nyou look at satellite pictures of heritage sites that ISIS controls, \nyou can pick out thousands of small holes in the desert. ISIS has \nlooted these areas, has dug up coins and statues and anything else it \ncan carry, and has trafficked those items on the black market. As a \nresult, millions of dollars have flowed into ISIS' coffers.\n  So a few years ago I knew we needed to do more to combat this serious \nproblem. With the help of several colleagues--and, again, I emphasize \nhow helpful the chairman has been--I set out to help preserve this \nhistory and, at the same time, to cut off a vital revenue stream for \nthese terrorists. I was confident we could do it because we have done \nit before.\n  During the Iraq war, we also saw the looting of antiquities. So we \npassed legislation then to impose import restrictions on those items \ncoming in from Iraq.\n\n                              {time}  1816\n\n  I decided that we needed to take similar steps with respect to items \ncoming out of Syria. So we got to work, talking to experts and \nofficials to find the best ways of stopping looted goods arriving on \nour shores and to make sure those goods aren't sold to help ISIS' \ncampaign of violence.\n  It is really disgraceful that anyone in the United States would buy \nthese things. Those proven practices and innovative approaches are at \nthe core of this bill.\n  These restrictions would bring the United States in line with the \nU.N. Security Council resolution passed unanimously last year. That \nresolution called on all States to deny funding to ISIS by preventing \ntrade in Iraqi and Syrian cultural property.\n  Our European partners have already stepped up and enacted similar \nmeasures. That is good news because it is going to take a wide-ranging \neffort to effectively crack down on this illegal marketplace.\n  My bill would also encourage administration agencies already working \non this problem to collaborate more closely so that our efforts are \nmore streamlined and efficient. Finally, it is important to note that \nthe legislation would not prevent the importation of Syrian artifacts \nfor preservation or restoration.\n  So this is a good bill. I have been working on it for several years. \nI am proud of everything that has gone into it by my colleagues and our \nstaff members.\n  I am glad, once again, that we are working in a bipartisan way to \npass legislation that advances our interests, and I am very grateful \nthat we are so close to the finish line on this bill.\n  So I want to thank everybody. I want to especially thank Chairman \nRoyce once again. I ask that all Members support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is always a great feeling to cross the \nfinish line on a piece of legislation. At our best, that is what the \nForeign Affairs Committee does, and we are at our best here this day.\n  So I again want to thank Chairman Royce for his leadership and \npartnership. I want to thank our Senate colleagues for doing their \npart. I want to thank the staff that worked so hard on this bill.\n  We should be seizing every available opportunity to cut off resources \nto ISIS and other terrorist groups. This legislation goes after a \npractice that has put millions of dollars in ISIS' hands and has \nresulted in the irreversible destruction of some of history's greatest \nartifacts.\n  So it destroys these artifacts, which is bad enough, but then it puts \nmoney in ISIS' hands. They actually make money by doing it. It is \naiding and abetting terrorism. So it is a double whammy.\n  We knew from past experience that the approach laid out in this bill \nworks. It is long past due that we ramp up our efforts to stop the \nlooting, stop the trafficking, and stop the destruction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send it to the \nPresident. I know that the President will sign it. It is very \nimportant. I hope we will soon see this legislation enacted and on the \nbooks.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume\n  Again, I thank Mr. Eliot Engel of New York for this legislation.\n  The ancient cities now facing destruction at the hands of ISIS are \nconsidered the birthplace of modern civilization. As we stand here on \nthe floor of the House, we see behind us the relief of the great \nlawgivers.\n  First, there is Moses. Next to him is Hammurabi for Hammurabi's Code, \nthe great lawgivers and heroes of liberty. We think about the fact \nthat, in this part of the world, these antiquities are now in the hands \nof ISIS.\n\n[[Page H1987]]\n\n  As one expert told the Financial Services Committee's Task Force to \nInvestigate Terrorism Financing last week, this is where the Acadian \nKing Hammurabi ruled at the beginning of the second millennium BC and \nwhere the Hebrew prophet Jonah preached successfully repentance to the \nAssyrian Ninevites 1,000 years later.\n  Now, in 2015, ISIS has as many as 4,500 cultural sites under its \ncontrol. A raid carried out last year by U.S. Special Forces revealed \nthat ISIS has invested heavily in the looting and smuggling of \nantiquities in the region as they cut up antiquities and then try to \ntrade them for hard currency.\n  The legislation before us today is an important step toward curbing \nthis illicit trade and limiting funding to these terrorists. I do want \nto note that the bill's emergency import restrictions are not designed \nto continue in perpetuity and can be waived under certain conditions \nfor the temporary safeguarding of cultural property in the United \nStates.\n  The bill also presses the administration to increase accountability \nfor U.S. efforts to protect cultural property overseas and improves \ncongressional oversight of this work.\n  I appreciate the other committees of jurisdiction for working with \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee on this measure, particularly the \nCommittee on Ways and Means for its assistance on the cultural import \nrestrictions in this bill.\n  Lastly, I want to recognize the work of the committee staff on this \nimportant legislation, particularly Jessica Kelch, who, along with Mark \nIozzi on Mr. Engel's staff and Kristen Marquardt on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee staff, worked out all the complexities to deliver what I am \nconfident will be effective legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 years, the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) and I have had the honor of co-\nchairing the Congressional Charity Golf Classic with Members and former \nMembers.\n  This year, the tournament was a great success. We had over 200 \nparticipants, counting Members, former Members, military, and \nvolunteers. The charity chosen by the United States Association of \nFormer Members of Congress for the past 9 years has been Warfighter \nSports, which is an organization that enables our most severely wounded \nmilitary people--those who have lost legs or arms or who have been \nblinded--to participate in sports. This year, we were able to raise \n$137,000 for that great charity.\n  The Republicans won the Speaker's Trophy, which I have here, by a \nscore of 158-109. The number one team was headed by the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), and the number two team was headed by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Crenshaw).\n  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), the co-\nchairman.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-chair the \nCongressional Charity Golf Classic. The real winners of this golf \ntournament are the wounded warriors we golfed with. Over the last \nnumber of years, since we have changed the format, we have been able to \nsee the changes in them.\n  There is a competitiveness between Republicans and Democrats, but we \nalso play with a lot of people who have literally put their life on the \nline for our country. They have illnesses and disabilities that this \nprogram benefits.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Tennessee. Coming from Texas, I \nwill quit saying the best thing from Tennessee came out in 1836. It was \na lot of fun, and I thank the gentleman for doing this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1988-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1988-H1989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INVESTOR CLARITY AND BANK PARITY ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, in Houston, Harris County, and \nsurrounding counties last week, eight of our fellow citizens lost their \nlives.\n  I want to offer our thoughts and prayers on behalf of the families of \nGerman Antonio Franco, Claudia Melgar, Sunita Vikas, Malhara Singh, \nPedro Rascon Morales, Charles Edward Odum, Suresh Kumar Talluri, and \nTeri White Rodriguez. They are all loving members of families, who now \nhave lost their lives, and the families are saddened by their loss.\n  In the course of this, I want to thank the first responders for their \ncourageous efforts in, one, seeking to find these individuals, and also \nhelping those who have been impacted by the flooding.\n  The efforts of Houstonians who came to the aid of neighbors and \nstrangers during the flooding saved more lives and provided comfort to \nthose impacted.\n  We offer a special thanks to the diverse religious communities that \nresponded with generosity, by feeding and helping thousands of \nhouseholds left homeless.\n  We are also very grateful for the presence and laudable work of the \nAmerican Red Cross and, as well, the City of Houston and Harris County, \nthe mayor and county judge, all who were participating in this effort \nalong with other elected officials.\n  When tragedy strikes, we come together, congressional persons, State \npersons, local elected officials, because we are Texans.\n  It was very sad to lose this many people in a storm that was \nunexpected.\n  In Ecclesiastes Chapter 3: ``To every thing there is a season, and a \ntime to every purpose under the heaven . . . a time to weep, and a time \nto laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.''\n  I would ask, as we begin to try and rebuild our lives, that we have a \nmoment of silence; if my colleagues would stand in a moment of silence \nfor those names that I have called: German Antonio Franco, Claudia \nMelgar, Sunita Vikas, Malhara Singh, Pedro Rascon Morales, Charles \nEdward Odum, Suresh Kumar Talluri, and Teri White Rodriguez.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of my colleagues in \nthe Texas Congressional Delegation in remembrance of those who lost \ntheir lives during the Flooding tragedy that occurred in the city of \nHouston and the surrounding area.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are offered on behalf of and for the \nfamilies of:\n  1.

Teri White Rodriguez\n  I thank all of the first responders for their courageous and \neffective efforts to bring assistance and support to those impacted by \nthe flooding last week.\n  The efforts of Houstonians who came to the aid of neighbors and \nstrangers during the flooding saved lives and provided comfort to those \nimpacted.\n  We offer a special thanks to the diverse religious community of \nHouston who responded with generosity and compassion to over 1000 \nhouseholds left homeless by the flooding.\n  We are also very grateful for the presence and laudable work of the \nAmerican Red Cross whose volunteers some of which were also victims of \nthe flooding immediately began to offer aid and assistance to flood \nvictims.\n  As elected officials we share a common bond with our constituents \nthat motivate our work on their behalf each day.\n  When tragedy strikes we in the Texas Delegation cease to see the \nvictims as being from a city, town or rural community but as Texans who \nare in trouble or in need of help.\n  Ecclesiastics Chapter 3:\n\n       To everything there is a season, and a time to every \n     purpose under the heaven . . .\n       A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a \n     time to dance.\n\n  This past week has been a time of weeping for far too many \nHoustonians and those impacted in the State of Texas by flooding, which \ncaused more than $5 billion in damage and loss of life.\n  Today the House stands as one to express our condolences to those \nimpacted by the flooding and to show our commitment that we will do all \nthat we can to ease the suffering of those affected and work to \nminimize the damage caused by flooding in our State of Texas and every \nother state.\n  I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of those who \nperished in the Houston floods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1989-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1989-H1990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GERMANY HAS A MORAL OBLIGATION TO HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, along with Congressman Ted Deutch, I\n\n[[Page H1990]]\n\nintroduced H. Con. Res. 129, a resolution urging Germany to honor its \ncommitments and fulfill its moral obligations to Holocaust survivors. \nGermany, even by the current government's own admission, has fallen \nshort of Chancellor Adenauer's promise to take care of all of the needs \nof all Holocaust survivors.\n  Due to the horrific physical and mental pain that they have endured, \nHolocaust survivor needs are more complex than other elderly \nindividuals. There can be no more delay, Mr. Speaker. All Holocaust \nsurvivors must be provided all of the medical, mental, and home care \nneeds that they require.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are nearly 15,000 Holocaust survivors in my home \nState of Florida alone. There are many in my district, like my good \nfriends, Jack Rubin, David Mermelstein, David Schaecter, Herbie \nKarliner, Joe Sachs, and Alex Gross.\n  I made a vow that I would continue to fight on behalf of them and all \nHolocaust survivors, and I urge my colleagues to join me in urging \nGermany to honor its commitments to all Holocaust survivors and to \nplease cosponsor this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1990-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LANGEVIN.

Each \nyear, this event keeps getting bigger and bigger, both because the \nawareness continues to grow, but also because autism continues to grow \nas a challenge.\n  Thanks to the executive director, Joanne Quinn, and the entire team \nof the Autism Project, thousands of Rhode Islanders joined together for \na fun-filled day to increase awareness of autism spectrum disorder.\n  Every year, they inspire me to fight for programs and resources that \nwill lead to a better future for families living with autism, and I \nencourage all of my colleagues to join me in this fight by supporting \nAutism Awareness not just in April, but every month of the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1990-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATIONS TO THE MINNETONKA GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN.

The Skippers won the title with a very hard-fought \nvictory over conference rival Hopkins by a score of 61-52.\n  The Minnetonka team overcame history to win the title. Hopkins was \nseeking its fifth title in 6 years, while Minnetonka had only made the \ntournament once in school history. But this Minnetonka team was \ndetermined, right from the tip-off, and finished the game off with a \nstrong run to secure the championship for the school and for the \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, this basketball team is blessed with a number of \ntalented players who worked hard to get to this point, including some \nthat will continue to play at the college level. But even more than \nthat, they are student athletes who have lived up to their obligations \nin both the classroom and also in our community.\n  The coaches, parents, and fans of the Minnetonka team are very proud. \nWe wish them well in their accomplishment.\n  Congratulations again to the Minnetonka High School girls basketball \nteam.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1990-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        KAPOLEI MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER HONORED BY THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n  (Mr. TAKAI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TAKAI.

She will be honored at the White House next week for her \nunparalleled devotion to her work and her students.\n  As librarian at Kapolei Middle School, Carolyn recognized that over \n1,400 students had limited access to library resources since the \nschool's multitrack calendar conflicted with library hours. To address \nthis, Carolyn creatively wove technology into library resources to \nincrease accessibility for both students and teachers. Now, students \nand teachers are able to access library material at any time online, \nwhich, in turn, has increased their potential in the classroom.\n  Our State is fortunate to have school librarians such as Carolyn who \ndevote time and energy and to ensure that every student has the means \nhe or she needs to succeed. Her efforts have truly made a difference.\n  Congratulations, Carolyn, for your well-deserved recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1990-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING THE PASSING OF TONY COSTILLO OF AURORA, COLORADO\n\n  (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Tony \nCostillo, a longtime friend of mine, from my hometown of Aurora, \nColorado, who recently passed away.\n  Tony and I had a friendship that started in our youth. We had so much \nin common. Tony and I both came from military families. Our late \nfathers had both married war brides in the aftermath of World War II. \nThey were career enlisted soldiers who were transferred to Fitzsimons \nArmy Medical Center for their last assignment in 1964 when we were both \njust 9 years old. Our military families both came from previous \nassignments in Europe.\n  While I followed in my father's footsteps and joined the military, \nTony stayed in Aurora and eventually married the love of his life, Nita \nAdkins of Pueblo, Colorado.\n  Tony and Nita raised two extraordinary children, Ben and Jess, in a \nloving family that has been inseparable.\n  Tony was an extraordinary example of a great friend, a loving \nhusband, a devoted father, and he will always be remembered and missed \nby all who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1990-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1915\n                          BRING BACK OUR GIRLS\n\n  (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. WILSON of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, while horrific trench warfare was \ntaking place in Europe, half a continent away on April 25, 1915, the \nAustralian and New Zealand Army Corps, ANZAC, set out to capture the \nDardanelles and Gallipoli, but met fierce resistance from the Ottoman \nTurks. It was World War I, 100 years ago.\n  What was originally intended to quickly eliminate Turkey from the war \nturned into a bloody, 8-month battle. More than 8,000 Australians and \n2,400 New Zealanders died in that campaign.\n  The battle and the losses of so many caused Australians and New \nZealanders to remember the sacrifice of all those who died on ANZAC \nDay, a day of remembrance, April 25. The Australians have built a \nmagnificent memorial to their war dead. Having seen it, I was humbly \ninspired how Australians show gratitude to their fallen warriors.\n  Mr. Speaker, join me in honoring our friends and allies, the Aussies \nand the Kiwis across the sea, as they honor their fallen on ANZAC Day, \nthose who died in the war to end all wars.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1991-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING CHERNOBYL\n\n  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight for two purposes. The first \nis to warmly recognize my noble brother, Steve. I am so proud of you.\n  The second reason I rise is as co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus to \ncommemorate one of the greatest engineering and political tragedies in \nmodern history. Thirty years ago today, on April 26, 1986, at 1:23 \na.m., operators in the control room of reactor number 4 mishandled a \nroutine safety test at Chernobyl's Vladimir Illyich Lenin Nuclear Power \nStation in the former Soviet Union, now present-day Ukraine.\n  The mishandled test led to a catastrophic explosion that burned for \n10 days, and the radioactive fallout spread over tens of thousands of \nsquare miles forcing more than one-quarter of a million people \npermanently from their homes. Its plumes reached northern Europe as \nwell.\n  Chernobyl's legacy remains a heavy burden for the people of Ukraine. \nTo its everlasting shame, the Soviet Union tried to cover up the \nseverity of the disaster engulfing the region with repercussions that \ncould have been avoided.\n  The event drove one-third of a million people from their homes and \ntriggered an epidemic level of thyroid cancer. Over the years, the \neconomic losses have amounted to hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Mr. Speaker, the impact of Chernobyl lingers socially, economically, \nand culturally. We, as a free world, should help build a bright future \nfor these communities and their people who persevered in the face of \nsuch profound catastrophe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1991-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENDING ENVIRONMENTAL WORK OF HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON CONSERVATION AND \n                                FORESTRY\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, from our Nation's farmers \nto our foresters, anglers, hunters, and those who love the outdoors, \ngood land management and conservation practices hold endless benefits.\n  To support this stewardship, the 2014 farm bill provides substantial \nopportunities for agricultural conservation. This includes initiatives \nsuch as the Conservation Reserve Program, Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, and Conservation Stewardship Program, just to name \na few.\n  These voluntary programs are essential in assisting landowners to \nimplement best management practices while also improving water quality \nand the surrounding watersheds.\n  The farm bill and the committee have also worked to promote well-\nmanaged forests. Our Nation's forests, of course, are economic engines \nin many rural areas while providing resources for our Nation. \nAdditionally, our forests also deliver significant ecological benefits \nbecause they are natural water filters, as well as our most important \ncarbon sinks.\n  With Earth Day last Friday, I think it is timely to recognize all the \ngreat conservation work going on in our communities and in our \ncommittee, and the importance of managed land and water. With that in \nmind, it remains essential that we continue active stewardship of our \nforests, farmlands, soils, and watersheds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/house-section/article/H1991-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING MATTS WILCOXEN\n\n  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.

Despite being a full-time student at \nthe Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville campus and a member of \ntheir ROTC program, he volunteered several days per week to assist \nconstituents and communities throughout my congressional district.\n  Matts has distinguished himself far beyond the walls of my district \noffice.

He additionally served as the battalion \ncommander for the first semester of this academic year and was the \ndeputy battalion commander during the second semester.\n  Next month, Matts will not only graduate, but he will also be \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant in the Armor Branch of the U.S. \nArmy. Matts is a motivated leader who will serve our Nation proudly in \nthe Army.
