Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform you that I will \nresign as Speaker of the House effective upon the election of my \nsuccessor. I will also resign as Representative from Ohio's Eighth \nDistrict at the end of this month.\n  I leave with no regrets, no burdens. If anything, I leave the way I \nstarted--just a regular guy, humbled by the chance to do a big job. \nThat is what I am most proud of. I am still just me, the same guy who \ncame here 25 years ago as a small-business man and spent all these 25 \nyears trying to just be me.\n  Now, sometimes my staff thought I was too much like me, but it really \nis the thing I am most proud of. I am the same regular guy who came \nhere to try to do a good job for my district and my country.\n  Before I go, I want to express what an honor it has been to serve \nwith all of you. The people's House is, in my view, the great \nembodiment of the American Dream. Everybody here comes from somewhere, \nand everybody here is on some mission.\n  I come from a part of the world where we are used to working. As far \nback as I can remember, I was working. My staff was asking me the other \nday: Well, you know, on November 1st, you're not going to have a job. \nWhen was the last time you didn't have a job?\n  I thought about it and thought about it and thought about it. I \nthought, well, I had to be 8 or 9 years old because I was throwing \nnewspapers back then and working in my dad's bar. As a matter of fact, \nI used to work from 5 a.m. on Saturday morning until 2 p.m. for $2. Not \n$2 an hour. $2.\n  I never thought about growing up as the easy way or the hard way. It \nwas just the Cincinnati way. Our city takes its name from the great \nRoman general Cincinnatus, a farmer who answered the call of his nation \nto lead and then surrendered his power to go back to his plow.\n  For me, it wasn't a farm. It was a small business. And it wasn't so \nmuch a calling as it was a mission--a mission to strive for a smaller, \nless costly, and more accountable Federal Government here in \nWashington.\n  How did we do? Here are some facts. For the first time in nearly 20 \nyears, we have made some real entitlement reforms, saving trillions of \ndollars over the long term.\n  We have protected 99 percent of the American people from an increase \nin their taxes. We are on track to save taxpayers $2.1 trillion over \nthe next 10 years, the most significant spending reductions in modern \ntimes. We have banned earmarks altogether. Sorry.\n  We have protected this institution. We have made it more open to the \npeople. Every day in this capital city there are hundreds of kids from \nthe toughest neighborhoods who are finally getting a chance at a decent \neducation.\n  I am proud of these things, but the mission is not complete. And the \ntruth is it may never be. One thing I came to realize over the years \nthat I have been here is that this battle over the size and scope and \ncost of our government in Washington has been going on for more than \n200 years, and the forces of the status quo go to an awful lot of \ntrouble to prevent change from happening.\n  Real change takes time. Yes, freedom makes all things possible, but \npatience is what makes all things real. So believe in the long, slow \nstruggle. Believe in this country's ability to meet her challenges and \nto lead the world. And, remember, you can't do a big job alone, \nespecially this one.\n  So I am grateful to my family, Deb and my two girls. My two girls \nwere 3 and 1 when I first ran for office. Now they are a lot older. So \nthey have been through a lot. You all know what your families go \nthrough. It is one thing for us to take the bricks and the boards and \neverything that gets thrown at us, but it is another thing for our \nfamilies. Their skin isn't as thick as ours.\n  I am also grateful to all of my colleagues: my fellow leaders, Mr. \nMcCarthy and Mr. Scalise, Ms. McMorris Rodgers; and many on my side of \nthe aisle, our committee chairs, people I have worked with for a long \ntime.\n  But I am just as grateful to Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Clyburn, and \nMr. Becerra and others for all of the work that we have done together. \nOver these last 5 years, we have done an awful lot of work together. \nThere was probably more work done across the aisle over the last 5 \nyears than in the 25 years that I have served in this institution.\n  Now, as much as I enjoy working with all of you, some of you still \ncould learn to dress better. You know who you are. I saw one of the \nculprits, one of the usual suspects who shows up here once in a while \nwithout a tie. This morning he didn't look dressed very well, but he \ndid have a tie on.\n  I am grateful to the people who work in this institution every day, \nwhether it is the Reading Clerks or--you know, there are a lot of \npeople, thousands of people, who allow us to do our jobs and to help \nmake this institution what it is. Whether it is the people you see here \ntoday or the people in the CAO's office or the Capitol Police or \nlegislative counsel, there really are thousands of people who really do \nallow us to do our job.\n  I am grateful to my staff. Now, you all know I am a big believer in \nstaff. None of us can be what we are without a good staff, and I \ncertainly would never have gotten to this job without having built a \ngreat team. So I really am grateful to my staff. As they like to say to \neach other, once you are part of Boehnerland, you are always a part of \nBoehnerland, and that certainly goes for me as well.\n  I am especially grateful to all my constituents and the volunteers \nover the years. That includes a student at Miami University in Oxford, \nOhio, in 1990, who was putting up campaign signs for me. His name was \nPaul Ryan. I don't think he could pronounce my name back in 1990 when \nhe was putting up yard signs for me.\n  But, as Cincinnatus understood, there is a difference between being \nasked to do something and being called to do something. Paul is being \ncalled. I know he will serve with grace and with energy, and I want to \nwish him and his family all the best.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  My colleagues, I have described my life as a chase for the American \nDream. That chase began at the bottom of the hill, just off the main \ndrag in Reading, Ohio, right outside of Cincinnati. At the top of the \nhill was a small house with a big family, a shining city in its own \nright.\n  The hill had twists. The hill had turns, and even a few tears. \nNothing wrong with that. But let me tell you, it was just perfect.\n  Never forget, we are the luckiest people on the Earth. In America, \nyou can do anything that you are willing to work for, willing to work \nhard at, and anything can happen if you are willing to make the \nnecessary sacrifices in life.\n\n[[Page H7337]]\n\n  If you falter--and you will--you can just pick yourself up, dust \nyourself off, and go do it again, because hope always springs eternal. \nAnd if you just do the right things for the right reasons, good things \nwill happen.\n  And this, too, can really happen to you.\n  God bless you, and God bless our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/house-section/article/H7337-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7337-H7340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ELECTION OF SPEAKER\n\n  The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the Speaker's announcement of October 29, \n2015, the Chair will receive nominations for the Office of Speaker.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris \nRodgers).\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, today, in the people's House, it \ngives me great honor to nominate the people's Speaker.\n  You don't need to look any further than the architecture of \nWashington, D.C., to see what our Founders envisioned. It is not by \nmistake that the dome over the Congress is the very center of the \nFederal city. The White House and the Supreme Court are set about us, \nsatellites to the supreme power of the people expressed in this \nlegislative body.\n  In the House, we are eager for a fresh start that will make us more \neffective to fulfill our obligation to reflect the will of the people \nand to reestablish the balance of power.\n  There is no better person to lead us in that calling than the man I \nam about to nominate. He was first elected to the House at the ripe old \nage of 28, and he has served here now for almost 17 years.\n  We all remember when he led the House Budget Committee: the visionary \nproposals, the lengthy debates. And who could forget those PowerPoints?\n  He is now the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But he \nis more than a chairman to us. He is more than a colleague. He is our \nfriend. He is a leader.\n  Through it all, he has never forgotten his roots. He lives on the \nsame block he grew up on in Janesville, Wisconsin. There is no place he \nwould rather be than at home with his family.\n  He will continue to put the people of this country first. And I can \nsay, in all candor, he did not seek this office. The office sought him.\n  As chair of the House Republican Conference, I am directed by the \nvote of that Conference to present for election to the Office of \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives for the 114th Congress the \nRepresentative from the State of Wisconsin, the man from Janesville, \nthe Honorable Paul D. Ryan.\n  The SPEAKER. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Becerra).\n  Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, I offer my congratulations to my friend, \nthe gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), on his nomination by his \ncolleagues.\n  At this time, as chairman of the Democratic Caucus of this House, I \nwish to place in nomination the name of a proven leader for the Office \nof Speaker of the House of Representatives:\n  A leader who has accomplished, in this Chamber and for this country, \nwhat few can match;\n  A leader who, as Speaker of this House, secured passage of landmark \neconomic recovery package legislation in 2009 which transformed a \ndiving economy, losing 800,000 jobs each month, to one which has now \ncreated more than 13 million jobs over the last 67 consecutive months \nof job growth;\n  A leader who, as Speaker, accomplished what 70 years of Congresses \ncould not, enactment of our lifesaving health security law, which has \nput 18 million more Americans in control of their and their children's \nhealth care;\n  A leader who had the foresight, in 2008, to fight for the biggest \ninvestment in our troops since World War II, with the passage of the \nPost-9/11 GI Bill, and the largest investment in our veterans' health \ncare and benefits in the 77-year history of the VA;\n  A leader who was not afraid to take on the challenge of fixing our \nbroken immigration system and secured passage of the DREAM Act in 2010.\n  Mr. Speaker, leadership is about making the tough choices and getting \nthings done. It means knowing how to build a majority, not just with \nthe members of your own political party, but with the 435 elected \nMembers of the House of Representatives so we can get things done. This \nleader understands that and knows how to get things done, even while \nserving in the minority in this House.\n  That is why, less than 24 hours ago, this leader succeeded in \nbreaking through the gridlock in this House and secured the votes \nneeded to avert a senseless government shutdown and a perilous default \non the payment of America's bills. Thanks to this leader, 16.5 million \nseniors will not suffer a $55-per-month increase in their Medicare \npremiums and Congress will not cut the Social Security benefits of 11 \nmillion disabled Americans by 20 percent.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is leadership, and that is what Americans expect \nfrom those they elect. That is why it is my privilege, as chairman of \nthe House Democratic Caucus and as directed by the colleagues of the \nDemocratic Caucus, to nominate for election to the Office of Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives, from the 12th District of the great State \nof California, the Honorable Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro Pelosi.\n  The SPEAKER. The names of the Honorable Paul D. Ryan, a \nRepresentative from the State of Wisconsin, and the Honorable Nancy \nPelosi, a Representative from the State of California, have been placed \nin nomination.\n  Are there further nominations?\n  There being no further nominations, the Chair appoints the following \ntellers:\n  The gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller);\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brady);\n  The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur); and\n  The gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen).\n  The tellers will come forward and take their seats at the desk in \nfront of the Speaker's rostrum.\n  The roll will now be called, and those responding to their names will \nindicate by surname the nominee of their choosing.\n  The Reading Clerk will now call the roll.\n  The tellers having taken their places, the House proceeded to vote \nfor the Speaker.\n  The following is the result of the vote:\n\n                             [Roll No. 581]\n\n                             RYAN

My dear colleagues of the 114th Congress of the United \nStates, today, as every day, we come to this floor strengthened and \ninspired by the support of our colleagues, the trust of our \nconstituents, and the love of our families.\n  My special thanks to my husband, Paul; our five children; our nine \ngrandchildren; and the entire Pelosi and D'Alesandro families for their \nsupport.\n  My deep gratitude to the people of San Francisco for the continued \nhonor they give me to represent them here.\n  My heartfelt thanks to my Democratic colleagues for extending me the \nhonor of being nominated to be Speaker of the House. Thank you, my \ncolleagues.\n  Today, we bid farewell to a Speaker who has served his constituents \nand this Congress with honor for 25 years, Speaker John Boehner.\n  In his story, we are reminded of the enduring, exceptional promise of \nAmerica--this hardworking son of an Ohio bartender and owner who grew \nup to be the Speaker of the House of Representatives. John Boehner \ntalked about the American Dream. John Boehner, you are the \npersonification of the American Dream.\n  As you all know, Speaker Boehner was a formidable spokesman for the \nRepublican agenda. My Republican colleagues, I am sure you know--and I \ncan attest--to the fact that he was always true and loyal to the \nmembers of his Conference in any negotiations we ever had.\n  Although we had our differences and often, I always respected his \ndedication to this House and his commitment to his values. Thank you, \nJohn, for your leadership and courage as Speaker.\n  Your graciousness as Speaker extended and was reflected in your staff \nunder the leadership of Mike Sommers, whom we all respect. Thank you to \nJohn Boehner's staff.\n  I know I speak for everyone here, Democrats and Republicans, when I \nthank you for making the visit of His Holiness Pope Francis such a \nbeautiful and meaningful experience for all of us.\n  Today, we extend our thanks and congratulations to Debbie; your \ndaughters, Lindsay and Tricia; and the entire Boehner family, now \nincluding grandson, Allister.\n  Let's hear it for the family of John Boehner.\n  On behalf of House Democrats and personally, I wish you and your \nfamily all of God's blessings in the glorious years ahead.\n  Last month, we witnessed something truly special when Pope Francis \nmade history addressing a joint session of Congress. Standing right \nhere, Pope Francis called on us to seek hope,\n\n[[Page H7339]]\n\npeace, and dialogue for all people and reminded us of our duty to find \na way forward for everyone. ``A good political leader,'' His Holiness \nsaid, ``is one who, with the interest of all in mind, seizes the moment \nin a spirit of openness and pragmatism.''\n  Pope Francis echoed the principles of our Founders that placed at the \nheart of our democracy the saying, ``E Pluribus Unum,'' from many, one. \nThe Founders could never have imagined how vast our country would \nbecome, how diverse and many we would be--ethnically, gender \nidentities, beliefs, and priorities--but they knew we had to be one.\n  Every day in this House and across the country we pledge allegiance \nto one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n  This is the beauty of America, that for all of our honest \ndifferences, perspectives, and priorities aired and argued so \npassionately on this floor, we are committed to being one nation. \nDespite our differences--in fact, respecting them--I look forward to a \nclear debate in this marketplace of ideas, the people's House of \nRepresentatives.\n  So, my fellow colleagues, we have a responsibility to act upon our \nshared faith in the greatness of our country. We have a responsibility \nto be worthy of the sacrifices of our troops, our veterans, and our \nmilitary families. We have a responsibility to make real the promise of \nthe American Dream for all.\n  There is important work before the Congress. We must do more to \npromote growth, decrease the deficit, create good-paying jobs, and \nincrease the paychecks of America's working families.\n  Today, in this House, a page is turned. A new chapter has begun. \nToday, the gavel passes to a proud son of Wisconsin, the first Speaker \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  Paul Ryan has had the full breadth of experience on Capitol Hill, \nfrom a young staffer to a Tortilla Coast waiter--shall I say that \nagain?--Tortilla Coast waiter--to a Congressman, to being a sincere and \nproud advocate for his point of view as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, as a respected leader and chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, and in a minute, he will be the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, on behalf of House Democrats, I extend the hand \nof friendship to you.\n  Congratulations to you, Paul, and to Janna; your children, Liza, \nCharlie, and Sam; your mother, who is here--how proud she must be--and \nthe entire Ryan family, whom we all know mean so much to you.\n  Mr. Speaker, God bless you and your family. And God bless the United \nStates of America.\n  This is the people's House. This is the people's gavel. In the \npeople's name, it is my privilege to hand this gavel to the Speaker-\nelect of the House, Congressman and Honorable Paul D. Ryan.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Thank you, Madam Leader.\n  Before I begin, I would like to thank all of my family and friends \nwho flew in from Wisconsin and from all over for being here today.\n  In the gallery I have my mom, Betty; my sister, Janet; my brothers, \nStan and Tobin; and more cousins than I can count on a few hands.\n  Most importantly, I want to recognize my wife, Janna; and our \nchildren: Liza, Charlie, and Sam.\n  I also want to thank Speaker Boehner. For almost 5 years, he led this \nHouse. For nearly 25 years, he served it. Not many people can match his \naccomplishments, the offices he held, the laws he passed.\n  But what really sets John apart is he is a man of character, a true \nclass act. He is, without question, the gentleman from Ohio. So please \njoin me in saying one last time, ``Thank you, Speaker Boehner.''\n  Now I know how he felt. It is not until you hold this gavel, stand in \nthis spot, look out and see all 435 Members of this House, as if all \nAmerica is sitting right in front of you--it is not until then that you \nfeel it, the weight of responsibility and the gravity of the moment.\n  As I stand here, I can't help but think of something Harry Truman \nonce said. The day after Franklin Roosevelt died, Truman became \nPresident. He told a group of reporters, ``If you ever pray, pray for \nme now.''\n  When they told me yesterday what had happened, I felt like the Moon, \nthe stars, and all the planets had fallen on me. We should all feel \nthat way. A lot is on our shoulders. So if you ever pray, let's pray \nfor each other, Republicans for Democrats and Democrats for \nRepublicans.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  And I don't mean pray for a conversion, all right? Pray for a deeper \nunderstanding. Because when you are up here, you see it so clearly. \nWherever you come from, whatever you believe, we are all in the same \nboat.\n  I never thought I would be Speaker, but early in my life, I wanted to \nserve this House. I thought this place was exhilarating because here \nyou can make a difference. If you had a good idea, if you worked hard, \nyou could make it happen. You could improve people's lives. To me, the \nHouse of Representatives represents what is the best of America: the \nboundless opportunity to do good.\n  But let's be frank. The House is broken. We are not solving problems. \nWe are adding to them. I am not interested in laying blame. We are not \nsettling scores. We are wiping the slate clean.\n  Neither the Members nor the people are satisfied with how things are \ngoing. We need to make some changes, starting with how the House does \nbusiness. We need to let every Member contribute, not once they have \nearned their stripes, but now.\n  I come at this job as a two-time committee chair. The committees \nshould retake the lead in drafting all major legislation. If you know \nthe issue, you should write the bill.\n  Let's open up the process. Let people participate, and they might \nchange their mind. A neglected minority will gum up the works. A \nrespected minority will work in good faith. Instead of trying to stop \nthe majority, they might try to become the majority. In other words, we \nneed to return to regular order.\n  Now, I know this sounds like process. It is actually a matter of \nprinciple. We are the body closest to the people. Every 2 years, we \nface the voters and sometimes face the music. But we do not echo the \npeople; we represent the people. We are supposed to study up and do the \nhomework that they cannot do. So when we do not follow regular order, \nwhen we rush to pass bills that a lot of us don't understand, we are \nnot doing our job. Only a fully functioning House can truly represent \nthe people; and if there were ever a time for us to step up, this would \nbe that time.\n  America does not feel strong anymore because the working people of \nAmerica do not feel strong anymore. I am talking about the people who \nmind the store and grow the food and walk the beat and pay the taxes \nand raise the family. They do not sit in this House. They do not have \nfancy titles, but they are the people who make this country work, and \nthis House should work for them.\n  Here is the problem. They are working hard. They are paying a lot. \nThey are trying to do right by their families, and they are going \nnowhere fast. They never get a raise. They never get a break. The bills \nkeep piling up and the taxes and the debt. They are working harder than \never before to get ahead, and yet they are falling further behind. They \nfeel robbed. They feel cheated of their birthright. They are not asking \nfor any favors. They just want a fair chance, and they are losing faith \nthat they will ever get it.\n  Then they look at Washington, and all they see is chaos. What a \nrelief to them it would be if we finally got our acts together. What a \nweight off of their shoulders. How reassuring it would be if we \nactually fixed the Tax Code, put patients in charge of their health \ncare, grew our economy, strengthened our military, lifted people out of \npoverty, and paid down our debt. At this point, nothing could be more \ninspiring than a job well done. Nothing could stir the heart more than \nreal, concrete results.\n  The cynics will scoff. They will say it is not possible. You better \nbelieve, we are going to try. We will not duck the tough issues; we \nwill take them head-on. We are going to do all we can do so that \nworking people get their strength back and people not working get their \nlives back. No more favors for the few. ``Opportunity for all,'' that \nis our motto.\n  I often talk about a need for a vision. I am not sure I ever really \nsaid what I\n\n[[Page H7340]]\n\nmeant. We solve problems here, yes. We create a lot of them, too. But \nat bottom, we vindicate a way of life. We show by our work that free \npeople can govern themselves. They can solve their own problems. They \ncan make their own decisions. They can deliberate, collaborate, and get \nthe job done.\n  We show that self-government is not only more efficient and more \neffective, it is more fulfilling. In fact, we show it is that struggle, \nthat hard work, that very achievement itself that makes us free. That \nis what we do here.\n  We will not always agree, not all of us, not all of the time, but we \nshould not hide our disagreements. We should embrace them. We have \nnothing to fear from honest differences honestly stated. If you have \nideas, let's hear them. I believe that a greater clarity between us can \nlead to greater charity among us, and there is every reason to have \nhope.\n  When the first Speaker took the gavel, he looked out at a room of 30 \npeople, representing a nation of 3 million. Today, as I look out at \neach and every one of you, we represent a nation of 300 million.\n  So when I hear people say that America doesn't have it, we are done, \nwe are spent, I don't believe it. I believe with every fiber of my \nbeing that we can renew the American idea. Now our task is to make us \nall believe.\n  My friends, you have done me a great honor. The people of this \ncountry, they have done all of us a great honor. Now let's prove \nourselves worthy of it. Let's seize the moment. Let's rise to the \noccasion. And when we are done, let us say that we left the people--all \nthe people--more united, happy, and free.\n  Thank you.\n  I am now ready to take the oath of office.\n  I ask the Dean of the House of Representatives, the Honorable John \nConyers, Jr., of Michigan, to administer the oath of office.\n  Mr. CONYERS then administered the oath of office to Mr. Paul D. Ryan \nof Wisconsin, as follows:\n\n       Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you will support and \n     defend the Constitution of the United States against all \n     enemies, foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith \n     and allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation \n     freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; \n     and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of \n     the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God.\n\n  (Applause, the Members rising.)\n  Mr. CONYERS.

John A. Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: To facilitate application of sections 302 \n     and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, I am transmitting an \n     updated status report on the current levels of on-budget \n     spending and revenues for fiscal years 2015, 2016, and for \n     the 10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025. This \n     status report is current through October 27, 2015. The term \n     ``current level'' refers to the amounts of spending and \n     revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted \n     or awaiting the President's signature.\n       Table 1 in the report compares the current levels of total \n     budget authority, outlays, and revenues to the overall \n     limits, as adjusted, that were filed in the Congressional \n     Record on April 29, 2014 for fiscal year 2015, and to the \n     limits contained in the conference report on S. Con. Res. 11, \n     as agreed to on May 5, 2015, for fiscal year 2016, and for \n     the 10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025. This \n     comparison is needed to implement section 311(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act, which creates a point of order \n     against measures that would breach the budget resolution's \n     aggregate levels. The table does not show budget authority \n     and outlays for years after fiscal year 2016 because \n     appropriations for those years have not yet been considered.\n       Table 2 compares the current levels of budget authority and \n     outlays for legislative action completed by each authorizing \n     committee with the ``section 302(a)'' allocations filed on \n     April 29, 2014 for fiscal year 2015, and to the limits \n     contained in the conference report on S. Con. Res. 11, as \n     agreed to on May 5, 2015, for fiscal year 2016 and for the \n     10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025. For fiscal \n     year 2015, ``legislative action'' refers to legislation \n     enacted after the adoption of the levels set forth in the \n     Congressional Record on April 29, 2014. For fiscal year 2016 \n     and the 10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025, \n     ``legislative action'' refers to legislation enacted after \n     the adoption of the levels set forth in the conference \n     agreement on S. Con. Res. 11. This comparison is needed to \n     enforce section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, which \n     creates a point of order against measures that would breach \n     the section 302(a) allocation of new budget authority for the \n     committee that reported the measure. It is also needed to \n     implement section 311(b), which exempts committees that \n     comply with their allocations from the point of order under \n     section 311(a).\n       Tables 3 and 4 compare the current status of discretionary \n     appropriations for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 with the \n     ``section 302(b)'' suballocations of discretionary budget \n     authority and outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The \n     comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act because the point of order under \n     that section equally applies to measures that would breach \n     the applicable section 302(b) suballocation. The tables also \n     provide supplementary information on spending in excess of \n     the base discretionary spending caps allowed under section \n     251(b) of the Budget Control Act.\n       Table 5 compares the levels of changes to mandatory \n     programs (CHIMPs) contained in appropriations acts with the \n     permissible limits on CHIMPs as specified in sections 3103 \n     and 3104 of S. Con. Res. 11. The comparison is needed to \n     enforce a point of order established in S. Con. Res. 11 \n     against fiscal year 2016 appropriations measures containing \n     CHIMPs that would breach the permissible limits for fiscal \n     year 2016.\n       Tables 6 and 7 display the current level of advance \n     appropriations for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively, \n     of accounts identified for advance appropriations under \n     section 601 of H. Con. Res. 25 (113th Congress), in force and \n     effect pursuant to H. Res. 5 (114th Congress), and under \n     section 3304 of S. Con. Res 11. These tables are needed to \n     enforce a point of order against appropriations bills \n     containing advance appropriations that are: (i) not \n     identified in the statement of managers or (ii) would cause \n     the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the \n     level specified in the budget resolution.\n       In addition, letters from the Congressional Budget Office \n     are attached that summarize and compare the budget impact of \n     enacted legislation that occurred after adoption of the \n     budget resolution against the budget resolution aggregates in \n     force.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Jim Herz or Jim \n     Bates at (202) 226-7270.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Tom Price, M.D.,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\nTABLE 1.--REPORT TO THE SPEAKER FROM THE COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, STATUS OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2015, 2016, AND 2016-\n                  2025 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET REFLECTING ACTION COMPLETED AS OF OCTOBER 27, 2015\n                                   [On-budget amounts, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Fiscal Year 2015   Fiscal Year 2016  Fiscal Years 2016-\n                                                                \\1\\                \\2\\                2025\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAppropriate Level:\n    Budget Authority...................................          3,033,319          3,040,743               n.a.\n    Outlays............................................          3,027,686          3,092,541               n.a.\n    Revenues...........................................          2,535,978          2,675,967         32,233,099\nCurrent Level:\n    Budget Authority...................................          3,037,055          3,154,888               n.a.\n    Outlays............................................          3,047,157          3,167,136               n.a.\n    Revenues...........................................          2,453,570          2,676,111         32,237,119\nCurrent Level over (+) / under (-)\nAppropriate Level:\n    Budget Authority...................................             +3,736           +114,145               n.a.\n    Outlays............................................            +19,471            +74,595               n.a.\n    Revenues...........................................            -82,408               +144             +4,020\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nn.a. = Not applicable because annual appropriations Acts for fiscal years 2017 through 2025 will not be\n  considered until future sessions of Congress.\n\\1\\ Section 115(b) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) required the Chairman of the Committee on the\n  Budget in the House of Representatives to file aggregate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2015 for purposes of\n  enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
