The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, Republicans in the House are \nholding a hearing that will blame the Obama administration because \nthousands of children and young adults are fleeing three countries in \nCentral America and are seeking safety in the United States and in \nother countries.\n  The premise, as far as the Republicans on the committee are \nconcerned, is that President Obama has not deported anyone or enforced \nany immigration laws. As far as they are concerned, the President's \nexecutive actions--which we should remember are for a different set of \nimmigrants altogether and which Republicans have delayed until the \nSupreme Court decides on a lawsuit this summer--are a clarion call to \neveryone in these three particular countries to attempt to come to the \nU.S. It is not the rampant murders, the extortion, the forced \nconscription into street gangs, or the utter collapse of civil society \nand civil order that is driving people to risk their lives to seek \nsafety here. No. It is ``that'' President whom Republicans love to \nhate. He is to blame.\n  I hope that at least a little time at the Judiciary hearing on \nThursday will be devoted to the problems our government has faced over \nthe past couple of years in handling young and unaccompanied asylum \nseekers from Central America. We know that some women were kept in \nlockups for too long, that the term ``humane family detention'' is an \noxymoron, that children were released to guardians who did not have the \nchildren's best interests in mind, and that some were forced into human \ntrafficking situations, and we should have been more vigilant. Those \nare the issues I hope we can focus on.\n  We should be asking: How can we remain a society that protects the \ninnocent, that cares for children who have put themselves in our care, \nand that does so in accordance with the laws of this Nation and the \nlaws of basic decency?\n  Unfortunately, at this point, we know what Judiciary Committee \nhearings are not about. They are not serious attempts to craft \nlegislation that creates an immigration system that works for the \nAmerican people. Hearings in this Congress are not about how the \nCongress can create legal and controlled immigration alternatives so \nthat people do not try to come illegally or spend thousands of dollars \non smugglers and traffickers.\n  We will probably not discuss how a generation of temporary protected \nstatus for certain immigrants has not created a long-term, sustainable \nsituation in immigrant communities or sending countries so that \nimmigration is safe, legal, orderly, and voluntary.\n  We will spend a lot of time discussing whether President Obama is to \nblame but very little time actually discussing why people come in the \ndead of night, holding onto a freight train, and running a gauntlet \nwith smugglers and not what can be done to have immigration where \npeople come in the light of day with visas, passports, and plane \ntickets.\n  We simply will not discuss how we get from this broken reality to a \nfeasible and sustainable future of immigration. Rather, the Judiciary \nCommittee will continue to feed the hucksterism and red meat politics \nthat Americans hate, and they hate it with good reason.\n  In the years since 2007, when President George Bush started ramping \nup raids and deportations, right through the 2 million deportations of \nPresident Obama's, I can honestly say I have not seen such fear and \nanxiety in immigrant communities, where mothers and fathers are keeping \ntheir children out of school because of the fear of being arrested by \nimmigration authorities.\n  The home raids announced by the Obama administration around Christmas \nhave struck a nerve. They have sparked rumors and panic and have \nmultiplied as city after city has experienced raids or the rumors of \nraids. Children are taken as they go to school--yes, as they go to \nschool. The government has stopped them and has arrested them.\n  The fear and anxiety has nothing to do with Donald Trump or with the \nfantasy that he has of deporting millions\n\n[[Page H500]]\n\nof immigrants or of barring people from this country because of their \nreligion. The fear and anxiety is born of decades of congressional \ninaction and of leaders in Washington who hope that the problem will \njust go away; but we will not be discussing that at the hearing \ntomorrow.\n  As for the path forward that will allow the country to move beyond \nthe legislative roadblock imposed by the opponents of legal \nimmigration, we will, again, not discuss how we make progress but, \nrather, yes, how we blame Obama.\n  For all of the Americans who want a legal and accountable immigration \nsystem and for all of the families who fear a knock on their doors, \nthis Congress, again, seems to have nothing and to do nothing other \nthan to let the demagogues and fear rule the day.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is a shame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H500-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN RECOGNITION AND IN CELEBRATION OF THE WORK OF DR. ANGUS STEWART \n                                 DEATON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Lance) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and to celebrate the \ntremendous work of Dr. Angus Stewart Deaton of Princeton, New Jersey, \nwho was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Dr. Deaton \nis a renowned academic, who is the Dwight D. Eisenhower Professor of \nInternational Affairs and Professor of Economics and International \nAffairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International \nAffairs and the Economics Department at Princeton University.\n  The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences selected Dr. Deaton for the \nSwedish National Bank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred \nNobel for his work regarding consumption, poverty, and welfare. The \nwork is of critical importance to the entire world.\n  The Nobel Committee said in its selection announcement: ``The \nLaureate, Angus Deaton, has deepened our understanding of different \naspects of consumption. His research concerns issues of immense \nimportance for human welfare, not least in poor countries. Deaton's \nresearch has greatly influenced both practical policymaking and the \nscientific community. By emphasizing the links between individual \nconsumption decisions and outcomes for the whole economy, his work has \nhelped transform modern microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development \neconomics.''\n  The Nobel Committee elaborated on its decision:\n\n       Dr. Deaton received this year's prize in Economic Sciences \n     for three related achievements: the system for estimating the \n     demand for different goods that he and John Muellbauer \n     developed around 1980; the studies of the link between \n     consumption and income that he conducted around 1990; and the \n     work he has carried out in later decades on measuring living \n     standards and poverty in developing countries with the help \n     of household surveys.\n\n  Dr. Deaton is a man of the world. A native of Edinburgh, Scotland, he \nwas educated as a foundation scholar at Fettes College and received his \nundergraduate, master's, and doctorate of philosophy degrees from the \nUniversity of Cambridge, where he was later a fellow at Fitzwilliam \nCollege. He was a faculty member at the University of Bristol before \ncoming to Princeton. He has studied and visited many nations, has used \nresearch and experiences from around the world to shape the direction \nof his work, and has written extensively on societal issues facing the \nglobal community.\n  His spouse, Dr. Anne C. Case, is the Alexander Stewart 1886 Professor \nof Economics and Public Affairs and Professor of Economics and Public \nAffairs at the Woodrow Wilson School and Economics Department at \nPrinceton. She is also an accomplished and acclaimed faculty member who \nhas published groundbreaking economic research. Angus Deaton has two \nadult children, and in their spare time, he and Professor Case enjoy \nthe opera and trout fishing.\n  Dr. Deaton is a superb professor, mentor, colleague, friend, and \nPrincetonian. He is extremely worthy of this preeminent international \nhonor. My wife, Heidi, and I and my twin brother, Jim, are proud to \ncall Angus and Anne our friends. It is a great honor to Dr. Deaton's \ncountry of birth, the United Kingdom, and to his adopted country, the \nUnited States of America, that he has received this year's Nobel Prize \nin Economic Sciences. It is also a great honor to Princeton University, \nwhose motto is: ``In the nation's service and in service of all \nnations.''\n  On behalf of the Congress of the United States, I congratulate \nProfessor Deaton. May he continue his momentous work for the betterment \nof the human condition in the many years that lie ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H500-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H500-H501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHOLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the armed occupation by out-of-State \ninvaders in eastern Oregon is now in its second month. There has \nalready been violence, loss of life, damage to Federal property, and \nthe total disruption of this small, quiet community in far eastern \nOregon.\n  From this unfortunate and unnecessary spectacle, there are some \nlessons and conclusions to be drawn:\n  First and foremost, it must be made clear that the armed takeover of \ngovernment or of private facilities for grievances real or imagined is \nabsolutely unacceptable and won't be tolerated;\n  Second, while it is easy to be an armchair quarterback and second-\nguess the authorities, I think it is clear that a firmer response to \nthe earlier Bundy law breaking in Nevada--owing the Federal Government \nover $1 million and resisting Federal authorities at gunpoint--might \nhave prevented or at least not encouraged this latest outrage, which \nincludes some of his family members coming to Oregon from Nevada;\n  This is a call to action for Americans who treasure our public \nspaces--our parks, our forests, our rangelands, our marine sanctuaries. \nThese are treasures that belong to all Americans, and it is important \nfor us to understand what we have and to understand what is at stake \nfor forces that would threaten our heritage;\n  If America somehow decides to give up these treasures, as some \ndemand, special consideration would not be given to the rich--putting \nit up for the highest bidder--or for people who just happen to be in \nthe proximity. Special consideration should be given to the Native \nAmericans, who ought to be first in line, who have been systematically \nshortchanged by the Federal Government, which has denied them their \ntreaty rights, systematically taking away land that was promised to \nthem by treaties that were negotiated--presumably in good faith--\nratified by Congress, and signed by past Presidents;\n  And it is not just enough to enforce the law. We should recover \ndamages from lawbreakers who tear up the landscape, degrade wildlife \nhabitat, and destroy property.\n  I have introduced legislation that would allow the Federal \nGovernment--in fact, not allow, but require the Federal Government--to \nmake payments to State and local governments that have had to incur \nsignificant costs because of threats to Federal property. H.R. 4431 \nwould reimburse State and local officials for these extraordinary costs \nincurred due to threats to Federal property.\n  When we talk in trillions here in Washington, D.C., maybe talk of \n$100,000 here or $1 million there doesn't sound like very much.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  To the State of Oregon it matters. And, for this tiny community, a \nfew hundred thousand dollars has a significant impact on the local \ntaxpayer and their services. They shouldn't be made to pay the bill.\n  I'm also working with Congressman Thompson, to close a loophole that \nwould not allow us to recover for damages to Federal facilities by \nthese lawbreakers, this legislation would allow the Federal Government \nto go back to recover its costs from people who willfully inflict this \ndamage.\n  Let's act now, put this matter to rest, make the people in eastern \nOregon whole, and discourage such reckless and dangerous behavior in \nthe future.\n\n[[Page H501]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H501-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n     EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT WILL RETURN CONTROL TO OUR SCHOOLS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last month I met with \nteachers, administrators, school board members, even educators in \nhigher education that train our next generation of teachers and some \ngraduate students who are in that program to discuss the Every Student \nSucceeds Act, or ESSA, which replaces No Child Left Behind as our \nNation's elementary and secondary education law.\n  I was honored to be appointed by Speaker Ryan to the conference \ncommittee that was tasked with settling the differences between the \nHouse and Senate versions of ESSA to assure this legislation will \nprepare students for life success.\n  The ESSA reins in the unilateral power of the United States Secretary \nof Education and gives it back to the States and the local education \nagencies. It prohibits the Secretary from adding new requirements to \nState education plans, being involved in the peer review process, and \nexceeding his or her statutory authority. It also allows school \ndistricts to disentangle themselves from Common Core without penalty.\n  Additionally, the ESSA eliminates the controversial adequate yearly \nprogress provision, paving the way for States to develop their own \naccountability systems. While the new law keeps annual standardized \ntesting requirements for students in grade 3 through 8 in place to \nmonitor progress, it eliminates most of the burden of testing on \nteachers and students and it sets up a process to further reduce even \nmore standardized testing in the future.\n  While assessments for elementary schools must be the same for all \npublic school students statewide, States may also choose. They have \nflexibility to offer nationally recognized local assessments at the \nhigh school level as long as the assessments are reliable, valid, and \ncomparable.\n  In other words, a local education agency could use the SATs or ACTs \nto evaluate high school students instead of being held solely to tests \nmandated by the Federal Government.\n  Now, this flexibility should, could, and will be extended to career- \nand technical-education-focused students whose trade-specific \ncompetency is appropriately measured by the NOCTI performance test.\n  This flexibility will benefit our students and strengthen our overall \neconomy. High school students will have increased access to pathways \nleading to careers in high-skill, high-wage jobs in technological \nindustries.\n  The connection between education and our students' future careers is \nalso enhanced by a provision in this law that encourages businesses to \nget involved with their local schools.\n  Schools will be able to apply for funds to provide apprenticeships \nthat offer academic credit toward comprehensive career counseling.\n  Now, this was the result of bipartisan legislation I introduced with \nCongressman Jim Langevin aimed at informing school counselors of local \nlabor market conditions so that they can best guide the decisionmaking \nprocess of these students and their parents.\n  Not only does ESSA lift overly strict testing requirements, it also \nends the Federal mandate on teacher assessments.\n  States will be able to enact their own evaluation system in \naccordance with stakeholders, including teachers, paraprofessionals, \nand their unions. The structure of their system will no longer be tied \nto Federal funding as it was in No Child Left Behind.\n  ESSA provides flexibility in the use of Federal funding, allowing \nteachers and district administrators to finance priorities set at the \nlocal level. This commonsense provision restores control to those on \nthe front lines of educating our students and our children.\n  The ESSA also calls for the United States Department of Education to \nstudy how title I funds are allocated. Now, title I funds are used to \noffset the impact of poverty, one of the leading influences in the \nacademic achievement of our children. I have long been concerned that \nthe children are put at a disadvantage based upon the population of the \nschool district rather than the concentration of poverty.\n  This study is the result of an amendment I introduced, which gained \nthe support of the entire conference committee responsible for merging \nthe House and Senate versions of the legislation.\n  Title I funds are vastly important to students who are low income, \ndisadvantaged, or who have disabilities. I am hopeful this study will \nmake a strong argument for a more equitable distribution of funds for \nthe areas which need them most. Funding must be based on student need, \nnot a school district's ZIP code.\n  The ESSA is 4-year reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. Feedback from those involved in educating our students \nis so essential to making the right changes to our education system, \nand I appreciate the feedback that came in this process as we succeeded \nin this reform.\n  Now, as these changes are put into practice, I want to hear from you. \nIf a particular provision of the ESSA is having a great effect on your \nstudent or your school district, whether it is good or whether it is \nbad, Congress needs to know.\n  As the implementation of this new law begins, I will continue to \ntravel across Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, keeping our \nschools up to date on the change that was long overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H501-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H501-H502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLIMATE CHANGE--A TIPPING POINT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, 2015 was a landmark year for global climate \nchange, and that is not a good thing. According to the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, 2015 was our planet's hottest year on \nrecord. Last year the global average land surface temperature was 1.33 \nCelsius above the 20th century average, and 10 of the last 12 months \ntied or broke existing records for highest monthly global temperatures.\n  Despite the fact that climate science and research consistently \ndisplay the reality of climate change, some of my colleagues still \ndebate its validity in this very Chamber.\n  What is there to debate? More than 12,000 peer-reviewed, scientific \nstudies are in agreement that climate change is real and humans are \nsignificantly to blame. For those of you keeping track at home, there \nare zero peer-reviewed scientific studies that state the opposite.\n  One of the primary concerns of these scientific studies is that \nclimate change might trigger events that will dramatically alter the \nEarth as we know it. Scientists have discovered a number of tipping \npoints where abrupt changes in climate could create a variety of \nnational and global effects. It is hard to predict when these events \ncould occur; but we know that when they do, we will have very little \nwarning.\n  Reaching these critical points could lead to abrupt changes in the \nocean, snow cover, permafrost, and the Earth's biosphere. Alarmingly, \nmany of these events are triggered by warming levels of less than 2 \ndegrees.\n  We now know that, in the latter part of this century, we will find \nthe planet's temperature pushing not 2 degrees, but 4, 5, even 6, \ndegrees Celsius of warming.\n  While it may seem minor, each degree makes a significant difference. \nA 2-degree shift in temperatures could lead to an increased rise in sea \nlevel by 55 centimeters. Levels have already risen by about 20 \ncentimeters over the course of the 20th century, increasing flooding \nalong coastlines, impacting people and properties. A 3-degree increase \ncould impact water availability and accelerate drought and extreme heat \nwaves.\n  Each of these conditions would negatively impact the production of \nmajor crops, like wheat and rice, leading to global food security \nrisks.\n  Anything above a 4-degree increase would cause even more drastic \nconsequences, such as extreme ocean acidification, a decline in \nglaciers, a change in ocean currents, and a nearly ice-free Arctic in \nthe summer.\n  While the majority of the detected shifts are distant from major \npopulation centers, the implications will be\n\n[[Page H502]]\n\nfelt over large distances, creating significant economic and \nhumanitarian consequences.\n  As with any abrupt change in the Earth's system, a cascade of other \ntransformations will likely follow, each building upon and exacerbating \nthe others. We could see a shift in ecosystems, the collapse of \npermafrost in the Arctic, and an extensive species loss. Each of these \nchanges would trigger massive implications for the natural systems and \nsociety as a whole.\n  So what does all this mean? It means we must act now. As President \nObama said in his State of the Union address: If you want to debate the \nscience of climate change, feel free to do so, but you will be pretty \nlonely.\n  Today America's business leaders, the Pentagon, the majority of \nAmericans, the scientific community, and nations around the world \nrecognize that we cannot wait to act.\n  We saw evidence of this last year when more than 40,000 negotiators \nfrom 196 countries descended on the French capital for the Paris \nClimate Summit. The Summit provided the world with an effective global \nframework for addressing climate change, but our work is far from over.\n  It is time to recognize that the consequences of inaction are far too \ngreat. If my colleagues are willing to put political ideologies aside \nand recognize that acting on climate change is not just in our planet's \ninterest, but in the interest of humanity, we may still have a fighting \nchance.\n  Albert Einstein once said: ``The world, as we have created it, is a \nprocess of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our \nthinking.''\n  Now is the time for Congress to change our thinking and address the \nreality of climate change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H502-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ARMY SERGEANT RODDIE EDMONDS OF KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Duncan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, the word hero is used way too \nlightly these days, but an extraordinary man from my district was a \ntrue hero of legendary proportions.\n  During World War II, Army Sergeant Roddie Edmonds of Knoxville, \nTennessee, was captured at the Battle of the Bulge by the Nazis and \nsent to a POW camp. When the war was nearing an end, the camp's \ncommander ordered all of the Jewish prisoners to report for what they \nknew was certain death.\n  As the highest ranking American in the camp, Sergeant Edmonds called \non all 1,000 servicemen imprisoned there to step forward.\n  The German commander explained: They cannot all be Jews.\n  Sergeant Edmonds responded, with a pistol at his head: We are all \nJews here.\n  The German commander backed down.\n  Sergeant Edmonds has now been designated Righteous Among the Nations, \nIsrael's highest award for non-Jews. He is the first American \nserviceman to receive this honor.\n  Much has been written about the Greatest Generation, Mr. Speaker. It \nis because of people like Sergeant Edmonds. His son was given this \ngreat award on behalf of his father at the Israeli Embassy last week.\n  I am introducing a bill requesting that Sergeant Edmonds be awarded a \nMedal of Honor posthumously.\n  Director Steven Spielberg has purchased the rights to Sergeant \nEdmonds' story, and I hope a movie about his life will come out in the \nnear future. The story of his valor should be made known to all \nAmericans.\n\n\n                      Federal Air Marshal Service\n\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I want to go in a different \ndirection at this point and mention another topic.\n  A couple of months ago, in interviews both by National Public Radio \nand CBS News, I described the air marshal program as possibly the most \nneedless, useless, wasteful program in the entire Federal Government.\n  Shortly thereafter, the Los Angeles Times published an editorial \nentitled ``It's Time to Ground America's Air Marshals'' and said, \n``Duncan has a point.''\n  The editorial pointed out that there is no data showing marshals \nsuccessfully put down in-flight threats and added: ``In fact, \npassengers are apparently more likely to stop troublemakers on board \nthan armed marshals.'' The Times said that air marshals are a placebo \nthe country should stop taking.\n  I became concerned a few years ago about this when I read in USA \nToday that more air marshals had been arrested than arrests by air \nmarshals. At that point, the Service was costing $200 million per \narrest.\n  I was able to get the Appropriations Committee to start reducing \ntheir funding from a high of $966 million, after they had been given \nbig increases each year, to $790 million this fiscal year.\n  Having airport screeners and simply locking aircraft doors have done \nmuch more good than the many, many billions we have spent just so air \nmarshals can fly back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, \nusually in first class. This money is money that could and should be \nspent on much more cost-effective security measures.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, The Wall Street Journal, a few months after 9/\n11, when they noticed that almost every department and agency in the \nFederal Government was sending up requests for more money based on \nsecurity, said a wise legislative policy to follow would be that, from \nnow on, if any legislation came to the Congress with the word \n``security'' attached, it should be given twice the scrutiny and four \ntimes the weight.\n  Unfortunately, we have wasted many, many billions on different \nprograms in this country just because they had the word security \nattached. We need to take the advice of The Wall Street Journal and \ngive those bills much more scrutiny.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H502-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H502-H503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n                          CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Foster) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, last month President Obama came to this \nChamber to speak, inter alia, of a moonshot to cure cancer under the \nleadership of Vice President Biden. This week the President announced \nspecific plans to invest $1 billion to fund that moonshot.\n  As a scientist and as the manager of large scientific projects, I am \nnaturally inclined to be skeptical of such bold claims from \npoliticians. President Nixon famously launched the same war on cancer \nin 1971. Tragically, we continue to wage that war today.\n  More recently, Andrew von Eschenbach, the director of the National \nCancer Institute under President Bush, set the goal of eliminating \nsuffering and death from cancer by 2015. We all know, unfortunately, \nthat that goal was never met.\n  So why is this cancer moonshot any different? Is this a moment like \n1961 when President Kennedy stood before a joint session of Congress \nand announced his goal of sending a man to the Moon by the end of the \ndecade and succeeded? Or is this a moment like 1971 when President \nNixon declared war on cancer and failed?\n  I believe that President Obama's cancer initiative will succeed, and \nthe reason that it will succeed is brutally simple: Science, basic \nscience and technology that exists today and did not exist 45 years \nago; technology that was generated by decades of curiosity-driven \nfederally funded research paid for by the United States taxpayer.\n  There are many decades of federally supported basic scientific \nadvances that will allow the Obama-Biden cancer moonshot to succeed: \nThe ability to fully genome sequence individual cancers, the ability to \nmanipulate the genome and produce animal models to study and to test \nthe basic mechanisms of cancer, and immunotherapy treatment, which was \nnamed Science magazine's breakthrough of the year in 2013 and has been \ncapturing so many headlines around the world.\n  Immunotherapy is an ingenious and revolutionary treatment that uses \nthe body's own immune system to fight cancer. Since time immemorial, \nthere have been stories of miraculous remissions of cancer when \npatients with apparently incurable cancers have experienced spontaneous \nand often complete remissions. These were often attributed to an act of \nGod or perhaps the moral character of the patient.\n\n[[Page H503]]\n\n  We now understand that for most, if not all, of these remissions that \nthey happen when the body's immune system, which has evolved over \nmillions of years of combat with foreign viral and bacterial invaders, \nfinally understands that cancer is an enemy and has all the horsepower \nthat it needs to attack and to clean it up. Immunotherapy now gives us \nthe scientific understanding of how to mass produce those miracles.\n  This would never have been discovered without decades of sustained \nFederal investment in R, and although the breakthroughs in \nimmunotherapy rest upon a large pyramid of federally funded research, \nthere are two parallel threads of federally funded research that \ndirectly led to this breakthrough.\n  One was pioneered by Jim Allison, then of UC Berkeley, and Arlene \nSharpe of Harvard Medical School. The other was pioneered by Lieping \nChen of the Mayo Clinic, all three labs using Federal funds to study \nhow the immune system is controlled and how it knows to kill foreign \ncells but not its own cells. This was a fascinating scientific \nquestion, but not one which was obviously relevant to cancer.\n  All three labs were sponsored by basic science peer-reviewed grants \nfrom the National Institutes of Health, which I mention, Mr. Speaker, \nbecause of the way that peer review seems to be coming under attack by \nmembers of your party. In the 1990s these groups were all working on \nwhat became known as immune checkpoints, which are regulatory pathways \nto turn down the immune system to prevent it from attacking its own \nbody.\n  Even once this basic discovery was made, the established \npharmaceutical companies would not touch it, but in 1999 Medarex, a \nsmall biotech in Princeton, New Jersey, funded by the National \nInstitutes of Health, took on the project. Ten years later, only after \nMedarex was well on the way to showing that their cancer immunotherapy \napproach worked in humans, it was purchased by Bristol-Myers Squibb for \n$2.4 billion. Now there are many drug companies developing checkpoint \ninhibitor drugs to treat cancer as well as other immune system-related \ntreatments for cancer.\n  So, as I mentioned before, the Obama-Biden cancer moonshot will \nlikely succeed because of the technology and basic science that was \ngenerated by decades of curiosity-driven scientific research funded by \nthe United States Government.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am the representative of U.S. citizens, but one who \ndoes not share your party's monomania about small government or a \ndesire to keep our government small and indebted simply to provide low \ntax rates for wealthy donors because Americans know that small \ngovernment does not accomplish great things, like sending a man to the \nMoon or curing cancer.\n  The following is a complete text of my remarks:\n  Mr. Speaker, last month, President Obama came to this chamber to \nspeak, inter alia, of a ``moonshot'' to cure cancer, under the \nleadership of Vice President Biden. This week the President announced \nspecific plans to invest one billion dollars to fund that ``moonshot.'' \nAs a scientist, and as the manager of large scientific projects, I am \nnaturally inclined to be skeptical of such bold claims from \npoliticians. President Richard Nixon famously launched the same ``war \non cancer'' in 1971. Tragically, we continue to wage that war today. \nMore recently, Andrew von Eschenbach, the director of the National \nCancer Institute under President Bush, set the goal of ``eliminating \nsuffering and death from cancer by 2015.'' We all know, unfortunately, \nthat goal was not met. So why is this ``cancer moonshot'' any \ndifferent?\n  Is this a moment like 1961, when President Kennedy stood before a \njoint session of Congress and announced his goal of putting a man on \nthe moon by the end of the decade--and succeeded? Or a moment like 1971 \nwhen President Nixon declared War on Cancer and failed?\n  I believe that President Obama's cancer initiative will succeed. And \nthe reason it will succeed is brutally simple: science. Basic science \nand technology that exists today, and did not exist 45 years ago. \nTechnology that was generated by decades of curiosity-driven scientific \nresearch--paid for by the United States Taxpayer. There are many \ndecades of federally-supported basic scientific advances that will \nallow the Obama-Biden cancer moonshot succeed: the ability to fully \ngenome sequence individual cancers, the ability to manipulate the \ngenome to produce animal models to study and test the basic mechanisms \nof cancer, and immunotherapy treatment, which was named Science \nMagazine's breakthrough of the year in 2013, and which has been \ncapturing so many headlines around the world. Immunotherapy is an \ningenious and revolutionary treatment that uses the body's own immune \nsystem to fight cancer.\n  Since time immemorial, there have been stories of ``miraculous \nremissions'' of cancer, where patients with apparently incurable \ncancers have experienced spontaneous and often complete remissions. \nThese were often attributed to an act of God, or perhaps the moral \ncharacter of the patient.\n  We now understand that most, if not all, of these remissions happen \nwhen the body's immune system, which has evolved over millennia of \ncombat with foreign viral and bacterial invaders, finally understands \nthe cancer as an enemy, and has all of the horsepower it needs to \nattack it and to clean it up. And immunotherapy now gives us the \nscientific understanding of how to mass produce those miracles. But \nthis would never have been discovered without decades of sustained \nfederal investments in R\n  Although the breakthroughs of immunotherapy rest on a pyramid of \nlargely taxpayer-funded research, there are two parallel threads of \nfederally funded research that directly led to this breakthrough. One \nwas pioneered by Jim Allison, then of UC Berkeley, and Arlene Sharpe, \nof Harvard Medical School. The other was pioneered by Lieping Chen of \nthe Mayo Clinic. All three labs were using federal funds to study how \nthe immune system is controlled, how it knows to kill foreign cells but \nnot its own cells. This was a fascinating scientific question, but not \none that was obviously relevant to cancer. All three labs are supported \nby basic-science from the National Institutes of Health peer-reviewed \ngrants. Which I mention, Mr. Speaker, because of the way that peer \nreview is coming under attack by members of your party.\n  In the 1990s, they were all working on what have come to be known as \nimmunological checkpoints, which are regulatory pathways that turn down \nthe immune system to prevent it from attacking its own body.\n  Even once this basic discovery was made, the established \npharmaceutical companies would not touch it. But in 1999, Medarex, a \nsmall biotech in Princeton, NJ, funded by the National Institutes of \nHealth, took on the project. Ten years later, only after Medarex was \nwell on the way to showing that their cancer immunotherapy approach \nworked in humans, it was purchased by Bristol-Myers-Squibb for 2.4 \nbillion dollars. There are now many drug companies developing \ncheckpoint inhibitor drugs to treat cancer, as well as other immune-\nsystem-related treatments for cancer.\n  So as I mentioned before, the Obama-Biden cancer moonshot will likely \nsucceed, because of the technology and basic science that was generated \nby decades of curiosity-driven scientific research--funded by the \nUnited States Government. Or, funded by big government, Mr. Speaker, as \nyour colleagues like to say. Funded by a big government, directed by a \nvast, unelected, overpaid, lazy, wasteful federal bureaucracy. A \nbureaucracy that will save millions of American lives. I often hear my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle claim we don't need to make \nfederal investments in R, because if it's worth doing, the private \nsector will do it. Immunotherapy is a perfect example of why that logic \ndoesn't work.\n  The private sector took over, but not until researchers spent decades \nand millions of taxpayer dollars elucidating the basic science and \nproving this method could work.\n  I also hear my colleagues cherry picking studies that they can't make \nsense of and label them as wasteful spending, then trumpeting their \nsuccess in cutting ``wasteful'' government spending. When the truth is \nthose ``wasteful'' programs often lead to breakthroughs like \nimmunotherapy. The cancer moonshot being led by Vice President Biden is \nlikely to succeed, but only because of sustained investments in federal \nfunding for research and development. As we work in the coming months \nto develop a budget, I hope my colleagues will keep this in mind. I am \nthe representative of U.S. citizens, Mr. Speaker, but one that does not \nshare your party's monomania about ``small government'', or a desire to \nkeep government small and indebted simply to provide low tax rates for \nits wealthy donors. Because Americans know that small government does \nnot accomplish great things, like sending a man to the moon, or curing \ncancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H503-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H503-H504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CELEBRATING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND CONSTRICTING INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The Chair \nrecognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, as I come to the floor this morning, I \nwant to express appreciation for our 64th annual National Prayer \nBreakfast that takes place tomorrow. I think this is such a wonderful \ngathering that we\n\n[[Page H504]]\n\nhave every year, where our Nation focuses on praying for our Nation. I \nwant to welcome my guests, Dr. and Mrs. Franklin Page, who will join us \nthis week to recognize this time and to set aside time to celebrate our \nreligious liberty and the individual freedom that becomes the focus of \nthis week.\n  There is also another focus that comes into mind as we talk about \nthis religious liberty. I want to take a moment and welcome and \nrecognize the arrival of my new nephew, Grayson Lee Hunter. He is \njoining brothers Worth and Preston, his cousin Georgia Kate, and his \ncousins Jack and Chase, who are my grandsons. We know that being able \nto grow up in freedom is such a wonderful gift, and we are excited \nabout that and excited about what individual freedom means to each of \nus.\n  I want to turn our attention now to something that constricts that \nfreedom, and that is what we see through the President's healthcare \nlaw. Again, yesterday we came to the floor to push to repeal that law. \nThis is something that we will continue. There is a reason for this.\n  Let me give you some examples. Last week I was out in my district. I \nvisited with constituents who are employers. I want to cite three \nexamples. One, an employer of 76 people, another an employer of 400 \npeople, and another a franchise owner, 3,000 people that are in this \ngroup.\n  Let me tell you what I heard from each and every one of these \nindividuals. Their employees, many of whom are my constituents, want to \nsee a return to patient-centered, affordable health care. They do not \nwant more Big Government and more unfunded mandates that they are being \nforced to deal with. It changes the kind of health care that they can \nget.\n  Now, when it comes to health insurance, what we have found is the \nescalation of cost to the individual because of what is happening with \nthe mandate. The insurance cost has gone up, the out-of-pocket \ndeductibles, all of this is going up. What we also see is a cramping of \naccess because of narrowed networks.\n  Another thing that is happening is what is taking place through the \noversight boards, the preventive service task forces. These could also \nbe called some of those oxymoronic Federal agencies because instead of \nopening up the healthcare process, what we see is they are reducing \nwhat you have access to, and it is also a slowdown in payment \nreimbursements for so many of our Medicare recipients. That is what is \nhappening in health care, and we are hearing about it from our \nemployers.\n  Now, there are options that are out there. Let me cite just a couple \nfor my colleagues. H.R. 2300, Empowering Patients First Act, that is \nthe bill from Dr. Price, and also, special attention to, the Republican \nStudy Committee plan, the American Health Care Reform Act. It is H.R. \n2653. Leading this charge has been my Tennessee colleague Dr. Phil Roe, \nwho has worked with each of us as we have pulled provisions into this \nbill to make certain that we return to the principles of affordability, \naccessibility, and accountability in patient-centered health care. We \nthink it is time for these moves to take place.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to return everyone's attention to the need \nto address the issue of replacing the ObamaCare legislation so that we \nreduce the cost and increase the access of health care for all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H504-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DR. OMALU'S DISCOVERIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McNerney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the medical \nachievements and discoveries of an extraordinary man from my district, \nDr. Bennet Omalu.\n  Dr. Omalu's medical achievements, focusing primarily on brain \ninjuries, have recently come to prominence with the movie \n``Concussion,'' which chronicles Dr. Omalu's career and the \ncontroversies that his discoveries have created within the National \nFootball League. Dr. Omalu's medical research is also particularly \nrelevant as we prepare to watch Super Bowl 50 this weekend.\n  Dr. Omalu was born in Nnokwa, Nigeria, and was the sixth of seven \nsiblings. His mother was a seamstress, and his father was a mining \nengineer and respected community leader who encouraged Omalu's career \nin medicine. His long medical career began at the age of 16 when he \nstarted attending medical school at the University of Nigeria. Omalu \nearned a bachelor of medicine and a bachelor of surgery in 1990.\n  In 1994, Dr. Omalu moved to Seattle, Washington, and completed an \nepidemiology fellowship at the University of Washington. In 1995, he \nmoved to New York to complete his residency training in anatomic and \nclinical pathology. After completing his residency, Dr. Omalu trained \nas a forensic pathologist at the Allegheny County Coroner's Office in \nPittsburgh.\n  It was here, after conducting an autopsy on former Pittsburgh Steeler \nMike Webster, that Dr. Omalu made a groundbreaking discovery that would \nforever change our understanding of brain injuries. Dr. Omalu was the \nfirst to identify and diagnose and name chronic traumatic \nencephalopathy. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, is a disease \nprevalent in athletes who participate in high-contact sports like \nfootball, boxing, and wrestling.\n  Since Dr. Omalu's discovery, we now know that CTE is a progressive, \ndegenerative disease that is found in people who have suffered \nrepetitive brain trauma, including subconcussive hits that do not show \nany immediate symptoms. Early symptoms of CTE are usually detected 8 to \n10 years after the original trauma and include disorientation, \ndizziness, and headaches.\n  As the disease progresses, individuals with CTE can experience memory \nloss, social instability, erratic behavior, and poor judgment. The \nworst cases of CTE show symptoms of dementia, vertigo, impeded speech, \ntremors, deafness, slowing of muscular movements, and suicidal \ntendencies.\n  Dr. Omalu's continued research on brain injuries and CTE has given us \na greater understanding of the long-term effects of repeated brain \ntrauma.\n  According to the CDC, approximately 3.8 million Americans every year \nsuffer from concussions and approximately 208,000 people seek treatment \nin emergency rooms for traumatic brain injuries.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Approximately two-thirds of those emergency room visits are children \nages 5 to 18. The rate of recurrence with traumatic brain injuries is \nhigh. An athlete who sustains a concussion is four to six times more \nlikely to sustain a second concussion.\n  Of course, CTE research will also apply to veterans who suffer from \ntraumatic brain injuries from combat activity.\n  Dr. Omalu has advocated for more education among athletes who play \nhigh-contact sports, teaching them about the risks associated with \nrepetitive brain trauma. He has committed himself to advancing the \nmedical understanding of CTE, brain injuries, and their effects on the \npeople who suffer from them.\n  Today, Dr. Omalu has eight advanced degrees and board certifications, \nincluding master of public health and epidemiology and master of \nbusiness administration. He resides in Lodi, California, and serves as \nthe chief medical examiner of San Joaquin County, California, and as a \nprofessor at the UC Davis Department of Medical Pathology and \nLaboratory Medicine.\n  The Bennet Omalu Foundation is committed to funding research, raising \nawareness, providing care, and finding cures for people who suffer from \nCTE and traumatic brain injuries. It is imperative, as a Nation, that \nwe support research on CTE and brain injuries and figure out how much \nhigh-impact sports are affecting the health of our children and \nathletes. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the research and \nachievements of Dr. Bennet Omalu and all he has done to further the \nunderstanding of the human brain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H504-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H504-H505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HUD OVER-INCOME HOUSING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Woodall). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of bipartisan \nlegislation that the House recently passed, H.R. 3700, the Housing \nOpportunity Through\n\n[[Page H505]]\n\nModernization Act, and specifically section 103 that addresses a \ndisturbing trend in taxpayer federally subsidized housing.\n  Last summer, HUD's inspector general published an audit revealing \nthat over 25,000 recipients of taxpayer-supported housing actually \nexceeded the maximum allowable income to qualify for housing \nassistance. Importantly, roughly triple that number is on a wait list \nfor housing. In fact, those on the wait list are economically \nqualified.\n  Worse, to pay for these over-income tenants, American taxpayers--you \nand I--are on the hook for $104 million next year. While hundreds of \nthousands of desperate low-income American families legitimately in \nneed of taxpayer-supported housing today sit on those lists idly \nwaiting for much-needed help, tens of thousands of over-income tenants \nsit in taxpayer-supported housing.\n  In one instance, a New York family with an income of nearly $500,000 \nis receiving taxpayer-subsidized public housing. In Nebraska, an \nindividual with double the income limit and $1.6 million in assets is \nliving in taxpayer-supported housing, paying $300 a month. In my home \nState of Florida, we have many cases as well.\n  It is very clear that eliminating this kind of waste, fraud, and \nabuse is the reason that we serve today. It is critical that we do so.\n  A combination of inadequate congressional directives and an \nindifferent Federal bureaucracy has let down the American people--the \npeople who trust Congress to responsibly and effectively allocate tax \ndollars. It has also let down the low-income families on the wait list \nwho are hoping for an opportunity to climb out of poverty.\n  I am pleased that the House acted responsibly yesterday to pass \nlegislation to stop this failed policy. Section 103 of the Housing \nOpportunity Through Modernization Act sets clear requirements for HUD \nand, now, for local housing authorities.\n  Under this section, households currently in public housing whose \nincome exceeds 120 percent of the median income level for 2 consecutive \nyears will no longer be permitted to receive taxpayer assistance. \nFurther, public housing authorities will be required to report annually \nto Congress and the American people on tenant incomes so that we might \nmaintain proper oversight of this program.\n  These are reasonable reforms that bring accountability to a Federal \nprogram that desperately needs it, ensures a smooth pathway for over-\nincome households to a reasonable transition off of taxpayer \nassistance, and should create new opportunities for those on the wait \nlist.\n  I am also pleased to see that HUD is finally taking steps to address \nthis matter. It is far too late, but at least they are. Just yesterday, \nthe agency announced that it will consider a much-needed new rule to \nstrengthen oversight of over-income tenancy in public housing.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should not rest until we can be sure that taxpayer \ndollars, those of the men and women who entrust us to represent them, \nare going to support only those American families most in need of \nassistance.\n  We still have much work remaining, but with passage of the Housing \nOpportunity Through Modernization Act, we have made a very important \nfirst step. Let us, together, hope that the Senate and the President \nwill join with us in this important work on behalf of the American \ntaxpayers that we represent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H505-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION: GO RED FOR WOMEN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Mrs. Beatty) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the American \nHeart Association's Go Red for Women campaign.\n  The Go Red for Women campaign is a critical public awareness platform \nthat the American Heart Association uses to help promote heart-healthy \nlifestyles. More than 627,000 women's lives have been saved from heart \ndisease since the Go Red for Women campaign was created in 2004. We \nhave made tremendous progress, Mr. Speaker, in the fight against \ncardiovascular disease, but we still have a long way to go.\n  Heart disease is the number one killer of women and is more deadly \nthan all forms of cancer combined. Heart disease causes one in three \nwomen's death each year, killing approximately 1 woman every minute. \nNinety percent of women have one or more risk factors for developing \nheart disease. Since 1984, more women than men have died from heart \ndisease.\n  Heart disease is, unfortunately, a silent killer. According to the \nAmerican Heart Association, nearly half of all women are not aware that \nheart disease is the leading cause of death for women.\n  For African American women, the risk of heart disease is especially \ngreat. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for African \nAmerican women. Of African American women 20 years of age and older, \n46.9 percent have cardiovascular disease; yet only 43 percent of \nAfrican American women know that heart disease is their greatest health \nrisk. In fact, I did not realize that I was at risk for stroke.\n  In 1999, I suffered a cerebral brain stem stroke. Because of my \npersonal experience, I decided to be part of the solution. As this \nepidemic continues, I decided to not sit on the sidelines.\n  In 2000, I was elected to serve on the National American Heart \nAssociation Board of Directors. I was the only nonphysician or \nnonmedical professional on the board at that time. As a board member, I \nserved as a leader, guiding the American Heart Association's mission, \ncultural sensitivities, and national efforts.\n  Here in Congress, my advocacy continues. As a member of the \nCongressional Heart and Stroke Coalition, my colleagues and I work to \nraise awareness about the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular \ndisease.\n  Last Congress, I introduced two pieces of legislation that raise \nawareness for stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. One, the Return \nto Work Awareness Act, would assist survivors of stroke and other \ndebilitating health occurrences in returning to work. Both pieces of \nlegislation had the support of the American Heart Association and the \nNational Stroke Association.\n  I will reintroduce, Mr. Speaker, these important pieces of \nlegislation this month during American Heart Month. I encourage all my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to join me as an original \nsponsor.\n  Mr. Speaker, you will notice that many of our colleagues today will \nbe wearing the red American Heart Association pin. By wearing this pin, \nwe help raise the awareness of cardiovascular disease in women and \nprovide an important reminder that it is never too early to take action \nto protect our health.\n  This month, American Heart Month, let us recommit ourselves to \nimproving heart-healthy lifestyles and to continue to fight against \nthis deadly disease for ourselves and our families.\n  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize all the survivors of heart \ndisease and those who are battling heart disease.

Mr. Speaker, next Friday will mark the seventh \nanniversary of the crash of Continental Colgan Flight 3407.\n  The cause of the accident was pilot error due to inexperience. The \nfamilies of those who were lost fought for and won reforms that require \npilots to be sufficiently experienced before they are entrusted with \nthe safety of the flying public.\n  But regional airlines are trying to roll back these higher standards, \nclaiming that they cannot find enough experienced pilots. That is \nsimply not true. The airlines would see that if they increased starting \nsalaries for pilots from $16,000 a year to a level commensurate with \nthe responsibility they are given.\n  Yesterday the Western New York congressional delegation stood with \nthe families to serve notice that we will relentlessly oppose any \nattempt to water down these reforms. We will honor those who died by \nensuring that never again will our loved ones be entrusted with \ninexperienced pilots.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H506-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCE LIEUTENANT HADAR GOLDIN\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

Mr. Speaker, this Sunday ``60 \nMinutes'' highlighted an explosive undercover investigation by Global \nWitness, which showed just how easy it is for criminals and corrupt \nofficials to use anonymous shell companies to bring dirty money into \nthe United States.\n  The reason it is so easy is because States don't require the \ndisclosure of the true beneficial ownership of shell companies. This is \nunacceptable, and it has to stop. As Global Witness stated, ``anonymous \nshell companies are like getaway cars for crooks.''\n  That is why I am reintroducing a law, along with my good friend and \ncolleague, Representative Peter King, which would require that the \nperson creating the corporation say who the beneficial owner is and, \nalso, to explain who really owns the company.\n  If States do not require and get this information, then, as a \nbackstop, the United States Treasury will have this information before \nan account can be opened.\n  This is a commonsense, bipartisan attack on what is a major national \nsecurity and law enforcement issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H507-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE\n\n  (Mrs. ROBY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to draw attention to the important \nrole that agriculture plays in this country.\n  I am honored to serve in a district in which agriculture represents \nthe largest employer and is responsible for $11 billion in economic \nimpact.\n  It is why, during my time on the House Agriculture Committee, I was \nproud to help craft a new farm bill that delivers modern, more \nconservative policy for our farmers.\n  That is why now, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have \nremained diligent in making sure that the promises we made in the farm \nbill are kept.\n  We faced a challenge last year in the crop insurance program when it \nwas gutted in the budget. This is the system that we promised our \nfarmers to help transition away from direct payments.\n  Cutting it was unfair. I was proud to help restore that program \nfunding before the end of the year, but it demonstrated something of a \ndisconnect.\n  Mr. Speaker, not everyone in Congress represents a district with such \na large agricultural footprint. What I try to explain to my colleagues \nis that, when you mess around with the crop insurance program, you \naren't just affecting farmers who put seed in the ground.\n  You are affecting the ones who sell the seed, who build the equipment \nto cultivate and harvest the crop, and those who help process the goods \nfor their final products.\n  That farming dollar turns over many times, and there is an entire \nagriculture supply chain that is affected by the farm policies we set \nin Congress.\n  My farmers know I have their back and I always will as long as I am \nin Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H507-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GO RED FOR WOMEN CAMPAIGN\n\n  (Ms. GRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. GRAHAM.

The troubling \nnumbers are more than a statistic. They are a fact of life that cause \nunnecessary pain and suffering to families across our country.\n  I say unnecessary pain and suffering because we have the power to \nchange it. We can save lives. As much as 80 percent of heart disease \nand stroke-related deaths can be prevented with education and action.\n  That is why I am standing to raise awareness and encourage my fellow \nmembers and constituents across north Florida to Go Red by \nparticipating in National Wear Red Day on Friday.\n  Wear something red, like this jacket, to show your support for women \nfighting heart disease and strokes.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the World Health Organization \ndeclared the Zika virus outbreak a global public health emergency.\n  The virus is particularly dangerous to pregnant women as it has been \nlinked to serious physical and neurological defects in their unborn \nchildren. As the father of six children, I understand how frightening \nthis could be.\n  Experts fear the virus will spread more widely to the United States, \nespecially with the Olympic Games in Brazil on the horizon. That is why \nI have introduced the Zika Response and Safety Act, to ensure that key \nagencies have the resources necessary to combat this growing threat.\n  In 2014, Congress allocated more than $2 billion to fight Ebola. Much \nof that money is still unspent. I would like to make some of that \nfunding available to be used to combat the Zika virus.\n  This virus is a global health threat that requires our immediate \nattention. I urge my colleagues to support the Zika Response and Safety \nAct so that we can provide the necessary resources to understand and to \nprevent the harmful effects from Zika.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H507-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                    WE NEED TO PROPERLY MANAGE WATER\n\n  (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to the failure of \nCalifornia State agencies and Federal agencies to properly manage \nCalifornia's water system as a result of the El Nino storms that we \nhave been receiving.\n  El Nino years, like this one, are California's hope of digging out of \nthe historical drought conditions that we are facing. There is very \nhigh likelihood that most of the State will experience flood \nconditions, while communities in the San Joaquin Valley that I \nrepresent will receive a zero water allocation.\n  This year we have already missed an opportunity to move significant \namounts of water to regions of California that need it most in the San \nJoaquin Valley.\n  As a result of the State and Federal agencies' inability to operate \nin the most flexible range allowable, over 160,000 acre-feet of water \nhas been lost this week alone and over half a million acre-feet has \nbeen lost this year. Meanwhile, an estimated total of 2 million acre-\nfeet of water has gone out to the ocean.\n  State and Federal agencies are failing to take advantage of the water \nin the system today, and that is unacceptable. It is a disservice to \nall Californians. It is simply immoral.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H507-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H507-H508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING AMBASSADOR GARY DOER\n\n  (Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Coach Glenn Robinson \nof Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster.\n  For 45 years, since he was only 25 years old, Coach Robinson has been \nleading the F Diplomats to victory. Coach Robinson is the winningest \ncoach in the history of Division III basketball. He is now only the \nthird college basketball coach ever to win 900 games, behind only \nlegendary Bobby Knight of Indiana and Philadelphia's Bob Magee.\n  Four times he has broken his own school record for best record in the \nseason, 12 times he has been named Region Coach of the Year by the \nNational Association of Basketball Coaches, 12 times he has been \nConference Coach of the Year, he has once been Division Coach of the \nYear, and he has won 93 postseason victories, 42 NCAA tournament \nvictories, including 16 trips to the Sweet 16, 10 trips to the Elite 8, \nfive trips to the Final 4, and one national championship appearance.\n  True leadership is servant leadership, the kind that finds people's \nstrengths. Coach Robinson is an exemplary leader, and the proof of that \nis that he brings out the best in his players, 25 of whom have gone \nall-American.\n  Coach Robinson is one of the greatest coaches in college history, and \nLancaster will always be rightly proud of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H508-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WE MUST FIX OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM\n\n  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POLIS.

Yet here we \nare, more than halfway through the 114th Congress, and not a single \nimmigration bill that fixes the problem has even been brought to the \nfloor or committee or passed.\n  We hear Presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle tapping \ninto the enormous public sentiment that says stop what you are doing \nand fix our broken immigration system. There are 11 million people or \nmore in our country illegally. The rule of law has been made a mockery \nof, families are being torn apart by ICE and DHS at great cost to \ntaxpayers. Let's fix our immigration system.\n  Comprehensive immigration reform will save over $200 billion, create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs for Americans, secure our borders, and \nrestore the rule of law.\n  What is not to like? Let's come together around finally fixing the \nproblem rather than simply complaining about it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H508-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING DAVID LAWSON, ROCHESTER VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER\n\n  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute \nto a brave individual in my district. Rochester volunteer firefighter \nDavid Lawson was returning home from an early-morning medical call last \nmonth when he hit a deer. While the accident only caused minor damage \nto his vehicle, it delayed his trip home. While he was driving, he saw \nsmoke coming out of the vents of a nearby property.\n  He called 911. He headed to the house and began banging on the front \ndoor to wake up the residents. He woke up the adults. The adults \ngrabbed the four kids, and they got out safely. We later found out the \nfire started in the attic, which is why it did not set off smoke \ndetectors.\n  David Lawson's courage and resolve to protect the residents of \nnorthern Indiana is truly remarkable. On behalf of the people of \nIndiana's Second Congressional District, I want to personally thank \nDavid and every brave man and woman who represent Indiana's finest \nfirst responder community for their collective service and commitment \nto protecting all of our loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H508-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREMEMBERING THE LEGACY OF SACRIFICE AND SERVICE OF DAVID MAURITSON AND \n                              PHIL DRYDEN\n\n  (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember two remarkable \nindividuals who tragically died Monday evening in a plane crash in \nMobile County, Alabama.\n  Major David Mauritson of Fairhope and Lieutenant Phil Dryden of Gulf \nShores were members of the Civil Air Patrol, and they were returning \nfrom a compassion flight to Baton Rouge where they helped transport a \nfellow citizen for medical care when their plane went down.\n  David Mauritson had been a member of the Civil Air Patrol since 1991 \nand worked for years as a cardiologist and a lawyer. He had been flying \nall his life and was committed to helping others through charity \nmedical flights.\n  Phil Dryden served our country in Vietnam as a combat medic. He had \njust joined the Civil Air Patrol last year and served as the Mobile \nsquadron's assistant operations officer.\n  Mr. Speaker, one day our time on this Earth will draw to a close. \nWhen that day comes, we will be remembered not for what we had, we will \nbe remembered for what we did.\n  David Mauritson and Phil Dryden left this world helping others. The \nlegacy of service and sacrifice is how they will always be remembered.\n  On behalf of Alabama's First Congressional District, I offer my \ndeepest condolences to their families.

Mr. Speaker, as part of the Iran nuclear deal, the \nIranian regime will receive up to $150 billion in sanctions relief. \nSecretary of State John Kerry has admitted that some of\n\n[[Page H509]]\n\nthe sanctions relief will go to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, \nwhich provides funding and training to terrorist groups like Hezbollah \nand Hamas. The Revolutionary Guard Corps is also responsible for \nsupporting Shia militias that killed American troops and are currently \nfueling sectarian tensions in Iraq.\n  Like most of my colleagues in Congress, I opposed the Iranian deal \nand continue to believe it will not guarantee a nuclear weapons-free \nIran.\n  But the simple fact that this deal has moved forward should not be an \nexcuse for allowing sanctions relief to benefit terrorists.\n  Yesterday the House passed a commonsense bill that prohibits \nPresident Obama from removing sanctions on foreign financial \ninstitutions that are doing business with Iran's Revolutionary Guard \nCorps. I urge immediate adoption of this legislation.\n  We also need to deal with the victims of Iran's terrorism--Americans \nwho were subject to terrorism by Iranian actions. Out of the $150 \nbillion, up to $40 billion of awarded money should be received by these \npeople because of this action.\n  The Obama administration has already made too many of these \nconcessions.

Standing at 210 feet tall, and possibly taller, depending on \nfund-raising success, the Corpus Christi cross will be the largest \ncross on this side of the Atlantic Ocean.\n  Corpus Christi is the perfect setting for the tallest cross in the \nWestern Hemisphere because Corpus Christi, translated from Latin, means \n``the body of Christ.'' The cross, a symbol of hope, will be located \ndirectly across Interstate 37 from the Coastal Bend State Veterans \nCemetery. What better location is there for a reminder that Christ died \nfor our sins than next to the resting place of those who fought for our \nfreedom.\n  Good work, Pastor Milby, Abundant Life Fellowship, and everybody else \nin Corpus Christi supporting this project.

The State of Louisiana was \ndisproportionately represented with hundreds of folks from our State, \nLouisiana being one of the most pro-life States in the Nation, one of \nthe highest percentages of churchgoers, and one of the highest \npercentages of believers in America.\n  The term ``sanctity of life'' gets thrown around a lot when we start \ntalking about pro-life versus pro-choice in political debate, but it is \nmore than a slogan.

Now there are \na half million more.\n  ISIS is working tirelessly to exploit our national security weakness. \nMeanwhile, the administration is turning a blind eye to the vast \nmajority of visa overstays.\n  Half a million foreign nationals overstayed their visas last year, \nbut less than 1 percent of that group is currently being investigated. \nI have written Secretary Johnson to demand that immediate action be \ntaken to crack down on these visa overstays.

Each and every year, they collect toys to distribute to \nless fortunate children during the holidays.\n  The Family First Center of Lake County, under the direction of Dr. \nEvelyn Chenier, has been a huge partner with the Toys for Tots program. \nJust last year, they distributed nearly 75,000 toys to over 19,000 \nchildren in the Lake County community.\n  Toys for Tots is just one of the numerous programs with which the \nFamily First Center is involved.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule for H.R. 1675, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act \nof 2015, and for H.R. 766, the Financial Institution Customer \nProtection Act of 2015. House Resolution 595 provides for a structured \nrule for consideration of both H.R. 1675 and H.R. 766.\n  The resolution provides 1 hour of debate equally divided between the \nchair and ranking member of the Committee on Financial Services for \nH.R. 1675 and H.R. 766. Additionally, the resolution provides for \nconsideration of all seven amendments which were offered to H.R. 1675, \nand two of the three amendments offered to H.R. 766. Finally, Mr. \nSpeaker, the resolution provides for a motion to recommit for each \nbill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and the \nunderlying legislation. H.R. 1675 is a vehicle for a group of five \nlegislative items, and I will speak about each one of them briefly by \ntitle.\n  Title I, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, would amend SEC rule \n701, which hasn't been modified since 1999.\n  Although small companies are at the forefront of technological \ninnovation and job growth, they often face significant obstacles that \nare often attributable to the proportionately larger burdens on them \nthat securities regulations--written for large public companies--place \non small companies when they seek to go public.\n  SEC rule 701 permits private companies to offer their own securities \nas part of written compensation agreements to employees, directors, \ngeneral partners, trustees, officers, or even certain consultants \nwithout having to comply with very expensive and burdensome security \nregistration requirements. SEC rule 701, therefore, allows small \ncompanies to reward their employees through employee stock ownership in \na company. These ESOPs have been very successful.\n  The $5 million threshold in rule 701 has not been adjusted since \n1999. If the disclosure threshold had been adjusted for inflation, it \nwould be more than $7 million today. The SEC has authority to increase \nthe $5 million disclosure threshold via rulemaking, but like the 500 \nshareholder rule that we had to fix--and my colleague from Colorado was \nvery active in helping with--rule 701 has not been changed. It is \nunlikely to happen without congressional intervention. That is why this \nis so important.\n  This is about getting employees access to ownership in their \ncompanies. It is about building ownership structures that make these \ncompanies stable over time. It allows businesses to incentivize their \nemployees with a direct stake in the ownership in their company. It \nwill help with employee retention, makes sure that these firms have \ngreat opportunities for retirement programs, and helps employees reap \nsome of the benefits of their life's work that they worked so hard for \nevery day.\n  I will give an example, Mr. Speaker. There is a company in my \ndistrict called Allied Mineral. I talked about this, as my colleague \nfrom Colorado may remember, yesterday in the Rules Committee.\n  Allied Mineral is a company in Hilliard, Ohio, that has an ESOP, or \nemployee stock ownership model, and many of those folks who operate \nforklifts in their warehouse will retire with over $1 million in their \n401(k). It really helps these folks want to stay in their company; \ntherefore, it improves retention and cuts down on training new\n\n[[Page H511]]\n\nemployees, but it helps them in their retirement. It is a great vehicle \nto make these companies productive and stable, as well.\n  That is title I. Title I is really important. Title I is pretty \nuniversally agreed to.\n  Title II, the Fair Access to Investment Research Act, directs the SEC \nto create a safe harbor for certain publications or distributions of \nresearch reports by brokers or dealers distributing securities, such as \nexchange-traded funds.\n  An exchange-traded fund is an investment company whose shares are \ntraded intraday on stock exchanges at market-determined prices. \nInvestors can buy and sell exchange-traded funds through a broker or in \na brokerage account, just as they would any other publicly traded \ncompany.\n  Over the past three decades, exchange-traded funds have grown from \n100 funds with about $100 billion in assets to over 1,300 funds worth \n$1.8 trillion in assets. However, due to anomalies in our securities \nlaws and regulations, most of the broker-dealers don't publish research \nabout these exchange-traded funds, despite their growth in popularity.\n  The SEC has implemented similar safe harbors to what this bill would \nsuggest for other asset classes, including listed equities, corporate \ndebt, and closed-end funds. This section will help investors get access \nto useful information when deciding whether to invest in exchange-\ntraded funds and similar products.\n  Title II, I think, is also pretty agreed to.\n  Title III, the Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and \nBrokerage Simplification Act, amends the Securities Exchange Act to \nexempt merger and acquisition brokers from registration with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission. Merger and acquisition brokers \nperform services in connection with the transfer of ownership of mostly \nsmaller privately held companies.\n  An estimated $10 trillion of privately owned companies will be sold \nor traded as baby boomers retire and folks want to figure out what to \ndo with their life's work and how to move their company in a way that \nthe company can continue to exist. But it is important for us to reduce \nthe costs associated with this flow of capital because the registration \nwith SEC for these M brokers can be very expensive.\n  M brokers currently help successful entrepreneurs take the capital \nout of their company and maybe move on to the next phase of their life, \nwhile simultaneously aiding new entrepreneurs in the ability to invest \ntheir capital in the continued success of their company. They foster \neconomic development, growth, and innovation.\n  Despite the valuable services of these M brokers, the compliance \ncosts for this new regulation with the SEC and FINRA can be very \nexpensive. For each individual broker inside an organization, it can \ncost $150,000. Ongoing costs are about $75,000 a year.\n  Let's say somebody does four deals a year. Deals take a little while \nto happen, and they are not going to do a ton of deals. A small firm \nmight do that few number of deals. If you do four deals a year, the \nfirst year you have just added $75,000 to the cost of each deal.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  That is too high. It is causing problems. We need to make sure that \nwe streamline this and allow these small companies to have access to \nthe same type of access to capital that our big companies have.\n  The limit in this is up to $250 million in sales. As many people in \nthis Congress know, up to about $500 million in sales is what we call \nmiddle-market companies.\n  Middle-market companies dot the maps of each one of our districts. \nThese middle-market companies aren't necessarily names you might \nrecognize or the American people would recognize, but they are the \nfastest growing part of our economy. They are major employers in our \ncommunities, and they deserve access to capital, just like the big \ncompanies do.\n  So that is why title III is so important. It will relieve some of the \nfees for these merger and acquisition brokerage houses that help these \ncompanies get access to capital.\n  Title IV, the Small Company Disclosure Simplification Act, provides a \nvoluntary exemption for emerging growth companies, again, with annual \nrevenues up to $250 million from the eXtensible Business Reporting \nLanguage.\n  Basically, it is exportable files. The data is still available. The \npoint here in title IV is that the data will be available, but it might \nnot be in a downloadable format that you can put in a spreadsheet. You \nmight have to look at it in a PDF.\n  Investors look at a lot of things in PDF. I can look at PDFs on my \nphone, and it won't deny anybody information. But the cost of this new \nformat is adding up to $50,000 in costs for these small companies. The \nquestion is: Does the cost really meet the benefit?\n  So it allows an exemption for these small companies. And, again, it \nis an optional exemption. It is not a mandatory exemption. It doesn't \nend this downloadable program, but it allows these small companies to \nbe more flexible in the way they do it because of the cost.\n  Title IV requires the SEC to report to Congress on the XBRL \nrequirements so that it can better analyze and understand how to \nutilize XBRL and structure data moving forward.\n  Finally, we have title V, the Streamlining Excessive and Costly \nRegulations Review Act, in the Securities and Exchange Commission. It \nactually is built on some executive orders. Title V is modeled after \nexecutive orders that the President did last year.\n  It would force the independent agencies and require the Federal \nReserve, OCC, and FDIC to review regulations at least every 10 years \nand identify any outdated and unnecessary regulations that are imposed \non depository institutions.\n  We need to do the same thing for the SEC. That is what this does. I \nthink it will help streamline and make sure that paperwork is more \nreasonable over time, especially for duplicative, outdated, and overly \nburdensome regulations.\n  So that is H.R. 1675.\n  The other bill is H.R. 766, the Financial Institution Customer \nProtection Act.\n  You may have all heard about Operation Choke Point, where law \nenforcement, the Department of Justice, partnered with a lot of other \nagencies. Their plan was to ``choke off'' banking services from \nbusinesses that they found undesirable.\n  Rather than investigating and prosecuting companies that were alleged \nto have committed crimes like fraud and any other misdeeds, the \nDepartment of Justice issued subpoenas to financial institutions to ask \nabout entire industries and effectively coerced financial institutions \nto cease offering banking services to many of those industries.\n  The Department of Justice partnered with the FDIC, the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, to identify merchants that they said \nposed high risk for consumers, notwithstanding the question of whether \nthese merchants were operating under the law or illegally.\n  In doing so, the FDIC equated legitimate and regulated industries, \nsuch as coin dealers, firearms and ammunition sales industries, with \ninherently illegal activities, such as Ponzi schemes, debt \nconsolidation scams, and drug paraphernalia.\n  So that is the real problem here, that they didn't separate out legal \nbusinesses with illegal businesses. If they want to do something with \nregard to businesses that are already illegal and make sure that those \nfolks can't get access to banking services, that is a legitimate thing.\n  But the way they identified high risk made a lot of legal businesses \nlose their access to financial services. They were terminated by their \nbanks and they had, in many cases, no place to turn.\n  This is a blatant overreach by our Federal regulators. And many of \nus, including me, believe this bill is an important step to make sure \nthat businesses that are legally operating have confidence that they \nwill have access to banking services. That is the key here.\n  This last section of this last bill makes sure that legally operating \nbusinesses have access to legal banking services and that the banks \ncan't be intimidated by their regulators to make sure that legally \noperated businesses don't have access to banking services.\n\n[[Page H512]]\n\n  I look forward to debating these bills with our House colleagues. I \nurge support for both the rule and the underlying legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding \nme the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to this rule today \nbecause it is close--it is close--to a rule that would have substantial \nbipartisan support.\n  The rule today provides for consideration of H.R. 1675, the \nEncouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2015, and H.R. 766, the Financial \nInstitution Customer Protection Act of 2015.\n  In terms of process, there is some credit to be given under this \nrule. The rule was very close, with one major fault, which I will \ndiscuss in detail, to fulfilling the promises laid out by the new \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives.\n  As you might recall, Mr. Speaker, there was a promise to all Members \nthat each Member of this body would have a chance to consider his or \nher ideas on the House floor through a more open amendment process.\n  And you know what? That is a good idea.\n  Of course, if it was an idea that didn't have a majority of support, \nthat is fine. But there would be a vote. We could debate it. We could \nvote on it.\n  If ideas came to the floor, were debated and considered worthy by a \nmajority of this body, they would pass. Even if a particular committee \nchair of jurisdiction didn't like the bill, even if leadership on \neither side didn't like the amendment, the will of the body could be \nheard for commonsense improvements.\n  Now, this promise of regular order is so simple, so attractive, so \ndesirable, by the American people who let us do our job, yet, \nunfortunately, it still remains elusive.\n  Now, on the first bill here today, H.R. 1675, the Encouraging \nEmployee Ownership Act, there were seven amendments submitted to the \nRules Committee, four of which I was a cosponsor of.\n\n  I am proud to say all seven amendments were made in order to be \nconsidered on the House floor. If that was all that this rule \ncontained, I would be proud to support that rule.\n  In addition to that, H.R. 1675 is actually good legislation. Look, \nany one of us can say we don't personally agree with every word, and \nthere are amendments to address some of the deficiencies in the bill.\n  But in its total, it is a package that should be considered for an \naffirmative vote by Members of both parties. I am confident that it \nwill have strong bipartisan support in the underlying bill.\n  It promotes and makes needed updates in employee ownership, which is \na great form of corporate governance that I think each Member of this \nbody should support. We have companies in my district that use it.\n  The legislation also clears away red tape for small- and middle-\nmarket companies, which my good friend from Ohio (Mr. Stivers) spoke \nabout here on the floor as well as in the Rules Committee.\n  I do believe that one of the bill's titles, in its current form, \ntakes away and reduces market transparency in the wrong direction.\n  But I am proud to say, Mr. Speaker, we have amendments that will be \nconsidered today by Mr. Issa and Mr. Ellison, as well as cosponsored by \nmyself, that would address that matter--to encourage transparency in \nfinancial markets--because financial markets are predicated on as-\nclose-to-perfect information as we can achieve and step towards perfect \ninformation, enhance the efficiency of markets; steps away from perfect \ninformation, decreased efficiency of markets.\n  Now, the second bill, H.R. 766, unfortunately is a piece of \nlegislation that again addresses a real need, but I can't support it.\n  Again, I would be proud to vote for the rule if it included a simple \namendment which I will be talking about in a moment. But, \nunfortunately, the process through the Rules Committee shut that down.\n  I want to be clear. H.R. 766 takes a look at a critical, legitimate \nissue, the issue of the Justice Department and Operation Choke Point.\n  Now, unfortunately, what it does is it goes too far in limiting the \ntools that are available to DOJ to combat actual illegal activities, \nlike Ponzi schemes, banking fraud, and situations where the banks \nthemselves are complicit in committing the alleged fraud.\n  It also fails to deliver on what Mr. Stivers indicated its goal was, \nto allow legally operating businesses to access the banking system.\n  It fails to deliver on that because, while there were nine amendments \nthat were made in order, a critical amendment offered by my colleagues, \nMr. Perlmutter of Colorado and Mr. Heck of Washington State, was not \nallowed, an amendment that would have furthered the goal of this bill \nto allow legally operating businesses to access banking services.\n  It was a germane amendment. There were no points of order. In fact, a \nmajority of the Members of this body have supported this amendment, in \nfull or in part, in various floor votes in earlier times.\n  A majority of this body supports a real-world solution to a real-\nworld problem, not just one we face in Colorado, but many States face. \nThe fact that legal, legitimate marijuana-related businesses cannot \ninteract with legitimate banking institutions is an enormous problem \nfor economic growth and a security risk.\n  It is a problem for law enforcement that we hear from police and \nsheriff departments back home every day, and it is a problem for the \nsafety of our communities.\n  It is simply not acceptable to meet the standard of an open and \ntransparent process that the Speaker has promised to eliminate from \neven consideration and a vote, this very important amendment that \naddresses the accessibility of banking services to companies that are \nengaged in a legal State business. For 23 States and the District of \nColumbia, this is an enormous problem right now.\n  To be clear, what we are talking about is not just people who run \nmedical marijuana dispensaries, but also highly regulated growing \noperations. Even farmers producing industrial hemp are turned away from \nopening bank accounts, cannot accept credit cards, have to haul around \nlarge amounts of cash to pay their employees every day, placing \nthemselves and their employees at enormous risk of physical assault and \nrobbery, as well as detracting from the very law enforcement ability to \ntrace transactions that our law enforcement officials are clamoring \nfor.\n  Due to Congress' inaction, hundreds of businesses in Colorado and 22 \nother States are forced to operate on a dangerous, untrackable, cash-\nonly system that raises serious public safety concerns, increases tax \nfraud, and is an enormous burden on our economy.\n  Now, those are facts that are not in dispute. I know that there are \nmany Members on both sides of the debate about how we should treat hemp \nand marijuana, whether they should be legal or illegal. That is not the \nissue.\n  The issue is that 22 States and the District of Columbia have chosen \nto legalize it under State law. It is illegal under Federal law. We are \nnot debating that here now either. That is fine. That wouldn't be \ngermane for this bill, to say let's legalize it federally. That is not \neven what we are talking about here.\n  What we are talking about is, in the States that it is legal, it is \nabsolutely critical from even a law enforcement perspective--even if \nyou want it to continue to be illegal federally--that the interactions \nare through our normal banking system in a traceable way.\n  These are facts that are not in dispute. My good friend from Ohio \nknows these issues. In the lead-up to Ohio's possible consideration of \nlegalization, I am confident that many Ohioans had conversations with \nlaw enforcement, walking through officials on the issue of making this \na cash-based business.\n  That was a significant issue in the Ohio election and in other \nStates.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  The issues of taxation and recordkeeping are critical. But do you \nknow what, that points to the necessity of this legislation. Do you \nknow what, Mr. Perlmutter's amendment would likely have passed this \nbody with Republican and Democratic support. It would have won a \nmajority of bipartisan support this week. It is not the job of the \nRules Committee to pick\n\n[[Page H513]]\n\nwinners and losers. If it is particularly objectionable for the Rules \nCommittee to abuse its power to kill a measure that has demonstrated a \nbipartisan level of support, that is not an appropriate use of the \ndiscretion of our committee or our chair to have their personal \nopinions guide what amendments are forwarded to this body for full \nconsideration.\n  What else can Members do? We write thoughtful amendments that solve \nreal-world problems in our State. We garner support for these \namendments year by year talking to Republicans and Democrats. And then \nwhat, it just dies because we can't get it to a floor vote? How is that \nan open and transparent process? It is not.\n  Mr. Perlmutter and Mr. Heck are fighters. They will keep working on \nthis. We will win this debate eventually. This is simply a speed bump \nin making sure that we address this issue for which there are no \nlegitimate arguments on the other side regardless of where one stands \non the legal treatment or regulation of substances that are currently \nclassified.\n  We should have won this week with this debate. This type of \nbipartisan work should be rewarded in this body, and the 23 States and \nthe District of Columbia that face this issue deserve better. This \namendment had no drafting error. There was no political gimmick to it. \nIt wasn't nongermane. It didn't even rewrite in any substantial way the \nunderlying bill. It was perfectly consistent. It wasn't even \ncontroversial. I can't understand why it didn't deserve consideration \nby this body--not even a 10-minute debate, not even a 1-minute debate.\n  Will the gentleman from Ohio amend the rule to allow at least a 1-\nminute debate on this amendment? I will yield for a ``yes'' or ``no.''\n  Reclaiming my time, I think the gentleman from Ohio won't even allow \na 1-minute debate. The gentleman from Ohio said he wanted legally \noperating State businesses to have access to banking services which is \nthe very purpose of this bill. It is a great shame that we cannot fix \nthis issue now. Because you know what, otherwise I give credit to the \ngentleman from Ohio and my colleagues on the Rules Committee for \nallowing 9 of 10 amendments to be considered on the House floor under \nthese two bills.\n  This is the rule that I am coming closest to supporting of any rule \nthat we have debated thus far in the 114th Congress here on the floor, \nbut because of this one glaring deficiency which prevents, through an \nopen and transparent process, a real-world problem that Democrats and \nRepublicans agree need to be solved from being addressed in any \nappropriate bill in an appropriate way, I cannot recommend to my \ncolleagues that they support this rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like quickly to respond to what the gentleman \nreferred to, and he did change some of my words. I said that these are \nlegally operating businesses. Mr. Speaker, by the gentleman from \nColorado's own admission, these are not federally legal businesses. \nThey are illegal under Federal law. Marijuana is illegal in U.S. Code \n21, section 812. The gentleman knows that.\n  Maybe we should debate whether marijuana should be legal under \nFederal law. If he wants to debate that, that is okay. But this is a \nrecognition for banking services of businesses that are operating \nlawfully under both Federal and State law, not ambiguous businesses \nthat are legal under State law but illegal under Federal law. At the \nmost, these businesses are ambiguous, but clearly they are illegal \nunder Federal law. I didn't say businesses that are operating legally \nunder State law in my comments. I said legally operating businesses. \nThat means under Federal and State law.\n  We live in a Federal republic with a State and a Federal Government. \nIf something is illegal under Federal law, under U.S. Code 21, section \n812, then it is illegal. Those businesses are not legally operating \nbusinesses. That is the distinction. That is why the amendment from Mr. \nPerlmutter and Mr. Heck was not allowed, because these businesses--\ndrug-related businesses--are illegal under Federal code. That is the \nreason we are not debating that amendment here.\n  I would say to the gentleman's point earlier where he wanted a minute \nof debate, I think he has gotten more than a minute on both sides on \nthis. So he has done pretty well.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), a \nfellow from the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Ohio \nfor the time today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 595 \nproviding for consideration of H.R. 766, the Financial Institution \nCustomer Protection Act and H.R. 1675, the Encouraging Employee \nOwnership Act of 2015. I strongly support this rule and the underlying \nmeasures.\n  H.R. 766 is a vitally important response to the administration's \nunacceptable executive overreach through Operation Choke Point. \nOperation Choke Point is another example of the administration's \ncircumventing Congress. It is a disturbing abuse of authority to \nachieve politically motivated results, and the fine folks in northeast \nGeorgia have made it clear that they won't stand for it.\n  Under the program, the Justice Department and Federal financial \nregulators have coerced banks and other financial institutions into \ncutting off relations with legal businesses simply because the \nadministration does not like them.\n  The administration has painted a target on certain industries ranging \nfrom payment processors and short-term lenders to gun and ammunition \nstores to other small businesses. Again, it is the administration who \nhas decided under the guise of customer protection to target entire \nindustries simply because they deem them offensive.\n  This is not the way the government is supposed to operate, and it is \ntime we prevent it from happening. I have had the opportunity to meet \nwith some of the hardworking individuals in the industries affected, \nand it is clear action is needed.\n  A few weeks ago I met with several members of the electronic payments \nindustry. This is an industry that promotes innovation, is rapidly \ngrowing, and plays a large and important role in Georgia's economy. To \ngive you an idea of the enormity of this industry, the electronic \nconsumer spending is projected to exceed $7.3 trillion in 2017. Yet the \nadministration has been increasingly exerting pressure on this \nindustry. They have increasingly tried to make the payments industry \nresponsible in part for the misdeeds of bad actors in other segments of \nthe industry.\n  Possibly even more disturbing, by forcing payments processors and \nbanks to assume the role of regulators and police the industry for bad \nactors, known or unknown, the administration is promoting \ndiscrimination of legal businesses if they belong to a certain industry \nthat isn't supported by the White House's political agenda. What has \nhappened to fairness under the law? It is amazing to me. The \nadministration is choking legitimate businesses off from needed capital \nand other resources by painting them with a scarlet letter, and they \nare burdening the payments industry by trying to use it as a means to \ncarry out their own dirty work.\n\n  Another industry long targeted by Operation Choke Point is the gun \nindustry. As Americans, we have a constitutional right to bear arms \nunder the Second Amendment. Just this week I had the privilege of \nvisiting Honor Defense, a gun manufacturer located in my hometown of \nGainesville, Georgia. I talked with the owner, toured their facilities, \nand assembled actually one of their fine firearms.\n  These are hardworking American businesses operating legal businesses. \nThe administration doesn't like this industry, though, so they have \npainted a target on their back. This is not right. We should be \nencouraging businessowners to grow their businesses and celebrating \ntheir success, not trying to force them out of business.\n  Stories of industries and legitimate small businesses that have been \ntargeted are widespread. It is time for this to stop. The government \nhas a legitimate role in protecting consumers and preventing fraud. But \nthat necessary role should not be abused to achieve political goals. \nFinancial regulators should not be able to target legal businesses by \nchoking off their lines of\n\n[[Page H514]]\n\ncredit and forcing them out of business.\n  Mr. Speaker, Operation Choke Point is misguided and politically \nmotivated, and it is time we rein it in to protect small businesses and \nlegitimate enterprises of hardworking Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the \nunderlying legislation.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up a bill to help prevent mass shootings \nby promoting research into the causes of gun violence and making it \neasier to identify and treat those prone to committing violent acts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. To further discuss our proposal, I yield 4 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Honda).\n  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous question. If we \ndefeat the previous question, Mr. Polis will be able to offer an \namendment to the rule to bring my Gun Violence Research Act to the \nfloor for an immediate vote.\n  My Gun Violence Research Act would lift the over 19-year-old ban on \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with respect to \nobjectively studying the health aspects of gun violence.\n  Former Republican Congressman from Arkansas, the Honorable Jay \nDickey, who was the author of the CDC ban, has gone on record \nregretting his decision--expressing that the prohibition was rooted in \npartisan politics, not sound public policy.\n  With well over 32,000 Americans killed by gunshots per year and \nroughly 88 Americans killed every day--every day--gun violence is \nundoubtedly a public health crisis that necessitates attention.\n  I represent Silicon Valley, and I have seen firsthand the role and \nvalue objective research plays in expanded knowledge and informed \ndecisionmaking.\n  Research on gun violence should not be controversial or partisan. It \nis a commonsense tool to help us understand why tens of thousands of \nour fellow citizens are being killed every year by gunshots.\n  Without being able to adequately understand why the problem is \noccurring, we are unable to effectively tackle our Nation's gun \nviolence epidemic and protect the American people whom we represent.\n  This is why I urge my Republican colleagues to allow a vote on this \ncritical legislation and lift the ban on desperately needed gun \nviolence research. When we understand the problem, we can make informed \npublic policy decisions to keep Americans safe without eroding the \nSecond Amendment and demonizing the millions of law-abiding gun owners.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher). He is a member of the \nForeign Affairs and Science, Space, and Technology Committees.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nunderlying rule and in support of H.R. 1675, a bill that aims to lessen \nmany of the regulatory burdens that employers currently experience. Of \nparticular interest to me and of interest to working men and women \nthroughout America is title I of the bill entitled Encouraging Employee \nOwnership Act of 2015. This title would make it easier for private \nemployers to grant their employees with greater ownership stake in \ntheir own companies without having to disclose certain sensitive \ninformation.\n  The consideration of the bill is but the latest in a long history of \nactions taken by the Federal Government to promote an ownership \nsociety. President Jefferson recognized ownership of private property \nas the keystone of a free society. President Lincoln pushed for, and \nCongress delivered, the Homestead Act of 1862 which has proven to be \none of the most important manifestations of Jefferson's vision of a \nbroad-based ownership property society. More recently, President Reagan \nsupported employee stock ownership, labeled it ``the next logical step, \na path that benefits a free people.''\n  In the near future, I will reintroduce legislation that incentivizes \nemployee ownership even further than we currently have it by treating \nas tax-free any broad-based distribution of employer stock that is held \nby the employees for a certain period of time. Yes, it would be ESOPs \non steroids. We would dramatically increase the amount of employee \nownership in our country and all the benefits that go with that.\n  I would ask my colleagues to consider my bill. It will be proposed \nprobably next week. My proposal is simple and easy to understand. No \nteam of lawyers or accountants would be needed to be hired in order for \nan employer to participate in this expansion of employee ownership of \nhis or her company. As such, it has great potential to give a shot in \nthe arm to many small upstart companies that do not have significant \nsums of cash to offer employees or to attract the very people who \nactually have the skills necessary for their new company to succeed, \nbut instead have an idea that if an employee is willing to work hard \nand make a company grow, prosper, and succeed that that company's \nbenefits would be shared with the employee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to consider joining me in support \nof the working people of this country by giving them the opportunity to \nachieve the American Dream and make employees partners instead of \nadversaries to management.\n  One of the things in this bill that we are talking about today is \ntaking a step forward in employee ownership. I certainly support that. \nThe legislation I will propose takes another step.\n  I would like to congratulate my friends who have been involved with \nthis bill today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the rule and the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California. I look forward to \ndiscussing with him his bill next week and seeing whether it is \nsomething that I can support.\n  I strongly believe in encouraging employee ownership through ESOPs \noptions. This bill does part. We can do a lot more. It is a big thing \nthat we can do to address the increasing income disparities that this \ncountry has in making sure that workers can participate in capital \nformation and capital growth along with owners and executives. We look \nforward to working with the gentleman on that bill and contacting the \ngentleman as well.\n  The gentleman from Ohio said that somehow legal operating businesses \nmust have access to banking resources, the goal of this bill. He said, \noh, wait a minute, I mean Federal ones not State ones, not Federal not \nState. This is where you have a difference. Of course, you won't have \nany disagreement that there is an ambiguity here with regard to types \nof businesses that are legal at the State level and are not legal \nfederally. But this is where you will find that most Democrats believe \nvery strongly in States' rights.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Most Republicans believe here, with the exception of the other \ngentleman from California who just spoke and a number of others who \nwould allow a majority to support this bill, but apparently the \ngentleman from Ohio believes in an overarching Federal definition \ntelling States what they can and can't do indirectly through the \nbanking system, effectively constraining their ability to allow banks \nto serve businesses that might sell types of firearms that are illegal \nfederally, or types of marijuana or hemp or other products that might \nbe illegal federally. Effectively, they are arguing that the Federal \nGovernment should tell them what to do and impose a one-size-fits-all \nsolution on States that are as diverse as Texas and California and \nColorado and North Dakota.\n  I disagree with that premise, as do most of the Democrats here today. \nWe feel that while this body, of course--and I agree with the \ngentleman--\n\n[[Page H515]]\n\nshould continue with the discussion about the regulatory structure of \nlegal treatment of cannabis products federally, that should in no way, \nshape, or form stand in the way of a simple fix that says, whether you \nwant it to be legal or illegal, transactions should be traceable, safe, \nthrough the banking system for businesses that are legal at the State \nlevel.\n  Let me address H.R. 1675, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, \nalso being named the Capital Markets Improvement Act. It is a good \npiece of bipartisan legislation that I think can be made even better \nthrough the amendment process.\n  Title I of this bill, which will revise the SEC's rule 701 by raising \nand indexing for inflation the threshold under which companies can \nissue stock to employees without running into government red tape, is a \ncommonsense, good piece of legislation. I hope it is something that \nmost of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree with. I am an \nearly cosponsor of this legislation, and I think we should promote and \napplaud the structure, the indexation, and, of course, allowing \nemployees to have a stake in their companies.\n  That is not the only solution. The gentleman from California (Mr. \nRohrabacher) might have some other ideas I look forward to discussing, \nas do I. But if you want to help solve some of our Nation's issues with \nincome inequality and the wealth gap, then we should applaud and \npromote companies that incorporate employee stock or option ownership.\n  Whether you issue stock in the manner under this bill or whether you \noperate in ESOP or any of the other forms that allow workers to benefit \nfrom the growth of your company, we should find ways to work together \nto promote and encourage this style of corporate governance.\n  Title II is a safe harbor for investment research, a bill that will \nhelp improve available market information for investors and something \nthat has broad bipartisan support. I know my colleague from Delaware \n(Mr. Carney) will also be pleased to see this pass, as an original \nsponsor.\n  My colleague from Ohio, who is a co-chair with me of the \nCongressional Caucus for Middle Market Growth, spoke yesterday and \ntoday about how this overall package of legislation will help grow \ncompanies in the all-important middle market. This is Main Street \nAmerica. These are companies that might not be big enough to be \nmultinational, multibillion-dollar brand names, and they are not \nstartups or small companies, but it is the engine of our economy, the \nportion of the market that is a vital piece of our economic engine \ncreating jobs on Main Street.\n  Title III of this bill will work to reduce red tape for these very \nmiddle market companies.\n  These provisions have broad bipartisan support, and I applaud them. \nThe SEC has largely agreed with this. In fact, the only argument \nagainst it has been we already do this, and I think that is a weak \nargument because we ought to put it in statute. The SEC has agreed and \nhas taken action, but, unfortunately, some of their actions have added \nin some increased investor impediments as well.\n  I hope the administration can work with Congress to improve this bill \nif there are specific issues they have with it. But the bill is \nnecessary. It is better to fix things in statute. I think that we can \nwork together to reduce red tape to grow small- and middle-sized \ncompanies.\n  Title V of the bill is another bipartisan piece of legislation that \nis in line with the sort of regulatory review that we already ask in \nmany agencies. It is the sort of good government legislation I think \nboth sides of the aisle can find agreement on and hopefully support \nnow.\n  Title IV of H.R. 1675, unfortunately, is a bit of a step in the wrong \ndirection, and it is something we discussed extensively in the \ncommittee yesterday. Fortunately, for this provision, there was an open \nprocess. Mr. Issa and Mr. Ellison have amendments that will be \nconsidered that improve the portion of the bill or remove it entirely. \nUnfortunately, the bill, as written, is a move away from searchable \nfinancial reporting that can be done digitally. It is a step away from \nsortable and downloadable formats. It is a return to the pen and paper \nand inefficient world of the 20th century rather than a step forward to \nthe open data transparency world of the 21st century.\n  Across the board, market participants, investors, and regulators want \ninformation that is already required--we are not talking about any new \nrequirements--information that is already required, financial \ninformation, to simply be available in a digital, searchable format. \nThat is all we seek to preserve and not eliminate.\n  It is an odd and outdated use of government resources to deal with \nthis information by hand, by pen, by paper. It puts investors and \nothers at an enormous disadvantage, and it prevents and reduces the \namount of information in the marketplace. Searchable and sortable data \ncan be better used to track trends, find anomalies, find investment \nopportunities, and help regulators notice trouble spots in markets and \nhopefully catch the next Enron before it explodes.\n  Just as importantly, investors need information. So do \nentrepreneurial folks, who want to take this information and package it \nin new and interesting and exciting ways and sell it on to \ninstitutional and individual investors. We heard yesterday from \ndetractors who said investors aren't asking for this information.\n  We also heard that the committee didn't include any investors in \ntheir testimony; they only included operating companies. I am not sure \nwho they are speaking for; but in my conversations, I have never heard \nany investor say, ``I want less information,'' or, ``I want information \nto be harder to search or find.'' No investor says, ``I want to know \nless about a company's earnings. I want it to be in an archaic pen and \npaper format.'' That argument that this information isn't welcome by \ninvestors is simply incorrect, and it is counter to anything you will \never hear from anyone in the investment community.\n  Hopefully, we will fix these issues through amendment. Overall, I \nbelieve this package should merit serious consideration and support \nfrom my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  H.R. 766, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, does \naddress a very important issue, and that is the inexcusable actions of \nOperation Choke Point, which, at best, could be described as an \noverzealous use of the Department of Justice's power, or, at worst, as \na pernicious attempt to root out activities that are determined to be \npolitically unpopular.\n\n  Unfortunately, as we examine this bill, it looks like it has some \nunintended consequences which are not addressed through the amendment \nprocess. The amendment process also fails to include a simple amendment \nthat would further the goals of this bill with regard to the regulated \nmarijuana industry in 22 States.\n  I hope that we can address the Operation Choke Point issue. I hope we \ncan prevent this administration and future administrations from \nengaging, having DOJ engage in this kind of troublesome use of \nauthority to coerce closures of accounts for otherwise legitimate and \nlegal customers of local financial institutions.\n  If a bank or credit union has a legal business, it is legal in the \nState, they deem it creditworthy, they are a good customer and they \nwant to open an account with them, they should be able to serve that \ncustomer. The Federal Government should not use the bank itself as an \nintermediary in a dispute. If the DOJ has a dispute with a bank's \ncustomer, that should be resolved between the DOJ and the customer, not \nthe bank.\n  I hope that there is groundwork for bipartisan legislation in this \narea that can ensure that this President and future Presidents and the \nfuture Department of Justices do not abuse their authority in this \narea.\n  One real-life, everyday issue where this concept comes up of the \nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Government interfering with the \nbank working with its legal customer would have been addressed by the \nPerlmutter amendment that I spoke about earlier. It is not just a \nColorado issue. Frankly, if this bill addressed that issue, despite it \nbeing overarching in other areas, I would probably support it.\n  Thus is the importance of this issue from local law enforcement in \nour State. But, unfortunately, not even a\n\n[[Page H516]]\n\nminute, not even a second of debate is allowed on the issue. The \ngentleman from Ohio claimed that we were having that debate.\n  To be clear, we are not. We are debating the underlying rule. There \nis no time for the sponsors of the amendment to make their case or for \nopponents of the amendment to make their case. We are outlaying the \ntime for other amendments. Many amendments have 10 minutes; many \namendments have more. There is not even a second for the debate of that \namendment sponsored by Mr. Perlmutter. That is why I cannot support \nthis rule.\n  213 million Americans live in a State or jurisdiction where the \nvoters have allowed for some legal marijuana use. Colorado tried to \nsolve the problem locally, but we were rejected by Federal banking \nregulators in courts, so Congress needs to be the one to make this \nchange. Only Congress can address this issue.\n  While there remains a need to align Federal and State laws, while the \nDOJ and Treasury have issued some guidance, some institutions are \nproviding banking services to the DOJ and Treasury guidance issues, the \nguidance does not solve the problem, which is why we need to change the \nlaw and provide certainty, which this very simple amendment that has \nbipartisan support and likely would have passed on the floor would have \ndone. But it is completely shut down under this rule even though it \nfurthers the actual goal of the legislation, is germane to the \nlegislation, is consistent with the legislation, and yet it is \ncompletely shut down in a closed process that runs contrary to the \nSpeaker's stated goal of allowing Members on both sides of the aisle to \ncontribute to making things better.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to address two quick points made by the gentleman.\n  With regard to H.R. 1675 and exportable data, the gentleman tries to \nclaim that this data will not be available. It will be available in \nscanned-in information, so you can still look at it and see it. It is \nnot pen and paper data the way he alleges. It is still very accessible \non the electronic systems. It is just not exportable data.\n  The question is: Is that exportable data worth the $50,000 cost for \nthese small companies? It is only a few small companies that will \nbenefit from being relieved from this burden because the cost is more \nthan the benefit.\n  Secondly, the gentleman continues to ignore the fact that marijuana \nbusinesses are not legal under Federal law. If he wants to have the \ndebate about whether they should be legal under Federal law, we should \nhave that debate. That is not germane in this bill.\n  What we are talking about are legal businesses that are legal under \nFederal and State law, not ambiguous businesses that are only legal one \nplace or the other. In our Federal system, there is both a Federal and \na State component. If he wants to debate making marijuana legal at the \nFederal level, that is legitimate; it is just not germane in this bill. \nThis is for businesses that are legal at the State and Federal level.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is \na distinguished member of the Committee on Oversight and Government \nReform that had a lot of hearings on Operation Choke Point.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio \nfor yielding and for his leadership on this important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 766, the Financial \nInstitution Customer Protection Act of 2015.\n  Over the past several years, the Obama administration's Department of \nJustice has strong-armed the financial industry in an attempt to cut \noff payment processors, short-term lenders, gun and ammunition stores, \nand other companies from banking services simply because they do not \nlike their line of business.\n  Operation Choke Point is just another example of this administration \ntrying to advance its radical leftist agenda through executive power \noverreach with a disregard for Americans' due process rights. In \neffect, these businesses are being treated as if they are guilty until \nproven innocent.\n  The bill before us today prevents Federal bureaucrats from abusing \ntheir executive power to prevent legitimate businesses from using \ndepository banks. It also requires written justification of any request \nto terminate or restrict a business' account, unless the business poses \na legitimate threat to national security.\n  In the First Congressional District of Georgia that I represent, we \nhave a large, multi-State licensed consumer finance company that \nservices more than 1,000 new customers every day. This is just another \nexample of this administration working to limit economic growth and \nAmericans' free will.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can put an end to \nthis administration's unconstitutional actions and restore the rule of \nlaw.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, I appreciate the committee of jurisdiction's work and the \nRules Committee's work to make 9 out of 10 amendments submitted in \norder today--that is 9 out of 10. But I have to reiterate again that \nthe one that is most important to not only my home State, but the \njurisdictions in which 213 million Americans live--22 States plus the \nDistrict of Columbia--is omitted from consideration in its appropriate, \ngermane bill.\n  I strongly object to the unnecessary gatekeeping of the Rules \nCommittee and what they have engaged in and the way that they have \ntreated this excellent idea and real-world solution from Mr. Perlmutter \nand Mr. Heck.\n  Access to banking services is an issue of fundamental importance for \nall businesses, as the proponents of this bill have argued. Do you know \nwhat? That includes State legal marijuana businesses. Just because some \nMembers of Congress--and they are in the minority, by the way, and they \nare decreasing every day--object to the very existence of these \nbusinesses does not mean that they should obstruct the entire \nlegislative process and shut down our ability to make it possible for \nthese businesses to exist, grow, and succeed.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  The Perlmutter-Heck amendment is a germane, thoughtful solution to a \nreal-world problem, and I hope this House will atone for its error \ntoday by swiftly taking up legislation--and there is a stand-alone \nbill--to solve this banking issue once and for all.\n  This was a discussion that we had in our committee yesterday, but, \nunfortunately, it is a discussion that we are not allowed to have on \nthe people's floor of the House of Representatives. There is not an \namendment that would have somehow legalized or have made any judgment \nabout the legality or the morality of marijuana. It simply would have \naddressed a banking issue that both proponents and opponents of \nmarijuana law reform agree needs to be addressed. Now, I am happy to \nhave that conversation about how we should treat marijuana federally at \na separate point. That is fine. I have legislation to regulate \nmarijuana like alcohol, and others have other ideas.\n  Those who are following at home need to know that the Perlmutter-Heck \namendment is not that discussion. It was germane to the bill we were \ndiscussing, and it, frankly, gets at the issue of why our banks are \nbeing used as a chokepoint for doing business with otherwise legal and \nlegitimate customers as determined by the States.\n  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, while I support one of the two \nunderlying bills--and I would like to be here to support the other if \nit would simply deal with the urgent issue of 213 million Americans who \nlive in jurisdictions that face it--I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' \nand defeat the previous question and to vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado's points.\n  These two bills are great bills. The first bill helps to preserve and \nto incentivize employee stock ownership. It decreases burdensome \nregulations so as to allow these middle market companies, which I \ntalked about earlier, to have access to capital and to continue to \ngrow, and it ensures that entrepreneurs can have access to the capital \nmarkets in an affordable and efficient way.\n  H.R. 766 addresses legal businesses. Again, I want to stress \n``legal'' businesses. The gentleman from Colorado,\n\n[[Page H517]]\n\nMr. Speaker, I think, would welcome the day of the Articles of \nConfederation. He wants to ignore that we have the State and the \nFederal governments. He wants the States to just make decisions and not \nallow the Federal Government to do anything. If marijuana is illegal at \nthe Federal level, that is a fact. If he wants to have the debate about \nmaking marijuana legal at the Federal level, we should do that. That is \nnot germane to this bill.\n  These businesses are, at best, ambiguously legal, and they are \nclearly illegal at the Federal level. So let's clear up the ambiguity. \nThen they can have the same access that other legal businesses have, \nlike gun dealers and automotive dealers and short-term lenders, which \nare already legal at both the State and Federal levels. They need \naccess to banking services. H.R. 766 makes sure they will continue to \nhave access to banking services.\n  There are some amendments that I will be supporting and that others \nwill be supporting. Make one's mind up on the amendments, but I think \nboth of these bills are important. I urge my colleagues to support the \nrule and the underlying bills.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n            An Amendment to H. Res. 595 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3926) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \n     better understanding of the epidemic of gun violence, and for \n     other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the \n     bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute \n     rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3926.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania). The question \nis on ordering the previous question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of adoption, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 240, \nnoes 176, not voting 17, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 55]\n\n                               AYES--240\n\n     Abraham\n     Aderholt\n     Allen\n

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 1675, to \ndirect the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise its rules so as \nto increase the threshold amount for requiring issuers to provide \ncertain disclosures relating to compensatory benefit plans.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 595 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1675.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1402\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 1675) to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise \nits rules so as to increase the threshold amount for requiring issuers \nto provide certain disclosures relating to compensatory benefit plans, \nwith Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1675, the Encouraging \nEmployee Ownership Act.\n  I do this because, as you know, Mr. Chairman, regrettably, we saw \nthat in the last quarter this economy grew at a paltry seven-tenths of \n1 percent. On an annualized basis, this economy is limping along at \nroughly half the normal growth rate.\n  That means that this economy is not working for working families, who \nunder 8 years of Obamanomics have found themselves with smaller \npaychecks and smaller bank accounts and greater anxiety about how are \nthey going to make their mortgage payments, how are they going to make \ntheir car payments, are they going to be able to save enough to send \nsomebody to college.\n  This economy is still underperforming for American families. So it is \ncritical that we help our small businesses, which are truly the job \nengine in our economy, Mr. Chairman, as you well know.\n  I want to commend the sponsors of the five bills that make up H.R. \n1675, Representatives Hultgren, Hill, Huizenga, and Hurt. Their work \nhas resulted in a bipartisan bill that we think will help create a \nhealthier economy.\n  Again, we know that 60 percent of the Nation's new jobs over the past \ncouple decades have come from our small businesses. If we are going to \nhave a healthier economy that offers more opportunity, we have to offer \nmore opportunities for small business growth and small business \nstartups. We have to ensure that they have capital and the credit they \nneed to grow. You can't have capitalism without capital, Mr. Chairman.\n  Yet, we have heard from countless witnesses in our committee--from \ncommunity banks to credit unions, the primary source of small business \nloans--that they are drowning, drowning in a sea of complex, \ncomplicated, expensive regulations, many of them emanating from the \nDodd-Frank Act, which is causing a huge burden on the economy and \nworking families.\n  The same is true of many of our burdensome security regulations as \nwell. Many of them are well intentioned, but, Mr. Chairman, they were \nwritten with our largest public companies in mind, but they end up \nhurting our smaller companies. It is time that we help level that \nplaying field for small businesses with smarter regulations that will \nstill maintain our fair and efficient markets, protect investors, but \nallow small competitors the chance to succeed. We make some progress \ntoday on this bipartisan bill, H.R. 1675.\n  Now, it is a modest bill, Mr. Chairman. It is only 20 pages long--\nanybody can read it--but it provides many overdue improvements that \nwill help spur capital formation, and the legislation gives companies \noptions and choices on how to best attract investment and capital. In a \nfree society, isn't that where we should be?\n  It updates rules to allow small businesses to better compensate their \nemployees with ownership in the business. Let them have a piece of the \nAmerican Dream. In so doing, it strengthens provisions enacted into law \nin the bipartisan JOBS Act and the FAST Act to give employees a greater \nopportunity to share in the success of their employer.\n  It codifies no action relief issued by the SEC to remove regulatory \nburdens for individuals who assist with the transfer of ownership of \nsmall- and mid-sized privately held companies.\n  It will provide investors with more research on exchange-traded \nfunds, or ETFs, by extending a liability safe harbor consistent with \nother securities offerings.\n  It provides a voluntary, Mr. Chairman--I repeat voluntary--exemption \nfrom reporting in XBRL data format for emerging growth companies and \nsmaller public companies, the cost and use of which have continually \nbeen questioned in our committee.\n  The committee received testimony from a biotechnology executive who \nsaid that outreach to his analyst investors yielded a consensus \nresponse that they weren't even aware of XBRL, but the witness went on \nto say that his company is having to spend $50,000 annually in \ncompliance costs that obviously could have been better spent in \nproductivity and job creation.\n  Finally, it requires the SEC to conduct a retrospective review every \n10 years to update or eliminate outdated, unnecessary, and duplicative \nregulations. This is also known, Mr. Chairman, as common sense. The \nadministration claims that this provision is duplicative because the \nSEC is already encouraged to review their regulations. Well, \nencouragement doesn't quite get the job done. We need to ensure that \nthese regulations are looked at and at least looked at on an every-\ndecade basis.\n  You will hear some say that, well, the SEC's resources are stretched \ntoo thin. I am happy to go back and amend Dodd-Frank so that they have \nmore resources to devote to capital formation. By the way, they just \ngot a big, fat raise in the latest omnibus. Mr. Chairman, I don't think \nthat argument holds much water.\n  By enacting H.R. 1675, we are going to ease the burdens on small \nbusinesses and job creators. Isn't that what we ought to be about? We \nwill help foster capital formation so that Americans can go back to \nwork, have better careers, pay their mortgages, pay their healthcare \npremiums, and ultimately give their families a better life.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1675.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1675. It is \nreally a package of five bills which will harm investors and, \nperversely, the very small businesses Republicans say they want to \nhelp. It does so by ignoring and supplanting the good judgment of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, which has already sought to provide \nsmall businesses with regulatory relief in these same areas while also \nensuring that investors in those businesses have the protections they \ndeserve.\n  The SEC's balanced approach makes sense as investors who are not \nconfident in the integrity of our markets\n\n[[Page H520]]\n\nwill simply not invest, which means that job-creating companies will \nnot have the capital they need to grow. In particular, this bill would \nreduce corporate transparency for employee stockholders by allowing \nprivate companies to compensate their employees with up to $10 million \nin stock every year without having to provide them with relatively \nsimple disclosures about the financials of the company or the risk \nassociated with these securities.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, I am not going to attempt to hide the facts \nof this bill with a lot of rhetoric. The fact of the matter is, if \nemployees are being given stock up to $10 million that they don't know \nthe value of, and the companies don't have to disclose anything about \nthe stock, they could end up with worthless stock, not worth anything, \nwhere they had great expectations that somehow in lieu of raises and \nmore money that they probably deserve, they are being given rotten \nstock.\n  This provision would double the current disclosure threshold, \nallowing larger companies with at least $34 million in total assets to \nencourage overinvestment by employees in a company that they cannot \nvalue and that may never permit them to sell except back to the company \nat a price set by the company. That is another aspect of this.\n  This type of deregulation invites more Enron-type fraud into the \nmarket. Remember Enron? I hope we have not forgotten it already and \nwhat happened to those employees. Sometimes you had two members of the \nfamily, the husband and the wife, who both had this bad stock that they \ncouldn't sell back, they couldn't do anything with, where employees \nhave to trust the accounting of their companies but instead are left \nwith valueless stock.\n  Similarly, this bill would exempt over 60 percent of public companies \nfrom using a computer-readable format known as XBRL in their SEC \nfilings. Exempting such a large number of filers would prevent these \ncompanies from being easily compared to other companies that use XBRL, \nto the disadvantage of analysts, researchers and the SEC, investors, \nand even the companies themselves.\n  Basically, what you are doing is saying, we are going to have a bill \nhere that would prevent the kind of information that analysts and \nresearchers, the SEC and investors should have, comparing them with \nother companies because somehow we want to protect those who don't want \npeople to really know what their worth is.\n  This is very serious stuff. According to the SEC's Investor Advocate, \nthis exemption seriously impedes the ability of the SEC to bring \ndisclosure into the 21st century. That is their quote.\n  Title III of the bill further supplants the SEC's good judgment by \nsignificantly expanding the Commission's recently provided relief for \ncertain mergers and acquisition brokers without imposing eight \nimportant investor protections granted by the SEC. As a result, bad \nactors who may have committed fraud and shell companies could use this \nrelief and brokers wouldn't have to make basic disclosures about their \nconflict of interest.\n  In committee markup, Democrats attempted to close these loopholes, \nbut our efforts were rejected in a party-line vote.\n  Can you imagine that the SEC has taken a big step, and they have \nlistened to concerns, they have listened to complaints, and they have \ngone overboard to make sure that they were providing relief for certain \nkinds of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  What this bill would do is take away the ability of the SEC to have \ninvestor protections that they have already been granted.\n  So again, this bill, which includes five bills all designed, \nbasically, to disregard the investors, disregard the small-business \npeople, disregard the average American citizen, is a bill that would \nsimply go in the wrong direction, helping the corporations who would \nsimply not want to disclose and not want to be seen for what they are.\n  Title II also fails to sufficiently protect investors, as it \neliminates offering liability for brokers who, under the guise of \nproviding exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, could selectively use data to \npromote and sell highly risky, complex, and little-known ETFs to \nunsuspecting investors.\n  Finally, the bill seeks to impose additional regulatory burdens on \nthe SEC by requiring it to conduct a duplicative and more onerous \nretrospective review of its rules.\n  Specifically, title V would require the SEC to, within 5 years of \nenactment, review and revise all of its rules, which I should mention \ndate back to 1934. It would also allow the SEC to override \ncongressional mandates, including those in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nreform bill.\n  Republicans on the Financial Services Committee are always claiming \nthat the SEC is unresponsive to Congress, yet this provision in the \nbill would allow the Commission to unilaterally repeal the will of \nCongress at their whim. Indeed, this title is a thinly veiled \nRepublican attempt to impose cost-benefit type analyses on our \nregulators as a means of eliminating rules designed to benefit the \npublic and protect investors.\n  H.R. 1675 is an anti-investor bill that will reduce transparency, \nestablish additional administrative burdens on the SEC, and create \neasily exploited loopholes for bad actors.\n  It is well known that Members on the opposite side of the aisle do \nnot like our ``cop on the block,'' which is the SEC. While they talk \nabout what the SEC will, can, or will not do, they simply try and \nstrangle it by being opposed to them having the adequate funding that \nthey need in order to do their job.\n  So, when we hear today, for example, as the chairman said, that he \nwould be willing to support some funding for the SEC, it is very \nimportant that they put their money where their mouths are and make \nsure that the SEC has the money to do its job.\n  In conclusion, this bill goes in the wrong direction. It is \nunfortunate that, at a time when we have gone through a recession based \non 2008 and the unwillingness or the inability for our regulatory \nagencies to watch over our investors and to watch over our average \nsmall-business people and homeowners, et cetera, and while we are \ntrying desperately to clean up this mess with Dodd-Frank reforms, we \nwould come in here at this time, having experienced all of this, with a \nbill like this that would try and protect the worst actors in the \nfinancial services industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 1675.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Hultgren), a workhorse on our committee and the chief \nsponsor of H.R. 1675, to bring more jobs to the American people.\n  Mr. HULTGREN. I thank Chairman Hensarling for his great work on the \nFinancial Services Committee, and I specifically want to thank him for \nhis help on this bill coming to the floor today.\n  Mr. Chair, today I am very proud to speak in support of the Capital \nMarkets Improvement Act. The bill includes a number of important titles \nthat my colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee, \nRepublicans and Democrats, are confident will improve our capital \nmarkets, whether it is reducing regulatory requirements for emerging \ngrowth companies subject to redundant reporting requirements to the SEC \nor making it easier for investors to have access to investment reports \non exchange-traded funds.\n  This bill also includes a title I worked on diligently with Mr. \nDelaney to make it easier for companies in Illinois and nationwide to \nlet hardworking employees own a stake in the business they are part of.\n  The Illinois Biotechnology Industry Organization, which represents \ncompanies that employ thousands of residents in my district and \nthroughout Illinois, believes that making it easier for companies to \noffer employee ownership helps Illinois businesses expand and hire more \nworkers.\n  Warren Ribley, the president and CEO of iBIO, has stated:\n\n       As someone who has worked in economic development for most \n     of my career, I know that offering an ownership stake to \n     employees is a critical tool in recruiting top talent to job-\n     generating companies. And there is no doubt that an equity \n     stake encourages employees to drive hard for success of the \n     enterprise.\n\n[[Page H521]]\n\n       EEOA promises to aid in job creation in Illinois' growing \n     technology sector, especially for the many early-stage \n     companies with whom we assist along their commercialization \n     path.\n\n  Unfortunately, some companies are shying away from offering employee \nownership because of regulations that limit how much ownership they can \nsafely offer.\n  SEC rule 701 mandates various disclosures for privately held \ncompanies that sell more than $5 million worth of securities for \nemployee compensation over a 12-month period. In 1999, the SEC \narbitrarily set this threshold at $5 million without a concrete \nexplanation for why investors would face difficulties with sales above \nthis number.\n  For businesses who want to offer more stock to more employees, this \nrule forces those businesses to make confidential disclosures that \ncould greatly damage future innovations if they fell into the wrong \nhands. This required information includes business-sensitive \ninformation, including the financials and corresponding materials like \nfuture plans and capital expenditures.\n  The SEC originally acknowledged this, and some voiced their concern \nthat a disgruntled employee could use this confidential information to \nharm their former employer. Leaving aside the risk involved in \ndisclosing this confidential information, it is costly to prepare these \ndisclosures just so a business can offer the benefits of ownership to \ntheir employees.\n  My bill is simple. It is a simple, bipartisan fix that changes that. \nEEOA amends SEC rule 701 to raise the disclosure threshold from $5 \nmillion to $10 million and adjust the threshold for inflation every 5 \nyears.\n  To be clear, issuers that are exempt from disclosure would still have \nto comply with all pertinent antifraud and civil liability \nrequirements. The employees purchasing these securities go to their \nbusiness every day and already have a good sense of how their company \nis operating.\n  Support for this effort to improve the utility of rule 701 can \nactually be found in the SEC's own Government-Business Forum on Small \nBusiness Capital Formation Final Reports for 2001, 2004-2005, and 2013.\n  As the Chamber of Commerce has explained, this legislation would \n``help give employees of American businesses a greater chance to \nparticipate in the success of their company.'' Increasing this \nthreshold, they explain, would ``ensure that rule 701 remains a viable \nprovision for businesses to use in the future'' and ``decrease the \nlikelihood of unnecessary regulatory requirements.''\n  There is no evidence to suggest that rule 701 is not working for \ncompanies and their employees, and we have every reason to make this \noption available to more Americans with the desire to build their \nwealth through their company's success.\n  Finally, I want to underscore how important it is that the Capital \nMarkets Improvement Act pass with a strong bipartisan vote, just like \neach title passed in the Financial Services Committee under Chairman \nHensarling's leadership.\n  My bill, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, had a bipartisan \nvote of 45-15 in committee. Mr. Hill's bill, making investment reports \non ETFs more accessible, had a vote of 48-9. Mr. Huizenga's bill, \ncreating a simplified SEC registration system for M brokers, had a \nvote of 36-24. Mr. Hurt's bill, allowing an optional exemption for \nemerging growth companies for SEC reporting requirement, had a vote of \n44-11. Also, Mr. Hurt's bill, requiring the SEC to retroactively review \nregulations, had a 46-16 vote.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote in support of the Capital Markets \nImprovement Act of 2016.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Ohio, (Mrs. Beatty), a member of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Chairman, I think it is simple today. We have heard \nCongresswoman Maxine Waters outline our position for this.\n  Let me just say that this bill is flawed, overly broad, avoids \nappropriate oversight, duplicative of existing administrative \nauthorities, and could be wasteful and costly. I join Ms. Maxine Waters \nof California today in opposition to H.R. 1675, a package of capital \nmarket deregulatory bills that undermine the Security and Exchange \nCommission's effective oversight of capital markets and places the GOP \nspecial interests ahead of those hardworking Americans whom we are here \nto serve.\n  Secondly, the package also excludes exemptions from certain investor \ndisclosures and SEC filing requirements and a safe harbor from certain \nbroker-dealer liabilities, all without commensurate investor \nprotections.\n  A key component of this package is title V, H.R. 2354, which is an \nunnecessary, burdensome, and unfunded mandate requiring a full-scale \nreview designed to hamstring the SEC's ability to perform basic \noversight of the financial markets.\n  Title III of the package exempts small business merger and \nacquisition brokers from registering as a broker-dealer with the SEC.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me sum it up by saying that the bad outweighs the \ngood in this bill. I stand in opposition to it.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce), a valued member of the Financial Services \nCommittee and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, the reason this legislation is on the floor, \nfrankly, is because of the anemic economic growth that the United \nStates is facing. We have got less than 2 percent economic growth. If \nwe are going to figure out a way to get the economic engine running \nagain, we have got to do something to remove the barriers to access to \ncapital. That is what the Capital Markets Improvement Act attempts to \ndo here. H.R. 2354, the Streamlining Excessive and Costly Regulations \nReview Act, does just that.\n  Let's face it, regulators aren't perfect. They are like lawmakers in \nthat sense. Regulators have a certain obligation to examine their \nrecord to determine failures and to rectify missteps as needed.\n  The Streamlining Excessive and Costly Regulations Review Act will \ngive the Securities and Exchange Commission the opportunity to do so. \nIt would set that up on an ongoing basis. It requires a retrospective \nCommission review of rules and regulations that have an annual economic \nimpact or cost of $100 million or more, result in a major increase of \ncosts or prices for consumers, or harm the ability of U.S. enterprises \nto compete against foreign competitors.\n  Commissioners will be able to reverse ineffective, insufficient, or \nexcessively burdensome regulations with the guidance of public notice \nand comment, and it ensures that the SEC isn't simply rolling out the \nred tape in a vacuum, oblivious to the negative economic impact that \ntheir actions have on consumers, investors, or businesses.\n  The success of a regulation or rulemaking shouldn't be measured in \nquantity. Instead, we need smart guidelines to protect our economy and \npreserve the world's strongest capital markets here in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank the author of this bill, Mr. Hurt of Virginia, \nfor his leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), the ranking member of the \nTask Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing on the Financial Services \nCommittee.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  It is very rare that I get to speak in opposition to such bad \nlegislation, but not only do we have a single bill that is bad \nlegislation, my friends across the aisle have packaged five bad bills \nand put them all together. My only regret is that I only have 3 minutes \nto speak about these bills.\n  Let me single one out, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of \n2015. Currently, employee benefit plans must disclose information to \nemployees who invest in those plans if the plan's assets are above $5 \nmillion.\n  H.R. 1675, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2015, now 2016, \nmodifies SEC rule 701 by allowing private companies to compensate their \nemployees up to $10 million, indexed for inflation.\n  So they can pay their employees in stock, basically. But the key here \nis\n\n[[Page H522]]\n\nthat they don't have to provide the same information that they would to \noutside investors in that same stock. Therein lies the danger here.\n  This means that employees in smaller companies, start-ups, \nespecially--small drug companies, small software companies--those \nemployees with smaller plans, oftentimes those companies are more \nsubject to, more vulnerable to, the ups and downs of the economy. These \nare the most vulnerable.\n  So the employees in those small plans that are paid with company \nstock would be less protected as to how their stocks are performing.\n  Last Congress I voted against a similar bill, H.R. 4571, when it was \nmarked up in our committee. I also spoke in opposition to this bill \nwhen it was included as title XI of H.R. 37.\n  This bill uses the veneer of job creation to provide special \ntreatment for well-connected corporations, mergers and acquisition \nadvisers, and financial institutions, while doing very little for and \nprobably doing much damage to employees and working families.\n  I strongly support employees receiving equity. I think that is a good \ndeal. If employees can receive stock options and, importantly, if they \ncan know about the value of those stocks and know about the condition \nof these companies, that can be a huge advantage.\n  Employees will buy into the company, but they have to have the \ninformation about what the stock is worth. This bill allows them to be \ndenied that information. They are buying a pig in a poke. They don't \nknow what the stocks are worth. So it puts them at a tremendous \ndisadvantage.\n  And, again, these companies are the ones that are most vulnerable to \nups and downs in the economy going forward.\n  I agree the remarks of Professor Theresa Gabaldon from George \nWashington University during our April 29 Capital Markets and \nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee hearing. During her \ntestimony, the professor expressed opposition to this bill for the very \nreasons I have stated.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield another 30 seconds to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. LYNCH. She opposed this bill because employees deserve the same \nprotections, she said, as investors.\n  This makes sense. This is easy. We should be able to do what we want \nto do here and stimulate the economy, yet, at the same time, allow \nthese employees to have the information that they need to know what the \nvalue of the stocks they are being paid with are worth. It is as simple \nas that.\n  I thank the ranking member for her indulgence.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 10 seconds to remind my \nfriends who have spoken that title I of this bill passed 45-15, with \nDemocratic support; title II, 48-9, with Democratic support; title III, \nin the last Congress, passed the floor 420-0; title IV, 44-11, with \nDemocratic support; title V, 41-16, with Democratic support. So perhaps \nthey should discuss these attacks amongst themselves first.\n  I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Hurt), one of \nthe prime sponsors and author of title IV and title V.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the \nFinancial Services Committee for his leadership in moving this \nlegislation to the floor.\n  I rise today in support of this bill, the Capital Markets Improvement \nAct.\n  As I travel across Virginia's Fifth District, the number one issue \nfacing the families I represent is the desperate need for job creation.\n  Making sure that hardworking Virginians and Americans have adequate \naccess to capital markets is imperative to job creation and to \nsustained economic growth for our great Nation.\n  This is why it is so important that the Financial Services Committee \nand the House of Representatives continue to push legislation that will \nmake it easier for our businesses, for our farmers, and for families to \nbe successful.\n  Indeed, every provision within this bill today we are considering has \nreceived bipartisan support, and each title of this bill is critical to \nenhancing access to capital and ensuring that the U.S. capital markets \nremain the most vibrant in the world.\n  Within this Capital Markets Improvement Act, I am pleased that two \nprovisions that I have sponsored have been included, the Small Company \nDisclosure Simplification Act and the Streamlining Excessive and Costly \nRegulations Review Act.\n  The first provision is contained in title IV. The Small Company \nDisclosure Simplification Act addresses a 2009 mandate from the SEC \nwhich required the use of eXtensible Business Reporting Language, or \nXBRL, for public companies.\n  While the SEC's rule is well-intended, this requirement has become \nanother example of a regulation where the costs often outweigh the \npotential benefits.\n  These companies spend thousands of dollars and more complying with \nthe regulation, yet there is little evidence that investors actually \nuse XBRL, leading one to question its real-world benefits.\n\n  The provision before us today is a measured step that would offer \nsmall companies relief from the burdens of XBRL. Title IV provides a \nvoluntary--let me say that again--a voluntary exemption for emerging \ngrowth companies and smaller public companies from the SEC's \nrequirements to file their financial statements via XBRL in addition to \ntheir regular filings with the SEC.\n  It is important to note that nothing in this bill precludes companies \nfrom utilizing XBRL for their filings with the SEC. The exemption is \ncompletely optional and allows smaller companies to assess whether the \ncosts incurred for compliance are outweighed by any benefits using this \ntechnology.\n  During our committee's hearing on this issue, one company reported \nthat it spent $50,000 on complying with XBRL. That is a real cost to a \nsmall company, especially when that cost does not yield a significant \nbenefit.\n  I am not suggesting that every firm pays this much, but certainly we \ncan agree that, when filing fees are this high, we should ensure that \nthe requirements result in a benefit to investors and to those public \ncompanies being regulated.\n  It is also very important to note that, with this legislation, all \npublic companies will continue to file quarterly and annual statements \nwith the SEC.\n  Furthermore, this bill will not kill the implementation of XBRL or \nstructured data at the SEC. It is merely providing a temporary and \nvoluntarily exemption for smaller companies so that they may better \nutilize their capital.\n  It is about choice and ensuring that these companies can use their \ncapital to create jobs instead of using it to comply with unnecessary \nred tape.\n  This bill has previously received strong bipartisan support in the \nFinancial Services Committee and on the floor of this House when this \nmeasure was part of the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small \nBusiness Burdens Act.\n  Similarly, during the last Congress, this measure was also approved \nwith a strong bipartisan vote in the House. I ask that my colleagues \nonce again support this commonsense legislation today.\n  In addition to the disclosure simplification issues, we have also \nsponsored title V of this Capital Markets Improvement Act. This is a \nbipartisan bill that I crafted with my colleague, Ms. Kyrsten Sinema of \nArizona.\n  The Streamlining Excessive and Costly Regulations Review Act is about \naccountable and representative government and making sure that the SEC \nis taking an ongoing retrospective look at its regulation.\n  This legislation would simply require the SEC to review its major \nrules and regulations on a regular basis to determine whether they are \nstill effective or outdated or whether they need to be changed in some \nregard. In fact, other prudential regulators, such as the FDIC, the \nOCC, and the Federal Reserve, are already doing this.\n  During the mid-1990s, the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork \nReduction Act, or EGRPRA, required these entities to conduct a \nretrospective review of all of their regulations to determine if they \nwere still effective and, subsequently, report their findings to \nCongress.\n  Because the House Banking Committee at the time did not have \njurisdiction over the SEC, the SEC was left out of this process.\n\n[[Page H523]]\n\n  Title V would simply require the SEC to retrospectively review its \nregulations with the goal of ensuring that they are effective and up to \ndate. It would enable the SEC to operate in the most effective manner \npossible. It would afford the SEC the autonomy and flexibility to make \nthis mandate effective.\n  President Obama himself endorsed this idea in multiple 2011 executive \norders, and the other prudential regulators are already operating under \na similar review process. This legislation simply puts the SEC on the \nsame playing field as the other regulators.\n  Moreover, this bill provides Congress with the insight it needs to \nhold the Commission accountable, and the legislation adheres to the \nrequirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  All said, the structure and the process of title V will provide \nindustry, the SEC, and Congress, with the structure and time necessary \nto ensure that this retrospective review process is effective.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this title so that we \ncan continue to improve the SEC's regulatory regime.\n  In closing, let me again thank the committee chairman, Chairman \nHensarling, and Chairman Garrett, who is our Capital Markets and \nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee chair, for making these \ntwo provisions a part of this act. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' \non this good bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored \nEnterprises of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the \nranking member for yielding and for her leadership on this committee \nand on this legislation.\n  I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1675. It would curtail the \nexisting regulatory structure protecting investors.\n  While this package includes bills that I have supported, including \nthe ETF research bill, which simply allows more research on a fast-\ngrowing market, ultimately, I have to oppose this package because it \nwould roll back the progress that we have made in many areas, including \non XBRL.\n  I rise in opposition to the prior speaker from the great State of \nVirginia, really, one of my favorite Republicans to work with on the \ncommittee, but I oppose very much his bill that would roll back XBRL \nand would allow roughly 60 percent of all public companies to opt out \nof the requirement to use XBRL.\n  I believe that this would hurt the overall economy, the liquidity of \nthe markets, and the information that investors are able to gain and \ngather.\n  I am a big supporter of XBRL, which allows companies to file their \nfinancial statements in a computer-readable format. XBRL makes it \npossible for investors and analysts to quickly download standardized \nfinancial statements for an entire industry directly to a spreadsheet \nand immediately start making cross-company comparisons in order to \nidentify the best performers.\n  I would argue that this would increase the amount of investment in \nstart-ups and small businesses. This would enable investors to more \neasily identify the companies that are diamonds in the rough, so to \nspeak; and very often, these are small companies that have innovative \nbusiness models but have trouble attracting the attention of analysts \nand institutional investors.\n  One reason is it is simply too time-consuming for analysts and \ninvestors to pick through every small company's 100-page financial \nfilings.\n  A small company's filings may tell an incredible story about why that \ncompany is poised to be the next Apple or Google. But if the so-called \nsearch costs are high enough that analysts and investors never see \nthem, then that company will never get the capital infusion it needs to \ngrow and our economy will never realize the benefits that the company \nhas to offer.\n  This is where XBRL comes in. It dramatically reduces the search costs \nby making it fast and cheap for investors to gather standardized \nfinancial statements for entire industries, including the small \nbusinesses that the investors wouldn't have bothered with before.\n  So if you want to improve small companies' access to capital, rolling \nback XBRL is the last thing you would want to do. I believe that we \nshould be moving forward, not backward, on XBRL.\n  We are already far behind the rest of the developed world in using \nstructured data. I rise in opposition to this bill.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield the gentlewoman an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I think we should think very \nhard about an issue before we take away a tool that literally benefits \nboth investors and small companies.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Unfortunately, that is what this bill would do. Instead of moving \nforward on XBRL and making it even more useful for analysts and \ninvestors, the bill would allow roughly 60 percent of all public \ncompanies to opt out of their requirements to use XBRL. This would \neffectively take our capital markets back to the 20th century.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill which doesn't \nbenefit investors and I would say the overall economy.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote from my colleagues.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade \nSubcommittee of the Financial Services Committee and the author of \ntitle III of this act.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to alert the \nAmerican people: we have a red herring alert. This is a legislative \nequivalent to an Amber Alert because we have folks who talk a good game \nbehind closed doors, who come out here, though, in the light of day and \ndo something very different, and they are missing. They are missing in \naction from solving the problem. This red herring alert is very \ndisturbing. We instead are seeing today trumped-up attacks on \ncommonsense reforms that need to happen that many people will behind \nclosed doors agree need to happen.\n  In my particular case with section 3, we have a ``no-action'' letter \nput out by the SEC that those on the other side of the aisle say, ``We \ndon't need to do anything. The SEC is taking care of it.'' The problem \nis that it took years for the SEC to even address the issue. Apparently \nwhat is good enough for a ``no-action'' letter should be good enough \nfor the law. So they know full well that many of the things that we are \ntrying to address in H.R. 1675 are coming from unintended consequences.\n  This important piece of legislation is a package of bipartisan ideas \ndesigned to help Main Street businesses promote job creation and \neconomic growth. The Second District of Michigan, west Michigan, is \nfull of these types of family-owned companies.\n  Mr. Chairman, small businesses, private companies, and entrepreneurs \nneed access to capital, but burdensome, needless regulations out of \nWashington and the SEC have created barriers to that investment \ncapital.\n  Main Street small businesses are the heart and soul of our Nation. In \nfact, they have created the majority of the Nation's new jobs over the \nlast couple of decades. So what does that mean? It is not the big, \nmajor companies that are creating those job opportunities. It is our \nsmall, innovative companies that are. For these small businesses to \nsurvive and thrive in a healthy, growing economy, we must reduce \nbarriers to capital and encourage small business growth and the small \nbusiness entrepreneur without putting the taxpayer or the economy at \nrisk.\n  H.R. 1675 does exactly that. This compilation of bipartisan \nregulatory relief provisions will ensure that Main Street businesses \ncontinue to have access to the capital that they need to grow the \neconomy and create new jobs.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 1675. You need to ignore \nthe red herrings that are getting thrown out there. The capital markets \nneed to have these reforms. I look forward to working with my Senate \ncolleagues to see H.R. 1675 make its way to President Obama's desk for \nhis signature.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe\n\n[[Page H524]]\n\ngentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a true progressive \nchampion.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1675, the \nEncouraging Employee Ownership Act.\n  As a young housewife in suburban Chicago, I joined a handful of women \nin a successful campaign to get freshness dates on grocery products. At \nthe time, expiration dates were coded. The stores knew, but consumers \nwere in the dark about whether the milk they were buying had been on \nthe shelf too long.\n  Getting that information was really important. It gave us the facts \nand the power to make the right food choices for our families. Getting \ninformation about our stocks--whether those stocks are in the form of \ncompensation or investments--is equally important. Again, information \nis power--the key to being able to protect the financial well-being of \nour families.\n  Simply, workers deserve to know the value of the stocks they are \nreceiving instead of wages. We are living in a time of serious wage \nstagnation. According to the National Employment Law Project, real \nhourly wages were 4 percent lower on average in 2014 than in 2009. So \nit is important for workers who are offered stock compensation to have \naccurate data about the value of those stocks.\n  Similarly, we are experiencing a real retirement security crisis. \nMedian savings for all working households is $2,500 for retirement. For \nthose near retirement, it is $14,500--not a heck of a lot of money \nsaved for retirement. So we need to encourage investments. But if we \nwant Americans to invest, we need to give them information. They need \nto be able to judge the risks and make wise decisions.\n  Yet, instead of giving American workers or investors more \ninformation, H.R. 1675 would give them less. This bill would double the \nthreshold that triggers disclosure of information to workers. It would \nreduce the requirements for broker-dealers to be accountable for \ncertain information that they provide. It would make it harder to find \ninformation on SEC filings, and it would give the SEC unilateral power \nto overturn congressionally enacted laws to protect investors.\n  Those are all really bad ideas, and I think we should vote ``no'' on \nH.R. 1675.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is \nremaining on both sides?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 9 minutes remaining. The \ngentlewoman from California has 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill). He is the author of title II of the act.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 1675 and \nparticularly want to speak about title II, which is called the Fair \nAccess to Investment Research Act, which I sponsored along with my \nfriend and colleague, Mr. Carney from Delaware.\n  Since starting my most recent investment firm that I had back in the \n1990s before I came to Congress a year ago, I have seen the investment \ncategory exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, grow from about 100 funds with \n$100 billion in assets to over 1,400 funds with almost $2 trillion in \nassets--a significant increase over that time.\n  Despite their growing popularity and use by retail investors and \nsmall institutional investors, most broker-dealers in this country do \nnot publish research on ETFs. Primarily, the lack of that publication \nis due to anomalies in the securities laws and regulations, and that is \nat the heart of what we are talking about here. It is an important \ninvestment category. It deserves research, and it deserves more \ninformation, not less.\n  Title II's mission is simple. It directs the SEC to provide a safe \nharbor for research reports that cover ETFs so that those reports are \nnot considered offers under section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. \nTherefore, ETF research is just treated like all other stock corporate \nresearch.\n\n  This is a commonsense proposal, and it mirrors other research safe \nharbors implemented by the SEC which clarify the law and allow broker-\ndealers to publish ETF research allowing investors more information \nabout this rapidly growing and important market.\n  Further, this bill holds the SEC accountable--a large challenge \nbefore the Congress--to follow our direction. This bill requires the \nSEC to finalize the rules within 120 days, and if the deadline is not \nmet, an interim safe harbor will take effect until the SEC's rules are \nfinalized.\n  I might add to my friends at the Commission, this is not a topic \nunfamiliar to you as it has been raised at the Commission many times, \nincluding by the Commission staff over the past 17 years--and yet no \naction has happened. So we are no longer out ahead of the curve on this \ntopic, we are behind it, as there are some 6 million U.S. households \ncurrently using ETFs in their investment portfolios, and they need \naccess to this research.\n  Having worked in the banking and investment industry for three \ndecades, I appreciate Chairman Hensarling and Congress' efforts to \npromote capital formation, reduce unnecessary barriers, provide \nsunshine, provide information to our investors, and, by definition, \ngrow jobs and our economy.\n  I want to finally thank Mr. Carney of Delaware for working with me on \nthis project and for being so patient along its way in the last weeks.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, when my colleague from Massachusetts came \nto the floor and started to talk about this bill, he said this is a bad \nbill, and included in this bill a total of five bad bills.\n  As we go through each of these bills, we cannot help but wonder why \nany public policymaker would want to endanger small businesses and \ninvestors in the way that this bill does. One must ask one's self why, \nwhy would any elected official want to eliminate financial disclosures \nfor employees regarding their stock compensation? Why would you want to \ndo that? Why don't you want employees to know what they are being \ngiven? Why don't you want employees to understand that this stock that \nthey are being given may or may not be worth the paper that it is \nwritten on? Why would we want to keep this information away from them?\n  As it was stated by the gentlewoman from Illinois, she said basically \nthat many of these companies are not increasing wages. As a matter of \nfact, we have stagnation in wages in this country and in all of the \nmajor companies, for example. So what is happening is these employees \nbelieve that when they are being given stock instead of a raise, then \nmaybe they have something valuable.\n  They need to know what they are getting. They need to know exactly \nwhat their company is holding out to them is valuable. So I raise the \nquestion, why would any public policymaker want to keep this \ninformation from employees?\n  Further, the opposite side of the aisle always talks about they are \nfor dealing with crime, that they are about criminal justice. But here \nthey are allowing bad actors to engage in small business mergers and \nacquisitions. I am talking about people who have been convicted. I am \ntalking about people whom you have administrative orders against. I am \ntalking about swindlers. I am talking about bad people that will be \nallowed, by this bill, to engage in small business mergers and \nacquisitions. I don't understand it, and I don't know why.\n  Increasingly, the people of this country are looking at the Members \nof Congress, and they are saying that they are not with us, they are \nagainst us, and that we don't have anybody that is really protecting \nour interests. More and more, it is being discussed. They are finally \ngetting on to it that somehow too many of the Members of Congress are \nsiding with the big guys, siding with the large corporations, and with \nthe big banks, and not looking out for the interests of the people. \nThey want to know why.\n  Again, title III of this bill would significantly expand an exemption \nfor registration granted by the SEC to certain mergers and acquisition \nbrokers who deal with small businesses without providing significant \nprotections for those businesses or investors.\n  Last Congress when we considered this exemption, it was meant to \nprompt action by the SEC to finalize its no-action letter to exempt \nthese merger and acquisition brokers from registration. Two weeks after \nthat bill passed the House floor, the SEC granted relief. Yet you \nwouldn't know it if\n\n[[Page H525]]\n\nyou read this bill. This bill ignores that relief, and, worse, it \ninexplicably omits eight--omits eight--of the important investment \nprotections that it includes.\n  As a result, it would allow, again, these bad actors, these cheaters, \nthese people who commit fraud, and these scammers to use this exemption \nproviding them with an opportunity just to swindle our small \nbusinesses. Yet they claim they support small business.\n  It is fashionable to say, ``I am for small business.'' Everybody is \nfor small business. But when you take a look at what we do, you can \ndetermine who is for the small business and who really are for the big \nbusinesses, for the swindlers, and for the cheaters who rob small \nbusinesses of the opportunity to be successful.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  It would also allow M brokers to merge public shell companies that \nhave no assets of their own.\n  Even some of my Republican colleagues who will be offering an \namendment to add in these two protections are unable to justify the \nomission, but my friends on the opposite side of the aisle completely \nignore the other six investor protections in the SEC's no action \nrelief.\n  I am not going to go any further with that. That is quite obvious.\n  But let me say this. Not only do we have these bad bills with bad \npublic policy, we have a trick in the bill and the bill attempts to tie \nthe hands of the SEC by saying they need to go back--oh, back to 1934 \nand review everything that they have done, all of these regulations.\n  Do you know why they are doing that? It is the same reason that they \nwon't support them getting additional funding to do their job. They \njust want to tie their hands so that they won't be able to do the job \nthat they are supposed to do.\n  When we call these bills bad, we are simply not sharing with you some \nrhetoric about some meaningless harm that may come because of these \nbills. We are telling you these are harmful bills, these are truly bad \nbills.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), the chairman of the Capital Markets and \nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman.\n  I want to commend Mr. Hultgren, Mr. Hill, and all of the sponsors who \nhave worked so hard on the underlying legislation and for the \ndedication to doing what? Improving the capital markets and creating \njobs in this country.\n  Mr. Chairman, the last decade has really not been kind to middle \nclass Americans and to lower income Americans as well, where people are \nstruggling to make it to the 15th of the month or the end of the month.\n  We have not experienced in this country a 3 percent GDP since, I \nthink, back in 2005. Middle class income wages are basically \nstagnating, and the number of people in poverty in this country during \nthis administration has reached an astonishing 50 million people.\n  Did you hear that? Fifty million people during the Obama \nadministration find themselves still in poverty right now.\n  Yet, the Obama administration continues--if you listen to him and our \ncommittee meetings from the other side of the aisle, they tout the \nsupposed strength of the recovery, despite the fact that, under \nPresident Obama, only the rich in this country have gotten richer while \nthe poor and the middle class continue to struggle.\n  Today our committee brings to the floor a package of bills that will \ndo what, they will help small businesses. They will help people get new \njobs. They will help the creation of new hiring. They will help those \nhardworking Americans who want to get a better job and improve \nthemselves to create wealth in this country and not just rely, as in \nthe past, on taxpayer economic sugar highs provided by the Federal \nReserve or wasteful stimulus programs.\n  What do we have right now? We have five bills. We have Mr. Hultgren's \nlegislation that will help hardworking Americans by giving Americans \nmore chance to do what? Invest their money so they can work.\n  We have Mr. Hurt's legislation initiatives to hold the SEC \naccountable, yes, hold American bureaucrats accountable and reduce \nWashington's unnecessary burdens on small public companies.\n  We have Mr. Huizenga's bill to make it easier for small businesses to \nsimply receive advice from professionals.\n  Finally, we have Mr. Hill's bill over here that will allow investors \ngreater access to research on investment funds before they invest their \nmoney.\n  Mr. Chairman, what we have here is that not a single one of these \nprovisions will grow the bureaucracy, not a single one of these \nprovisions will throw more taxpayer dollars at the situation in the \nhopes that it will solve some perceived problem out there, and not a \nsingle one of these provisions include any new Federal mandates on the \njob creators of this country: small businesses.\n  Each and every one of these is a positive solution to our economic \nproblems. As an added bonus, they all have the benefit of being \nbipartisan.\n  Again, I thank you and all the sponsors for their support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1675.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on each \nside?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne). The gentleman from Texas has 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema), one of the Democratic cosponsors \nand cosponsor of title V of the bill.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Hensarling for including \nlegislation to review outdated and unnecessary regulation in this \nimportant bill.\n  And thank you to Congressman Hurt for working across the aisle with \nme to advance this commonsense measure.\n  Business owners in Arizona regularly tell me that our inefficient and \noften confusing regulatory environment hurts their ability to grow and \nhire. This commonsense legislation requires the SEC to improve and \nrepeal outdated regulations, holding them accountable, and providing \ncertainty for businesses and consumers in Arizona.\n  This bill requires the SEC to within 5 years of enactment and then \nonce every 10 years thereafter review all significant SEC rules and \ndetermine by Commission vote whether they are outmoded, ineffective, \ninsufficient, excessively burdensome or are no longer in the public \ninterest or consistent with the SEC's mission to protect investors, \nfacilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient \nmarkets.\n  The Commission would then be required to provide notice and solicit \npublic comment on whether such rules should be amended or repealed and \nthen amend or repeal any such rule by vote in accordance with the \nAdministrative Procedures Act.\n  Finally, the Commission would report to Congress within 45 days after \nany final vote, including any suggestions for legislative changes.\n  The bill would require the SEC to only review major or significant \nrules. It would not allow mandatory rulemakings to be repealed \nunilaterally by the SEC.\n  Should the SEC determine that legislation is necessary to amend or \nrepeal a regulation, the bill requires the Commission to include in \ntheir report to Congress recommendations for such legislation.\n  Finally, the bill would prevent additional litigation by clarifying \nthat the initial SEC vote would not be subject to judicial review.\n  I believe that reviewing significant rules at the SEC, as directed by \nthe administration's executive order, is a worthwhile use of SEC \nresources.\n  I hope Members join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation.\n\n  Thank you, Chairman Hensarling and Congressman Hurt, for advancing \nthis important legislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman and Members, I yield \nmyself such time as I may consume.\n  Since the gentleman from New Jersey talked about the President and\n\n[[Page H526]]\n\nblamed him for everything he could think of, the administration is \nsending you a message. The administration strongly opposes H.R. 1675.\n  ``Among other flaws, this bill includes several provisions that pose \nrisks to investors, are overly broad, allow financial institutions to \navoid appropriate oversight, and are duplicative of existing \nadministrative authorities.''\n  Thank you from President Obama.\n  H.R. 1675 is yet another Republican attempt to deregulate Wall Street \nduring the 114th Congress. We have seen time and time again that \nRepublicans will stop at nothing to launch attacks at the expense of \nAmerican consumers and taxpayers in order to help the largest Wall \nStreet banks. This bill is another example of these tactics.\n  So far during this Congress, Republicans on the Financial Services \nCommittee have taken a number of measures to undermine consumers, \nundermine investors, and undermine financial stability. Some of the \nworst examples of this include:\n  Change in the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \nLadies and gentlemen, the Republicans hate the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, and they have tried to bog the agency down in \npartisan gridlock and disfunction. Republicans never wanted to create \nthe CFPB. Now that it is there and it is successful, they want to \nundercut it.\n  Deregulating large banks by removing the enhanced prudential \nstandards established by the Dodd-Frank Act. This would allow large \nregional megabanks to escape basic rules related to capital, liquidity, \nand leverage established after the crisis.\n  Allowing discriminatory markups on automobile loans for racial and \nethnic minority borrowers. Republicans want auto finance companies to \nbe able to gouge minority consumers with interest rate markups even \nwhen those consumers are equally creditworthy compared to their White \ncounterparts.\n  Removing consumer protections on mortgages for the largest banks. The \nRepublicans would remove vital consumer protections from the riskiest \nmortgage products sold by the largest banks in this country.\n  The bill also would allow mortgage brokers to get hefty bonuses for \nsteering borrowers into expensive and complex mortgage products.\n  Eliminating Dodd-Frank protections related to manufactured housing \nloans, thereby allowing consumers to be charged sky-high interest rates \nwithout providing them guaranteed housing counseling or legal recourse.\n  Undermining the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Our \nconsolidated regulator in charge of monitoring systemic risk among the \nfinancial system by doubling the time it would take for them to \ndesignate risky nonbank companies for extra supervision.\n  We should not be surprised about this bill today. It is consistent \nwith everything that they have been doing in order to protect Wall \nStreet, the biggest banks that are too big to fail. This again is \nconsistent with everything they have been doing.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am very proud of the fact, as the chairman of the \nFinancial Services Committee, that we move a lot of bipartisan \nlegislation. I take great pride in that. It is just so rare that the \nDemocratic ranking member chooses to be a part of any of it.\n  Here we have major titles of this bill. Title I supported 45-15 with \nDemocratic support; title II passed 48-9 with Democratic support; title \nIII, 36-24; title IV, 44-11; title V, 41-16, yet another bipartisan \nexercise where men and women of goodwill come together to try to work \non behalf of the working families of America. Yet again, the ranking \nmember and those who are close to her choose not to be a part of this.\n  I guess I would ask, Mr. Chairman, how many more people have to \nsuffer in this economy? Working families are struggling. Their \npaychecks are less since the President came to office, since we have \nhad 8 years of Obamanomics. They have 10 to 15 percent less in their \nbank accounts. We have tried it their way, Mr. Chairman, and it has \nfailed.\n  Why does the ranking member and other Democrats continue this war on \nsmall business? We are losing our small businesses. Entrepreneurship in \nAmerica is at a generational low.\n  We are trying to give them a little bit of a bipartisan lifeline to \nbreath a little life into these small businesses to allow them to \ncreate more jobs and better career paths so that so many people don't \nstruggle to pay their mortgages and to pay their healthcare premiums.\n  These are modest changes. I am glad that a number of Democrats have \ndecided to cross the ranking member and want to do something that is \ncommonsense that will help small businesses and help the struggling \nworking people in America.\n  I urge all to vote for the act. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \nof amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-43.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 2, after line 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 102. STUDY AND REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall \n     complete a study and submit to Congress a report on the \n     prevalence of employee ownership plans within companies that \n     have a flexible or social benefit component in the articles \n     of incorporation or similar governing documents of such \n     companies, as permitted under applicable State law.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 595, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. DeSaulnier) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, this is a straightforward study \namendment that intends to build on the potential links between \nemployee-owned corporations and social benefit corporations. This \namendment requires the SEC to study overlaps between employee-owned \ncorporations and alternative corporate forms authorized under various \nState laws.\n  Alternative corporate forms allow corporations, with the consent of \ntheir shareholders, to pursue social and environmental goals as a for-\nprofit business enterprise. With legal protections that allow companies \nto consider the interests of all stakeholders, benefit corporations can \nhelp solve social and environmental challenges through their \nbusinesses. Benefit corporation status and other corporate forms allow \ncompanies to differentiate themselves and appeal to all consumers.\n  Alternative corporate forms provide legal protections that benefit \ninnovators, entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers. These legal \nprotections have helped create opportunities for innovation in States \nlike California, which currently attracts almost half of all venture \ncapital investment in the United States.\n  Some of these alternative corporate forms include flexible purpose \ncorporations, benefit corporations, and low-profit limited liability \ncompanies. Benefit corporations, the most common type of alternative \ncorporate form, are authorized in 30 States, including in the District \nof Columbia, and are currently being considered in five more States. \nL3Cs are authorized in eight States.\n  My amendment simply seeks to improve the availability of data so \nCongress can explore connections between employee-owned corporations \nand these increasingly popular alternative corporate forms.\n  Specifically again, this amendment requires the SEC to study and \nreport to Congress the prevalence of employee-owned ownership plans \nwithin corporations that also include a flexible or a social benefit \ncomponent in their articles of incorporation as allowed under relevant \nState laws.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \namendment to improve our understanding of employee-owned corporations.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H529]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's amendment, \nbut I find it somewhat ironic when I continue to hear pleas from the \nother side of the aisle on how terribly burdened the SEC is and what \ngreat need they have that they can't make due with the resources that \nthey have, and then here is a study which would be yet another burden \non the SEC. First, Mr. Chairman, I find that somewhat ironic.\n  I don't find that the gentleman's amendment really has anything to do \nwith encouraging employee ownership at privately held companies. I \nguess what really disturbs me, Mr. Chairman, is that this goal or this \nagenda of many is to take disclosure from those items that will enhance \nshareholder value and to, instead, take this into a debate about social \nvalues.\n  We are a very diverse country, and this is a good thing. There may be \nsome investors who are interested in companies that support a pro-life \nposition, and there may be others who are interested in a company that \nsupports a pro-abortion position; but that has very little to do with \nthe investment return, which, for most American families, is what they \ncare about when they wonder if they are going to be able to pay for \ntheir home mortgages, to pay their utility bills, or to send their kids \nto college.\n  There are some people in America who support the Second Amendment, \nand there are some people who don't. Again, there is a wide diversity \nof social issues, and for those who wish to invest along those lines, \nin a relatively free society, they ought to be able to do that. If they \ncan't get the information they need from a corporation, they have a \nmultitude of investment opportunities. If they don't feel they are \ngetting the type of social value information they need, they have a \nvariety of opportunities.\n  I feel that the gentleman from California's amendment leads us down a \nroad that, I think, ultimately, is harmful to working Americans who are \ntrying to invest their meager savings in order to make ends meet. I \nurge that we reject the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, while I respect the gentleman's \nunderstanding and his years of work in this field, I think my \nexperience as a new Member who is coming from a State legislature that \ninvolved the business community in the development of some of these \nalternative forms, it is merely providing more information for \nshareholders and investors. That is why, when we did it in California, \nwe had bipartisan support, including having the support from the \nbusiness community.\n  That is the spirit, at least, in which I am offering the amendment. I \ndon't think it would be, from a cost-benefit standard, very hard for \nthe SEC to provide this information to Congress so that, as these forms \ncontinue to move throughout the States, we have a better understanding. \nThat is the purpose and the spirit of the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING.

Pursuant to House Resolution 595, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, it has been estimated that \napproximately $10 trillion--with a T, 12 zeros--worth of small, \nprivately owned, and family-operated businesses will be sold or closed \nin the coming years as baby boomers retire. Mergers and acquisitions \nbrokers, or M brokers as they are often called, will play a critical \nrole in facilitating the transfer of ownership of these small, \nprivately held companies.\n  If you were here earlier today, you would have heard me issue a red \nherring alert. This is exhibit A, what we are dealing with right now, \nas to what that red herring alert is and as you are hearing from my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. This is exhibit A, what I \nused to use as an example of Washington working.\n  Last Congress, I had this exact bill, and it passed this body \nunanimously. Let me repeat that--unanimously. There were zero votes \nagainst it. It went on as a suspension bill. It went on suspension \nbecause it was noncontroversial. It was agreed that this was the right \ndirection to go. Unfortunately, I now have to use this bill and my \nportion--this amendment that we are dealing with--as an example of how \nD.C. is broken, and we wonder why the American people are cynical. \nLet's get to the heart of the matter.\n  Why do we need to do this? Why do we need to address this particular \nissue regarding these M brokers?\n  Today, Federal securities regulations require an M broker to be \nregistered and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and \nFINRA, just like Wall Street investment bankers who buy and sell \npublicly traded companies. So let's just get this point clear. These \nare not folks on Wall Street. These are folks in Holland, Michigan, in \nGrand Rapids, Michigan, in California, in Texas, in Florida, and \nanywhere else that one is selling a small, family-owned business. That \nis right. Anyone who is dealing with a sale or who is brokering the \nsale of a business anywhere in America is forced to register with the \nFederal Government and be regulated as a securities broker-dealer \nregardless of the size of the business or the sale transaction. This \nred tape is, of course, in addition to the State laws that already \nregulate those transfers.\n  How did we get here?\n  This bill corrects an unintended consequence of a 1985 Supreme Court \nruling that overturned a lower court that\n\n[[Page H530]]\n\ncreated the sale of business doctrine. Prior to that decision, private \ncompany sales were exempted from Federal regulation. Since 1985, the \nSEC has issued many nonaction--or no action--letters that, under \nvarious but differing factual circumstances, have granted relief for \nM brokers. However, the other side is not willing to actually put it \ninto law.\n  Let's be clear. Title III of H.R. 1675 does not do away and does not \nchange in any way, affect, or limit the SEC's jurisdiction or powers to \ninvestigate and enforce Federal securities laws. Rather, it simply \nexempts M brokers from SEC registration as broker-dealers, which \nmakes the transfer of these small, family-owned businesses affordable. \nIn fact, what do you do when you own a small family business? I own \none. If I am able to save money on one side, I am able to invest it \ninto my employees, and I am able to invest it into the equipment that \nis in my business.\n  Federal securities regulation is primarily designed to protect \npassive investors in public security markets. Passive investors are \npeople like you and me who might just buy a share in a company \nsomewhere. Privately negotiated M transactions are vastly different \nand benefit little from SEC and FINRA registration and regulation but \nare burdened by the same regulatory requirements, obligations, and \nassociated costs. M brokers, themselves, are small businesses.\n  Title III of H.R. 1675 includes my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 686, \nthe Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage \nSimplification Act, which would create a simplified system for brokers \nfacilitating the transfer of ownership of small, privately held \ncompanies. Yes, it was a bipartisan bill that passed our committee.\n  My amendment would further clarify two things:\n  First, any broker or associated person who is subject to suspension \nor revocation of registration is disqualified from the exemption. In \nother words, if you are a bad actor, you are exempted. You are not \nallowed to take part in this;\n  Second is the inapplicability of the exemption to any M transaction \nwhere one party or more is a shell company. We heard that being brought \nup as a reason we shouldn't be doing this. Again, we offer an \nexemption. If there is a shell company, that is not allowed to be used.\n  By including these additional investor protections--let me repeat, \n``additional''--this amendment strikes an appropriate balance between \nthe legitimate interests of all stakeholders and maintains strong \nprotections for investors and small businesses.\n  Today, Mr. Chairman, I just hope that we will see some common sense, \nthat we will not chase after the red herrings that are being thrown out \nthere, and that we will support H.R. 1675.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition \nto the amendment even though I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from California \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank \nMr. Huizenga for addressing one of the many glaring problems with this \nbill.\n  Title III of this bill significantly expands an exemption granted by \nthe SEC to certain brokers but without providing the significant \nprotections the SEC deemed important for small businesses or investors.\n  This amendment would prevent people who have committed fraud and \nsecurities violations--individuals who couldn't sell used stock but who \ncould sell your small business in the underlying bill--from claiming \nthis exemption.\n  However, why does the amendment limit the bad actor provision to just \nthis title? Why not make it explicit that persons and companies that \nhave committed fraud are not eligible to take advantage of any of the \nexemptions provided in this act?\n  I also appreciate that the amendment prevents public shell companies \nfrom taking advantage of this title, which would otherwise allow \nprivate companies to circumvent important public company disclosure \nrequirements.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to know why the author completely ignores \nthe other six investor protections in the SEC's no action relief. I am \nnot aware of any witness before our committee who explained how these \nother investor protections were burdensome. Indeed, they seemed like \ncommonsense protections.\n  For example, the SEC required merger and acquisition brokers who \nrepresent both parties of the transaction to obtain the consent of both \nparties to that conflict of interest. Similarly, the SEC prohibited M \nbrokers from engaging in private placements and arranging buyer \nfinancing because the narrow exemption from registration is intended \nfor persons who fairly facilitate the merger of small businesses, not \nfor the promoters who are compensated for their ability to hype up the \nvalue of the companies and attract new investment.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  If Republicans truly wanted to codify the SEC's administrative action \nto provide legal certainty for these brokers, then they should have \naccepted the Democratic amendment adding back in these protections. But \nthat isn't the point of this bill, and this amendment is just a sleight \nof hand that all is well.\n  Let me just mention here that registered broker-dealers are subject \nto a variety of regulatory requirements that nonbroker-dealer M \nadvisers are not, including, without limitation, regarding antimoney \nlaundering, privacy of customer information, supervisory reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements, inspections by the SEC and SRO, such as \nFINRA, supervision and regulation of employees' trading and outside \nbusiness activities, insider trading, and regulations governing \ninteractions between a broker-dealer's investment banking and research \ndepartments.\n  H.R. 686 risks promoting lower standards and less rigor and \nregulatory oversight in the providing of this important advice.\n  It is worthy to add that SIFMA is opposed to the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Sherman\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-414.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I offer my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 9, after line 16, insert the following:\n       ``(C) Disqualification for certain conduct.--An M broker \n     may not make use of the exemption under this paragraph if the \n     broker--\n       ``(i) has been barred from association with a broker or \n     dealer by the Commission, any State, or any self-regulatory \n     organization; or\n       ``(ii) is suspended from association with a broker or \n     dealer.\n       ``(D) Transactions involving shell companies prohibited.--\n       ``(i) In general.--An M broker making use of the \n     exemption under this paragraph may not engage in a \n     transaction involving a shell company, other than a business \n     combination related shell company.\n       ``(ii) Shell company defined.--In this subparagraph, the \n     term `shell company' means a company that--\n\n       ``(I) has no or nominal operations; and\n       ``(II) has--\n\n       ``(aa) no or nominal assets;\n       ``(bb) assets consisting solely of cash and cash \n     equivalents; or\n       ``(cc) assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash \n     equivalents and nominal other assets.\n       ``(iii) Business combination related shell company \n     defined.--In this subparagraph, the term `business \n     combination related shell company' means a shell company that \n     is formed by an entity that is not a shell company solely for \n     the purpose of--\n\n       ``(I) changing the corporate domicile of such entity solely \n     within the United States; or\n       ``(II) completing a business combination transaction (as \n     defined in section 230.165(f) of title 17, Code of Federal \n     Regulations) among one or more entities other than the shell \n     company, none of which is a shell company.\n\n       ``(E) Financing by m brokers prohibited.--An M broker \n     may not provide financing, either directly or indirectly, \n     related to the transfer of ownership of an eligible privately \n     held company.\n       ``(F) Disclosure and consent.--To the extent an M broker \n     represents both buyers and sellers of an eligible privately \n     held company, the broker shall provide clear written\n\n[[Page H531]]\n\n     disclosure as to the parties the broker represents and obtain \n     written consent from all parties to the joint representation.\n       ``(G) Passive buyers prohibited.--An M broker may not \n     engage in a transaction involving the transfer of ownership \n     of an eligible privately held company to a passive buyer or \n     group of passive buyers.\n       ``(H) No authority to bind party to transfer.--The M \n     broker may not bind a party to a transfer of ownership of an \n     eligible privately held company.\n       ``(I) Restricted securities.--Any securities purchased or \n     received by the buyer or M broker in connection with the \n     transfer of ownership of an eligible privately held company \n     are restricted securities (as defined in section \n     230.144(a)(3) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations).\n       Page 10, line 8, insert ``, and'' after ``officer''.\n       Page 10, beginning on line 11, strike ``20 percent'' and \n     insert ``25 percent''.\n       Page 10, line 14, strike ``20 percent'' and insert ``25 \n     percent''.\n       Page 10, line 19, strike ``20 percent'' and insert ``25 \n     percent''.\n       Page 12, beginning on line 19, strike ``will be active in \n     the management of'' and insert ``will actively operate''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 595, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Sherman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman, there may be some acrimony on the floor \nfrom time to time, but I think we are mostly in agreement.\n  The SEC, under some tutelage from the committee, in January of 2014 \nissued its no-action letter providing that, in certain circumstances, a \nsmall business merger or acquisitions broker would not have to \nregister. They issued this in January of 2014.\n  The gentleman from Michigan brought forward a good bill designed to \ncodify that decision by the SEC, but he did not in his codification \ninclude six of the limitations that the SEC had in its no-action \nletter.\n  Now he has brought forward and I think we just adopted an amendment \nto add to his bill the two most important limitations that the SEC had \nin its no-action letter.\n  It excludes from the exemption those who have been bad actors in the \npast and barred from association with broker-dealers, and it excludes \nshell companies.\n  As far as it goes, I think that is a good amendment. I am glad we \nadopted it.\n  But if we are going to deal with this area with statute, we should \ntake a look at the other exclusions from the exemption that the SEC \nincluded in its no-action letter.\n  The amendment that is before us today is the same amendment I offered \nin committee. It does everything that the gentleman from Michigan's \namendment does and takes the additional exclusions that the SEC had in \nits no-action letter.\n  The most important of these is to require that, to be eligible, a \nbroker would have to disclose to both parties and get consent from both \nparties if they are getting paid by both parties.\n  So if you are getting a seller's commission and a buyer's commission, \nyou would tell the buyer and the seller that that is the case. This \namendment would add that as a requirement for the exemption.\n  We would also have, as the SEC had in its no-action letter, an \nexclusion where there are passive buyers. So this is the amendment I \noffered in committee. It includes the amendment that we just adopted. \nIt includes the other exclusions from the exemption that the SEC \nadopted.\n  None of the SEC's exclusions from its exemption have been \ncontroversial. So I would like to go beyond the gentleman from \nMichigan's amendment and include all of those exclusions from the \nexemption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate the gentleman from \nCalifornia's amendment. I think there are a lot of well-thought ideas \nhere. I appreciate the sentiment by which he approached the amendment.\n  I do believe, though, that, in this particular case, this amendment \ngoes a little bit too far in the wrong direction and ultimately can \nprove to hurt a number of small businesses and economic growth.\n  Number one, a lot of what the gentleman is trying to achieve I think \nhas already been achieved in the amendment by the gentleman from \nMichigan that we just approved on voice vote here on the floor.\n  I would also add that, with the amendment from the gentleman from \nMichigan, who has the underlying title of this bill, the language now \nis identical to the bipartisan Senate language.\n  We know how difficult it is to get laws passed. I think it is \nimportant, where we can, to align the language with the other side of \nthe Capitol. I think this could ease passage of a bill which is \nbipartisan, again, on both ends of the Capitol.\n  Again, I appreciate what the gentleman from California is trying to \ndo, but I think that the gentleman from Michigan strikes the \nappropriate balance.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chair, there might be some advantage to having \nlanguage identical to the Senate, if the bill was identical to a Senate \nbill.\n  In this case, this title is being added to five other titles. In the \ncommittee, we dealt with it as six separate bills. Here on the floor, \nit is one bill. So there is no particular advantage to conforming to \nthe Senate.\n  If the Senate language does not exclude from the exemption those \nbrokers that fail to disclose that they are representing both sides, \nthen that proves the additional wisdom----\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time. I appreciate the \ngentleman's pushback, but I am still not going to quite see things his \nway.\n  I believe that the gentleman from Michigan strikes the proper balance \nhere, particularly at a time when, again, our working families are \nstruggling and this economy is limping along. We had a fourth-quarter \nGDP report where this economy was barely on life support systems.\n  We have to jump-start our small businesses. We have to jump-start \ncapital formation. The gentleman from Michigan has the right balance.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman, we have tough economic conditions out in \nour country. We need more jobs. We need business to operate smoothly.\n  How many jobs do we create by telling merger and acquisition brokers \nthat they can get fees from the seller and get fees from the buyer and \nnot tell either party that they are getting paid by both parties?\n  That is not an essential element. That failure to disclose is not an \nessential element of rejuvenating the American economy.\n  This bill is not identical to the Senate bill because this bill has \nsix titles. The Senate bill has one title.\n  Here is a chance for the House to show its superior wisdom to include \nlanguage that neither the author of the bill nor the chairman of the \ncommittee argues against in substance to add language that says that, \nif you want to enjoy this exemption, you have to tell both parties that \nyou are being paid by both parties if, indeed, you are being paid by \nboth parties.\n  So this additional disclosure requirement is good on the merits. It \ndoes nothing to delay the adoption of the additional legislation. I am \nconfident that a rejuvenation of our economy does not require that we \nconceal from those who are buying and selling businesses the fact that \ntheir broker is getting paid by both sides. Let's provide for full \ndisclosure. Let's revitalize the economy.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the efforts of \nmy colleague from California. We have worked well on a number of these \nissues.\n  I would point out, though, that maybe not you, but some others are \ntrying to act like this is the monumental thing whereas mergers and \nacquisitions are going to fail or flounder whether your amendment is \npassed.\n\n[[Page H532]]\n\n  While it may be of some interest and I think it has some things that \nare either benign or not terribly objectionable, we do know--and I \nthink we probably would both jointly agree--that oftentimes our problem \nisn't between us. It is between trying to get this body and the Senate \nto agree. If we can have one less thing to have a disagreement with \nthem on as we are advancing this, I am all for it.\n  I will specifically say subsection (C) on page 1, as you are talking \nabout, my amendment adds what you have in there and more bad actor \ndisqualifications. Actually, your amendment would roll that back. I \ndon't think that was your intention, but that is what it would do.\n  In subsection (D), our amendment adds the same disqualification, but \nis shorter and simpler to understand, which is also important as we are \ndealing with the Senate.\n  In subsection (E), there is no apparent reason to prevent private \nbusiness sellers and buyers from getting a transaction fee from a bank \nthat is affiliated with an M broker. There shouldn't be some sort of \nexclusion on that.\n  In subsection (F), it is highly, highly unusual that an M broker \nwould work for both the seller and the buyer in the same transaction. \nSo I think this is maybe a section in search of a problem.\n  Subsection (G), adding this prohibition is frankly redundant, in our \nview, and could cause some more confusion.\n  In subsection (H), the reasonable belief element sort of does the \nsame thing. I am not sure what we are trying to get at other than maybe \ncausing some more confusion. It is not, again, an intention of that but \nis what it would do.\n  Subsection (I) is simply restating the existing law.\n  So I think, as we are going through this, we are not wildly out of \ndisagreement. I just believe that the amendment that was offered and \npassed earlier, which puts us in line, again, with the efforts of the \nSenate, is a better way to go.\n  Again, to my friend from California, this is not you that I will \ndirect this at, but others on your side of the aisle who are pointing \nto the no-action letter as the reason why we don't have to do this \nlegislation.\n  Yet, now we are saying we have to pass your amendment because it is \nonly a no-action letter and we need this into the law. So we can't have \nit both ways.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-414.\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 16, after line 9, insert the following:\n       (d) Limitation to New Filers.--The exemptions set forth in \n     subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only with respect to \n     issuers that are first required to file financial statements \n     and other periodic reporting with the Commission under the \n     securities laws after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 595, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Issa) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chair, my amendment quite simply makes this bill \nbetter. Since 2011, almost 5 years, virtually every single public \ncompany has reported financial statements to the SEC by electronic, \nsearchable, readable data format, often called XBRL.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  This searchable data allows the investor community to look through \ndata in a way they never could under paper, and its accuracy is as good \nor as bad as the source material that goes onto that paper.\n  Now, both the author of the bill and myself agree on one thing: \nprinting paper and sending electronic format is outdated. There is no \nquestion at all that the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nis long overdue to convert to an all-electronic filing.\n  As a matter of fact, for most of the people that will be listening \nand watching today, they are already electronically filing their income \ntax and then printing out a paper copy to stick in a drawer. The idea \nthat a public company who spends two, three, four or more millions of \ndollars in compliance every year would file paper, and then that paper \nwould be electronically scanned, sent to India, converted to data, and \nthen analyzed by the investment community is truly about the most \nbackwards way one could imagine doing it.\n  What my amendment to Mr. Hurt's bill that is enclosed in the larger \nbill says is, we understand that some small startup companies, even \nthough they are going public, may have a difficult time transitioning, \nand the idea that they would be allowed to go optional, as Congressman \nHurt's bill intends, is acceptable if, in fact, it is for a short \nperiod of time, as the eventual transition to all-electronic filing \ngoes forward.\n  The many thousands of companies who have been successfully filing \nelectronically and who have software that makes it simply a push of a \nbutton, coming off of this would, in fact, be a giant step backwards.\n  As we go toward all-electronic filing and the elimination of the \nabsurdity of paper as the standard of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, we only ask that this provision be one that is focused on \nnew companies for a short period of time. That is the reason the \namendment takes the 5-year exemption to all companies to be simply an \nexemption to new IPOs; in other words, companies that may not at the \ntime of their public offering already have the software in place to do \nthis filing.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in gentle opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I say I rise in gentle opposition--I do \nnot say that tongue in cheek--because the gentleman from California is \nhighly respected as a Member of this body. His opinions are respected \nas an entrepreneur and as a small-business individual. His acumen is \nrespected as an investor, and so it is not a pleasant experience to \noppose one of his amendments. I appreciate the sentiment with which he \noffers it.\n  I would just remind all that title IV of the bill provides an \noptional exemption from the XBRL data filing requirements for emerging \ngrowth and smaller public companies for a limited period of time. I \nthink there is an open question. One thing that the gentleman didn't \nget the benefit of was hearing all the testimony that we had within our \ncommittee. There was a lot of testimony about just how costly this is \nto a number of these companies.\n  Now, if the investing public demands it, then smaller companies will \ndo it. For example, there was a Sarbanes-Oxley exemption for some \nsmaller companies and only roughly half of them took it because for \ncertain smaller companies what they found out was, well, the investors \ndemanded it.\n  I would say, again, why don't we let the free market determine this. \nWe are not talking about the types of information that are provided in \ndisclosure. We\n\n[[Page H533]]\n\nare talking about the format. We are talking about the format of \ndisclosure.\n  We have heard testimony from a company that is spending over $50,000 \nannually on XBRL compliance and, at least in their case, they can't \nfind people who follow their company who are actually using it, so that \nis $50,000 a year that could go into R, that could go into \nproductivity enhancement, that could go into hiring more individuals.\n  I am not saying that XBRL is unimportant, but I think to some extent \nthat at least for the smaller companies, and particularly at this time \nin our country's economic history, where we came off of an incredibly \nhorrendous quarter, and we know that after 8 years of Obamanomics, we \nare limping along at half of our average economic growth, I think we \nwant to err on the side of our small businesses, of our entrepreneurial \nventures, of our small business startups, so I appreciate the value \nthat XBRL provides to a lot of companies, a lot of investors, but I \nthink if they demand it enough, we will provide it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), a senior member of the Committee on \nFinancial Services.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support \nof the gentleman's well thought out and meaningful amendment.\n  All financial regulators in the developed world require searchable \nPDFs, as his bill would allow, and that is why the Securities and \nExchange Commission began requiring the extensible business reporting \nlanguage. XBRL is the global standard for structured financial \nreporting. Why should we be any different?\n  By removing the requirement for 60 percent of the firms, as H.R. 1965 \ndoes, is a step backward for corporate transparency and the ability for \ninvestors to invest in new startups. It is a well-thought-out \namendment. I congratulate you on it. I support it.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each side \nhas remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1\\3/4\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I have been on the board of a \npublic company, of multiple public companies. I have taken a company \npublic, as have many of the supporters of this amendment. I know the \ncost of taking a company public. It is in the millions. It is not in \nthe thousands.\n  I also know that whether it is Bernie Madoff or Enron or WorldCom or \na host of much smaller companies that have deceived the public, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission has an obligation to continuously \nimprove the material available to the financial community and to make \nsure that it is equally searchable and equally accessible to the large \nand small investor. That is the reason that I strongly believe that \nelimination of paper, not covered in this bill, should not be replaced \nby elimination in any way of the reporting under the digital reporting \nrequirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  I would urge Members that this is narrowly focused, much more narrow \nthan the bill itself. It recognizes that if somebody wants to go public \nand not do this, they would have the ability to do so. As Mrs. Maloney \nsaid, for 60 percent of the reporting companies to be exempted out \nwould begin to rot away the underpinnings of a 5-year-old program that \nhas been successful.\n  I would hope people would realize that it is not a necessary, a \ndraconian backwards step to before 2011. In fact, from my information \nand from my experience, it is a de minimis cost to simply include a \ndigital format that the world can look at and evaluate quicker and with \ngreater accuracy.\n\n  I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), the \nchairman of the full committee, for bringing a combined bill that I \ngenerally approve of and hope that this amendment will make it a bill I \ncan vote for.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield the balance of my \ntime to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Hurt), the author of title IV \nof H.R. 1675.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I join the chairman of the \nCommittee on Financial Services in my respect for the proponent of this \namendment. I certainly appreciate his efforts in attempting to make \nthis title better, but I would point out a couple of things.\n  The first thing I would say, as the chairman of the Committee on \nFinancial Services has said, this is a voluntary exemption. It is a \ntemporary exemption. We heard in the committee this Congress and in \nprevious Congresses that the XBRL format that has been required by the \nSEC since 2009 has not been reliable. A Columbia study that was done in \n2012 indicated at that time that only 10 percent of investors actually \nused, found XBRL format useful in doing analysis of public companies.\n  It is for those reasons that we believe that this temporary, \nvoluntary option for smaller companies not submitting to the SEC in \nthis format makes sense.\n  I would submit to you that what this amendment does is it would \nrequire all companies that are currently submitting in this form to \ncontinue. What it would do is exempt future companies. Well, it strikes \nme like this. If this XBRL format and process is not ready for prime \ntime, if it is not ready for prime time for future users, then we also \nought to give relief for those who are currently having to do it and \nwould like not to do it.\n  I believe that we should allow all emerging growth companies and \nsmaller issuers to take advantage of this voluntary exemption while the \nSEC is getting this format ready for prime time.\n  This amendment goes to the very essence of the underlying measure and \nwould not substantively provide any relief to the small companies who \nare currently being negatively impacted by this failed XBRL system.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and ask for the support \nof the underlying bill.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of the time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Issa).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-414.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of \nthe gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), the prime author of the \namendment, of which I am a lead cosponsor, I offer an amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike title IV.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 595, the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, this amendment \nstrikes title IV of H.R. 1675.\n  Title IV of this bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission \nexempt public companies with less than $250 million in annual revenue \nfrom reporting their financial information as searchable data. This \nexemption would cut off access to searchable, easily accessible data \nfor about 60 percent of all public companies.\n  Instead of using searchable, structured data, we would return to a \npaper-based system. Exempting 60 percent of public companies from \nfiling their financials in a structured, understandable way makes it \nharder for the people who review corporate financial disclosure \ndocuments to understand what is going on in a company. Eliminating the \nrequirement for searchable data\n\n[[Page H534]]\n\nharms researchers and academics, regulators, investors, and the general \npublic. All of them will have a harder time understanding the financial \nperformance of corporations.\n  If title IV is passed, documents that are nonsearchable must be \nmanually reviewed to extract useful information, and manual review is \nmuch more prone to error. No other financial regulator in the developed \nworld does not require searchable PDFs. That is why the Securities and \nExchange Commission began requiring reporting in eXtensible Business \nReporting Language, XBRL. It is the global standard for structural \nfinancial reporting. We would be behind the world if we do this.\n  By removing the requirement for 60 percent of firms, H.R. 1965 is a \nbackward step for corporate transparency and for investor knowledge and \ninvestors.\n  I support this amendment, and I believe that we need to move our \nfinancial analysis into the modern world.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  We spend a great deal of time on the Financial Services Committee \ntalking about ways to improve small companies' access to capital. Well, \nthat is exactly what XBRL can do. So I am puzzled that some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle would want to move backward \non XBRL instead of moving forward.\n  XBRL makes it possible for investors and analysts to very quickly \ndownload standardized financial information for an entire industry and \nmake immediate cross-company comparisons in order to identify the best \nperformers. It makes it easier for them to invest in startups. This \nallows investors to spend more time analyzing data and less time \ngathering data.\n  This will also enable investors to more easily identify the companies \nthat are diamonds in the rough, so to speak. Very often, these are \nsmall companies that are innovative. These are building models that we \nneed to support.\n  Right now, these small companies have trouble attracting the \nattention of analysts and institutional investors--this is a \nfundamental fact, and we spend a lot of time on the Financial Services \nCommittee trying to figure out why this is.\n  Well, one reason is it's simply too time-consuming for analysts and \ninvestors to pick through every small company's hundred-page financial \nfilings. Economists call these costs ``search costs''--and \nunfortunately, they still dramatically outweigh the benefits.\n  A small company's filings may tell a fantastic story about why that \ncompany is poised to be the next Apple, but if the ``search costs'' are \nhigh enough that analysts and investors never see them, that company \nwill never get the capital infusion it needs to grow. And our economy \nwill never realize the benefits that the company has to offer.\n  This is where XBRL comes in. It dramatically reduces the ``search \ncosts'' by making it fast and cheap for investors to gather \nstandardized financial statements for entire industries--including the \nsmall companies that the investor wouldn't have bothered with before.\n  If those small companies offer greater value than the bigger, more \nestablished companies in the industry, then it will likely be obvious \nto the investor when she looks at the data. This will result in capital \nflowing more efficiently--not just to the biggest, most well-known \ncompanies, but to the companies that can use that capital in the most \nefficient way.\n  But it's important to remember that if those small companies don't \nfile their financial information in XBRL format, then their financial \nstatements won't be part of the investor's data set--and thus will \nnever get a much-needed capital infusion from that investor.\n  This is how XBRL can help improve small companies' access to capital.\n  So if you're concerned about access to capital, then you should vote \nfor this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. \nEllison), my distinguished colleague, who is now here.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, if you are a company that is going public, \nif you are a company that wants to sell shares to retail investors, you \nare not a small business. You are a big business. You are in the big \nleagues.\n  Along with the privileges comes some responsibility. If you are too \nsmall to report your data, then you are too small to be on the NASDAQ. \nIf you can't run with the big dogs, you should stay on the porch.\n  True, they could choose to report in searchable, structured data, but \nthat would result in a fractured system. Some report by searchable \ndata, some by PDFs.\n  I want the people who review corporate financial disclosure documents \nto have the data that they need. They need to find corporate financial \ndata faster, in more detail, and at lower cost. That is where \neXtensible Business Reporting Language, or XBRL, comes in. XBRL is \noperating now.\n  When the exemption was brought before the previous Congress, two \nwitnesses testified to costs of $50,000 or more to file in XBRL. But \nthese two companies appear to be outliers.\n  The American Institute for Certified Public Accountants found that \nsmaller firms pay, on average, $10,000 a year. Meanwhile, the group of \ncompanies that would be exempt under this bill paid more than $1 \nmillion in legal and financial banking fees in 2013 just to raise \ncapital from investors. So the cost of XBRL is miniscule compared to \nthe other costs of being a public company.\n  This amendment is meritorious, and I ask for its support.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, every working American knows this \neconomy stinks. There are no two ways about it.\n  We have got to jump-start our small businesses and our emerging \ngrowth companies. Entrepreneurship is at a generational low. Let's do \nsomething to actually help our small businesses raise capital. You \ncan't have capitalism without capital.\n  The gentleman from Virginia, the author of title IV, provides a very \nsimple optional exemption from the XBRL data filing requirement. It has \nnothing to do with the content of disclosure, Mr. Chairman. All it has \nto do with is the format--a format that is very expensive for a number \nof our emerging growth companies, some of whom testified that a lot of \ninvestors don't even use it.\n  So what we are essentially hearing from the author of the amendment \nand others is a rough translation that this is in the small business' \nbest interest because they will need it to attract investors. Well, why \ndon't we let them make that decision? This is almost the analog of \nObamaCare: the American people were too stupid to know what kind of \nhealth care they needed.\n  If XBRL works for these small companies, they will use it. If it \ndoesn't, then they will opt out of it. It is optional for emerging \ngrowth companies and smaller public companies. It is temporary. It is a \nhuge burden on these companies at a time when we just had one of the \nworst quarters of economic growth we have seen in years and when the \neconomy continues to lag at roughly half of its historic economic \ngrowth.\n  At some point, I would hope the other side of the aisle would end the \nwar on small businesses and emerging growth companies. We need title \nIV.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nHurt), the author of title IV of H.R. 1675.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The first amendment that we heard about from the gentleman from \nCalifornia was certainly couched as a friendly amendment. This \namendment, to be sure, is not a friendly amendment because what it does \nis strike title IV altogether. I certainly appreciate the comments made \nby the gentleman and the gentlewoman in support of the amendment, but I \nwould suggest to you that this amendment is not a constructive \napproach.\n  There have been a lot of misstatements about what this title does, \nbut the fact is this: If the SEC were ready to effectively implement \nXBRL, we wouldn't be having this conversation, but the SEC is not. \nSmaller and emerging growth companies are wasting valuable resources on \na system that is not ready for prime time.\n  One of the things that was said earlier was that this exemption would \naffect 60 percent of the companies that are regulated. The truth of it \nis and the perspective that needs to be remembered is this:\n  Number one, among those 60 percent of companies, we are talking about \nonly less than 7 percent of the market value of all public companies. \nSo, in the grand scheme of things, we are\n\n[[Page H535]]\n\ntalking about companies that are small.\n  The second thing we know about them is they are our most dynamic job \ncreators, period; and the purpose of this bill, the purpose of this \ntitle, is to support those that are actually creating jobs in an \neconomy where we need jobs desperately.\n  The other point that I would make is to reiterate again what the \nchairman said, and that is that title IV is voluntary. It is optional. \nIf it is good for the company, then the company can choose to continue \nto submit this information in that format. If a company doesn't believe \nthat it is in its best interest and there is not value to it and to \npotential investors, then it is something they should not have to waste \ntime on.\n  The second point is that it is completely temporary. It is a \ncompletely temporary exemption that will expire in 5 years.\n  I agree with where we want to go in terms of the technology, but \nasking these small companies who are our Nation's most dynamic job \ncreators to waste their resources on a system that is not yet useful to \nthem or to their investors is something that we should not stand for.\n  With that, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

There is 1 minute remaining.\n\n                              {time}  1635\n\n  So the amendment was rejected.\n  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nYoung of Iowa) having assumed the chair, Mr. Byrne, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1675) to \ndirect the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise its rules so as \nto increase the threshold amount for requiring issuers to provide \ncertain disclosures relating to compensatory benefit plans, and, \npursuant to House Resolution 595, he reported the bill back to the \nHouse with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on the amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at \nthe desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I am opposed in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Frankel of Florida moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1675 \n     to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to \n     report the same back to the House forthwith with the \n     following amendment:\n\n       Insert after section 1 the following:\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON BAD ACTORS AND PROTECTION OF AMERICAN \n                   RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--A bad actor may not make use of any \n     exemption, safe harbor, or other authority provided by this \n     Act or an amendment made by this Act or a regulation issued \n     pursuant to this Act or an amendment made by this Act.\n       (b) Rulemaking.--The Securities and Exchange Commission \n     shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Bad Actor Defined.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``bad actor'' means any person that has been convicted \n     of a felony or a misdemeanor involving securities, including \n     those securities used for investing in retirement.\n       Page 19, after line 22, insert the following:\n       (b) Protection of American Seniors.--The Commission may not \n     amend or repeal any regulation pursuant to subsection (a) if \n     such amendment or repeal would weaken the protections \n     provided for American seniors.\n\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask \nunanimous consent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to \nthe bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If \nadopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as \namended.\n  Mr. Speaker, in a bipartisan spirit, I offer a motion to recommit in \norder to make needed improvements to the current proposal.\n  Let me start with the story of Charles Bacino, as noted in ``The \nStreet,'' a financial news service.\n  Charles grew up in Pueblo, Colorado. He was an accomplished musician. \nHe taught music for over 30 years and brought joy to audiences across \nour country, from Disney World in Orlando to the Venetian in Las Vegas. \nHe even performed alongside the famed tenor, Luciano Pavarotti. But \nmost importantly, Charles was the loving father of three children and \nseven grandchildren.\n  At age 73, as Charles lay dying of pancreatic cancer in a hospital \nbed in Las Vegas, he called his financial affairs manager to his \nbedside to discuss his investments and put his final affairs in order. \nAs a morphine drip was working to ease his pain, Charles' financial \nadviser persuaded him to invest $82,000 in a cocoa and banana \nplantation in Ecuador. Charles gave the adviser the keys to his house \nto get his checkbook, and in a matter of moments, his money was gone.\n  Financial fraud against our seniors cuts deep. Sadly, there are many \nmore out there like Charles. One in five Americans over age 65 have \nbeen victimized by financial fraud. This equates to seniors losing \nnearly $13 billion a year due to financial fraud.\n  I am sad to report to you that close to 1 million seniors are \ncurrently forgoing meals as a result of economic hardship due to \nfinancial abuse, and this problem may get worse as older Americans live \nlonger.\n  Here is the thing: the bill that my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle bring to us today shields abusers like Charles' so-called \nfinancial adviser and strips Congress of the power to protect our \ngrandmothers and grandfathers from con artists who swindle them.\n  Mr. Speaker, my motion to recommit would preserve decades of SEC \nconsumer protections designed to help folks just like Charles. It would \nensure that those criminals who prey on seniors will be held \naccountable.\n  My amendment adds something to this legislation that every person in\n\n[[Page H538]]\n\nthis Chamber--Democratic and Republican--should want to do and get \nbehind: stronger protections for the people who held us in their arms \nwhen we were young and that sheltered us and shared their wisdom with \nus as we grew. As they protected us, we must protect them.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, that was a heartbreaking story, and I \nhave no doubt that it is true. But I would urge the gentlewoman to \nperhaps actually read the bill. Unlike ObamaCare and unlike Dodd-Frank, \nperhaps if the gentlewoman actually read the bill, which is 20 pages, \nnot 2,000 pages, she would understand that H.R. 1675 has nothing to do \nwith her story.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Fraud is illegal. I repeat: Fraud is illegal. If one is convicted of \na felony under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, there is a \nstatutory prohibition from doing what she has described.\n  Mr. Speaker, at best, this is a duplicative amendment, it is a \nsuperfluous amendment, and it takes away from the fact that under 8 \nyears of Obamanomics this economy is not working for working people. It \nis time to help our small businesses, it is time to help our growth \ncompanies, it is time to put America back to work, and it is time to \nreject the motion to recommit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of passage.\n  This is a 5-minute vote.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 184, \nnoes 241, not voting 8, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 60]\n\n                               AYES--184\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blum\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

The United States is committed to helping Cote d'Ivoire \nstrengthen its democracy and stay on the path of peaceful democratic \ntransition, and we look forward to working with the Government and \npeople of Cote d'Ivoire to ensure continued progress and lasting peace \nfor all Ivoirians.\n  While the Government of Cote d'Ivoire and its people continue to make \nprogress towards consolidating democratic gains and peace and \nprosperity, the situation in or in relation to Cote d'Ivoire continues \nto pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security \nand foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, I have \ndetermined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and \nrelated measures blocking the property of certain persons contributing \nto the conflict in Cote d'Ivoire.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 3, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H540-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SUCCESS OF SOUTH HILLS SCHOOL OF BUSINESS & TECHNOLOGY\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, as co-chairman of the \nbipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus, I want to recognize \nthe accomplishments of the South Hills School of Business & Technology, \nwhich has campuses based in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional \nDistrict.\n  I was recently notified by school officials that they have placed 86 \npercent of their 2014 graduates in jobs within their fields of study. \nNow, that statistic is 10 percent higher than the average occupational \nplacement rate for associate degree graduates. Additionally, the school \nachieved a job placement rate of close to 100 percent for graduates of \ntheir criminal justice, business office specialist, and administrative \nmedical assistant programs.\n  This stands as further evidence that careers in our career and \ntechnical education fields are in demand. It also serves as a reminder \nfor high school students across the Nation that a technical education \nis a great option for their futures.\n  Madam Speaker, the South Hills School of Business & Technology is \njust one example of how these institutions create job-ready employees \nfor 21st century careers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H540-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING KENTUCKY SENATOR GEORGIA POWERS\n\n  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. YARMUTH.

Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New \nJersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) is recognized for 60 minutes as the \ndesignee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speaker, the city of Flint, Michigan, has \nbeen hit by a crisis of massive proportion. Its impact on the long-term \nhealth and future success of its residents remains unclear.\n  The fact I find most disturbing is that it is a completely manmade \ncrisis. It grew out of the same kind of stubborn faith in austerity \nmeasures that has handicapped our ability to govern for years. It grew \nout of a failure to protect the Flint River from environmental damage. \nIt grew out of both a failure to invest in Flint's crumbling \ninfrastructure and in the willful disregard for the people of that \ncity, a city in which more than 40 percent of the residents live below \nthe poverty line and in which the majority of families are African \nAmerican.\n  My colleagues and I are here on the floor this evening to urge every \nMember of this body to understand one thing: If we fail to acknowledge \nthe issues that led to the Flint water crisis, we will see similar and \nequally devastating events in more and more cities across the country.\n  We need to recognize that tunnel vision for deficit reduction creates \nmore problems than it solves. The emergency manager appointed by \nGovernor Snyder instituted a plan to run Flint like a business in order \nto bring it back from the brink of death. In the process, he sought out \nthe least expensive options for basic needs, like water. In doing so, \nhe decided to pull from the corrosive and contaminated Flint River \nwithout ensuring the treatment protocol necessary to ensure the water \nwas clean. We now know that, although the Flint River is in poor shape, \na little additional spending could have prevented this crisis. Instead, \nFlint went the bare bones route, leaving a generation of residents to \nsuffer the permanent consequences.\n  Madam Speaker, Congress has, once more, been so focused on reducing \nthe deficit that we have lost sight of our responsibility to govern. \nOnly a few months ago did we finally abandon the absurd policy of \nsequestration, which has hampered the functioning of countless programs \nover the past several years. The benefits of austerity and small \ngovernment are questionable at best. Flint has proven that, and we \nwould all be wise to remember it.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the only lesson that we can take away from \nthis crisis. This Congress has made undermining environmental and \nenergy regulations one of its core missions. In the first 100 days of \nthe 114th Congress, it voted on more environmental and energy issues \nthan on any other topic, and not a single one was aimed at protecting \nresources, like the Flint River, from the kind of contamination that \nallowed its water to corrode lead pipes.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  If reducing the deficit has been the first priority for my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, allowing corporations and big \nbusinesses to take whatever liberties with our environment they choose \nhas to be a close second.\n  Under the majority of this House, our babies would choke on smog \nbefore we limit the amount of pollution a single smokestack can spew \nout. Our streams and rivers would poison even the fish swimming in them \nbefore we would set restrictions on where these companies can dump \ntheir chemical byproducts. Our forests and farmlands would turn barren \nbefore we would question the long-term impact of fracking.\n  It took years to turn the Flint River into the downright dangerous \nwater source that has caused so many problems. But for other rivers, \nlakes, or streams, there may still be time to repair or prevent the \ndamage that we have done. Flint should move us to strengthen, not \nweaken, our environmental protections.\n  Madam Speaker, there is one more lesson to learn here, and it is \nperhaps the most important. The infrastructure in Flint, like in so \nmany other cities, is outdated, and no one at the local, State or \nFederal level seems willing or capable of making the necessary \ninvestments.\n  Today in our Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing, one \nof the topics of concern was that, even if individual homes had \nreplaced their old lead pipes, the city's pipes would still have caused \na major problem. Madam Speaker, that is a matter of infrastructure at \nthe most basic level.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, we spent more than a decade leading \nthe way in the battle against lead poisoning. But with the onset of \nGovernor Christie's administration, all these advances have also come \nto an abrupt halt there.\n  There are now 11 cities with levels of lead higher than what has been \nreported in Flint right in my State of New Jersey. This contamination \nfrom lead comes from paint instead of water.\n\n[[Page H542]]\n\n  Nonetheless, it is a reflection of the reduction and diminution of \nservices and resources to make our environment safe for our \ncommunities. Two of these cities are right in my district.\n  Still, Governor Christie's administration has ignored the problem and \nthoroughly failed our children by choosing not to fund our State's lead \nabatement fund.\n  Here at the Federal level we can take this even further. Our failure \nto invest in transportation and energy infrastructure is building up to \na crisis of a different kind, a time when our roads, our bridges, and \nour power grids begin to fail.\n  Madam Speaker, there are so many lessons we need to learn from Flint. \nI have a number of colleagues who are here with me this evening who \nhave raised their voices in support of the people of Flint and who I \nknow agree with me that this must be a watershed moment.\n  We need to change course to prevent this from happening again and \nensure the future of our Nation.\n  Before I turn this over, I want to take a moment to add that there \nare a number of organizations, coalitions, and other associations that \nconsistently are dedicated to protecting our natural resources. They \ndefend the Clean Water Act, and they fight for the Clean Air Act. I \nhope to see more of them fighting for Flint in the near future.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), \nwho not only represents the district in which there is Flint, but he is \na resident born and raised in the city of Flint, Michigan.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for conducting this \nSpecial Order and raising attention to this situation. Particularly on \nbehalf of the people that I represent, the 100,000 people in my \nhometown of Flint, as difficult as this time has been, they do get some \nstrength from the fact that Members of Congress from all across the \ncountry and, frankly, Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle \nhave expressed their concern.\n  It is my sincere hope that the concern expressed for the people of \nFlint will not just come in the form of sympathy, but will actually \nmove us to take action.\n  Let me just take a moment to tell you about my hometown. This is a \ncity that was the birthplace of General Motors in 1908. This is a city \nthat actually helped build the labor movement.\n  In 1936 and 1937, the workers in the factories occupied those \nfactories until, on February 11, they got that first UAW contract that \nactually helped build the middle class.\n  The reason I mention that is that it is a city that has great pride \nin the contribution that it has made over the decades to the incredible \nproductive capacity of our society.\n  With that pride as a backdrop, the last few decades have been really \ntough because we have seen the loss of manufacturing jobs. We have seen \nbig changes in our economy. The community has become smaller. It has \ngone from 200,000 people to about 100,000 now.\n  We have lost an enormous amount of the manufacturing base that we \nonce had, and it was really the engine of our economy. Of course, the \neffect of all that is to challenge the community and its very \nexistence.\n  The city itself has struggled to keep its budgets balanced to provide \nessential services. Then a few years ago a decision was made at the \nState level to reduce and, in fact, eliminate State support for cities.\n  That kind of support was necessary for the city to provide the \nessential role that it plays in a regional economy. As a result of that \ndecision, the city was in significant financial stress, really on the \nverge of bankruptcy.\n  The State of Michigan's solution, rather than provide support--\nadditional funding, economic development, workforce development, better \nschools--that is not the solution. Those are the things that would make \na difference.\n  Instead, the State of Michigan appoints an emergency manager that \nsuspends the authority of the city council and the mayor, as if this \ncity that is struggling as a result of disinvestment only needs new \nmanagement.\n  Worse yet, the charge to these emergency managers--and we have them \nin Michigan and lots of different communities and school districts--is \nto get in there and get the budget balanced. The tool they have is a \nbudget scalpel. There are no additional resources, just a knife to cut \nthe budget.\n  In the case of Flint, one of the places they chose to cut was the \nessential service of drinking water, temporarily shifting, as a result \nof an emergency manager's decision, to the Flint River.\n  Now, folks don't need to be mad at the river. It is just the river. \nActually, it is quite beautiful now since it is no longer used as an \nopen sewer. Some of it has been restored, but it is still river water. \nIt is 19 times more corrosive than the Great Lakes water that we have \ndrawn from decades as our water source.\n  In a rush to save money, the decision was made to use this river. In \nan almost inexplicable decision to save a few hundred dollars--really, \nI think it is estimated at about $100 a day--they didn't treat the \nwater with orthophosphate to control corrosion of the pipes.\n  That is what led to the pipes leaching lead into the water system, \ninto the households, into the bodies of human beings, and into 9,000 \nchildren under the age of 6 who are the real victims of this.\n  It is not good for adults. There is no acceptable level of lead in \nthe human body. It is a neurotoxin. But for children it is especially \ndangerous because it affects brain development in a way that is \npermanent.\n  So what we need now, since this was done to Flint by the failure of \nthe emergency manager to think about something other than dollars and \ncents, and the failure of the State, despite repeated warnings, \nincluding warnings from the EPA, that they should be applying corrosion \ncontrol and that this is going to have consequences, they treated it \nlike it was a public relations problem for them, not a public health \nproblem for 100,000 people. So the damage has been done.\n  We have two questions to ask ourselves. One is: How do we make sure \nthis never happens again? Getting rid of the emergency manager law \nwould be a big step in the right direction, making sure that not only \ndo we have adequate regulations regarding clean water, but the agencies \ncharged with them have adequate authority and resources to enforce. \nThat would go a long way to prevent this from happening again.\n  Legislation that myself and my colleagues from Michigan are \nintroducing would ensure that, when the EPA is aware of a problem like \nthis, they would have to make it public. That would go a long way.\n  The other question is: How do we make it right for the people in \nFlint, especially for the children? The State did this. It was their \ndecision. Virtually everybody back home has no doubt about that \nquestion.\n  There is an effort right now to try to obfuscate responsibility. That \nis really because, in my view--and this is only my opinion--by \naccepting responsibility for what happened means that there is the \nresponsibility to make it right. I just fear that the State of Michigan \nis trying to avoid that kind of responsibility.\n  To make it right, we need to spend some money on infrastructure, take \nup those lead service lines that have been so damaged by this corrosive \nwater and replace them with something that will not deliver lead into \nthe water system and to improve the infrastructure so that it is more \nsustainable.\n  Most importantly and finally, to make it right in Flint, we have to \nmake sure the kids, who are the real victims of this, are given every \nopportunity that we can give them to overcome something that their \ngovernment did to them.\n  That means giving them opportunities like every child having access \nto Early Head Start, every child being enrolled in Head Start, every \nchild having enrichment opportunities, every child being given all the \nhelp they can, all the support they can, for proper nutrition, every \nchild having a small class size so that teacher-student contact is real \nand not packed in a classroom of 35 or 40 kids, summer youth activity, \nsummer employment.\n  All of the things that we would do as parents for one of our own \nchildren struggling to overcome a developmental hurdle is what the \nState of Michigan owes to the 9,000 children of\n\n[[Page H543]]\n\nFlint under the age of 6 that have been subjected to high levels of \nlead. That is the moral obligation of the State of Michigan.\n  I just hope--and I know my colleagues stand with me--that, if the \nState is unwilling to step up and do the right thing, we recognize that \nthese children, these citizens, the people I represent, just like the \npeople we all represent, are not just residents of a State, but they \nare citizens of the United States, just like when a storm hits, when we \nhave a chance and the capacity to do something to ease that suffering, \nto provide opportunity to overcome a manmade disaster, that we are \nwilling to stand up and do that.\n  I can't tell you how much I thank my colleagues for taking some time \nthis week--particularly my colleagues from Michigan, but the folks from \nall over the country, have been helpful. This is a real crisis, and it \ndeserves a response equal to the gravity of the crisis.\n  On behalf of the people I represent, thank you so much.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speaker, we are particularly grateful for \nboth Representative Kildee and Representative Lawrence for having \nelevated this discussion to the point that we are giving it serious \nconsideration.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), a cosponsor \nof this Special Order hour.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I stand before you today a true \nMichigan girl, born and raised in the city of Detroit, having traveled \nand been in public service for over 25 years in multiple capacities.\n  Today I had the opportunity, after calling for a hearing to Chairman \nChaffetz, to call a hearing about this Flint water situation.\n  I want to tell you, being in Congress and knowing that there are two \naisles, two philosophies, two groups--the Republicans and the \nDemocrats--that I was so impressed that the chairman responded and \ngranted my request for a hearing.\n  He understood how important and how volatile the situation is. We \nstruggled a little bit with who would be able to be witnesses, but we \nhad the hearing.\n  I wanted to tell you that this is something that is not a partisan \nissue. The message I want to get out today is that this issue where \nchildren and families are affected because of the lack of government \ndoing their job is unacceptable. It is unacceptable in these United \nStates of America.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  I can tell you, Americans ask for three basic things whoever you are, \nwherever you live, and that is that we have safe food to consume, clean \nair to breathe, and clean water to drink because we need all those \nthings to merely live.\n  We trust our government to protect those things and to ensure that \nour consumption will not harm us. Clearly, we failed. We failed as a \ngovernment. This isn't about wearing your R or D. This is about the \ngovernment of these United States restoring the trust.\n  I want you to imagine a mother holding her child and, doing what a \nmother does with an infant, is feeding that child. She may mix formula \nand use water to mix the formula. Then she gives the baby the bottle. \nShe holds that baby, and that is just such a special bonding moment. Or \nshe may breastfeed. When you are breastfeeding, they tell you to drink \na lot of water.\n  In each of those scenarios, she was poisoning her child, poisoning \nher child for over 7 months before someone stood up and said: Stop \nusing the water. There are mothers all over this country who are \nholding their babies closer and praying, I hope this never happens to \nme.\n  I feel it is the role of government, Democrats and Republicans, \ncoming together to say never again in these United States of America. \nWe need to find out why this happened, when it happened, and when you \nknew about it, what did you do about it at all levels of government--\nFederal and State--and there is enough blame to go around.\n  It doesn't do those families in Flint any good if we just point \nfingers. We have to find out and have a full investigation so that we \ncan find out what we need to fix, so that we can stand before the \ncitizens of this great country and say: As your government, we are \nstarting to rebuild the trust, and we are going to fix this.\n  I want to be on the record that I feel those who made the decisions, \nfrom the emergency manager and the Governor, and those who were in a \nposition to make decisions should be providing statements and should be \na witness to tell us what happened, why it happened, when did they \nknow, what responsibility lies where.\n  We have already identified so many areas that legislation will be \ncoming forward. I hope they will be bipartisan. First of all, we need \nlegislation to find out when we find lead in water on a State level, \nwho has the primary role of protecting the water in that State? Where \nis the power of EPA? We must make it very clear, the notification of \nthe public once lead is identified in water.\n  We are hearing statements that are all over about why that didn't \nhappen. What we need to do is legislate that so it doesn't happen \nagain, make it very clear and enforce it. We need to increase the \nenforcement and testing of our water so that we will not have excuses \nin the future.\n  The last thing I want to say is: This is an election year, and as \nthose of us who serve in Congress go around and ask people to trust us, \nto give us their vote, we should also be able to say, in these United \nStates of America we have a history where we didn't always get it right \nin America. In America our history will teach us, there are times where \none side or the other didn't quite get it right, but our democracy and \nthe voice of the people rose to a level that demanded action happen.\n  Today, with this hearing and with us having this opportunity to put \nthis on the record, we are demanding that action be taken, that our \ngovernment stand up and do what it is supposed to do. We need to fund \nthe correctional actions that we need to do for the children who have \nbeen affected. We need to ensure that we are going to fix the pipes, \nand this is a bigger discussion, and that is infrastructure.\n  This Congress cannot continue to kick the can down the road when it \ncomes to infrastructure. This issue is about, yes, we did not treat the \nwater, but these lead pipes in older communities are an issue across \nthis country. We are going to have to stand up as a government, address \nit, fund it, and get about the work of fixing our infrastructure.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I would like to thank the Congresswoman. Another \nvery strong and strident voice on behalf of all the citizens in the \nState of Michigan, and particularly with regard to the issue \nconfronting our victims, the citizens as well as the city officials in \nFlint, Michigan, is our Congresswoman Dingell from Michigan.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Watson \nColeman for helping to organize this as well as the leadership of \nCongresswoman Brenda Lawrence and Congressman Dan Kildee, who is \nfighting for the people of his district.\n  Madam Speaker, the first responsibility of government is to keep the \nAmerican people safe, and it is clear that the government at every \nlevel failed the people of Flint. Clean and safe drinking water is a \nbasic human right. Now we need to focus on the people of Flint first, \nthe men and women and children, and what is happening there.\n  The most immediate need which we are still struggling with is what \nthey need. People have been donating bottled water, but in Flint, \nmothers don't know what is safe and what is not safe because they are \nstill getting conflicting information as to whether the water is safe \nto bathe in. They have rashes that no one can talk about. We have a \nGovernor who says if he had grandchildren, it would be safe, and an \nattorney general who is saying if he had children in Flint, he wouldn't \nlet them bathe. They don't even know what is safe.\n  We need to make sure that we are taking care of people, that they \nhave access and clean water. These families have no transportation. \nThey have set up water sites at five firehouses, and yet we don't think \nabout it because we are so lucky. These people don't have \ntransportation. Many of them have no way to get there. They are allowed \none case of water a day. Now, think about that. If you are trying to \nbathe your\n\n[[Page H544]]\n\nchildren and you don't know if tap water is safe or if the filter is \nthere. Think about if you are cooking spaghetti, a very common meal, \nyou need bottled water to just cook the spaghetti. So we really need to \nthink about the people of Flint and what it means to their daily life.\n  Secondly, we need to determine what it is they need long term, figure \nout the resources they need and all work together to get them. As my \ncolleagues have so eloquently said--Mr. Kildee, Mrs. Lawrence--who is \naccountable? Hold people accountable and make sure this never happens \nagain in America.\n  But having said that, there are 153,000 water systems in this \ncountry. Very bad decisions were made that made a community totally \ntoxic. As my colleague Mr. Kildee said, not only do we have to fix the \ninfrastructure, but we have almost 10,000 children who are going to \nneed Head Start, they are going to need access for resources for \nprobably a lifetime, for decades for health care, et cetera. How are we \ngoing to ensure that they have it? But how are we going to make sure \nthat we are addressing this problem across the country and making sure \nit never happens again? We need to make sure that our government at \nevery level never fails another community again.\n  The bringing of this tonight, the talking that all of us are doing, \nmay we all work together to fix this manmade crisis and make sure we \nkeep America safe for every other community.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Thank you very much, Congresswoman. I now yield \nto the distinguished lady from New York (Ms. Slaughter).\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, as a citizen and representative of the \nState of New York, I want to express my concern to all my colleagues \nfrom Michigan that in New York we care very deeply about this issue.\n  I want to thank certainly Congresswoman Watson Coleman for her \nleadership in allowing me to speak tonight. I rise today, Madam \nSpeaker, as the only microbiologist in Congress to discuss the current \nhealth disaster in Flint. It is not only a public health disaster but \nis also a violation of our social contract.\n  The magnitude of the public health crisis in Flint first became \napparent nearly a year ago, when lead levels of 397 parts per billion \nwere first detected in the city's drinking water, 26 times the limit \nthat the EPA uses to trigger action. In fact, last summer, a group of \nresearchers found lead levels high enough to meet the EPA's definition \nof toxic waste. No wonder that the filters that have been given to the \npeople of Flint have been rendered useless.\n  The truth is, the only safe level of lead in water is zero. Sadly, \nchildren are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of lead \npoisoning. The proportion of infants and children with above-average \nlevels of lead in their blood in Flint has nearly doubled since this \ncrisis. This toxic metal robs their brains of gray matter in the \nregions that enable people to pay attention, to regulate emotions, and \ncontrol impulses. For the rest of their lives, these children will \nlikely suffer from neurodevelopmental damage, reduced intelligence, \nbehavioral changes, anemia, hypertension, renal impairment, and other \nlifelong effects of lead poisoning, including a higher risk of \nincarceration.\n  What is worse, these children have been poisoned as a result of \ndeliberate decisions and systematic failures by the State of Michigan. \nMake no mistake about it, all of us who serve in this House and in \nyonder hall, as they serve in the Senate, have a responsibility for \nthese children because our oath requires that we will protect everyone \nfrom enemies both foreign and domestic. We have no right, and I think \nit borders on criminal that we would allow this kind of thing to happen \nto children who are also in our care. The failures of the Michigan \nState government are inexcusable, and doing this to our smallest \ncitizens is criminal.\n  Need I remind us that the democratically elected city council was \nsuperseded by a State-appointed emergency manager--I don't know what \nthe emergency was, but he certainly created one--who made these \ndreadful decisions that brought us to this process and to this \ndemocratic process that was undermined and the hundreds who live with \nthe consequences of it.\n  Those in Congress who have blocked investments in our Nation's \ninfrastructure need to take another look at the consequences of their \ninactions. Instead of investing in roads, bridges, and pipes, we spent \ntrillions of dollars on bombs, on decimating other countries, on war \nand wounding about 60,000 young Americans. While this failure impacts \nall Americans, it disproportionately harms the low-income areas, \ncommunities of color, doubling down on the already wide racial, health, \nand economic disparities across the country.\n  Now, Flint is only the latest example of this disturbing reality. I \nfear that it is a bellwether for the rest of the Nation. Just under \nfoot nationwide are century-old water pipes in almost every city, \ncertainly in the New England States, that may be the very next to fail. \nWe have got to take the steps to reverse the failed choices that \nbrought Flint to the brink, but also to ensure that what happened in \nFlint does not happen in other communities across the country. Again, \nthat is our responsibility.\n  I thank Congresswoman Watson Coleman for her timely concern over the \nissue and for yielding to me.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman very much for not only \nher eloquent words but the fact that she can speak from her scientific \nbackground, being a microbiologist. Absolutely there is science in this \nissue.\n  Now I yield to the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, this is the Progressive Caucus Special \nOrder hour. I am so honored that Bonnie Watson Coleman leads our Caucus \nin this regard. It couldn't be more important tonight than to have an \nexcellent leader guiding us in this discussion because, in my opinion, \nthe Flint water crisis is one of the most stunning failures of the \nphilosophy that you ought to run a government entity like a business \nthat I have ever seen.\n  Tonight the Flint water crisis that is in front of us is not a \ntsunami, it is not a tornado, and it is not a flood. It is decisions by \npeople who have inflicted massive harm and damage on children and the \ncommunity at large.\n  When we say children, the damage to the children is absolutely \nincontrovertible, but what about our seniors? What about our people in \nthe prime of their lives who cannot use the water in the city that they \nexpect to use it in?\n  I submit to you that this problem is the responsibility of Governor \nSnyder, who believes in running government like a business. The former \nleader of Gateway Computers promised outcomes and deliverables during \nhis campaign, but he wasn't selling computers. You are supposed to be \ngiving public services to the people. It is very different. Apparently, \nthe deliverables that he wanted to deliver, delivered awful, horrible \noutcomes for the people of Flint.\n  Before the Flint crisis, Mr. Snyder spent $1.8 billion in tax cuts \nfor corporations, leaving very little for small, struggling cities like \nFlint. Of course, it is all based on the philosophy that if you don't \nregulate rich people and big companies and you give them all the tax \nbreaks they ever want, then they are going to invest it all in the \nplant and equipment and wages and make it better off. What a stunning \nfailure. It is a lie, an untruth, and a demonstrably false claim.\n  To save money, the Governor has been appointing political cronies as \nfinancial managers to mostly Black, mostly poor municipalities around \nthe State. When I say that folks in Flint are mostly Black, I want to \nsay this. They are not all Black. There is a shared harm on White \ncommunities and Latino communities as well. I don't want people across \nAmerica to think: ``Well, I am not Black, so it is not really my \nproblem.'' No, it is your problem, if you are living in Flint and \ndrinking water, no matter what your skin color or ethnic background is.\n  In Flint, the emergency manager suggested switching the city's \ndrinking water supply to the Flint River to save the city about $5 \nmillion. Thank you. It will cost billions to correct the damage that \nthis perverted philosophy of money before people has resulted in. The \nconservative mantra says that cutting spending and shrinking government \nis the way to go. Well, he sure did\n\n[[Page H545]]\n\nthat, and now we have this crisis on our doorstep.\n  The government and businesses do not have the same bottom line, they \nshould not have the same bottom line, and we should treat businesses \nlike businesses and public services and government like that. They \nshould not confuse one for the other.\n  We have a crisis of democracy in Flint. Under the guise of fiscal \nresponsibility--which we all know only applies to low-income people and \nnever the well-to-do and the well-heeled--they are never asked to be \nfiscally responsible. For example, in Florida, the poor have to be \nfiscally responsible. They even have to be drug tested to get welfare. \nWe give farm subsidies away--that is welfare, too--and nobody is asked \nto do anything. It is ridiculous. It is a double standard.\n  Under the guise of fiscal responsibility, Governor Snyder used the \nState's emergency manager law to remove local power and appoint his own \npersonal emergency managers to run the city of Flint and numerous other \ncommittees in Michigan, including my own hometown where I was born and \nraised in Detroit, Michigan.\n  I am a proud Representative of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and its \nsuburbs today, but I was born in Detroit. I can never--nor would I want \nto--disconnect my connection to this crisis. This is my crisis. This is \nthe State where I was born and where my two older brothers and my \nparents and nieces and nephews live right now. My brother, Reverend \nBrian Ellison of Church of the New Covenant Baptist, was born in Flint.\n  Of the 25 times that emergency financial managers have been appointed \nin Michigan since 1990, Rick Snyder has appointed 15 of them. In doing \nso, he has denied these communities their right to representative \ndemocracy. This kind of idea that when your town is in trouble, \ndemocracy and the voice of the people cannot be part of the solution, \nis offensive to anybody who cares about democracy. Instead, it turns \nover control to an outside dictator who reports only to the Governor, \nnot anyone in the community.\n  I want to talk about Flint by the numbers just for a moment:\n  8,657 is the number of children under the age of 16 exposed to lead \npoisoning--it may be more now;\n  $5 million is the amount of money that Flint's emergency manager was \ntrying to save by switching the water supply to the Flint River;\n  $1.5 billion is estimated as what it would cost to now replace \nFlint's corroded water pipes;\n  $100 is the amount of money per day it would have cost to treat \nFlint's water with an anticorrosive agent;\n  10 is the number of Flint residents who have died from a \nLegionnaires' outbreak in Flint that experts suspect could be linked to \nwaterborne illnesses;\n  Zero is the number of corroded pipes removed from Flint since the \nGovernor decided to appoint this emergency manager.\n  Now, as I close, I just want to say that there is another group of \npeople who I just want to bring to light today, and that is a group of \npeople in our society who live among us who clean hotel rooms, work on \nfarms, and who really work superhard. These are people who may not have \ndocumentation to live in the United States.\n  One of the stories that we have yet to really put a lot of light on \nis the fact that undocumented people are being, according to reports, \nturned away from services. You need an ID to get the water. There are \ncases where undocumented people have not been able to get the services \nthat they need.\n  I just want to say that Flint's undocumented migrants hesitated to \nrequest help during the water crisis. On this floor and in other \nlegislatures around this country, conservative legislators are talking \nabout the aliens and all this kind of stuff as if these people are from \nanother planet, but my God, you deny them water? Come on. The fact of \nthe matter is that this is a humanitarian crisis. It deserves the full \nattention of our government.\n  The Progressive Caucus will offer an entry in our budget addressing \nthis crisis and coming at it with the money. Yes, we think the health \nand safety of the children and the people of Flint are more important \nthan somebody's tax cut. We do believe that to be true, and we are \ngoing to be standing firm for that.\n  We also urge all of our Members in this body to say wait a minute. \nAnytime public policy says the only thing that matters is cutting taxes \nand we don't really care about public services, you are going to get a \ncrisis like this.\n  Now that we have seen what this abhorrent philosophy will bring, I \nthink we can all say we need to slow down and ask ourselves the \nquestion: Isn't it worth a moment to spend time to deliver quality \npublic services to all of the people of this country? Isn't it time to \nlet government do what it is supposed to do, to protect the people?\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank Mr. Ellison, and I appreciate him taking \nthe time to be here.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank Congresswoman Watson Coleman for her \nleadership in coordinating this Special Order, and thank you to the \nMichigan Representatives who have been working so hard to try to \nrespond to this tragedy.\n  Madam Speaker, there will be a lot of investigations designed to find \nout what happened, whose fault it was, whether or not any crimes were \ncommitted, and how to prevent this from happening in the future, but \nthere is one thing we know, and that is that children have been \npoisoned by lead exposure.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce, we have begun the process to determine how to appropriately \nrespond, because we know that lead poisoning creates severe challenges \nto the public school system.\n  Children are entitled to an equal educational opportunity. That goes \nback to the Brown v. Board of Education case where the Court found that \nit is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in \nlife if denied the opportunity of an education. That opportunity is a \nright which must be made available to all on equal terms.\n  The local, State, and Federal governments have all failed our \nchildren, allowing them to be poisoned by lead exposure. We owe it to \nour children to mitigate, to the extent possible, the adverse effects \nof lead poisoning so they can achieve an equal educational opportunity.\n  Research already shows that the adverse effects of lead exposure are \ngreat due to decreased academic attainment, increased need for special \neducation, higher likelihood of behavioral challenges, and it can \nresult in a significant loss in earnings and tax revenues, additional \nburdens to the criminal justice system, and great stress on our \nhospital systems.\n  The opportunity for a strong start to a successful life will be \nstunted for Flint's children if they are not given the necessary \nresources including early interventions and access to high-quality \nearly learning programs such as Head Start to help them overcome the \nlifelong effects of exposure to lead.\n  We have an obligation to provide these resources--and provide them as \nsoon as possible--while they can be most effective. Current funding, \nhowever, only allows 20 percent of Flint children who are eligible for \nHead Start to actually attend.\n  The children who are able to participate in Head Start can receive \nearly screening services for developmental disabilities. Families can \nreceive counseling and assistance in accessing services. Head Start can \nprovide the Flint families affected by the disaster with early \nintervention services that they desperately need. But in order to do \nso, all families eligible for Head Start--not just the 20 percent \npresently participating--need to be able to access Head Start. We need \nto come up with the money to make that possible.\n  But make no mistake; we should not expect the fix to this crisis to \nbe easy or cheap. The impact of lead exposure on young children is \nlong-lasting, and our response must have a long-term approach. We must \nuse all of the tools available to us, starting with prenatal care and \nscreenings for pregnant moms, early intervention to identify special \neducation needs, title I funding from ESEA, after-school programs, and \neven investments in college access efforts.\n  Our children's futures have been compromised by bad government \ndecisions, but we know how to mitigate that damage. The response has to \nbe\n\n[[Page H546]]\n\nmore than just the infrastructure improvements and repairs to finally \nprovide clean water. We need a comprehensive response. Members of the \nCommittee on Education and the Workforce will be working to formulate \nthe appropriate response to the educational challenges. Other \ncommittees will work to the responses within their jurisdictions. But \none thing is certain: it is imperative that these resources be provided \nnow, without delay.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. \nClarke).\n  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam Speaker, as a member of the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus, I thank Mrs. Watson Coleman for her \nleadership, and I stand with my colleagues from the Michigan delegation \nand our colleagues throughout this House in our outrage over what has \noccurred and the pursuit of justice for the people of Flint.\n  As a New Yorker, I say to myself: There, but for the grace of God, go \nI. We, too, in New York City faced a lead crisis when callous landlords \ndid nothing to abate lead paint in their older housing stock. A crisis \nthat impacted untold numbers of young New Yorkers remains with us to \nthis very day. But then, that was the private sector. Who will speak \nfor the marginalized and disenfranchised that depended on the State \nleadership of the Governor, Mr. Snyder, and his team to keep them safe \nfrom harm?\n  The decision of the State of Michigan to change the source of water \nfor the sake of saving money showed an utter disregard for the well-\nbeing of the people of Flint. It is a national disgrace. It is a \nnational tragedy. This callous disregard for the poor and the \nvulnerable leaves us all culpable for what has happened in our Nation.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  The timeline of events is especially unnerving. The source of Flint's \nwater was changed in April of 2014. For nearly 1 year, complaints about \nthe water quality were ignored by the Michigan Department of \nEnvironmental Quality.\n  It took the EPA one series of tests to determine that the water was \nunusable, just one series of tests. And we know, as a result of that, \nthat this water was definitely unsafe for human consumption.\n  The result is babies, children, nursing mothers, the elderly, some \nwith compromised immune systems and health, were poisoned by their own \ngovernment.\n  Access to clean water and clean air are fundamental human rights. The \nState of Michigan has failed the people of Flint. Its State leadership \nhas demonstrated a contempt and marginalization of the humanity of her \npeople.\n  Who will speak for the marginalized and disenfranchised of the \ncallous disregard for the poor and the most vulnerable?\n  Well, tonight and every night across this Nation Americans are \nstanding up to say that this cannot be tolerated, that justice is due, \nthat we have to speak out for the vulnerable communities, often \nminority and impoverished, that are victims of environmental injustice.\n  We must stand firm in our resolve to see that the people of Flint are \ndealt with in a humane manner, that their lives are enhanced by a quick \nremedy to what they are currently experiencing.\n  The malaise, the laid-back way in which people--in particular, the \nGovernor and his administration--are dealing with this crisis leaves \nall of us uneasy.\n  You have heard from my colleagues this evening about the impact of \nlead on the brains of developing children. You have heard about how \nlead impacts the health of those with compromised immune systems.\n  We are also hearing about other contagions within the waters of the \nFlint River maybe even being tied to Legionnaires' disease. We will \ncontinue to see health crises emerge as more and more is discovered \nabout actually what is in the Flint River.\n  We have also been told that the level of lead within this water is so \nover the top that the filtration systems that have been given to the \npeople are no longer capable of providing them with a safe source of \nwater.\n  So it is now up to Governor Snyder to do right by his own people, to \nstand up and to do what is right by the people of Flint, Michigan. The \neffects of what has taken place in Flint will be effects that will be \nfelt and experienced by the people of Flint, Michigan, now and into the \nyears to come.\n  It is our sincere hope that the Governor and his team will do right \nby the people of Flint, Michigan, and, by extension, the people of the \nUnited States by moving swiftly to apply the resources of Michigan to \nthe mitigation of this problem as well as to make sure that every life, \nevery soul, that has been impacted by the poisonous water that they \nhave consumed will be taken care of today and for the rest of their \nlives.\n  So I thank Bonnie Watson Coleman for her leadership this evening. I \nthank all of my colleagues for standing up, for speaking out, for being \nconsistent, in demanding that this Governor do right by his people, \nthat he come out with a plan immediately to direct the resources needed \nto fix this problem, and to address the illness that is ultimately \ngoing to be a part of the lives of a significant portion of this \npopulation for the rest of their lives. It is the right thing to do.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Thank you very much to the Congresswoman.\n  Madam Speaker, could you tell me how much time I have left.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Very quickly, I would like to acknowledge the \nfact that Congressman John Conyers of the 13th District of Michigan was \nhere and has left a statement, which I will submit, with regard to this \nissue and the fact that he visited Flint, Michigan, just the other day.\n  I also want to just state two things very briefly, number one, \nsomething that Congresswoman Clarke spoke to, which is that these are \npermanent concerns that we have. This impairment that has taken place \nas a result of exposure to lead is something that these young people \nwill carry the rest of their lives.\n  It is not just what we are going to do about trying to educate them \nnow. It is how we are going to address this as they move through \nadulthood and how that impacts their ability to take care of their \nlives and to have careers, to be responsible.\n  So I do hope that the Governor does, indeed, do the investigations \nand the work that he needs to do in order to address these issues \nimmediately. I hope the Federal Government does the kind of \ninvestigation of everybody included in this situation, including the \nGovernor, to see just why this had to happen in the first place.\n  Finally, I yield to the eloquent and vivacious and ever-ready \nCongresswoman from the great State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, may I have the time remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman for her \ngenerosity, and let me, first of all, thank her for leading the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus.\n  I understand she is due a recognition, of which I celebrate, that she \nwill have shortly. But let me thank her for her astuteness about state \ngovernment.\n  You come from state government. You understand oversight. You \nunderstand the responsibilities. You are the right person to lead this \nparticular Special Order.\n  Madam Speaker, it is important today to say that I fully support the \nproposed supportive services that have been accounted or recounted by \nCongressman Kildee, Congresswoman Lawrence, and Congressman Scott, who \nis the ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. \nWe must embrace and surround those children.\n\n  I must say it again. I said it earlier. For those of us who remember \nJim Jones, who left California and gave a poisonous concoction to \nchildren in a foreign country, we have a Jim Jones in Michigan giving a \npoisonous concoction to the children of Flint, Michigan.\n  So we are obviously upset about this, and we want the services to be \nprovided for children, who are innocent.\n  But, at the same time, wearing a hat that deals with the law and law \nand order, I must make the argument that there has to be a criminal \ninvestigation.\n\n[[Page H547]]\n\n  Let me applaud the Department of Justice because I sent a letter \nJanuary 14, 2016, to ask the Department of Justice to immediately \ninvestigate the actions of State officials in Michigan. They are \nactively engaged. The FBI is actively engaged, and their work is not \nfor naught.\n  Let me give you an example, Madam Speaker, very quickly. The Governor \nwas asked to release his e-mails. Part of what he released was this \nblack, redacted pages of information.\n  He released some other materials that I think are telling. Here we \nare: ``We need Treasury to work with Dan in Flint on a clear side by \nside comparison of the health benefits and costs of GLWA [Great Lakes \nWater Authority] vs. a more optimized Flint system.''\n  But here's the real key: ``Also, we need to look at what financing \nmechanisms are available to Flint to pay for any higher cost actions.''\n  Madam Speaker, the Governor of the State of Michigan is sitting on $1 \nbillion. Yet, he is asking a city that is near bankruptcy, controlled \nby an emergency manager under a State law that was rejected by the \npeople of Michigan, to find out how they can pay for better water. They \nhave no money to pay for better water.\n  But let me tell you what they did. Instead of helping Flint pay for \nbetter water, helping them have a plan for anticorrosion, they paid an \nemergency manager under a law that was rejected by the voters of \nMichigan.\n  This individual led the Detroit's Public Schools as an emergency \nmanager. I am told that that was literally brought to collapse. He was \npaid $180,000. Well, he didn't do that well enough that they wanted to \ngive him $221,000.\n  Let me say this. The emergency manager payment for the city of \nFlint--let me correct that--was $180,000. When he did it for Detroit's \nPublic Schools, that came to near collapse. It was $221,000.\n  From my perspective, there is much here that warrants a criminal \ninvestigation.\n  Let me add to the point. On April 25, 2014, the city switches its \nwater supply. Let me be very clear. The city leaders--I served on city \ncouncil--had no authority because the emergency manager was in place.\n  Did the emergency manager have an anticorrosion plan? No.\n  Did they test the water when they opted to go cheap and save $5 \nmillion and go into the Flint River? No.\n  The city switches its water supply, because of money, from a Detroit \nsystem that works. The switch was made as a cost-saving measure for the \nstruggling majority-Black city of Flint.\n  Soon after, residents began to complain about the water's color, \ntaste, odor, and to report rashes and concerns about bacteria.\n  In August and September 2014, city officials suggested that they boil \nthe water, the complete wrong thing to do.\n  They did not have a plan for anticorrosion. They did not follow the \nFederal law that indicated that you had to put phosphate, an \nanticorrosive element, into the water. So it continued to deteriorate \nand deteriorate.\n  Guess what, Madam Speaker, and my colleagues. The emergency manager \nwas never a scientist. It was not someone who said: Let me test the \nwater before I order citizens to drink the water.\n  That sounds to me like there is culpability and criminal culpability \nbecause lives have been endangered. And so I am looking forward to the \nattorney general of Michigan coming in, just as the Governor should, \nand looking forward to a thorough investigation, Madam Speaker, that \nwill find some relief.\n  My final point, Madam Speaker, is to say that the Governor is \nculpable. The Governor right now needs to go into his rainy day fund \nand provide the full funding requested by Mr. Kildee and all others to \nfix the Flint water system.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my neighbors \nin Flint, Michigan, who are facing one of the greatest disasters in \nAmerican history. We cannot erase their pain. But I know that I stand \nwith my colleagues in saying we will do everything in our power to help \nthem recover and help make sure it never happens again.\n  The sort of regulatory neglect that has brought Flint to its knees \nhas a well-known disparate impact on urban, low-income, and minority \ncommunities. Residents who cannot afford to move to suburbs and \nwealthier neighborhoods, or who do not want to leave their longtime \ncommunities, are treated as second-class citizens. Here in Michigan, \nthe twofold combination of negligent environmental protection and \nunderinvestment in infrastructure is forcing those in underserved \ncommunities to pay with their health and lives.\n  We see this in places like Detroit, where 8% of children have \nelevated blood levels--16 times the national average according to the \nCenters for Disease Control. We see it in places like Flint, where an \nunelected emergency manager switched the city's water to an unsafe, \nuntreated source, which has exposed tens of thousands of residents to \ntoxic lead levels.\n  Exposure to lead--a potent neurotoxin--carries lifelong consequences. \nFlint parents must now raise children who face lifelong developmental \nand behavioral challenges, cover economic costs their city cannot \nafford, and confront mounting medical bills that cannot undo the harm \nthey have suffered. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. But they \nneed more than that--they need action.\n  It has become an all too common tale that whenever an urban or low-\nincome community's water or air quality is in question, risks to the \nhealth and safety of its residents are ignored. This must stop. \nUnderserved communities generally face so-called ``acceptable'' risks \nthat no other community or suburb would ever accept--or be asked to \naccept. This must stop. In Flint, the decision was made by someone they \nnever voted for and approved by someone who did not care that it might \nlead to toxic exposure for city's residents. This must stop.\n  The time when apologies and resignations would suffice has passed. \nThe disregard for the health and safety of our neighbors in Flint will \nmean massive, heartbreaking consequences for those affected and their \ncity. Anything less than a transformative, lasting shift in the \nMichigan Department of Environmental Quality and Michigan's other \nregulatory bodies--from panderers to guardians--simply adds insult to \ninjury. We are not dealing with isolated events of negligence. There is \na pattern and practice of disregard for the quality of our air and \nwater that has become intolerable, and we will not settle for mere \nassurances to do better.\n  Unfortunately, it appears those responsible for Flint are more \nfocused on surviving the scandal than fixing the problem. Governor \nSnyder has said he is sorry but he's only offering half measures: free \nwater that they cannot drink anyway, a fraction of what is needed to \nfix Flint's plumbing, and resources that cannot possibly overcome the \nhealth impacts of lead exposure. It appears the only time he thinks \nMichigan, the City of Flint, and the federal government should work \ntogether is when it is time to apportion blame, or when it is time to \ndo everything he says on his terms.\n  But we know how that story ends. It is time for those of us in \nCongress who care about a safe environment more than the business \nenvironment to act. That means directing federal resources to help \nFlint recover and rebuild, figuring out exactly what went wrong, and \nensuring that this never happens again.\n  Fixing this problem starts with providing government services that \nwill actually help these people heal. Especially the children so they \ncan succeed in life--which means a proper education, comprehensive \nhealthcare, and access to everything a child in a wealthy community \nwould have if they were similarly exposed. It means repairing the \ninfrastructure, so that they can have clean water again.\n  Preventing this from happening in the future starts with \nstrengthening--not cutting--our enforcement capacity. It means \neliminating emergency management programs that cut government \nregardless of the cost and strip citizens of their democratic rights. \nIt means stopping with the idea that a small government is a good \ngovernment, and it means stopping efforts to undermine our government \nby cutting its budgets to the bone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H547-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H547-H549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING ABIT MASSEY FOR RECEIVING THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA \n                           PRESIDENT'S MEDAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate \nAbit Massey on receiving the prestigious University of Georgia \nPresident's Award in recognition of his extraordinary service to UGA \nand the State of Georgia.\n  Abit is an institution in Georgia. He has served as the head of the \nGeorgia Department of Commerce, the UGA Alumni Association, and on the \nboard of the Georgia Research Foundation,\n\n[[Page H548]]\n\namong numerous other prestigious positions.\n  In my part of the world, Abit is better known as the dean of the \npoultry industry due to his tireless commitment to and advocacy on \nbehalf of the industry. Abit served as the executive director of the \nGeorgia Poultry Federation for almost 50 years and now serves as its \npresident emeritus.\n  One of the most amazing things about Abit is that not only does \neveryone know him, but everyone respects him. He is the dean of the \nState lobbyists at the Georgia Capitol, but he still makes time to say \nhello to everyone he meets and often greets them by name because his \nmemory never forgets anyone.\n  Abit's service to Georgia and commitment to the State is obvious, but \nI am glad to see UGA recognize that service through bestowing him the \nPresident's Award. I am honored to recognize this great Georgian and \nhope he continues to work to improve future generations of Georgians.\n\n\n                       English Language Unity Act\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 997, the English Language Unity Act, introduced by my friend, Mr. \nKing, from Iowa. I am a proud cosponsor of this important and \ncommonsense bill.\n  The English Language Unity Act establishes English as the official \nlanguage of the United States, requires all official functions of the \nUnited States to be conducted in English, and establishes a uniform \nlanguage requirement for naturalization.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  A common language creates a shared bond. It strengthens our shared \ncultural fabric and identity. English as the official language does not \nmean other languages cannot be spoken. It simply recognizes that \nofficially. We speak the language already spoken and shared by the vast \nmajority of the country.\n  Failure to have a national language can create costly and burdensome \ntranslation requirements and create legal confusion. It can also hinder \nnew citizens from assimilating quickly.\n  The diversity of the United States is one of our strengths. We should \ncontinue to celebrate the many cultures that make up our melting pot. \nThis great country gives us the freedom to share our differences. But \nat the end of the day, we are one Nation and one people. And as one \nNation, we should speak with one tongue when conducting official \nbusiness.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the English Language \nUnity Act.\n\n\n              Honoring Dan Summer of Gainesville, Georgia\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I \nrise to pay honor to a friend and a colleague, Mr. Dan Summer. Dan was \nan attorney in Gainesville. As a young attorney just getting started, \nhe was one of the people that I could turn to and ask questions of. He \nwas somebody who listened. He was somebody who cared.\n  Dan and his wife, Chandelle, ran a firm. Everyone in Gainesville knew \nthat if you went to them, you are going to get treated like family and \nhave somebody that takes not only the fight for your justice and for \nyour fairness, but makes it very personal.\n  When Dan passed away recently, he fought all the way to the end. ALS \ntook him from us, but his memory is strong.\n  What he has meant to Georgia and the legal community will go on for \nmany generations. He is one that stood up for rights. Many times when \nothers may have disagreed, Dan always stood up for the rights of \nothers. Dan was always making it his business to be the protector of \nthose in need. Dan Summer is who make Gainesville, Georgia. It is \npeople like Dan Summer; his character, his loving kindness, and his \nsmile.\n  I remember one of the last times that I saw Dan, it was a little bit \nago. He was walking across the Square in Gainesville. I pulled up, and \nI saw him walking across. I yelled: Hello, and the first thing he did \nwas turn around. And I saw that smile. It is Dan's smile, his concern, \nand his life that will be remembered.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would encourage all of us to strive for what is better \nin us. Dan Summer is one of those people that meant the world to me. \nHis family will experience this loss, but I know they will continue to \nrelish the love that he gave to not only his family but to his \ncommunity. With that, I remember Dan Summer.\n\n\n              Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Life. Liberty. The pursuit of happiness. Mr. \nSpeaker, in the United States Constitution, our Founders cast their \nvision for our Nation whose members would enjoy unparalleled freedom \nbecause of these basic truths.\n  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, today, \nmany have lost the pursuit of happiness in favor of the guarantee of \nhappiness. They are mistaking what we have as a guarantee in that \npursuit of happiness. These Founding Fathers believed in individual \nworth and individual rights. While the challenging realities faced by \ncitizens of nations that prey on individual and economic liberties \nsometimes remind us of the particular blessings we enjoy, we take these \nrights so often for granted.\n  I believe one of the things that is beginning to pervade our society \ntoday, Mr. Speaker, is a society that does not value life or liberty or \nthe pursuit of happiness. In fact, I believe there is an anti-life \nculture that is developing, one that does not value the personhood that \ncomes at conception and ends at natural death, the one that says that \nwe are made by God in His image, and we have infinite value not based \non who we are, but based on the fact that He breathed life into us. It \nis an abortion culture, an ending culture, that we are being strangled \nwith in the United States.\n  Abortion is literally killing generations of promise in our country. \nBut yet we have some who really just want to turn their back. They \nbelieve it is a choice.\n  I am so glad, Mr. Speaker, that your family didn't view it that way \nand my family didn't view it that way. Because when you look at life, \nyou take life as God has given it to us. And it is only up to Him, who \ngives life, the Maker and Creator of life, that determines the \npotential and the possibilities. Whatever path we go on, He has given \nus that hope.\n  In my own family, this became very real for me. I have had many years \nof pastoring, but it happened back in 1992. You see, there was a young \nyouth minister and his wife excited about the news that they were going \nto be parents. Everything was great. Everything was moving along. They \nwere working. They were doing everything that they thought that they \nwere supposed to be doing, until one day my bride called me and said: \nLet's do an ultrasound. We have one last ultrasound. The doctor wants \nto do one last ultrasound.\n  I came running back. I was off on a business trip. I got back just in \ntime to get there. They were doing the ultrasound. Ultrasounds are \namazing because they show life--not a fetus, not a blob--they show a \nlife in the womb. It starts when God breathes it in. If you don't \nbelieve me, just take a look.\n  Even back then when they started to go around, I could see my child \nwhom I had not had a chance to meet yet. Then a little bit later, the \nnurse stopped. She said: I need to go get the doctor. At that point my \nwife looked at me, and she said: Something is wrong. Tears started \ncoming down her face.\n  I said: Sweetheart, they are just going to get the doctor. He is just \ngoing to look at it. It is all good. She said: No, something is wrong.\n  It came back. The doctor looked and said: I need to show you \nsomething.\n  On a little spot, a little white spot that I could have not told the \ndifference of, the doctor told us the words that have now rung for me \nfor almost 23 years. He said: Doug, Lisa, your baby has spinal bifida. \nHe actually used a big term called myelomeningocele. All I knew was \nsomething was wrong.\n  We spent the next few days in sort of disbelief. We knew this was not \na mistake. We knew this was not anything except we were supposed to \nhave a child, and, undoubtedly, this was just going to be a little \ndifferent. We talked to doctors, and we found out it just continued on.\n  Then one day, Lisa went back to school after it had become known that \nwe were having an issue and the pregnancy was now going to be high \nrisk. One of the teachers came up to Lisa and said: You know you have a \nchoice. Lisa looked at her and said: Well, we\n\n[[Page H549]]\n\nare going to Atlanta, and we are going to have the baby in Atlanta. She \nsaid: No, no, no. You have a choice. You don't have to keep going.\n  At that point, it clicked. This teacher was telling my wife that she \ncould kill my baby. Lisa realized it real quickly. Lisa said: You \nrealize you are talking about my child.\n  When I hear of Planned Parenthood cavalierly talking about a choice \nto kill a baby, it is horrifying.\n  In this body, the reconciliation is addressed that we are going to \ncontinue to because there was a choice made this week. You had a chance \nto vote for life, and if you voted ``no,'' you voted against life. \nDon't try to make it any other thing.\n  The country has a choice coming up this year. It can take a culture \nof life from conception to death, natural death, or it can continue to \nvalue life, as man does, as throwaway, as maybe not good. You see, \nprioritizing and saying this is what we believe is what makes this \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness worth pursuing.\n  They told us that Jordan would have trouble. I actually had somebody \none time in a town hall say: Well, her quality of life may not be good. \nYou may have done her a disservice. I choked back my angry tears, and I \nsaid: You don't know my daughter.\n  You see, it is that time of the year when elections come around. My \ndaughter just got back home from her job skills training. She is \nlooking for a job. She is 23 years old. She is back home. She is going \nout to find where she can make a place in this world. She has a smile \nthat will light up a room. Her little chair whips around faster than \nyou can imagine.\n  I was thinking about even my own election, and my wife looked at me \nthe other night, and she said: You know, you realize you got something \ncoming up this year. I said: What's that? She said: Your secret weapon \ncomes home on Friday. She is daddy's girl.\n  You see, life is what you make it. Life is not what somebody else \nsays your life is.\n  When we have a culture of life, abortion is an abomination to that \nculture of life. It is why we need to continue every day to put forward \na culture of life on this world, Mr. Speaker. It is why we will \ncontinue to put forward a culture of life that says we value all.\n  When we do that, no one has to ask where Doug Collins stands. Doug \nCollins stands with life. Doug Collins stands with those of all. \nBecause I am one who believes that no matter who you see in a day, Mr. \nSpeaker, when you look into their eyes, you see someone of infinite \nworth, of infinite value, not because of anything they have done, but \nbecause of the life that was put into them by their Creator.\n  It is abortion that takes that away. It is why I will continue to \ncome to this floor as many times as I possibly can and stand for life \nbecause that is the life, the liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \nthat our Founders spoke of.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H549-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H549-H554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RESTORING ARTICLE I AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) is \nrecognized for the reminder of the hour as the designee of the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to be recognized to \naddress you here on the floor of the United States House of \nRepresentatives. I appreciate your attention to these matters that come \nbefore the House and the House Members that are in attendance, \nobserving in their office, and all the staff people around.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is important that we carry these messages out. I come \nto the floor tonight to raise a topic that is important to all \nAmericans, especially the Americans who take our Constitution \nseriously, and even more importantly, those Americans who have taken an \noath to support and defend the Constitution, and that would include all \nof our servicemen and -women along with many law enforcement officers \nand officers of the article III courts, the entire House of \nRepresentatives, the entire United States Senate, and, to my knowledge, \nthe entire body of legislators across the country and the State \nlegislators. I have many times--a number of times--taken an oath to \nsupport and defend our United States Constitution but, in the State \nsenate, also the constitution of the State of Iowa.\n  Our Founding Fathers structured our Constitution so that we would \nhave three branches of government, and some say three equal branches of \ngovernment. I do not completely agree with that assessment, Mr. \nSpeaker. Instead, I contend that the three branches of government were \nseparate, and they are separate. But the judicial branch of government \nwas designed to be the weakest of the three. Our Founding Fathers \nunderstood that there would be competition between the branches of \ngovernment.\n  So as part of this discussion, I would like to announce into the \nRecord here, Mr. Speaker, that our chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nChairman Goodlatte, has initiated a task force--a task force--that is \ndesigned to address the article I overreach of the President of the \nUnited States and the executive branch--not only this President, but \nprevious administrations as well.\n  I appreciate and compliment Chairman Goodlatte for his insight and \nforesight for taking this initiative. I thank him for suggesting and \nthen ratifying today that I will be chairing the Task Force on \nExecutive Overreach. It will be comprised of members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Republicans and Democrats. It will be bipartisan. I had \nhoped that it would be nonpartisan. Judging from some of the tone in \nthe debate today, there could be a little flavor of partisanship in \nthere, Mr. Speaker. That is fine, because that is how we bring about \nour disagreements.\n  In any case, a task force has been set up, and it will function for 6 \nmonths. Some time in August its authorization will either expire or it \nwill be reauthorized and extended for another period of time.\n  The theme is, again, restoring the article I authority of our \nCongress and to address the executive overreach.\n  The circumstances that bring us to this point are myriad. The \nobjectives of the task force, as I would design them, and the object of \na chair of a committee is to bring out the will of the group.\n  I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that the object, the plan, and the \nstrategy is this: First, it is my intention to intake all of the input \nthat we get from Democrats and Republicans from the bipartisan side in \nthe committee and to build a rather expansive list of the executive \noverreach that we have seen from the article II branch of government.\n  I say it that way so that we bring everything into our consideration. \nThen once that expansive list is made, then we will pare it down to \nthose things that can be sustained as the authority of this Congress \nversus the authority of the executive branch of government.\n  I would point out that the executive overreach isn't only about the \nunconstitutional overreaches that have taken place, especially recently \nwithin this administration, but it is also, Mr. Speaker, about the \nconstitutional overreach when a President will act under authority that \nmaybe has been granted to the executive branch of government by the \nlegislative branch of government, or an authority that has been \nexpanded off of an authority that was granted by the United States \nCongress.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  A big piece of this will be the rules and the regulations that are \nthe authority that we have granted to the executive branch of \ngovernment over the Administrative Procedures Act.\n  We know that when the executive branch publishes rules, we have been \ngetting more and more rules that are published. Once they are published \nfor the prescribed amount of time, and the comment periods for the \nprescribed amount of time are allowed and the American public is \nallowed to weigh in, at a certain point they have complied with the \nrequirements of the Administrative Procedures Act and then the rules go \ninto effect. Often the rules that are written by the executive branch \nof government are without the purview of Congress, but they have the \nfull force and effect of law. That is troubling to me.\n  Our Founding Fathers envisioned this. They gave us the republican \nform of government and a constitutional Republic. This constitutional \nRepublic is\n\n[[Page H550]]\n\ndesigned to be a limited government, Mr. Speaker. They didn't envision \nthat the Federal Government would grow to the expansive lengths that it \nhas. They thought that they would be able to keep it in a narrow \nlimited form and that the States would be dealing with the more \ndetailed issues that the Federal Government was not the benefit of.\n  We have the enumerated powers. They intended for us to stay within \nthe enumerated powers. The definitions that have come forward here by \nCongress, they reached out and stretched the limits of the enumerated \npowers.\n  They didn't imagine that there would be speed limits on the dirt \ntrails that had horses and buggies on them, and they didn't imagine \nthat the Federal Government would be subsidizing roads in a way that \nwould allow the Federal Government to set speed limits across this \ncountry. That is an example of events that have given the Federal \nGovernment--this Congress--some authority tied to the dollars that our \nFounding Fathers didn't envision, and it is one that I think simply we \ncan understand.\n  There is a proper role for the Federal Government. There is a proper \nrole in requiring conditions that go along with Federal dollars. I \nillustrate that point, though, to illustrate how far we have diverged \nfrom the intent of our Founding Fathers.\n  As our Founding Fathers framed the Constitution and established that \nall laws would be passed here in the United States Congress and not by \nthe executive branch of government and not by the judicial branch of \ngovernment, that separation of powers was envisioned to be this: \nCongress has the legislative authority. It is article I. It is article \nI for a reason, because the voice and the power of the people is vested \nin this Congress.\n  Our Founding Fathers envisioned that the policy would come forth here \nfrom the various populations of the Thirteen Original Colonies and the \nStates that later joined. Today, if we applied the vision of the \nFounding Fathers, we would look at 50 States and the territories, and \nwe would imagine that there are--and this is simply close to a fact--\n320 million people across those 50 States and the territories.\n  Out of those 320 million people would be generated ideas. There would \nbe grievances that would be brought forward and brought to the \nRepresentatives of Congress, and there would be ideas generated to \nsolve the various problems that we have in our country. There might be \na consensus that might be formed what the tax rates should be, what the \ndebt burden should be allowed to be, what the size of government should \nbe allowed to be, and what kind of policies might come out of this \nCongress. Our Founding Fathers envisioned that.\n  They envisioned then that the voice of the people would be \ntransferred and translated up through and out of the population into \nthe mind and the heart, any activity of their elected representative.\n  They envisioned also that, out of the corners of the country, the \nThirteen Original Colonies--and now from as far away as Guam to \nWashington, D.C., the corners of the United States, Alaska to Hawaii, \nto Florida, to Maine, and down to California certainly--that all of the \nideas within that would have to compete with other ideas, and that \ntheir elected representatives in this republican form of government \nthat is guaranteed in our Constitution would bring the best of those \nideas. Not all of them, not the clutter of bad ideas, but sort the \nclutter of the ideas so that just the cream of the crop, the best \nideas, would come from the corners of the United States and be brought \nhere into this Congress, that an individual Member of Congress, one of \nthe 435, would bring those ideas into the competition of the ideas of \nthe marketplace here.\n  The ideas of the marketplace here would have to compete against each \nother. Of the now 435 Members, there would be various ideas that would \ncompete with other ideas. The best ideas that could develop the \nconsensus out of the voice of the people would be sorted here in this \nCongress, and we would advance those ideas that reflected the will of \n``we the people.'' That is the vision of this republican form of \ngovernment. That is the vision that required that the Congress be \nestablished by article I.\n  The vision for article II was that the executive branch would be \nheaded by a President of the United States, who is the Commander in \nChief of our Armed Forces. We wouldn't have any Armed Forces if it \nweren't for Congress having the enumerated power to establish a \nmilitary--an Army, a Navy, and, subsequent to that, an Air Force.\n  So the Founding Fathers envisioned the executive branch and the \nPresident of the United States--the President, specifically, the \nCommander in Chief of our Armed Forces--and that his oath is to \npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States--\nthat is the oath, so help him, God, today, as is in his oath, although \nit wasn't in the original oath--and that he take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed. That is the Take Care Clause.\n  Some of us say somewhat facetiously that the President of the United \nStates took that wrong and decided to execute the Constitution instead \nof taking care that the laws be faithfully executed. That is something \nthat we will debate and discuss in the task force that addresses the \nexecutive overreach, Mr. Speaker.\n  Our Founding Fathers also established article III, which is the \ncourts. I will speak to that briefly in this segment, Mr. Speaker, \nbecause most of the focus of this task force is on the executive \noverreach. We do need to look into the judicial overreach as well. I \nbelieve that there is an effort to give that a review as well. But the \nConstitution requires that there be a Supreme Court, that they \nestablish a Supreme Court, and then the various other courts are at the \ndiscretion of Congress.\n  I have made this argument to Justice Scalia in somewhat a semiformal \nsetting--I might say an informal setting--a few years ago. I would \nargue that under the Constitution, if you read article III, the only \ncourt that is required by the Constitution is the Supreme Court. It is \nrequired that it be led and headed by a Chief Justice.\n  As you look at the language in the Constitution, I argued that the \nSupreme Court is not required to be--well, first of all, there are no \nother Federal courts that are required. The authority to establish them \nis granted in article III to Congress. Congress could develop all the \nFederal courts that they choose to, or they could decide to, \nessentially, abolish any of the Federal districts. In theory, at least, \nthey could abolish all the Federal districts.\n\n  The only Federal Court that is required under the Constitution is the \nSupreme Court. Under constitutional authority, Congress could eliminate \nand reduce the Federal Court system all the way down to the Supreme \nCourt. There is no requirement that there be nine Justices or seven or \nfive or three. There is a requirement that there be a Chief Justice.\n  In the end, if Congress wanted to control the judicial branch, they \ncould reduce their judicial branch down to the Chief Justice, and he is \nnot required to have a Supreme Court building or a budget. They could \nreduce the Chief Justice down to himself or herself, as the case may \nbe, with his own card table, with his own candle, and no staff. That is \nhow narrow and small the judicial branch of government could be if \nCongress decided to utilize its constitutional authority.\n  Of course, we don't do that. But there is a history of two judicial \nFederal districts being abolished by this Congress back in about 1802. \nIt was debated in the House and the Senate and successfully eliminated \na couple of Federal districts--I don't suggest that we do that at all, \nMr. Speaker, for those who would get on their Twitter account--\nillustrating the function of the Constitution itself. But the judicial \nbranch of government has now defined it down to that. It explains that \nthe third branch, article III, the third branch of government, was not \ndesigned to be a coequal branch of government. It was designed to be \nthe weakest of the three branches of government.\n  Then Marbury v. Madison came along that established judicial review, \nand off we are to the races and the growth of the judicial branch of \ngovernment. That can be shrunk or it can be allowed to grow, and its \ninfluence can be allowed to grow or it could be shrunk.\n  But I would make the point, Mr. Speaker, that it isn't only the \nSupreme Court that weighs in on what the Constitution says. It is each \none of us here\n\n[[Page H551]]\n\nin this Chamber and each Senator down at the other end of the United \nStates Capitol Building. We all have our obligation to interpret the \nConstitution because we all take an oath to uphold it.\n  We are not taking an oath to uphold it the way the Supreme Court \nwould amend it. In fact, the nine Justices of the Supreme Court--or \nfive, as the case may be--are the last people on the planet who should \nbe amending the Constitution of the United States. Whether it is a \nliteral amendment or whether it is a de facto amendment is what has \ntaken place with regard to the Obergefell case, for example, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  The judicial branch of government, article III, is designed to be the \nweakest of the three branches of government. If it stayed that way or \nif it becomes that again, we still have the conflict, the struggle for \npower that is going on between article I, the Congress; article II, the \nPresident and the executive branch; article III, the courts; and that \nstatic balance that is there between the three branches of government. \nThere is a little tug-of-war going on for the balance between each of \nthose branches of government.\n  Our Founding Fathers envisioned that it would be impossible to \nprecisely define the differences, the power structure, among the three \nbranches of government. They did, I think, a really good job given the \nlimits of language and imagination, and also the limits of not having a \ncomplete crystal ball on what would happen here in this country. But \nthey understood that even though they defined it as precisely as I \nthink was humanly possible in that period of time, or even now today, \nthey understood that each branch of government would jealously protect \nthe authority granted to it within its particular article within the \nConstitution.\n  For a long time that is what happened. Even now we have debates about \nwhat authority the Congress has versus what authority the President \nhas. That is the heart of the executive overreach task force that was \nestablished today in the Judiciary Committee, I would say the \nbrainchild of Chairman Goodlatte.\n  I don't believe that the Congress has done a very good job of \ndefending and jealously protecting its constitutional authority. It \nstarted a long time ago--someone today said 100 years ago--as Congress \nbegan delegating authority to the executive branch of government. It \nwas accelerated with the passage of the Administrative Procedures Act, \nwhich sets out the parameters for the executive branch of government to \nwrite the rules and regulations that have the full force and effect of \nlaw.\n  That came about, I think, Mr. Speaker, because this Congress was \noverwhelmed with all of the functions of a growing Federal Government. \nThe various committees and the various task forces that are established \nhere in this Congress grew and emerged out of the duties that this \nCongress recognized.\n  But at a certain point, Congress was bogged down with the details of \ngoverning. Willingly, to take some of that workload off of their back, \nthey delegated it to the executive branch of government. In doing so, \nthey had to delegate authority to the executive branch of government, \ntoo.\n  Not only was it the workload, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, but it also \nwas sometimes the political heat that is required to do the right \nthing. I have seen this in the State legislature, and I have seen this \nin Congress multiple times. Issues come up. You can't reach agreement. \nOne side or the other is scoring political points, sometimes it is both \nsides scoring political points, and the heat of that gets so great \nsometimes it brings about a decision here. But also, the heat of that \nmight cause the legislative branch of government to pass that \nresponsibility over to the executive branch, take the heat off, and let \nthem make the decision.\n  The result of executive decisions taking authority might be--let me \npick an example--the waters of the United States rule, where this \nexecutive branch, during the terms of this President, President Obama, \ndecided that they wanted to regulate a lot more of the real estate in \nthe United States of America. I looked back at a time in about 1992 \nwhen I saw another effort to do the same thing as there was a \ndesignation in my State that was driven by the EPA to designate 115 \nstreams in Iowa as protected streams.\n  Looking at that list of protected streams, I began wondering why \nwould they call some drainage ditches protected streams. I read down \nthrough the rule. In there, it said, in order to preserve the natural \nriparian beauty, these streams, according to their geographically \ndefined boundaries in the rule--which I never actually saw the \ngeographically defined boundaries. They just said they were there. I \ndon't know that they were. But according to their geographically \ndefined boundaries, these streams shall be protected streams, and these \nstreams and waters hydrologically connected to them. I will put that in \nquotes, Mr. Speaker, ``and waters hydrologically connected to them.''\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  When I read the language and I saw that that was the rule that was \npublished, I began to go and deliver the public comment.\n  I asked the representatives of the rule writers: What does \n``hydrologically connected to'' mean?\n  Their answer was: We don't know.\n  And I said: Then take it out of the rule.\n  No. We can't.\n  Do you mean you are representing something, and you do not know what \nit means, but you just know you can't take it out?\n  That's right. We can't take it out. This is the published rule, and \nnow we have to get this rule passed.\n  In any case, that brought about a battle within the State of Iowa. \nEventually, they got the rule in that said these streams and waters \nhydrologically connected to them will be regulated by the regulators \nand that they will decide what practices the rightful property owner \ncan implement on that real estate that they have now defined to be \nwithin the regulation of the government. The phrase ``waters \nhydrologically connected to'' thereby became the target of years and \nyears of litigation--of, perhaps, nearly 20 years of litigation or of \nmaybe even more than 20 years of litigation. I guess we would be at 25 \nor so years of litigation.\n  Finally, the courts concluded that the phrase ``hydrologically \nconnected to'' was too vague to be able to enforce it, and the \ncollection--the menagerie--of the article III Court's ruling on an \ninitiative that was brought forward by the executive branch of \ngovernment that was not the intention of the legislative branch of \ngovernment tied all three branches of government together in confusion \nthat eroded the property rights of people who were guaranteed those \nproperty rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n  All of that was being litigated through that period of time when we \nsaw the Kelo decision when the Court decided they could amend the \nConstitution, and the minority opinion was written by Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor. I stood on this floor and almost unknowingly quoted her \nminority opinion because we had come to the same conclusion \nindependently that the Court had taken three words out of the Fifth \nAmendment, and those three words were ``for public use.'' So now, \neffectively, the Fifth Amendment reads: nor shall private property be \ntaken without just compensation.\n  We know a little about that debate taking place in the Presidential \nrace because we have a candidate who believes that that is the right \nthing--to take people's private property for private use if you can \nconvince the government that would be confiscating it, that it is of \nbetter use if it pays more taxes. I disagree with that, Mr. Speaker, \nand I believe that the Kelo decision will be reversed one day when we \nappoint constitutionalists to the judicial branch of government. I \nbelieve also in the result of that, over a period of time, if we get \nthe right President who will make the right appointments to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  What I have illustrated here is how the three branches of government \ncan get involved in a convoluted conflict, and in that convoluted \nconflict, the tension between the three branches of government was \ndesigned to get sorted out so that we would be back to the \nConstitution, itself, and that the Constitution would rule. But when \nthe Supreme Court effectively strikes three words out of the Fifth \nAmendment to our Constitution, then we have the Court's ruling without \nthe will of the people, and the will of the people is\n\n[[Page H552]]\n\ngoing to be reflected through, especially and first, the House of \nRepresentatives--the quick reaction strike force. There is a reason we \nall take the oath to uphold the Constitution. It is so we understand \nit, and we define it. We take our oath seriously, and we defend it.\n  In the other two parts of that, when you had an executive branch that \ninitiated a policy--protected streams--that wasn't the initiative of \nthe legislature, then you have a superlegislature outside the purview \nof the legislative body. My detractors will turn around and say: But \nany rule that is passed can be nullified by the United States Congress. \nSo why do you worry about that? Why don't you just do your job in \nCongress and nullify the rules if you don't like them? Mr. Speaker, it \nworks a little bit differently than that, of course, especially when \nyou have a President of the United States who will veto that \nlegislation that would be nullifying the rule; so we are back into the \ncircle again.\n  If the President initiates a rule without regard to whether there is \na court ruling on that rule, the legislature then would be obligated to \nnullify the rule. The difficulty of that is it takes a supermajority \nhere then to undo something that appointed--but not elected--executive \nbranch officials have initiated often without the knowledge of the \nPresident of the United States, himself. That is an upside-down way to \nget things done.\n  It is supposed to be and is designed to be the will of the people--\nthe voice of the people--of the United States. They initiate the \npolicy. They send that policy up through Congress. Congress is to bring \nit before our committees. It evaluates the various ideas, competes, and \ndebates those ideas. It votes them through the various subcommittees \nand committees after having hearings so that the public can see what is \ngoing on--all out in the open, all out in the sunlight. We bring it \nhere to the floor of the Congress and vote on it; and if the Senate \nagrees, it becomes law. There was not designed to be a superlegislature \nwithin the executive branch; but, Mr. Speaker, that is what we have \ntoday. We have thousands and thousands of pages of regulations that are \ninitiated by a robust executive branch of government.\n  I expect that, in the duration of this administration, as we have \nheard from the President of the United States, he intends to make his \ndays count as we count down to the end of his Presidency. I take him at \nhis word. He has had a robust approach to stretching the limits of the \nexecutive branch of government throughout all of his time in office. \nNow he is sitting in a place where he has the appropriations he needs \nfor the functioning of the Federal Government all the way up until \nSeptember 30. By September 30, this Congress is going to be in a place \nwhere they are seeing the last weeks of a Presidential campaign play \nthemselves out in October and then in early November. So we are \nprobably right at 5 weeks. Let's see. Five weeks from the end of the \nfiscal year will be the vote for the Presidency, and absentee balloting \nwill be taking place at the same time.\n  The President of the United States has all of the levers that he \nneeds, he has got all of the tools that he needs, and he has got the \nfunding that he needs. He also has the robust idea that the executive \nbranch of government should be stronger, not weaker, and that it should \ndo more, not less. If we wonder about that, Mr. Speaker, we can look \naround at some of the President's actions and those of the executive \nbranch of government that I take great issue with. Many of them are \ntied up in the development, in the implementation, of ObamaCare.\n  ObamaCare, itself, Mr. Speaker, was legislation that was passed by \nhook, by crook, by legislative shenanigan. March 22, 2010, was the \nfinal passage, and it was a sad day for America because the will of the \npeople was not reflected in this Congress that day. It was a dramatic \ntime to be here. Those who will argue will say: Oh, the House passed \nthis legislation, and the Senate passed this legislation, and it \nactually was a function of the legislative body. I repeat again--hook, \ncrook, legislative shenanigan. It is not only I who says that, Mr. \nSpeaker. There have been Democrats who have voiced the same thing, but \nthere are far fewer of them these days as a result of force-feeding \nObamaCare to the United States Congress.\n\n  As the President began implementing ObamaCare, he began changing the \nlaw. He made some changes along the way. For example, the employer \nmandate was delayed. The individual mandate was delayed. Some of it was \nlitigated over to the Supreme Court. Some of these changes were not. He \ndecided which components of the law he wanted to ignore and which ones \nhe wanted to enforce. He took an oath, though, to take care that the \nlaws be faithfully executed. That is all of them. That is not part of \nthem. Yet, as we went through ObamaCare time after time after time, \nthere were changes made along the way in the implementation and \nenforcement of ObamaCare, and that brought about a great deal of \nconfusion in this country, and it upset a lot of people. It \ndisadvantaged a lot of people, and it advantaged some people.\n  He granted waiver after waiver for his favorite groups and entities \nthat were, I will say, people who were typically considered to be his \nsupporters. I didn't see much relief for the people who were typically \nnot considered to be his supporters, such as the Little Sisters of the \nPoor, for example. They are in the business of having to litigate their \nreligious freedom versus an imposition of the Federal Government's \nthat, under all of their health insurance policies, they are now \ncommanded to fund contraceptives, which violates their religious \nfreedom. By the way, it violates my religious convictions as well. So \nwe have a very robust President who has laid out a whole series of \ndemands not only through ObamaCare legislation, but also we have seen \nthis happen with immigration.\n  The President has said publicly 22 times ``I don't have the \nconstitutional authority to do what you want me to do'' when he has \nbeen talking to illegal immigrants who are in America and are pressing \nthis government to change the policy to accommodate them in the form of \namnesty, which I have described on this floor many times, Mr. Speaker. \nThe President said 22 times: ``I don't have the constitutional \nauthority to do this.''\n  After he was well vented in his position of explaining the \nConstitution right out here at a high school in Washington, D.C., the \nPresident answered a question from one of the students at the high \nschool. He said, ``I used to teach the Constitution,'' which he did for \n10 years as an adjunct professor at the University of Chicago. He \ntaught constitutional law. He said that the job of Congress is to write \nthe laws, that the job of the President and of the executive branch is \nto enforce the laws, and that the job of the judicial branch of \ngovernment is to interpret the laws.\n  I would bring this back to Chief Justice Roberts, who said clearly in \nhis confirmation hearing some years ago that his job as a Justice is to \ncall the balls and strikes. I agreed with that, and it was very \nencouraging to hear that, and I certainly supported his confirmation. \nYet I see that on June 24 of last year--that would be a Thursday--in \nthe opinion on ObamaCare that was written by Chief Justice Roberts, in \na narrow majority opinion where Chief Justice Roberts joined with four \nother Justices, they decided they could write words into ObamaCare, \nitself. ``Or Federal Government'' would be the three words. Maybe the \nthree words they took out of the Fifth Amendment, ``for public use,'' \nthey get to put in a bank somewhere, and when they need to add some \nwords into law, they can just borrow them from that little word bank. \nIf they strike them out of the Constitution, maybe the three words \nwould be left in the word bank, and the Supreme Court could then pull \nthree words out by choice and say, ``or Federal Government.''\n  Now ObamaCare reads, ``an exchange established by the State''--insert \n``or Federal Government.'' Now, that is what happened as to that \ndecision on ObamaCare on June 24, Thursday, the following day. The \nSupreme Court announced that they had created a new command in the \nConstitution. It is not just a new right. Remember, I said the Justices \nof the Supreme Court should be the last people on the planet to amend \nthe Constitution or to discover any new language in it. They are to \ncall the balls and strikes. That is what I agree with, and that is part \nof my oath, to defend the Constitution in\n\n[[Page H553]]\n\nthat fashion. The Supreme Court, instead, inserted those words into \nObamaCare, ``or Federal Government.''\n  The following day, they created a command that says not just that \nthere is a new right to same-sex marriage, Mr. Speaker, but that there \nis a command that, if the States are to conduct or to honor civil \nmarriage, they shall conduct and honor also same-sex marriages without \nregard to the convictions of their people, who no longer enjoy the 10th \nAmendment authority to establish that policy on marriage within the \nStates. The Federal Government took that onto themselves, and they \nissued not just a right to same-sex marriage but a command that \neveryone, especially the States and the political subdivisions thereof, \nshall honor same-sex marriage. That is a breathtaking overreach of the \nSupreme Court. It would be worse than the worst nightmare that any of \nour Founding Fathers ever would have had with regard to the limitations \nof this government.\n  So we are sitting here today with a Federal Government that has been \ndistorted beyond what would be the belief of our Founding Fathers, and \nthey had their share of fears. This Congress needs to reassert itself. \nIt needs to reestablish its constitutional authority. It needs to take \na good, hard look at the article I authority that is vested to it in \nthe Constitution, itself, and recognize that all legislative powers \nexist here in the House and in the Senate. The overreach of the \nexecutive branch takes place sometimes because Congress wanted to take \nthe heat off of us, and we gave that responsibility over to the \nexecutive branch of government. Sometimes the President decides he \nwants to do things outside the bounds of his constitutional authority. \nSometimes it is a mix of the two, and sometimes it is the President who \nenjoys the majority support of his party in the House and/or in the \nSenate. It is more likely that in this Congress that the Members of his \nparty will accept an overreach of a President of their own party than \nthey will an overreach of a President of the opposite party.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  It is also true, Mr. Speaker, that we have different views on what is \nexecutive overreach and what the Constitution says.\n  In fact, in some of the debate today, I said that the Constitution \nhas to mean what it says. The very literal words that are in the \nConstitution have to mean what they say and they have to mean to all of \nus what they were understood to mean at the time of ratification of the \nbase document of the Constitution and, also, of the various amendments \nas we move along through the amendments in the Constitution.\n  We need to have enough history to understand what those amendments \nand what the Constitution meant to the people that ratified it, and \nthen we need to recognize that the Constitution itself is an \nintergenerational guarantee, an intergenerational document signed off \non by our Founding Fathers with their hand and agreed to in an oath to \nthat Constitution by millions of Americans over time.\n  Many of them pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred \nhonor to preserve, support, and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  It is a document that is fixed into the letter of the words that are \nthere in the Constitution and the understanding of those words, not \nliving and breathing, but an intergenerational contractual guarantee \nfrom our Founding Fathers down to our descendants, as far as they shall \ngo to the end of the Republic, should it ever end. I pray it does never \nend as long as this Earth exists.\n  So the multiple generational great-, great-, great- --many times \ngreat-grandfathers all the way to the Founding Fathers said: Here is a \ncontract, and I am going to pass this contract on to the next \ngeneration. The next generation has to preserve, protect, and defend it \nand then pass it to the next generation and the next generation and the \nnext generation.\n  As Ronald Reagan said, freedom is not something that you inherited. \nIt is something that has to be preserved and fought for each generation \nand defended each generation. So if we lose the understanding of what \nthe Constitution means, we also have lost our Constitution itself, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  This task that we have is to preserve this language: ``All \nlegislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States.'' It is simple, pure, beautiful, worth preserving, \nprotecting, fighting for, bleeding for and, if need be, dying for.\n  That is why our honorable and noble military men and women take an \noath to support this Constitution, because it is worth defending. They \nare not defending the President of the United States specifically. They \nare defending this Constitution when they go into battle.\n  We need to defend it here in the House of Representatives. We have a \ntask force now to address the executive overreach and will be defining \nthe unconstitutional overreach. I am willing to accept the President's \ndefinition on the constitutional limitations with regard to \nimmigration.\n  When the President said he doesn't have the authority to establish \nand pass amnesty legislation, I agree with him. It is an enumerated \npower here in this Constitution that is preserved for the Congress to \nestablish a uniform naturalization, and that has been defined by the \ncourts to mean the immigration policies of the United States.\n  If we get this right, we will have a Congress that is empowered more, \nbut also an empowered Congress that is more accountable to we, the \npeople.\n  As Congress steps up and says let's claw that executive overreach \npower back into the House of Representatives and back into the United \nStates Senate, what we are really saying, Mr. Speaker, is let's claw \nthat executive overreach power and authority back here and hand it back \nto we, the people.\n  Now, let's go back and turn our ear to we, the people, so that this \nrepublican form of government that is guaranteed to us in this \nConstitution can gather the best ideas from all across this land and \nbring those ideas here to Washington, D.C., where the ideas compete \nwith each other. The best ideas float to the top like the cream rises \nto the top, and the public can look in and they can weigh in.\n  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, we need more oversight into the executive \nbranch of government. I have drafted and introduced legislation that \naddresses some of this in a way, I will put out here, to perhaps be a \nlittle provocative to start some ideas. Then the competition of ideas, \nthe best ones, as I said, need to float to the top.\n  That would be legislation that does this: It requires of this \nmountain and myriad of regulations that we have that go on in \nperpetuity, that can't be practically reduced or shrunk down or \nnullified by this Congress--as long as the President is willing to veto \na nullification bill and push it back at us, the legislation that I am \nproposing that sunsets all of the regulations over a period of 10 years \nsunsets any new regulation at the end of 10 years and it requires \nCongress to have an affirmative vote before any regulation can have a \nforce and effect of law.\n  We have passed out of the floor of the House here once, perhaps more \nthan that, what we call the REINS Act. This comes from a retired Member \nof Congress, a friend, a former ranger, Jeff Davis of Kentucky, who \ninitiated the legislation that there would be a requirement of an \naffirmative vote of Congress before a regulation that had more than \n$100 million of impact on our economy could take effect.\n  That addresses this. It addresses this going forward with new \nregulation. It doesn't go backward to other regulations. All of the old \nregulations are essentially de facto grandfathered by the REINS Act.\n  The legislation that I had put together before he introduced the \nREINS Act was more detailed. This legislation is called the Sunset Act. \nIt sunsets all regulations, but it sunsets them in increments of 10 \npercent of the regulations from each department each year for 10 years.\n  The departments have to offer up their regulations. They can sort \nwhich ones they want to expose to Congress for a vote over a period of \n10 years. But over 10 years, they have to offer up their regulations \nhere to Congress.\n\n  Congress then evaluates those regulations. Any Member of Congress can \ncome in and offer an amendment to those regulations, maybe an amendment \nto strike, maybe an amendment to add.\n\n[[Page H554]]\n\n  Maybe there are people in this Congress that want more regulations, \nnot less, and they would like to write them into law and affirmatively \nvote them in.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, that idea of sunsetting all regulations--10 \npercent a year for 10 years incrementally--is coupled with the idea of \nsunsetting any new regulation, also, at the end of 10 years and \nrequiring an affirmative vote on any regulation before all new \nregulations of any kind.\n  Doing so then restrains the executive branch of government and makes \nthe legislative branch of government responsible to the people.\n  Our regulators that are writing these rules will know that, if they \nwrite a rule that is egregious to the people, the people that have not \nbeen heard from the executive branch of government, when they go into \nthe office of, say, the EPA and they press their case to Gina McCarthy, \nfor example, and her people, they don't have a motive to listen because \nthey are insulated from the accountability to the people.\n  If they knew that those same individuals that are aggrieved by the \nproposed regulation can come to visit their Member of Congress and \npress their demand on their Member of Congress, they have to know that \nthat Member of Congress will come forward, come down here to the floor \nof the House of Representatives and offer an amendment to strike those \nregulations or amend those regulations so that it is acceptable to we, \nthe people. That is a vision to restrain an overgrowth of the executive \nbranch of government, Mr. Speaker.\n  I advocate that as one of the things to consider, but neither do I \nthink that I have all the good ideas. There are 435 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives and 100 Members of the Senate. There are good \nideas that come into every one of our offices from the 750,000 or so \npeople that each of us represent.\n  With the ideas that come from the public, if we sort them in the \nfashion envisioned by our Founding Fathers, if we limit the overgrowth \nof the executive branch of government, we take the responsibility back \nto us, it will press on us, Mr. Speaker, the kind of changes that are \ngood for the people in this Republic, that are good for the \nresponsibilities of the Members of the House and of the Senate. We can \ntake America, and we can take America onwards and upwards to the next \nlevel of our ascending destiny.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence and your attention.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H554-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H554-H557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SAVE CHRISTIANS FROM GENOCIDE ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Rohrabacher) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to call my colleagues' \nattention and the attention of the public to the legislation I have \nproposed.\n  The bill number is H.R. 4017. This act is the Save Christians from \nGenocide Act. I would ask my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this \nlegislation. A number have already done so.\n  I would ask the public to make sure that they know that their \nCongressperson knows exactly what is going on with H.R. 4017 and that \nthey would hope that their Member of Congress would also be a cosponsor \nof the bill.\n  By calling your Congressman's office, I am sure the Members of \nCongress will be very happy to hear your opinion. Many Members of this \nbody need to know that their constituents support the Save Christians \nfrom Genocide Act, H.R. 4017.\n  What this legislation does is set a priority for immigration and \nrefugee status for those Christians who are now under attack, targeted \nfor genocide in Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Pakistan.\n  Genocide is taking place. Mass murder is happening. Christians have \nbeen targeted for slaughter and elimination by radical Islamic \nterrorists in the Middle East. We have to acknowledge that or \nmillions--not just hundreds of thousands--of Christian brethren will \ndie.\n  Another group, the Yazidis, have also been similarly targeted, and my \nbill covers those people as well, although they are not Christians.\n  The greatest threat to our country today is radical Islamic \nterrorism. So it should not be a difficult decision on the part of our \nPresident or the people or the public or this body to decide that we \nare going to do what we can to save Christians who have been targeted \nfor slaughter by those very same forces who are now the greatest threat \nto our own security. However, what we have is not just a foot dragging, \nbut a negative response from this administration.\n  Our President has been unable to defeat or even to turn back the \nonslaught of radical Islamic terrorism. Yes. I have to admit this \nPresident was dealt a pretty bad hand. Things were not good when he \ntook over in the Middle East.\n  I think the mistake the United States made--it is clear that, when we \nsent our troops into Iraq, we did indeed break a stability that has \ncaused us problems. It was a bad situation at that time when our \nPresident became President.\n  Well, this President has turned a bad situation into a catastrophe. \nWe have almost lost--and with our President's policies, we would have \nlost--Egypt to radical Islamic terrorism.\n  Our President supported the Muslim Brotherhood leader of Egypt, a man \nnamed Mohamed Morsi, who was at that time President of Egypt during the \nearly years of this administration.\n  President Obama went all the way to Egypt in order to give a speech, \nstanding beside President Morsi to the Muslim people of that region.\n  What it was was basically an acceptance of the Muslim Brotherhood, \nwhich people now know is the philosophical godfather to all of the \nradical Islamic terrorist movements that now slaughter Christians and \nthreaten the peace and stability of the world.\n  Our President encouraged them in the beginning, feeling, if we did, \nagain, treat someone nicely, they will respect you.\n  What happened? Moderate regimes and, yes, regimes in the Middle East \nthat were not democratic, were less than free, have been replaced with \nradical Islamists who mean to destroy the Middle East and turn it into \na caliphate, radical Islamic terrorists who conduct terrorist raids \ninto Western countries, radical Islamic terrorists who murder people in \nTurkey, in Russia, in San Bernardino.\n  This is what has happened since this President took over and reached \nout with the hand of friendship and understanding to those who would \nbecome the radical Islamic terrorists of that region and, I might say, \na threat to the entire world, including the people of every city in the \nUnited States.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Had Egypt been left the way that the President wanted it to be, had \nwe instead not supported the effort by the Egyptian people to rid \nthemselves of Morsi and his government at the time when Morsi was \ntrying to destroy their supreme court and their court system, at a time \nwhen Morsi was trying to establish a caliphate that is totally rejected \nby the Egyptian people, had our President been able to support General \nel-Sisi, perhaps the revolution could have happened peacefully. But, \ninstead, Morsi was removed by General el-Sisi when he tried to betray \nthe Egyptian people.\n  Today General el-Sisi now has been elected by a landslide in Egypt. \nAnd General el-Sisi--now President el-Sisi--has done everything he can \nto try to find a way to reconcile between Islam and the other faiths, \nof not only the region but the world.\n  President el-Sisi is the only leader, the only President of Egypt \never to go to a Coptic Christian church and help them celebrate \nChristmas. This was an incredible act on his part. He also went to the \nMuslim clerics and personally pleaded with the leadership of the Muslim \nfaith in Egypt and in that part of the world, pleaded for a rejection \nof the radicalism and pleaded for a rejection of those people who would \ncommit acts of violence on others and try to repress the freedom of \nreligion of other people.\n  President el-Sisi begged and pleaded for the Egyptian clerics, the \nMuslim clerics to come out strongly for respect of other people's \nfaiths, respect of freedom of religion and tolerance toward others. \nWhen have we ever had a leader like that? Our President resented him \nbecause he overthrew a man who was in the Muslim Brotherhood who was \ntrying to lay the foundation for a caliphate of terrorists who would \nhave\n\n[[Page H555]]\n\ntried to attack the entire Western world.\n  So what did General el-Sisi get for being this courageous person? \nWhat did General el-Sisi get from us, from our President because he now \nbasically saved Egypt, but not only Egypt--because had Egypt become a \nradical terrorist state--the entire Middle East would have fallen. It \nwould have been totally out of control. And General el-Sisi stepped up.\n  What did he get from our President because of that? He got a feeling \nthat our President really didn't like him. He got the feeling, not only \nthe feeling, but he got rejection on those requests that he made for \nsupport from the United States, legitimate requests of how he could \nhave weapons systems that would help him defeat the same radical \nIslamic terrorists that are murdering our own people and conducting \nmurderous terrorist acts throughout the world.\n  At that time, I might add, they were also conducting mass murders of \nChristians and of other people of other faiths in the Middle East, \nburning people to death, taking people out and sawing their heads off \nand doing this in a very public way, capturing young women, raping them \nen masse because they are Christians or some other faith than Islam.\n  Yes, we needed to confront that at that time. But, instead, when \nGeneral el-Sisi needed help, what did he get? I went to Egypt several \nyears ago, and General el-Sisi pleaded: We have F-16s that we need to \ncombat this threat. We need spare parts for our tanks. He pleaded with \nus: We need these things or we can't police the desert areas on both \nsides of Egypt where these radicals are beginning to try to establish \nsome kind of an uprising and some kind of a conflict that is hard to \nget at. So they need helicopters, they need the spare parts for their \ntanks, and they need their F-16, airplanes as well.\n  So I came back and I put together, along with several of my other \ncolleagues, the Egyptian Caucus. The Egyptian Caucus is nothing more \nthan a group of probably 20 of us who are trying to do our best to see \nthat the radical Islamists do not take over Egypt and that General el-\nSisi is successful in reaching out to the moderate Muslims and trying \nto create goodwill between people of faith who are people of goodwill \nand should be working together and rejecting the radical terrorists \nthat now threaten the whole world and threaten the region.\n  So we are trying to help el-Sisi. He is the point man. I came back a \nyear later, and I talked to General el-Sisi. Well, did you get your \nspare parts? Well, did you get the F-16s yet? No. Did you get spare \nparts for the tanks you mentioned? No. Well, did you get those Apache \nhelicopters? He said: Yeah, we got the Apache helicopters, but the \ndefensive systems needed to send Apache helicopters into a combat zone \nwere not included, so we can't use them.\n  Now, what I just described to you is not something that just happened \nby bureaucratic happenstance or somebody forgot to send the paperwork \nout. This was the policy of the Obama administration. I have worked in \nthe White House and seen how these games are played. They are looking \nat el-Sisi as an enemy, and they are trying to play games with him, \nmaking sure his helicopters didn't have the equipment needed to do \ntheir job, and that the F-16s didn't come and the spare parts didn't \ncome.\n  Finally--after 2 years, I might add--I went back a year later, and \nfinally they had arrived, after we had raised hell in this body and the \nAmerican people had their say that people like el-Sisi and other \nmoderate people, like Abdullah in Jordan and people like that who are \nmoderate in their religious beliefs. They are moderate people, and they \nbelieve in giving people of other faiths respect and tolerance. These \nare the type of leaders we should be siding with.\n  I might add that General el-Sisi has worked with Israel. He has gone \nout of his way to make sure there isn't war between Israel and Egypt. \nWhat could be better than a man who is reaching out, asking for \ntolerance among all faiths, a man who reaches out to a country where \nthey have been at war before and is trying to say: We will never be at \nwar again, we will work together to build a better world. That is what \nhe is doing. But that is what our President is trying to undermine.\n  Our President basically has been unable to use the words ``radical \nIslamic terrorism.'' We keep saying that. That is why right after the \nBenghazi fiasco, that is why immediately when they started talking \nabout: Oh, these weren't really terrorists who murdered our Ambassador, \nit was all caused by a movie that had been shown, and it just enraged \nthese Muslim people and a demonstration got out of hand, and that is \nwhen they went in and murdered our Ambassador. Do you remember that?\n\n  I remember hearing it four or five times. The very first time that I \nheard it, I said: That is a lie. Everybody who knew what was going on, \nthat is what struck them, our government was lying to us in order to \nprotect what? And, I might add, our Secretary of State then, Hillary \nClinton, when she was confronted with that lie--and finally by the time \nwe confronted her with it, it was clearly a lie--she said: Well, what \ndifference does it make whether it was a radical terrorist group or \nwhether it was some people who were demonstrating against a movie? What \ndifference does it make?\n  I will tell you what difference it makes. The difference it makes is \nthat you are sending a message to radicals who murdered our Ambassador \nthat they have gotten away with it, and we are going to wink and nod \nand let them get away with it. We are not going to challenge them. We \nare not going after the terrorist murderers. We are not even giving \nthem credit or making them accountable for it. We are going to blame it \non somebody else so the American people won't get mad and insist that \nwe do something against it.\n  So, yeah, that was what the administration was trying to tell us. \nThis is the same administration, as I say, that can't get itself to \nhelp General el-Sisi, who has saved us from the horror story of having \nEgypt turned into a radical Islamic terrorist camp. And now we can't \neven tell the American people that their Ambassador has been murdered \nby radical Islamic terrorists.\n  In fact, those words, ``radical Islamic terrorists'' have not been \nuttered. I would challenge the President tonight, not including this in \na list of long things, but just get up and say one sentence \nspecifically about ``I reject radical Islamic terrorism, and the \nradical Islamic terrorists of the world have to know that.'' We haven't \nheard that from him. We haven't heard that from him at all. Give me the \nquote.\n  By the way, I think he did use the phrase in passing saying Christian \nterrorists and radical Islamic terrorists and blah-blah. No, that is \nnot it. Let's have a condemnation of radical Islamic terrorism. But, \nno, we haven't been able to do that.\n  That same President, then, at a time when the situation is spiraling \nout of control because these terrorists are flooding the Middle East \nand various countries--whether it is Syria, Iraq, and those parts--this \narea is becoming so unstable that if we do not do something to save the \npeople there who are under attack in two ways, number one, those people \nwho are there, like the Kurds, like the Sunnis in the Anbar Province \nwho are anti-ISIL, like General el-Sisi and Abdullah of Jordan, we have \nto make sure we help them. That is the first thing we have to do.\n  But the second thing we have to do is make sure we do what is morally \nright when it comes to those people who have been targeted to be \nslaughtered. We are talking about a genocide that is existing. We know \nthat the Christian communities have been targeted for extinction by a \nmass slaughter being conducted by radical Islamic terrorists. Those \npeople who have been targeted deserve to come to the United States.\n  Number one, our government needs to help those who are fighting ISIL. \nNumber two, our government needs to make sure that those people who are \ntargeted for genocide can find safe haven here instead of bringing \nhealthy, young Muslim men from that area and letting them come into the \nUnited States, letting them flood into Europe rather than those people, \nthose Christians who are being targeted.\n  I went up to Munich and took a look at one of these refugee camps. We \nall have seen this, video after video of young, healthy Muslim men by \nthe hundreds of thousands pouring in to Western Europe. We don't know \nhow many of them are terrorists. But here\n\n[[Page H556]]\n\nis the point. If those young men don't like radical Islam and this \nterrorism, they should be back in their home country fighting it.\n  If they do like radical Islam, they certainly shouldn't be permitted \ninto the Western democracies. The same is true in the United States. We \nshould not be permitting--and our President has been, I would say, not \ndoing the job that we have been expecting him to do to protect our \ninterests when it comes to the people who are flooding into our \ncountry, whether they are radical Islamic terrorists or whether they \nare just people coming in from the Middle East who we haven't checked \nout yet enough. And, of course, we have hundreds of thousands, and, \nyes, millions of people who have come here illegally--we don't even \nknow who they are--who have swarmed across the border.\n  This President talks about amnesty, talks about giving children who \nhave come here illegally free education and health care, the DREAM Act, \net cetera. What do you think this does? This encourages hundreds of \nthousands or millions of people to come here.\n  The trouble is, when there is a flood, we don't know if in that group \nof hundreds of thousands and millions of people in the last few years, \nhow many of them have been terrorists. Do you really believe that our \nenemies, that these people who slaughter innocent people, these people \nwho are rampaging through the Middle East, raping thousands of young \ngirls because they are Christians, you think that they would care about \nlying to come here and they would refrain from coming here because they \nwould have to cross the border and break the law? We don't know how \nmany of them are here, but they are here. It is the President of the \nUnited States who is at fault.\n  We should have had a system of coming into our country a long time \nago that handled refugees and handled people with legitimate \nimmigration status, and everyone that would come here from the Middle \nEast should have been vetted that way.\n  I was briefed, along with my colleagues, on the vetting process. Top \nlevel people in this government admit that they have not been able to \nreally verify the things that the people claim is their background.\n  I would suggest and I would insist, there is legislation here as well \nthat is pending that I am a cosponsor of that insists on a lie detector \ntest for everybody that comes here, at least from that region.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  We could ask them five questions, like: Have you ever advocated \nviolence for your religion? Do you believe in sharia law or the \nConstitution? That is all we have to do, just take an extra 5 minutes. \nWe haven't even done that.\n  We have millions of people here. Maybe 10,000 of them have animosity \ntoward us or are here to try to shoot people like they did in San \nBernardino, right in our own area. Innocent people were just \nslaughtered.\n  I went to Paris. These kids were in a dance club and these guys came \nin and just massacred them. They kept shooting at them for minutes at a \ntime. They loaded their guns again.\n  This is what we are up against. It is evil. And this administration, \nthis President can't use the words ``radical Islamic terrorists.''\n  Well, I ask my colleagues today to please join me in cosponsoring my \nlegislation, H.R. 4017. It does this. At the very least, we can try to \nsave those Christians in Yazidi cities that have been targeted for \ngenocide.\n  And how we do it is this. You have a certain number of those on \nrefugee status, a certain number on immigration status coming from \nthese five countries that I mentioned in the Middle East. These are the \nareas where the Christians are the most under attack. What my bill \nsimply says is that Christians and these Yazidis who have also been \ntargeted for genocide are going to get priority. They deserve to be on \nthe top of the list. They deserve priority long before these healthy, \nyoung Muslim men who want to come here. And then we will let them in. \nWe will, of course, vet them, make sure we know who they are, and they \nwill get the priority.\n  Now, the President made a statement--he didn't use the number of my \nbill, but he talked about it--and said: Well, we don't believe in that. \nThat is discriminating because of religion. It is a religious test. We \ndon't do religious tests in America.\n  Are you kidding? We cannot prioritize what we do to make sure that \nwhat we are doing is helping the person who is most in danger? Is a \nlifeguard in some way showing disrespect in not helping those other \npeople in the water by going out and saving someone who is drowning?\n  This isn't discrimination. This is a prioritization of the people who \nare under attack and will be slaughtered. This intellectualism will \nresult in what, if we accept the President and this administration \nsaying, ``Oh, you can't prioritize for Christians''?\n  By the way, he doesn't seem to have any trouble prioritizing for \nanybody else, but it is very clear that he won't let us prioritize for \nChristians who are targeted for genocide. No, I reject that totally. It \nis not racism.\n  We had another incident like this in our history. In 1939, there was \nat least one boatload of Jews that made it to the United States. They \nprayed and pleaded with us to let them in. At that moment, Nazi Germany \nwas in the process of picking up the Jews and putting them in \nconcentration camps.\n  These people got away with their families and they came here. And \nwhat did we do? We turned them back. We turned them back for the same \nreason. Oh, if we let you in, it is a special favor to you. These \npeople were targeted for genocide, and we let them go back. Many of \nthem died in these Nazi concentration camps. Let's not do that again.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring my bill, H.R. \n4017, the Save Christians from Genocide Act. Join me and we will send a \nmessage to the world that, yes, we are still the same good-hearted \npeople that we have always claimed to be but have not always met that \nstandard.\n  Today we deserve to stand up and be the champion of the type of \nvalues that I am talking about. That is what our Founding Fathers had \nin mind. America was the refuge of the world. America was the shining \ncity on the hill that inspired the whole world. But we weren't cowards. \nWe weren't someone who undermined some person in his country who is \nfighting an evil force like General el-Sisi. No, our Founding Fathers \nmade sure that those people who are struggling for a better world had \nour support.\n  By the way, let me just note that I worked on speeches for Ronald \nReagan. I was Reagan's speechwriter for 7 years in the White House. I \nwas actually researching one of his speeches, and I came across the \nfact that a man named Kossuth, from Hungary, came to the United States \nand was pleading for help for the Hungarian people who were then in an \nuprising against the Austro-Hungarian Empire and were fighting for \ntheir freedom. He was there in the Midwest giving speeches and trying \nto get the American people to support him. I read a couple of his \nspeeches.\n  Then I noted that in Springfield, Illinois, right after his speech, \nthe town liked him. He was a freedom fighter. But they passed a \nresolution at their meeting that said the United States is a \nnoninterventionist power and we should not get involved overseas, \nsomething like that.\n  Kossuth was still in town. He read the newspaper account of it. And \nwhen the word got out that he was so in despair that the people of the \nUnited States would say such a thing and side with the oppressor \nthrough their inaction, when the people heard about this, they called a \nsecond meeting.\n  In the second meeting, they passed a resolution saying that while we \ndon't want to send our military forces all over the world--which is \nstill a good idea--we will support those people who are struggling for \nfreedom throughout the world. We will open up our arsenals. We will \ngive them what they need to defeat the forces of tyranny that oppress \nthem. That second resolution, then, was passed and was signed by the \npeople of Springfield, Illinois; and in the last phases, I might add, \none of the people who signed that document was one A. Lincoln.\n  I will tell you this about that speech of Mr. Kossuth. That speech \nended with:\n\n       And we do this and we make this commitment so that \n     government of the people, by the people, and for the people \n     shall not perish from this Earth.\n\n\n[[Page H557]]\n\n\n  Lincoln was there in that room when that speech was given, and he \nlater united the people of the United States with that thought from \nthat man, that freedom fighter overseas.\n  There are people who are struggling for their freedom. There are \npeople who are struggling for their existence. We do not have to send \nAmerican military boys to fight the fight that they should be fighting \nfor themselves. But at the very least, we must give them the support \nthey need to defeat the evil forces in the world that would slaughter \nthem, slaughter their families, and come after us next.\n  That is what the war with radical Islam terrorism is all about. They \nare at war with us, and they mean to kill our families and they mean to \npush Western civilization out of the history books of the world in the \nfuture. They want it to be a radical Islamic world, and they will kill \nall of us to get it.\n  Now, that is not all of the Muslims. I agree with our President that \nwe should not say all Muslims are this way. After all, General el-Sisi \nis a Muslim; Abdullah of Jordan is a Muslim.\n  The people that we need on our side to defeat radical Islam are the \nmoderate Muslims of the world. I think at least 80 percent of the \nMuslims of the world are moderate and would want to be our friends. We \nneed now to recognize that that segment of Islam is now a threat to our \nsafety, our well-being.\n  This is an historic moment. We can either meet this challenge or we \nwill lose. But the most important thing, no matter what we do, if our \nPresident doesn't want to send troops there, fine, but at least let us \nensure that history will record that we saved those Christians who were \ntargeted for the genocide of this evil force that was expanding in that \npart of the world. Shame on us if we do not.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 4017. I ask the \npeople of the United States to let their Congressmen know that they \nexpect them to support honorable and noble and moral stands like this. \nIt is not discrimination. It is prioritizing towards those people who \nhave been targeted for genocide. Nothing could be better for our soul \nthan to help those who have been so targeted.\n  I ask that my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H557-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A Bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 2306.

Title III \n     of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n     disability by public accommodations and requires places of \n     public accommodation and commercial facilities to be \n     designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with the \n     accessibility standards.\n       Section 210(e) of the CAA requires the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance to issue regulations implementing \n     Section 210. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e). Section 210(e) further \n     states that such regulations ``shall be\n\n[[Page H558]]\n\n     the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of Transportation to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (b) of this section except to the extent that the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' Id. Section 210(e) further \n     provides that the regulations shall include a method of \n     identifying, for purposes of this section and for different \n     categories of violations of subsection (b), the entity \n     responsible for correction of a particular violation. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(3). On September 9, 2014, the Board \n     published in the Congressional Record a NPRM, 160 Cong. Rec. \n     H7363 & 160 Cong. Rec. S5437 (daily ed., Sept. 9, 2014). In \n     response to the NPRM, the Board received four sets of written \n     comments. After due consideration of the comments received in \n     response to the proposed regulations, the Board has adopted \n     and is submitting these final regulations for approval by \n     Congress.\n     Summary of Comments and Board's Adopted Rules\n       A. Request for additional rulemaking proceedings.\n       One commenter requested that the Board withdraw its \n     proposed regulations and ``create'' new regulations. The \n     commenter suggested that the Board's authority to adopt \n     regulations does not include the authority to incorporate \n     existing regulations by reference and also suggested that the \n     Board would be adopting future changes to the incorporated \n     regulations unless it specified that the regulations in \n     existence on the adoption date were the ones being \n     incorporated rather than the regulations in existence on the \n     issuance date (which was proposed in the NPRM and occurs \n     after Congress has approved the regulations). The Board has \n     determined that further rulemaking proceedings are not \n     required because the publication requirements of Section \n     304(b)(1) of the CAA, which requires compliance with 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 553(b), is satisfied by incorporating ``material readily \n     available to the class of persons affected'' by the proposed \n     regulation. See, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(a)(1)(E). Nonetheless, in \n     response to this comment, the Board has modified the proposed \n     regulation to incorporate the regulations in existence on the \n     adoption date rather than the issuance date. In addition, to \n     further avoid any confusion, the adopted regulations require \n     that the full text of the incorporated regulations be \n     published on the Office of Compliance website.\n       B. General comments regarding proposed regulations.\n     1. Compliance with both Titles II and III of the ADA.\n       Several commenters questioned whether it was necessary to \n     adopt regulations under both Title II and Title III when \n     Title II typically applies only to public entities and Title \n     III typically applies only to private entities. Section 210 \n     of the CAA can be confusing because it requires legislative \n     branch offices (which are ``public entities''') to comply \n     with sections of the ADA that are part of both Title II and \n     Title III. Ordinarily, as the commenters suggested, the major \n     distinction between Title II and Title III of the ADA is that \n     Title II solely applies to public entities while Title III \n     solely applies to private entities that are considered public \n     accommodations. In contrast, under the CAA, the legislative \n     branch offices listed in Section 210(a) must comply with \n     Sections 201 through 230 of Title II of the ADA and Sections \n     302, 303 and 309 of Title III of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(b)(1). For purposes of the application of Title II \n     of the ADA, the term ``public entity'' means any of these \n     legislative branch offices. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b)(2). For \n     the purposes of Title III of the ADA, the CAA does not \n     incorporate the definitions contained in Section 301 of Title \n     III, which limits the application of Title III to private \n     entities which own, operate, lease or lease to places of \n     public accommodation. Consequently, since the CAA expressly \n     applies Title III to legislative branch offices that are \n     ``public entities,'' those offices must at all times provide \n     services, programs and activities that are in compliance with \n     Title II of the ADA and, when those services, programs, \n     activities or accommodations are provided directly to the \n     public (as in places of public accommodations), they must \n     also comply with Sections 302, 303 and 309 of Title III of \n     the ADA. In other words, services, programs and activities \n     that involve constituents and other members of the public \n     must comply with both Titles II and III of the ADA, while \n     those services, programs and activities that are not open or \n     available to the public must only comply with Title II (and \n     Title I when employment practices are involved).\n       As noted in the NPRM, Congress applied provisions of both \n     Title II and Title III of the ADA to legislative branch \n     offices to ensure that individuals with disabilities are \n     provided the most access to public services, programs, \n     activities and accommodations provided by law. To that end, \n     the NPRM proposed an admittedly simple rule for deciding \n     which regulation applies when there are differences between \n     the applicable Title II and Title III regulations: the \n     regulation providing the most access shall be followed. In \n     response to the concerns expressed by the commenters, the \n     Board has further reviewed the Title II and III regulations \n     and determined that, when the regulations address the same \n     subject, compliance with the applicable Title II regulation \n     will be sufficient to meet the requirements of both Title II \n     and Title III. For this reason, and to eliminate the \n     potential confusion expressed by the commenters, the Board \n     has adopted only the DOJ's Title II regulation when the DOJ's \n     Title II and Title III regulations address the same subject.\n     2. Providing services, programs, activities or accommodations \n         directly to the public out of a leased space.\n       Several commenters raised questions regarding how the \n     regulations would be applied when a legislative branch office \n     is leasing space from a private landlord. Under the ADA \n     regulations (both Title II and Title III), the space being \n     leased, the building where it is located, the building site, \n     the parking lots and the interior and exterior walkways are \n     all considered to be ``facilities.'' If the facility is being \n     used to meet with members of the public, under the CAA, the \n     facility is a place of public accommodation operated by a \n     public entity and therefore the office must meet the \n     obligations imposed by those sections of Titles II and III of \n     the ADA applied to legislative branch entities under the CAA. \n     Because the private landlord is leasing a facility to a place \n     of public accommodation, the private landlord will also have \n     to comply with the DOJ's Title III regulations, subject to \n     enforcement by the DOJ or by an individual with a disability \n     through legal action. The private landlord is not covered by \n     the CAA.\n       Under the DOJ regulations that are incorporated by the \n     adopted regulations, the obligations imposed by Title II and \n     Title III differ depending upon when the leased facility was \n     constructed. Entities covered by either Title II or Title III \n     of the ADA (or both) must have designed and constructed their \n     facilities in strict compliance with the applicable ADA \n     Standards for Accessible Design (ADA Standards) if they were \n     constructed after January 26, 1992. This means that both \n     landlords and tenants are legally obligated to remove all \n     barriers to access in such leased facilities caused by \n     noncompliance with the applicable ADA Standards. Alterations \n     made after January 26, 1992 to facilities constructed before \n     January 26, 1992 must also be in compliance with the ADA \n     Standards to the maximum extent feasible, and any alterations \n     made to primary function areas after this date trigger a \n     separate obligation to make the path of travel to those areas \n     accessible to the extent that it can be made so without \n     incurring disproportionate costs. If barriers to access exist \n     in these alterations and in the path of travel to altered \n     primary function areas, both the landlord and the tenant are \n     legally obligated to remove those barriers. The regulations \n     allow consideration of the provisions of the lease to \n     determine who is primarily responsible for performing the \n     barrier removal work; \\1\\ however, because the legal duty is \n     jointly imposed upon both of the parties, legal liability for \n     any violation cannot be avoided by a private contract.\\2\\\n       All entities covered by Title III of the ADA who are \n     lessors or lessees of facilities that were both constructed \n     after January 26, 1992, and not altered since that date, must \n     remove access barriers if such removal is ``readily \n     achievable.'' 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 28 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 36.304. The phrase ``readily achievable'' means ``easily \n     accomplishable and able to be carried out without much \n     difficulty or expense.'' 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12181(9); 28 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 36.304(a). Examples of ``readily achievable'' steps for \n     removal of barriers include: installing ramps; making curb \n     cuts in sidewalks and entrances; repositioning shelves, \n     furniture, vending machines, displays, and telephones; adding \n     raised markings and elevator control buttons; installing \n     visual alarms; widening doors; installing accessible door \n     devices; rearranging toilet partitions to increase \n     maneuvering space; raising toilet seats; and creating \n     designated accessible parking spaces. 28 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 36.304(b).\n       Because legislative branch offices are ``public entities'' \n     that must always comply with Title II of the ADA, these \n     offices must also operate each of their services, programs \n     and activities so that the service, program or activity, when \n     viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable \n     by individuals with disabilities. 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.150(a). \n     While this requirement does not usually require a public \n     entity to make each of its existing facilities accessible and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities [28 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 35.150(a)(1)], a public entity must ``give priority to \n     those methods that offer services, programs, and activities \n     to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most \n     integrated setting appropriate'' when choosing a method of \n     providing readily accessible and usable services, programs \n     and activities. While structural changes in existing \n     facilities are not required when the public entity can show \n     that other methods are effective in meeting this access \n     requirement, when a public entity is renting solely one \n     facility in a locality, the only practical method of \n     providing accessibility is to make sure that this leased \n     facility is readily accessible. When a legislative branch \n     office has only one facility in a particular locality and \n     uses that facility to conduct meetings with constituents, it \n     can be difficult, if not impossible, for that office to show \n     that each of its programs, services and activities meet the \n     accessibility requirements of 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.150 when that \n     facility is not readily accessible. Constituents using \n     wheelchairs who are unable to attend meetings at a local \n     Congressional office because the facility is not readily \n     accessible do not\n\n[[Page H559]]\n\n     find that each of the office's services, programs or \n     activities, when viewed in its entirety, is readily \n     accessible or usable by them. Offices are usually placed in a \n     locality so that staff can meet personally with constituents \n     who live nearby. Nearby constituents using wheelchairs who \n     find that they cannot personally participate in such meetings \n     upon reaching the facility are effectively being denied the \n     access being provided to other constituents.\n       Because the adopted regulations adequately explain the \n     rights and responsibilities of the parties involved in \n     leasing facilities to public entities or public \n     accommodations, the adopted regulations contain no changes \n     based upon these comments.\n     3. Access requirements in rural and urban areas.\n       One commenter suggested that the Board should recognize \n     that the access requirements in rural areas differ from those \n     in urban areas and should therefore adopt regulations that \n     recognize this distinction. The ADA is a civil rights statute \n     and not a building code, although it is sometimes mistakenly \n     viewed as one. While alterations and construction in rural \n     areas may not be regulated by local building codes, under the \n     ADA, the individuals with disabilities living in those areas \n     are entitled to the same rights and protections as those \n     living in urban areas. This means that public entities and \n     public accommodations must comply with the same applicable \n     ADA access requirements regardless of their location. For \n     this reason, following the DOJ and DOT, the Board has not \n     made any changes in the proposed regulations to reflect \n     distinctions between rural and urban areas.\n       4. Accessibility requirements for leased facilities.\n       In the NPRM, the Board proposed adoption of an Access Board \n     regulation based on 36 C.F.R. Sec.  1190.34 (2004) which \n     since July 23, 2004 has been incorporated into the Access \n     Board's Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines \n     (``ABAAG''). This regulation provides that buildings and \n     facilities leased with federal funds shall contain certain \n     specified accessible features. Buildings or facilities leased \n     for 12 months or less are not required to comply with the \n     regulation as long as the lease cannot be extended or \n     renewed.\n       The Access Board's leasing regulation implements a key \n     provision of the Architectural Barriers Act (``ABA'') which \n     Congress originally passed in 1968 and amended in 1976. The \n     ABA was originally enacted ``to insure that all public \n     buildings constructed in the future by or on behalf of the \n     Federal Government or with loans or grants from the Federal \n     Government are designed and constructed in such a way that \n     they will be accessible to and usable by the physically \n     handicapped.'' S.Rep. No. 538, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \n     reprinted in 1968 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 3214, 3215. \n     Prior to being amended in 1976, the ABA covered only leased \n     facilities that were ``to be leased in whole or in part by \n     the United States after [August 12, 1968], after construction \n     or alteration in accordance with plans and specifications of \n     the United States.'' Pub. L. No. 90-480 Sec. 1, 82 Stat. 718 \n     (1968). In 1975, the GAO issued a report to Congress entitled \n     Further Action Needed to Make All Buildings Accessible to the \n     Physically Handicapped which found that ``leased buildings \n     were consistently more inaccessible [than federally-owned \n     buildings] and posed the most serious problems to the \n     handicapped'' and further found that ``[s]ince the Government \n     leases many existing buildings without substantial \n     alteration, the [ABA's] coverage is incomplete to the extent \n     that those buildings are excluded.'' Comptroller General, \n     Further Action Needed to Make All Buildings Accessible to the \n     Physically Handicapped (July 15, 1975) at 25, 28. In response \n     to the GAO Report, Congress amended the ABA by deleting the \n     phrase ``after construction or alteration in accordance with \n     plans and specifications of the United States'' thereby \n     providing coverage for all buildings and facilities ``to be \n     leased in whole or in part by the United States after \n     [January 1, 1977].'' The House Report accompanying the bill \n     that became law described the purpose of the 1976 Amendments \n     as being to ``assure more effective implementation of the \n     congressional policy to eliminate architectural barriers to \n     physically handicapped persons in most federally occupied or \n     sponsored buildings.'' H.R. Rep. No. 1584--Part I, 94th \n     Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1976). The hearings on the bill also make \n     it clear that Congress amended the ABA in 1976 to close the \n     loophole through which inaccessible buildings and facilities \n     were leased without alteration. See, Public Buildings \n     Cooperative Use: Hearings on HR 15134 Before the Subcommittee \n     on Public Buildings and Grounds of the House Committee on \n     Public Works and Transportation, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 107 \n     (1976) (statement of Representative Edgar).\n       Consequently, since 1976, a hallmark of federal policy \n     regarding people with disabilities has been to require \n     accessibility of buildings and facilities constructed or \n     leased using federal funds. Although, in the CAA, Congress \n     required legislative branch compliance with only the public \n     access provisions of the ADA rather than the Rehabilitation \n     Act of 1973 or the ABA, the ADA itself was enacted in 1990 to \n     expand the access rights of individuals with disabilities \n     beyond what was previously provided by the Rehabilitation Act \n     and the ABA. One of the sections of the ADA that Congress \n     incorporated into the CAA is Section 204. Section 204 \n     requires that the regulations promulgated under the ADA with \n     respect to existing facilities ``shall be consistent'' with \n     the regulations promulgated by the DOJ in 28 C.F.R. Part 39. \n     42 U.S.C. Sec. 12134(b). Under 28 C.F.R. Sec. 39.150(b), a \n     covered entity is required to meet accessibility requirements \n     to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of \n     1968, as amended, and any regulations implementing it.\n       As several commenters noted, when the DOJ promulgated its \n     ADA regulations in 1991, it stated in its guidelines that it \n     had intentionally omitted a regulation that required public \n     entities to lease only accessible facilities because to do so \n     ``would significantly restrict the options of State and local \n     governments in seeking leased space, which would be \n     particularly burdensome in rural or sparsely populated \n     areas.'' 29 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B Sec. 35.151. In these same \n     guidelines, however, the DOJ also noted that, under the \n     Access Board's regulations, the federal government may not \n     lease facilities unless they meet the minimum accessibility \n     requirements specified in 36 C.F.R. Sec. 1190.34 (2004) (and \n     now in ABAAG Sec. F202.6). This is true even if the facility \n     is located in rural or sparsely populated areas. None of the \n     commenters provided any specific examples of how complying \n     with a regulation regarding leased facilities otherwise \n     applicable to the federal government would be unduly \n     burdensome. Since the supply of accessible facilities has \n     increased during the past twenty-four years through \n     alterations and new construction, the burdensomeness of this \n     regulation is certainly much less than it was in 1991.\n       A commenter also noted that under the current House rules a \n     Member may not use representational funds to obtain \n     reimbursement for capital improvements and this might affect \n     the removal of barriers in facilities that are inaccessible. \n     However, the proposed regulation does not require that any \n     Member specifically pay for capital improvements. Instead, \n     prior to entering into a lease with a Member for a facility \n     that is in need of alterations to meet the minimum \n     accessibility requirements, the landlord is obligated to make \n     the needed alterations as a condition of doing business with \n     Congress. While it is likely that the landlord will recover \n     some of the costs associated with these alterations by \n     increasing the rent paid by federal tenants, Congress \n     determined when it amended the ABA to provide coverage for \n     all leased facilities that the increased cost associated with \n     requiring the federal government to lease only accessible \n     facilities would be minimal and well worth the benefit gained \n     by improving accessibility to all federal facilities. H.R. \n     Rep. No. 1584--Part II, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 9, reprinted in \n     1976 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 5566, 5571-72. In the \n     NPRM, the Board noted that the most common ADA public access \n     complaint received by the OOC General Counsel from \n     constituents relates to the lack of ADA access to spaces \n     being leased by legislative branch offices. Given the \n     frequency of these complaints and the clear Congressional \n     policy embodied in the ABA requiring leasing of only \n     accessible spaces by the United States, the Board found good \n     cause to propose adoption of the Access Board's regulation \n     formerly known as 36 C.F.R. Sec. 1190.34 (2004) and now known \n     as Sec. F202.6 of the ABAAG and the ABAAS. Because, under CAA \n     Sec. 210(e)(2), the OOC Board of Directors (``the Board'') is \n     authorized to propose a regulation that does not follow the \n     DOJ regulations when it determines ``for good cause shown and \n     stated together with the regulation, that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section,'' the Board has decided to require the leasing of \n     accessible spaces as required in Sec. F202.6 of the ABAAS.\n       5. Regulations regarding the investigation and prosecution \n     of charges of discrimination and regarding periodic \n     inspections and reporting.\n       Several commenters suggested that the regulations in Part \n     2, regarding the investigation and prosecution of charges of \n     discrimination, and in Part 3, regarding periodic inspections \n     and reporting, describe powers of the General Counsel that \n     are beyond what is provided in the CAA. These commenters \n     suggested that, under the CAA, the General Counsel does not \n     have the discretion to determine how to conduct \n     investigations and inspections nor the authority to act upon \n     ADA requests for inspection from persons who request \n     anonymity or persons who do not identify themselves as \n     disabled.\n       Section 210(d) of the CAA requires the General Counsel to \n     accept and investigate charges of discrimination filed by \n     qualified individuals with disabilities who allege a \n     violation of Section 210 of the CAA by a covered entity. The \n     CAA provides no details regarding how charges shall be \n     investigated. Similarly, while Section 210(f) of the CAA \n     requires that the General Counsel, on a regular basis, at \n     least once each Congress, inspect the facilities of covered \n     entities to ensure compliance with Section 210 of the CAA and \n     submit a report to Congress containing the results of such \n     periodic inspections, the statute provides no details \n     regarding how the inspections are to be conducted.\n       ``The power of an administrative agency to administer a \n     congressionally created . . . program necessarily requires \n     the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any \n     gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.'' Morton v. \n     Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 231, 94\n\n[[Page H560]]\n\n     S.Ct. 1055, 1072, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974) (cited with approval \n     by Chevron v. Nat'l Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, \n     843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). When Congress \n     expressly leaves a gap for the agency to fill, there is an \n     express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate \n     the statute. Id. at 844.\n       The OOC General Counsel has been conducting ADA inspections \n     since January 23, 1995, when the CAA authorized commencement \n     of such inspections. The OOC General Counsel has been \n     investigating charges of discrimination since January 1, \n     1997, the effective date of Section 210(d). Since the \n     creation of the office, the General Counsel has endeavored to \n     conduct these inspections and investigations in a manner that \n     is not disruptive to the offices involved and has not \n     received complaints or comments indicating that its ADA \n     investigations or inspections have ever been disruptive. The \n     regulations merely propose that the General Counsel conduct \n     investigations and inspections in the manner that they have \n     always been conducted.\n       Due to the lack of inspection resources, the General \n     Counsel is unable to conduct ADA inspections of all \n     facilities used by the covered entities at least once each \n     Congress. The General Counsel is unable to inspect all of the \n     facilities located in the Washington, D.C. area, much less \n     all of the facilities used by the district and state offices \n     that are also covered by Section 210 of the CAA. In light of \n     the General Counsel's limited resources and the large number \n     of facilities that are covered by the CAA, the General \n     Counsel must prioritize its ADA inspections. The proposed \n     regulations allow the General Counsel to continue its \n     practice of giving priority to inspection of areas that have \n     raised concerns from constituents. By allowing anyone to file \n     a request for inspection and by allowing requestors to remain \n     anonymous to the covered office (the requestor is required to \n     provide his or her identity to the General Counsel), the \n     General Counsel is better able to identify and examine \n     potential access problems and then pass this information on \n     to the covered offices who are in the best position to \n     address these potential issues. The General Counsel has found \n     that, without exception, covered offices have been very \n     responsive to the access concerns raised by constituents \n     through the request for inspection process and are usually \n     appreciative of information concerning constituent access \n     issues of which they might otherwise be unaware.\n       Under the proposed regulations, requests for inspection \n     filed anonymously or by persons without disabilities are not \n     considered ``charges of discrimination'' that could result in \n     a formal complaint being filed by the General Counsel against \n     the covered office. Unlike Section 215 of the CAA, relating \n     to occupational safety and health (``OSH'') inspections and \n     investigations, Section 210 of the CAA does not authorize the \n     General Counsel to initiate enforcement proceedings unless a \n     qualified individual with a disability has filed a charge of \n     discrimination. But like Section 215, Section 210 of the CAA \n     does authorize the General Counsel to inspect any facility \n     and report its findings to the covered offices and to \n     Congress. The proposed regulations merely recognize the \n     General Counsel's long standing and common sense approach \n     that concentrates limited inspection resources on the areas \n     of most concern to constituents.\n       The other concern mentioned in the comments is that the \n     proposed regulations define the General Counsel's \n     investigatory authority in a manner that is broader than what \n     Section 210 provides. Section 210 directs the General Counsel \n     to investigate charges of discrimination without specifying \n     how those investigations are to be conducted. To fill this \n     gap, the proposed regulations allow the General Counsel to \n     use modes of inquiry and investigation traditionally employed \n     or useful to execute the investigatory authority provided by \n     the statute which can include conducting inspections, \n     interviewing witnesses, requesting documents and requiring \n     answers to written questions. These methods of investigation \n     are consistent with how other federal agencies investigate \n     charges of discrimination. There is nothing in this proposed \n     regulation that is contrary to the statutory language in \n     Section 210. For this reason, the Board has not made any \n     changes in the adopted regulations in response to these \n     comments.\n       6. Request to create new regulations relating to safety and \n     security.\n       One commenter suggested that the Board use these \n     regulations to recognize the Capitol Police Board's statutory \n     authority relating to safety and security and create new \n     regulations defining this authority with respect to Section \n     210 of the CAA. In response, the Board does not find any \n     statutory language in the CAA which would allow it to define \n     the authority of the Capitol Police Board by regulation and \n     therefore does not find good cause to modify the language of \n     the DOJ or DOT regulations in the manner requested.\n       7. Comments to specific regulations.\n       a. Sec. 1.101--Purpose and Scope. One commenter suggested \n     that, when describing how the CAA incorporates sections of \n     Title II and III of the ADA, the regulation should use the \n     language contained in the incorporated statutory sections. \n     The Board has made this change in the adopted regulations. \n     The same commenter suggested that mediation should be \n     mentioned when describing the charge and complaint process. \n     The Board has also made this change in the adopted \n     regulations.\n       b. Sec. 1.102--Definitions. One commenter suggested that \n     the incorporated definition of the ``Act'' should be \n     reconciled with the definition of ``ADA'' provided in the \n     proposed definitions. The Board has added ``or Americans with \n     Disabilities Act'' after ``ADA'' in the definition section of \n     the adopted regulations. This will clarify that references to \n     the ``Americans with Disabilities Act'' or the ``Act'' will \n     refer to only those sections of the ADA that are applied to \n     the legislative branch by the CAA. One commenter suggested \n     that there should be some discussion in this section \n     regarding when a covered entity will be considered to be \n     operating a ``place of public accommodation'' within the \n     meaning of Title III. The Board has provided additional \n     guidance on this topic in this Notice of Adoption and has \n     added a provision in the adopted regulations providing that \n     the regulations shall be interpreted in a manner consistent \n     with the Notice of Adoption.\n       c. Sec. 1.103--Authority of the Board. One commenter \n     suggested that this section be modified in a way that would \n     allow the Board to adopt the Pedestrian Right of Way \n     Accessible Guidelines (``PROWAG'') as a standard. Because the \n     PROWAG are only proposed guidelines and they have not been \n     adopted by the DOT as standards by regulation, these are not \n     among the current DOT regulations that the Board can adopt \n     under Section 210(e)(2) of the CAA. For this reason, the \n     Board has not acted upon this suggestion.\n       d. Sec. 1.104--Method for identifying entity responsible. A \n     commenter suggested that the term ``this section'' refers to \n     both the statutory and regulatory language at different \n     times. In response to this suggestion, the Board has changed \n     the first reference to ``this section'' to ``Section 210 of \n     the CAA'' in the adopted regulation. A commenter has also \n     suggested that the regulation refers to allocating \n     responsibility between covered entities rather than \n     identifying the entity responsible and notes that there may \n     be instances where access issues arise because a private \n     landlord has failed to comply with the lease with the covered \n     entity and the General Counsel would be unable to ``allocate \n     responsibility'' between the covered entity and the private \n     landlord. In response, the Board notes that Section 1.104(c) \n     describes how the entities responsible for correcting \n     violations are identified. Section 1.104(d) describes how \n     responsibility is allocated when more than one covered entity \n     is responsible for the correction. Because a private landlord \n     is not a ``covered entity'' within the meaning of the CAA, \n     Section 1.104(d) would not be applicable when deciding how to \n     allocate responsibility between a private landlord and a \n     covered legislative branch office. To further clarify this \n     distinction, the Board has added the word ``covered'' before \n     ``entity'' in Section 1.104(d) of the adopted regulation. \n     Another commenter requested that this regulation be clarified \n     so that only violations of the sections of the ADA \n     incorporated in the CAA will be considered violations. In \n     response, the Board notes that this has been accomplished by \n     defining the ``ADA'' as including only those sections \n     incorporated by the CAA. Another comment requested a \n     definition of the term ``order'' in the last sentence of \n     Section 1.104(d). In response, this word has been deleted in \n     the adopted regulations.\n       e. Sec. 1.105--Title II Regulations incorporated by \n     reference. The Architect of the Capitol suggested a slight \n     modification to the definition of ``historic property'' in \n     Sec. 1.105(a)(4) which would add the word ``properties'' to \n     the list including ``facilities'' and ``buildings.'' The \n     Board has made this change in the adopted regulations. \n     Another commenter requested that the definition of \n     ``historic'' properties be modified to include properties \n     designated as historic by state or local law to cover \n     district offices located in such buildings. In response, the \n     Board notes that the definition contained in Sec. 1.105(a)(4) \n     merely supplements the definition of historic properties \n     contained in Section 35.104, which includes those properties \n     designated as historic under State or local law. To further \n     clarify this, the Board has added the word ``also'' to the \n     definition in the adopted regulation. Another comment \n     suggested that, rather than providing a general rule of \n     interpretation, all potentially conflicting regulations \n     should be rewritten to reconcile all possible conflicts. In \n     response, as noted earlier in response to the general \n     comments, the Board has adopted only the Title II regulation \n     when both a DOJ Title II and Title III regulation address the \n     same subject.\n       (1) Section 35.103(a). A comment suggested that this \n     regulation should not be adopted because it references Title \n     V of the Rehabilitation Act which includes employment \n     discrimination issues. In response, the Board notes that \n     Section 35.103(a) is based on Section 204 of the ADA, 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 12134, which is incorporated by reference into \n     the CAA; consequently, this provision remains in the adopted \n     regulations.\n       (2) Section 35.104. A comment suggested that this \n     regulation should be rewritten to delete all terms that are \n     irrelevant, duplicative, or otherwise inapplicable. In \n     response, the Board notes that definitions of terms that are \n     not used in the incorporated regulations are not incorporated \n     by reference, as made clear by the additional language added \n     in Sec. 1.105(a); consequently, there is no need to rewrite \n     the regulation.\n       (3) Section 35.105 (Self-Evaluation) and Section 35.106 \n     (Notice). A comment suggested\n\n[[Page H561]]\n\n     that these regulations should not be adopted because they \n     might require covered entities to report findings to the OOC \n     or keep and maintain certain records. The Board does not find \n     this reason to be ``good cause'' for modifying the existing \n     DOJ regulation. Unlike some of the other statutes \n     incorporated by the CAA, the ADA does not contain a specific \n     section about recordkeeping that Congress declined to apply \n     to legislative branch entities.\n       (4) Section 35.107 (Designation of responsible employee and \n     adoption of grievance procedures). A comment suggested that \n     this regulation should not be adopted because the CAA \n     contains other enforcement provisions. The Board does not \n     find ``good cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ \n     regulation. The DOJ placed these provisions in the \n     regulations even though the ADA contains enforcement \n     provisions. These regulations provide an opportunity to \n     promptly address access issues by allowing individuals with \n     disabilities to complain directly to the covered entity about \n     an access problem.\n       (5) Section 35.131 (Illegal use of drugs). A comment \n     suggested that this regulation should not be adopted because \n     it may raise Fourth Amendment issues. The Board finds that \n     there is not ``good cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ \n     regulation. The Fourth Amendment also applies to state and \n     local governments. This regulation exists to make clear that \n     covered entities can legally prohibit participants in \n     government sponsored sport and recreational activities from \n     illegally using drugs.\n       (6) Section 35.133 (Maintenance of accessible features). A \n     comment suggested that this regulation should be modified to \n     exclude offices that have no ``direct care and control'' over \n     accessible features because only certain offices control the \n     common areas in buildings. In response, the Board finds that \n     there is not ``good cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ \n     regulation. The entity or entities responsible for correcting \n     violations are identified in accordance with Section 1.104(c) \n     of the Proposed Regulations.\n       (7) Section 35.137 (Mobility Devices). A comment suggested \n     that this regulation should be modified to exclude offices \n     that do not have direct control over the daily operation of \n     legislative branch facilities. In response, the Board has \n     failed to find ``good cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ \n     regulation. The entity or entities responsible for correcting \n     violations are identified in accordance with Section 1.104(c) \n     of the Proposed Regulations.\n       (8) Section 35.150 (Existing Facilities). A comment \n     suggested that this proposed regulation should be modified so \n     that it requires that only accessible facilities be leased \n     and that Section 35.150(d) be removed because it requires the \n     development of a transition plan which imposes recordkeeping \n     requirements not adopted in the CAA. The Board does not find \n     ``good cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ regulation. The \n     accessibility requirements of leased facilities are addressed \n     in a separate regulation. Regarding transition plans, as \n     noted earlier, unlike some of the other statutes incorporated \n     by the CAA, the ADA does not contain a specific section about \n     recordkeeping that Congress declined to apply to legislative \n     branch entities. The transition planning requirement is a key \n     element of the DOJ regulations since it compels public \n     entities to develop a plan for making all of their facilities \n     accessible.\n       (9) Section 35.160 (Communications--General) A comment \n     suggested modifying this regulation so that it is consistent \n     with Section 36.303(c) (Effective communication). In \n     response, the Board notes that the adopted regulations do not \n     include Section 36.303(c) so there is no longer a reason for \n     modifying the existing DOJ Title II regulation.\n       (10) Section 35.163 (Information and Signage). A comment \n     suggested excluding offices that do not have direct control \n     over signage in common areas from this regulation. In \n     response, the Board does not find ``good cause'' for \n     modifying the existing DOJ regulation. The entity or entities \n     responsible for correcting violations are identified in \n     accordance with Section 1.104(c) of the adopted regulations.\n       (11) Appendices to Part 35 Regulations. A commenter \n     suggested correcting the titles of the Appendices to Parts 35 \n     and 36. The titles have been corrected in the adopted \n     regulations.\n       f. Sec. 1.105--Title III Regulations incorporated by \n     reference.\n       (1) Section 36.101 (Purpose). A comment suggested that this \n     regulation be modified to state that only those sections of \n     Title III incorporated by the CAA are being implemented. The \n     Board finds that this change is not necessary because the \n     adopted regulations define the term ``Americans with \n     Disabilities Act'' as including only those sections of the \n     ADA incorporated by the CAA.\n       (2) Section 36.103 (Relationship with other Laws). A \n     comment suggested deleting this regulation because it \n     references Title V of the Rehabilitation Act. In response, \n     the Board notes that Section 36.103 is based in part on \n     Section 204 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12134, which is \n     incorporated by reference into the CAA, and therefore finds \n     no cause for deleting this regulation.\n       (3) Section 36.104 (Definitions). Several comments \n     suggested that this regulation be modified to remove all \n     definitions that are irrelevant, duplicative, or otherwise \n     inapplicable. The Board notes that definitions of terms that \n     are not used in the incorporated regulations are not \n     incorporated by reference and therefore finds no cause for \n     altering the regulation. As noted earlier, because the Notice \n     of Adoption will be included as an appendix to the \n     regulations, the notice will serve as guidance for \n     interpreting the regulations.\n       (4) Section 36.209 (Illegal use of drugs). The Board has \n     not responded to comments regarding this regulation because \n     it has not been incorporated into the adopted regulations.\n       (5) Section 36.211 (Maintenance of accessible features). \n     The Board has not responded to comments regarding this \n     regulation because it has not been incorporated into the \n     adopted regulations.\n       (6) Section 36.303 (Effective communication). The Board has \n     not responded to comments regarding this regulation because \n     it has not been incorporated into the adopted regulations.\n       (7) Section 36.304 (Removal of Barriers). A comment \n     suggested modifying this regulation to acknowledge that the \n     General Counsel has no authority over private landlords. The \n     Board does not find good cause for modifying this regulation. \n     As noted earlier, there is nothing in the regulations \n     suggesting that the CAA applies to private landlords. In many \n     cases, barrier removal is the responsibility of both the \n     landlord and the tenant. If the tenant has a lease provision \n     that places this responsibility on the landlord, it is up to \n     the tenant to take appropriate action to enforce this \n     provision.\n       (8) Sections 36.402 (Alterations), 36.403 (Alterations: \n     Path of travel), 36.404 (Alterations: Elevator exemption), \n     36.405 (Alterations: Historic preservation) and 36.406 \n     (Standards for new construction and alterations). A comment \n     suggested modifying these regulations to consider the limited \n     control that some offices have over capital improvement and \n     alterations to buildings and to modify the historic \n     preservation definition to include buildings designated as \n     historic by state and local governments. The Board does not \n     find good cause for modifying the existing DOJ regulations. \n     The entity or entities responsible for correcting violations \n     are identified in accordance with Section 1.104(c) of the \n     adopted regulations. As noted earlier, the definition \n     contained in Sec. 1.105(a)(4) merely supplements the \n     definition of historic properties contained in Section \n     36.405(a), which includes those properties designated as \n     historic under State or local law.\n       (9) Appendices to Part 36 Regulations. A commenter \n     suggested correcting the titles of the Appendices to Parts 35 \n     and 36. The titles have been corrected in the adopted \n     regulations.\n       g. Section 1.105(e)--36 C.F.R. Part 1190 (2004) & ABAAG \n     Sec. F202.6\n       (1) Several commenters suggested that 36 C.F.R. Part 1190 \n     (2004) should not be adopted because it is no longer in the \n     Code of Federal Regulations. The Board does not find good \n     cause to reconsider its decision to adopt this regulation. As \n     noted earlier, although the regulation was removed from the \n     C.F.R. in 2004 when the substance of the regulation became \n     part of the ABA Accessibility Guidelines (``ABAAG'') at \n     Sec. F202.6, it is still an enforceable standard applied to \n     the United States Government. Since 1976, when Congress \n     amended the ABA, it has been a hallmark of federal policy \n     regarding people with disabilities to require accessibility \n     of buildings and facilities constructed or leased using \n     federal funds.\n       h. Part 2--Matters Pertaining to Investigation and \n     Prosecution of Charges of Discrimination\n       (1) Section 2.101 (Purpose and Scope). Several commenters \n     suggested that this regulation explain in more detail how the \n     General Counsel will exercise statutory authority by \n     procedural rule or policy. In response, the Board has deleted \n     this sentence from the adopted regulation.\n       (2) Section 2.102(b). A comment suggested that this \n     regulation be modified to further clarify what ``other \n     means'' can be used to ``file a charge'' other than those \n     listed in the regulation. In response, the Board has deleted \n     the reference to ``other means.''\n       (3) Section 2.102(c). Commenters suggested that this \n     regulation should be modified because subpart (2) of the \n     definition of ``the occurrence of the alleged violation'' is \n     currently phrased in a way that seems to assume that a \n     violation has occurred and is too broad because it might \n     allow a charge to be filed beyond 180 days of the date of the \n     alleged discrimination. In response to these comments, the \n     adopted regulations retain only the definition of occurrence \n     in subpart (1).\n       (4) Section 2.103. Commenters suggested modifying this \n     regulation because it appears to expand the General Counsel's \n     authority beyond what the CAA provides. For the reasons \n     stated earlier in the response to the general comments, the \n     Board disagrees with this assessment and therefore this \n     section has not been changed in the adopted regulations.\n       (5) Section 2.107(a)(2). Commenters suggested removing this \n     regulation because they believe that the CAA does not provide \n     compensatory damages as a remedy for violations of Section \n     210. After due consideration of these comments, the Board has \n     decided that the issue of what constitutes an appropriate \n     remedy should be decided on a case-by-case basis through the \n     statutory hearing and appeals process rather than by \n     regulation. It should be noted, however, that the analysis in \n     Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187 (1996) may not be applicable to \n     ADA cases under the CAA by virtue of the language in Section \n     210(b)(2) which defines ``public entity'' as including any of \n     the covered entities\n\n[[Page H562]]\n\n     listed in Section 210(a) and the language in Section 210(c) \n     which provides for ``such remedy as would be appropriate if \n     awarded under section 203 or 308(a) of the American with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990.'' These provisions, when read \n     together, may very well constitute an express waiver of \n     sovereign immunity for all damages that can be appropriately \n     awarded against a public entity, which would include \n     compensatory damages.\n       i. Part 3--Matters Pertaining to Periodic Inspections and \n     Reporting\n       (1) Section 3.101 (Purpose and Scope). Several commenters \n     suggested that this regulation explain in more detail how the \n     General Counsel will exercise statutory authority by \n     procedural rule or policy. In response, the Board has deleted \n     this sentence from the adopted regulation.\n       (2) Section 3.102 (Definitions). A commenter suggested that \n     the definition of ``facilities of a covered entity'' be \n     narrowed so that the General Counsel would only inspect \n     spaces occupied solely by a legislative branch office and \n     would not inspect common spaces, entrances or accessible \n     pathways used to access the solely occupied spaces. The Board \n     finds that such a narrow definition of ``facilities of a \n     covered entity'' would be inconsistent with the DOJ \n     regulations and the purpose of the statutory mandate to \n     inspect facilities for compliance with Titles II and III of \n     the ADA; therefore, it has not modified this definition in \n     the adopted regulations.\n       (3) Section 3.103 (Inspection Authority). Commenters \n     suggested that the General Counsel not be allowed to conduct \n     an inspection or investigation initiated by someone who \n     wishes to remain anonymous. For the reasons stated earlier in \n     response to the general comments, the Board rejects this \n     suggestion and has therefore not changed this section in the \n     adopted regulations. The Architect of the Capitol suggested \n     that, in the interest of simplicity and timeliness, Section \n     3.103(d) be shortened to: ``The Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol shall, within one year from the effective date of \n     these regulations, develop a process with the General Counsel \n     to identify potential barriers to access prior to the \n     completion of alteration and construction projects.'' Because \n     the language used in the NPRM more thoroughly describes what \n     this preconstruction process should entail, the Board does \n     not find good cause to modify this regulation in the manner \n     suggested.\n\n                          Adopted Regulations:\n\n     PART 1--MATTERS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY TO ALL REGULATIONS \n                   PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 210 OF THE \n                   CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n     Sec. 1.101 PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n     Sec. 1.102 DEFINITIONS\n     Sec. 1.103 AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD\n\n     Sec. 1.104 METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR \n       CORRECTING VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 210\n\n     Sec. 1.105 REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE\n\n     Sec. 1.101 Purpose and scope.\n       (a) CAA. Enacted into law on January 23, 1995, the \n     Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'') in Section 210(b) \n     provides that the rights and protections against \n     discrimination in the provision of public services and \n     accommodations established by sections 201 through 230, 302, \n     303, and 309 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, \n     42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 \n     (``ADA''), shall apply to the following entities:\n       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee;\n       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including \n     each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and \n     each committee;\n       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;\n       (4) the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services;\n       (5) the United States Capitol Police;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;\n       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including \n     the Botanic Garden);\n       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician; and\n       (9) the Office of Compliance;\n       Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis \n     of disability in the provision of public services, programs, \n     activities by any ``public entity.'' Section 210(b)(2) of the \n     CAA provides that for the purpose of applying Title II of the \n     ADA the term ``public entity'' means any entity listed above \n     that provides public services, programs, or activities. Title \n     III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n     disability by public accommodations and requires places of \n     public accommodation and commercial facilities to be \n     designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with \n     accessibility standards. Section 225(f) of the CAA provides \n     that, ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with definitions and \n     exemptions provided in [this Act], the definitions and \n     exemptions of the [ADA] shall apply under [this Act.]'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f)(1).\n       Section 210(d) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel \n     of the Office of Compliance accept and investigate charges of \n     discrimination filed by qualified individuals with \n     disabilities who allege a violation of Title II or Title III \n     of the ADA by a covered entity. If the General Counsel \n     believes that a violation may have occurred, the General \n     Counsel may request, but not participate in, mediation under \n     Section 403 of the CAA and may file with the Office a \n     complaint under Section 405 of the CAA against any entity \n     responsible for correcting the violation. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(d).\n       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel \n     of the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least \n     once each Congress, conduct periodic inspections of all \n     covered facilities and to report to Congress on compliance \n     with disability access standards under Section 210. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(f).\n       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set \n     forth herein (Parts 1, 2, and 3) are the substantive \n     regulations that the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance has promulgated pursuant to Section 210(e) of the \n     CAA. Part 1 contains the general provisions applicable to all \n     regulations under Section 210, the method of identifying \n     entities responsible for correcting a violation of Section \n     210, and the list of executive branch regulations \n     incorporated by reference which define and clarify the \n     prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability \n     in the provision of public services and accommodations. Part \n     2 contains the provisions pertaining to investigation and \n     prosecution of charges of discrimination. Part 3 contains the \n     provisions regarding the periodic inspections and reports to \n     Congress on compliance with the disability access standards.\n\n     Sec. 1.102 Definitions.\n\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided in these \n     regulations, as used in these regulations:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) ADA or Americans with Disabilities Act means those \n     sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     incorporated by reference into the CAA in Section 210: 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189.\n       (c) Covered entity and public entity include any of the \n     entities listed in Sec. 1.101(a) that provide public \n     services, programs, or activities, or operates a place of \n     public accommodation within the meaning of Section 210 of the \n     CAA. In the regulations implementing Title III, private \n     entity includes covered entities.\n       (d) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (e) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (f) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Office \n     of Compliance.\n\n     Sec. 1.103 Authority of the Board.\n\n       Pursuant to Sections 210 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections against discrimination on the basis of disability \n     in the provision of public services and accommodations under \n     the ADA. Section 210(e) of the CAA directs the Board to \n     promulgate regulations implementing Section 210 that are \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of Transportation to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (b) except to the extent that the Board may determine, for \n     good cause shown and stated together with the regulation, \n     that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e). \n     Specifically, it is the Board's considered judgment, based on \n     the information available to it at the time of promulgation \n     of these regulations, that, with the exception of the \n     regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no other \n     ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Attorney General \n     and the Secretary of Transportation to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (b) [of \n     Section 210 of the CAA]'' that need be adopted.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation. Such changes are intended to make the \n     provisions adopted accord more naturally to situations in the \n     Legislative Branch. However, by making these changes, the \n     Board does not intend a substantive difference between these \n     regulations and those of the Attorney General and/or the \n     Secretary of Transportation from which they are derived. \n     Moreover, such changes, in and of themselves, are not \n     intended to constitute an interpretation of the regulations \n     or of the statutory provisions of the CAA upon which they are \n     based.\n\n     Sec. 1.104 Method for identifying the entity responsible for \n       correction of violations of section 210.\n\n       (a) Purpose and scope. Section 210(e)(3) of the CAA \n     provides that regulations under Section 210(e) include a \n     method of identifying, for purposes of Section 210 of the CAA \n     and for categories of violations of Section 210(b), the \n     entity responsible for correcting a particular violation. \n     This section sets forth the method for identifying \n     responsible entities for the purpose of allocating \n     responsibility for correcting violations of Section 210(b).\n       (b) Violations. A covered entity may violate Section 210(b) \n     if it discriminates against a qualified individual with a \n     disability within the meaning of Title II or Title III of the \n     ADA.\n       (c) Entities Responsible for Correcting Violations. \n     Correction of a violation of the rights and protections \n     against discrimination is the responsibility of the entities \n     listed in subsection (a) of Section 210 of the CAA that \n     provide the specific public service, program, activity, or \n     accommodation that forms the basis for the particular \n     violation of Title II or Title III rights and protections\n\n[[Page H563]]\n\n     and, when the violation involves a physical access barrier, \n     the entities responsible for designing, maintaining, \n     managing, altering or constructing the facility in which the \n     specific public service program, activity or accommodation is \n     conducted or provided.\n       (d) Allocation of Responsibility for Correction of Title II \n     and/or Title III Violations. Where more than one covered \n     entity is found to be an entity responsible for correction of \n     a violation of Title II and/or Title III rights and \n     protections under the method set forth in this section, as \n     between those parties, allocation of responsibility for \n     correcting the violations of Title II or Title III of the ADA \n     may be determined by statute, contract, or other enforceable \n     arrangement or relationship.\n\n     Sec. 1.105 Regulations incorporated by reference.\n\n       (a) Technical and Nomenclature Changes to Regulations \n     Incorporated by Reference. The definitions in the regulations \n     incorporated by reference (``incorporated regulations''') \n     shall be used to interpret these regulations except: (1) when \n     they differ from the definitions in Sec. 1.102 or the \n     modifications listed below, in which case the definition in \n     Sec. 1.102 or the modification listed below shall be used; or \n     (2) when they define terms that are not used in the \n     incorporated regulations. The incorporated regulations are \n     hereby modified as follows:\n       (1) When the incorporated regulations refer to ``Assistant \n     Attorney General,'' ``Department of Justice,'' ``FTA \n     Administrator,'' ``FTA regional office,'' ``Administrator,'' \n     ``Secretary,'' or any other executive branch office or \n     officer, ``General Counsel'' is hereby substituted.\n       (2) When the incorporated regulations refer to the date \n     ``January 26, 1992,'' the date ``January 1, 1997'' is hereby \n     substituted.\n       (3) When the incorporated regulations otherwise specify a \n     date by which some action must be completed, the date that is \n     three years from the effective date of these regulations is \n     hereby substituted.\n       (4) When the incorporated regulations contain an exception \n     for an ``historic'' property, building, or facility, that \n     exception shall also apply to properties, buildings, or \n     facilities designated as an historic or heritage asset by the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol in accordance with its \n     preservation policy and standards and where, in accordance \n     with its preservation policy and standards, the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol determines that compliance with the \n     requirements for accessible routes, entrances, or toilet \n     facilities (as defined in 28 C.F.R. Parts 35 and 36) would \n     threaten or destroy the historic significance of the \n     property, building or facility, the exceptions for \n     alterations to qualified historic property, buildings or \n     facilities for that element shall be permitted to apply.\n       (b) Rules of Interpretation. When regulations in (c) \n     conflict, the regulation providing the most access shall \n     apply. The Board's Notice of Adoption shall be used to \n     interpret these regulations and shall be made part of these \n     Regulations as Appendix A.\n       (c) Incorporated Regulations from 28 C.F.R.

When investigating charges of \n     discrimination and conducting inspections, the General \n     Counsel is authorized to use all the modes of inquiry and \n     investigation traditionally employed or useful to execute \n     this investigatory authority. The authorized methods of \n     investigation include, but are not limited to, the following: \n     (1) requiring the parties to provide or produce ready access \n     to: all physical areas subject to an inspection or \n     investigation, individuals with relevant knowledge concerning \n     the inspection or investigation who can be interviewed or \n     questioned, and documents pertinent to the investigation; and \n     (2) requiring the parties to provide written answers to \n     questions, statements of position, and any other information \n     relating to a potential violation or demonstrating \n     compliance.\n       (b) Duty to Cooperate with Investigations. Charging \n     individuals and covered entities shall cooperate with \n     investigations conducted by the General Counsel. Cooperation \n     includes providing timely responses to reasonable requests \n     for information and documents (including the making and \n     retention of copies of records and documents), allowing the \n     General Counsel to review documents and interview relevant \n     witnesses confidentially and without managerial interference \n     or influence, and granting the General Counsel ready access \n     to all facilities where covered services, programs and \n     activities are being provided and all places of public \n     accommodation.\n\n     Sec. 2.104 Mediation.\n\n       (a) Belief that violation may have occurred. If, after \n     investigation, the General Counsel believes that a violation \n     of the ADA may have occurred and that mediation may be \n     helpful in resolving the dispute, prior to filing a \n     complaint, the General Counsel may request, but not \n     participate in, mediation under subsections (b) through (d) \n     of Section 403 of the CAA between the charging individual and \n     any entity responsible for correcting the alleged violation.\n       (b) Settlement. If, prior to the filing of a complaint, the \n     charging individual and the entity responsible for correcting \n     the violation reach a settlement agreement that fully \n     resolves the dispute, the General Counsel shall close the \n     investigation of the charge without taking further action.\n       (c) Mediation Unsuccessful. If mediation under (a) has not \n     succeeded in resolving the dispute, and if the General \n     Counsel believes that a violation of the ADA may have \n     occurred, the General Counsel may file with the Office a \n     complaint against any entity responsible for correcting the \n     violation.\n\n     Sec. 2.105 Complaint.\n\n       The complaint filed by the General Counsel shall be \n     submitted to a hearing officer for decision pursuant to \n     subsections (b) through (h) of Section 405 of the CAA. The \n     decision of the hearing officer shall be subject to review by \n     the Board pursuant to Section 406 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. 2.106 Intervention by Charging Individual.\n\n       Any person who has filed a charge may intervene as of \n     right, with the full rights of a party, whenever a complaint \n     is filed by the General Counsel.\n\n     Sec. 2.107 Remedies and Compliance.\n\n       (a) Remedy. The remedy for a violation of Section 210 of \n     the CAA shall be such remedy as would be appropriate if \n     awarded under Section 203 or 308(a) of the ADA.\n       (b) Compliance Date. Compliance shall take place as soon as \n     possible, but no later than the fiscal year following the end \n     of the fiscal year in which the order requiring correction \n     becomes final and not subject to further review.\n\n     Sec. 2.108 Judicial Review.\n\n       A charging individual who has intervened or any respondent \n     to the complaint, if aggrieved by a final decision of the \n     Board, may file a petition for review in the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, pursuant to Section \n     407 of the CAA.\n\n     PART 3--MATTERS PERTAINING TO PERIODIC INSPECTIONS AND \n                   REPORTING.\n\n     Sec. 3.101 PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n\n     Sec. 3.102 DEFINITIONS\n\n     Sec. 3.103 INSPECTION AUTHORITY\n\n     Sec. 3.104 REPORTING, ESTIMATED COST & TIME, AND COMPLIANCE \n       DATE\n\n     Sec. 3.101 Purpose and scope.\n\n       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General \n     Counsel, on a regular basis, at least once each Congress, \n     inspect the facilities of covered entities to ensure \n     compliance with the Titles II and III of the ADA and to \n     prepare and submit a report to Congress containing the \n     results of the periodic inspections, describing any \n     violations, assessing any limitations in accessibility, and \n     providing the estimated cost and time needed for abatement. \n     Part 3 of these regulations contains the provisions \n     pertaining to these inspection and reporting duties.\n\n     Sec. 3.102 Definitions.\n\n       (a) The facilities of covered entities means all facilities \n     used to provide public programs, activities, services or \n     accommodations that are designed, maintained, altered or \n     constructed by a covered entity and all facilities where \n     covered entities provide public programs, activities, \n     services or accommodations.\n       (b) Violation means any barrier to access caused by \n     noncompliance with the applicable standards.\n       (c) Estimated cost and time needed for abatement means cost \n     and time estimates that can be reported as falling within a \n     range of dollar amounts and dates.\n\n     Sec. 3.103 Inspection authority.\n\n       (a) General scope of authority. On a regular basis, at \n     least once each Congress, the General Counsel shall inspect \n     the facilities of covered entities to ensure compliance with \n     Titles II and III of the ADA. When conducting these \n     inspections, the General Counsel has the discretion to decide \n     which facilities will be inspected and how inspections will \n     be conducted. The General Counsel may receive requests for \n     ADA inspections, including anonymous requests, and conduct \n     inspections for compliance with Titles II and III of the ADA \n     in the same manner that the General Counsel receives and \n     investigates requests for inspections under Section 215(c)(1) \n     of the CAA.\n       (b) Review of information and documents. When conducting \n     inspections under Section 210(f) of the CAA, the General \n     Counsel may request, obtain, and review any and all \n     information or documents deemed by the General Counsel to be \n     relevant to a determination of whether the covered entity is \n     in compliance with Section 210 of the CAA.\n       (c) Duty to cooperate. Covered entities shall cooperate \n     with any inspection conducted by the General Counsel in the \n     manner provided by Sec. 2.103(b).\n\n[[Page H565]]\n\n       (d) Pre-construction review of alteration and construction \n     projects. Any project involving alteration or new \n     construction of facilities of covered entities are subject to \n     inspection by the General Counsel for compliance with Titles \n     II and III of the ADA during the design, pre-construction, \n     construction, and post construction phases of the project. \n     The Office of the Architect of the Capitol shall, within one \n     year from the effective date of these regulations, develop a \n     process with the General Counsel to identify potential \n     barriers to access prior to the completion of alteration and \n     construction projects that may include the following \n     provisions:\n       (1) Design review or approval;\n       (2) Inspections of ongoing alteration and construction \n     projects;\n       (3) Training on the applicable ADA standards;\n       (4) Final inspections of completed projects for compliance; \n     and\n       (5) Any other provision that would likely reduce the number \n     of ADA barriers in alterations and new construction and the \n     costs associated with correcting them.\n\n     Sec. 3.104 Reporting, estimating cost & time, and compliance \n       date.\n\n       (a) Reporting duty. On a regular basis, at least once each \n     Congress, the General Counsel shall prepare and submit a \n     report to Congress containing the results of the periodic \n     inspections conducted under Sec. 3.103(a), describing any \n     violations, assessing any limitations in accessibility, and \n     providing the estimated cost and time needed for abatement.\n       (b) Estimated cost & time. Covered entities shall cooperate \n     with the General Counsel by providing information needed to \n     provide the estimated cost and time needed for abatement in \n     the manner provided by Sec. 2.103(b).\n       (c) Compliance date. All barriers to access identified by \n     the General Counsel in its periodic reports shall be removed \n     or otherwise corrected as soon as possible, but no later than \n     the fiscal year following the end of the fiscal year in which \n     the report describing the barrier to access was issued by the \n     General Counsel.\n\n                    Recommended Method of Approval:\n\n       The Board has adopted the same regulations for the Senate, \n     the House of Representatives, and the other covered entities \n     and facilities, and therefore recommends that the adopted \n     regulations be approved by concurrent resolution of the \n     Congress.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 3rd day of February, \n     2016.\n\n                                            Barbara L. Camens,\n\n                         Chair of the Board, Office of Compliance.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       1. 28 C.F.R. Sec. 36.201(b) reads as follows: ``Landlord \n     and tenant responsibilities. Both the landlord who owns the \n     building that houses a place of public accommodation and the \n     tenant who owns or operates the place of public accommodation \n     are public accommodations subject to the requirements of this \n     part. As between the parties, allocation of responsibility \n     for complying with the obligations of this part may be \n     determined by lease or other contract.''\n       2. The DOJ's illustrations and descriptions in its \n     Technical Assistance Manuals regarding compliance with Titles \n     II and Title III by tenants and landlords make this clear. \n     See, U.S. Dept. of Justice, ADA Title III Technical \n     Assistance Manual Sec. III.-1.2000 (Nov. 1993) (``The title \n     III regulation permits the landlord and the tenant to \n     allocate responsibility, in the lease, for complying with \n     particular provisions of the regulation. However, any \n     allocation made in a lease or other contract is only \n     effective as between the parties, and both landlord and \n     tenant remain fully liable for compliance with all provisions \n     of the ADA relating to that place of public \n     accommodation.''); U.S. Dept. of Justice, ADA Title II \n     Technical Assistance Manual Sec. II.-1.3000 (Nov. 1993) (Both \n     manuals are available online at www.ada.gov). Also see, \n     Gabreille P. Whelan, Comment, The ``Public Access'' \n     Provisions of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act, 34 Santa Clara L. Rev. 215, 217-18 (1993).\n       3. Several commenters correctly noted that the NPRM \n     contains a technical error because the year (2004) was \n     omitted from the C.F.R. citation, which was a potential \n     source of confusion because the regulation was removed from \n     the C.F.R. in 2004 when the substance of the regulation \n     became part of the ABA Guidelines at Sec. F202.6. \n     Fortunately, all of the commenters were sufficiently able to \n     ascertain the subject matter of the proposed regulation to \n     participate fully in the rulemaking process by providing \n     detailed comments about the proposed regulation, which is all \n     that is required of a NPRM. See e.g., Am. Iron & Steel Inst. \n     v. EPA, 568 F.2d 284, 293 (3d Cir. 1977); United Steelworkers \n     v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 1980); and Am. \n     Med. Ass'n v. United States, 887 F.2d 760, 767 (7th Cir. \n     1989).\n       4. Under Sec. F202.6 of the ABAAG, ``Buildings or \n     facilities for which new leases are negotiated by the Federal \n     government after the effective date of the revised standards \n     issued pursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act, including \n     new leases for buildings or facilities previously occupied by \n     the Federal government, shall comply with F202.6.'' F202.6 \n     then proceeds to describe the requirements for an accessible \n     route to primary function areas, toilet and bathing \n     facilities, parking, and other elements and spaces. The ABAAG \n     became the ABA Accessibility Standards (``ABAAS'') on May 17, \n     2005 when the GSA adopted them as the standards. See 41 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 102 76.65(a) (2005).\n       5. These features include at least one accessible route to \n     primary function areas, at least one accessible toilet \n     facility for each sex (or an accessible unisex toilet \n     facility if only one toilet is provided), accessible parking \n     spaces, and, where provided, accessible drinking fountains, \n     fire alarms, public telephones, dining and work surfaces, \n     assembly areas, sales and service counters, vending and \n     change machines, and mail boxes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/house-section/article/H565-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H565-H566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS, ETC.\n\n  Under clause 2 of rule XIV, executive communications were taken from \nthe Speaker's table and referred as follows:\n\n       4203.
