The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, the voting was going on for months \nspearheaded by the Women on 20s campaign. A nominee was announced last \nweek. Women on 20s is a campaign that has been agitating to have a \nwoman's portrait, the portrait of a great American woman, placed on the \n$20 bill by at least 2020, the 100th anniversary of the U.S. \nrecognizing a woman's right to vote.\n  The Women on 20s campaign narrowed down their nominees for this honor \nto four women: Wilma Mankiller, a trailblazer and first woman chief of \nthe Cherokees; Rosa Parks, credited with starting the Montgomery bus \nboycott by not relinquishing her seat and sparking the modern civil \nrights movement in 1955; Harriet Tubman, an abolitionist born a slave \nwho became one of the most noted conductors on the Underground \nRailroad; and Eleanor Roosevelt, who redefined the role of First Lady \nwhile being a noted civil rights and human rights activist in her own \nright.\n  More than 600,000 votes were cast in an online poll, and the winner \nannounced with great fanfare last week is Harriet Tubman. I am \noverjoyed that this great American leader was selected.\n  As the author of Put a Woman On the Twenty Act of 2015, H.R. 1910, I \nthink matching a specific person with a specific biography will sharpen \nthe focus of this remarkable grassroots effort to put a woman's face on \nour currency. My legislation does not limit the idea of putting a woman \non our money to Harriet Tubman or any particular nominee. It instructs \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to convene the citizen panel that will \nmake recommendations and get it done.\n  From my perspective, as we see women breaking barriers at every level \nof our society and as we see people of color breaking barriers at every \nlevel of our society, our money ought to more accurately reflect who we \nare as a nation in the 21st century.\n  I am not saying that Andrew Jackson or any of the men we honor on our \nmoney are not worthy. Many of our Founding Fathers made important \ncontributions to this country which we continue to enjoy today in the \nUnited States and throughout the world by the spread of democracy.\n  It is also true that part of our history includes the practices and \ndecisions we certainly are not proud of as a nation. Let's be straight: \nPresident Jackson was, for many, a war hero, a great defender of the \nyoung American Republic and, really, the first President and founder of \nthe Democratic Party. He oversaw our Nation as it expanded west. It is \nthe expansion of this Nation, the manifest destiny that pushed settlers \nwest, that pushed the institution of slavery west, and that pushed the \nextermination and forced migration of Native peoples west.\n  That is precisely the nexus of Andrew Jackson and Harriet Tubman and \nillustrates why putting a new face on our money makes so much sense. \nThe forced removal of Native peoples from their lands so that we could \nexpand the practice of slavery is at the heart of Andrew Jackson's \nlegacy. The landgrab and the Trail of Tears of the Cherokee people is \nkey to contextualizing President Jackson.\n  It was when Harriet Tubman was about 6 years old that Jackson became \nPresident. She was born a slave in Maryland and eventually walked to \nfreedom in Pennsylvania. She went back again and again, at least 19 \ntimes, telling more than 300 former slaves how to follow the Big Dipper \nconstellation that pointed to the North Star and the way to freedom to \nthe north.\n  She was an agitator. She was a subversive. She used the tools of \nsocial change to improve America. She fought for the little guy against \nthe strong guy. She was willing to put herself at great risk to ensure \njustice for others. She was a woman, and she was Black. In other words, \nshe is an ideal American.\n  The other women honored as nominees by the Women on 20s campaign were \nalso great Americans. They were also subversive troublemakers, \nagitators, and, therefore, exactly the kind of people I think we need \non our currency. But Harriet Tubman, because she is a woman, because \nshe is a woman of color, because she fought for\n\n[[Page H3394]]\n\nfreedom and for a better America in the face of this Nation's greatest \nand, for many like me, still unresolved sin of slavery and racism, \nbecause she turned the tide of history for the better, she is very, \nvery worthy of this great honor.\n  In a few years, maybe in a few months, we will all wonder why it took \nso long to put an American woman on our $20 bill. Well, it shouldn't \ntake so long. Members of this body, Mr. Speaker, have the ability to do \nsomething about it and speed this process along.\n  Cosponsor the Put a Woman on the Twenty Act of 2015. It is H.R. 1910. \nJoin me in calling on the Secretary of the Treasury to do this, whether \nit is Harriet Tubman or anyone else that a fair and open process \narrives at. Let us stand as a Congress to put a great American woman on \nour money.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3394-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HOUSTON POLICE OFFICER--RICHARD MARTIN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in the early morning hours of Monday, \nwhile most of the city was asleep, the diligent Houston Police \nDepartment responded to a robbery call at an Exxon service station.\n  The lawmen approach the scene, and they see a suspect speed off in \nwhat turned out to be a stolen U-Haul truck. The police follow the \ntruck, and the high-speed chase is on.\n  The outlaw abandons the truck, carjacks a woman, pushes her out of \nthe minivan, and continues his flight. The outlaw fires shots at the \npolice and keeps fleeing in the darkness of the morning hours.\n  Houston Police Officer Richard Martin, aware of the chase and ahead \nof it, jumps out of his patrol car and starts placing spike strips on \nthe road to stop the approaching vehicle. The criminal sees Officer \nMartin and intentionally runs over him and kills him. Then the criminal \ncontinues on a 20-mile run from the law in the city of Houston.\n  He is later cornered by the police in a standoff, and then he shoots \nhimself and is taken to the hospital. As he lingered in the hospital, \nthe district attorney, Devon Anderson, prepared capital murder charges \nagainst him, but the killer died, thus avoiding the hangman.\n  The outlaw had a long criminal history.\n  Officer Richard Martin was a Houston police officer. He was 47 years \nof age. He had only been a peace officer for 4 years, and he worked at \nthe Westside patrol division.\n  Prior to being a police officer, he had been in private industry for \n20 years. Officer Martin was also a veteran. He spent 4 years on Active \nDuty in the United States Air Force, then spent 8 years as a reservist \nin the United States Air Force.\n  Being a police officer was his ultimate goal, so in his early \nforties, he became a Houston police officer. In just 4 short years, \nOfficer Martin became a field officer. His captain said that he crammed \n20 years of policing in the 4 years that he served as a Houston police \nofficer. This speaks volume about his character as a lawman.\n  He was the father of two, a 22-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old \nson; and he loved being actively involved in his children's lives, \nincluding his son's baseball team.\n  Mr. Speaker, just last week, our Nation celebrated National Police \nWeek, honoring the daily sacrifices of peace officers like Officer \nMartin.\n  Just across the way here, on the west side of the Capitol, last \nFriday, the families of those who had lost peace officers were here, \nsurrounded by thousands and thousands of other police officers and the \npublic to show their respect for those who are killed in the line of \nduty; and how quickly we are reminded, again, of their sacrifices.\n  Officer Martin's life was callously and coldly robbed and stolen from \nus and his family, and the Houston community is now in mourning.\n  Our first responders are a special breed, those like Officer Richard \nMartin. They work selflessly to maintain and restore order in \ncommunities and neighborhoods across America. While we sleep, those \nthat wear the badge are vigilantly and always on patrol, protecting us \nfrom the evil ones.\n  For these remarkable men and women, their safety is never guaranteed. \nWhile the badge and the uniform represents safety for citizens, it is a \ntarget for the unlawful.\n  We do take comfort in the fact that as long as criminals walk and \nwander our streets looking to do mischief, refusing to follow the law, \npeace officers will always be there on patrol, officers like Richard \nMartin.\n  Officer Martin was one of those officers. He was one of Houston's \nfinest. Friday, the city of Houston will lay to rest Officer Richard \nMartin. Peace officers will wear the black cloth ribbon of sacrifice \nacross their badges as they stand in silent mourning for one of their \nbrothers in blue.\n  The bagpipes will play ``Amazing Grace,'' and the flags will be \nlowered, as yet one more of our best is laid to rest for sacrificing \nhis life for the rest of us. Peace officers wear the badge over their \nheart as a symbol of their willingness to put themselves between us and \nthe lawless.\n  Officer Martin was a noble citizen who represented everything that is \ngood and right about our society. With heavy hearts, we send prayers \nand thoughts to his family and those of the thin blue line in the \nHouston Police Department.\n  We thank Officer Martin for giving his life for our town.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3394-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3394-H3396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Lance) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 150th \nanniversary of the incorporation of the town of Clinton in Hunterdon \nCounty, New Jersey. Established as a separate municipality in 1865, \nClinton has a rich history and is known for its natural beauty and \nsense of community.\n  The 2010 Census counted the town's population at 2,719.\n  As the recently deceased Clinton town historian and longtime mayor, \nAllie McGaheran, has written, the area was settled on the convergence \nof two rivers, the Spruce Run and the south branch of the Raritan, \nsurrounded by excellent farmland, attracting English and German \nsettlers. One of those settlers, David McKenny, built two mills \ndirectly across the river from each other.\n  These treasured mills--the first dating to 1810--now the Red Mill \nMuseum Village and the Hunterdon Museum of Art, were owned by Daniel \nHunt, the namesake of the town's first moniker, Hunt's Mill. These \nmills have been the center of Clinton's economic and cultural life for \ntwo centuries.\n  Later, mill owners John Taylor and John Bray championed renaming the \ntown after DeWitt Clinton, the builder of the Erie Canal and Governor \nof New York.\n  A limestone quarry, located immediately behind the Red Mill, brought \nanother wave of settlers, including Irish immigrants crossing the ocean \nto establish a better life for themselves and their families in the new \nworld.\n  The present municipal building, a handsome Victorian structure, was \nthe residence of John Leigh, a brick maker and farmer who served as the \ntown's second mayor. The Lehigh Valley Railroad provided passenger and \nfreight access, contributing greatly to the growth and wealth of the \ntown in the 19th century.\n  Clinton has a large historic district that is on the State and \nnational historic registers. There are five historic sites: the two \nmills; the music hall that entertained generations of residents; the \noriginal Grandin Library, named for artist and philanthropist Elizabeth \nGrandin in the last century; and the quarry.\n  The 150th anniversary of Clinton is being celebrated with parades, \nfarmers' markets, art displays, performances, and other community \nevents.\n  I thank and congratulate Megan Jones-Holt for her work as chair of \nthe 150th anniversary committee. She and her husband, former mayor and \ncurrent Hunterdon County Freeholder Matt Holt, do so very much for the \ntown civically.\n  Clinton is governed by the town form of government, with a mayor and \nsix council members. Mayor Janice Kovach and the governing body of the \ntown are greatly involved in the yearlong festivities. Clinton is \nserved by a dedicated volunteer fire company and rescue squad. Its \nbeautiful and historic churches are an integral part of the community.\n  The Clinton-Glen Gardner School District educates children through \nthe eighth grade. High school students attend North Hunterdon High \nSchool in neighboring Clinton Township, one of our State's strongest \npublic elementary and secondary schools. My twin brother, Jim, and I \nare proud graduates of the high school.\n  My own family has been involved in the history of Clinton for many \ngenerations. My great uncle was president of the local bank, and my \nfather practiced law in the town for 70 years.\n  In his essay, ``The Inspiration of Clinton,'' Stephen Shoeman notes: \n``Everybody in Clinton smiles. Everybody is friendly. America is \nbeautiful because of Clinton, New Jersey, and the other towns and \nvillages just like it.''\n  This year's celebration comes 1 year after the tricentennial of \nHunterdon County, a yearlong retelling of Hunterdon County's storied \nfounding and its 300-year journey in advancement from the English \ncolonies in North America to its present-day status as one of America's \npremier places to live and work.\n  Clinton's history is ingrained in the fabric of Hunterdon County. We \nhave also just celebrated New Jersey's 350th anniversary.\n  Public-spirited residents have worked to keep Clinton beautiful and \nthe epitome of small-town American life. Their efforts maintain a \ncharming and vibrant merchant district, excellent public schools, \nmeaningful cultural events, and significant engagement in public \naffairs.\n  The town of Clinton thrives on neighborly camaraderie. I am deeply \nhonored to represent the town here in the House of Representatives. And \nall who love Clinton congratulate the town on its landmark celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3396-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3396-H3397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the near hysteria over trade promotion \nauthority and the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership, the so-called TPP, \nis unfortunate because it is so misguided. The stakes are too high to \nget it wrong, and the negative arguments are unfortunate because they \nare so wrong.\n  Being against TPP, which has yet to be finished, is premature, at \nbest. Being against the TPA is misguided because those provisions \nguarantee people will actually know the details and have stronger tools \nto evaluate whether it is worthy of support.\n  The trade agenda and the role of America in the global economy has \nbeen front and center in Congress over the last few weeks, and well it \nshould be. The United States has an opportunity to make further inroads \nin 95 percent of the markets that are outside our borders and to be \nable to gain that access under more favorable terms.\n  Businesses large and small that want to sell their products overseas \nrun into much more difficult barriers, procedures, and costs than \npeople who sell their goods to America, which has one of the most open \nmarkets in the world.\n  In Oregon, there are two competing narratives: those who are opposed \nto further competition for American goods in American markets, fearing \na loss of business and jobs; and those who see significant opportunity \nselling goods and services abroad, creating more family-wage jobs at \nhome.\n  The people I talk to in Oregon who are in business overwhelmingly \nsupport that access. They feel they have far more to gain than they \nhave to lose, selling more wine, bicycles, agricultural products, and \nsmall tools. They think they can compete overseas, creating family-wage \njobs at home, if that playing field is level.\n  There are others who are deeply concerned that this perceived \nleveling of the playing field will not be achieved. They are concerned \nabout a lack of labor and environmental standards overseas.\n  Having spent time with the people who are negotiating the agreements, \nhaving reviewed documents myself, and working to reflect Oregon values \nand interests, these agreements, I am confident, hold promise for \nOregon. But it is too soon to tell for sure because the agreement is \nstill being negotiated, and people like me are still trying to \ninfluence it to make it stronger still. For instance, I have provisions \nI am working on in both the House and the Senate to provide an \nenforcement mechanism.\n  As the agreement potentially enters its final stages, where there are \nsome of the more difficult concessions with decisions yet to be made, \nthe United States and other countries are reluctant to show their full \nhand while things are in flux.\n  That is why the trade promotion authority that is working its way \nthrough the Senate--and may be in front of the House early in June--is \nso important.\n  This trade promotion authority is a significant enhancement over any \nsimilar provision in the past. It guarantees that the entire country--\nnot just Congress--will be able to examine all of the provisions 2 \nmonths before the President even signs the agreement and for months \nafter that, before Congress votes. The authority also sets out \nprovisions that speak to the concerns I have heard about for years \nabout the weaknesses in NAFTA, not having enforceable, strong \nprovisions for environment and labor.\n  That is why I thought it was important to vote to establish these \nrules\n\n[[Page H3397]]\n\nwhich were significantly strengthened and made more transparent as a \nresult of the tremendous efforts on behalf of my friend and colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Ron Wyden, in the Senate.\n  If an agreement is reached under these new rules, we will have the \nstrongest standards ever to evaluate a trade agreement, and everyone in \nAmerica will be able to evaluate for themselves, not conjure up some \nsort of speculation. They will have months to do what I am going to do: \nsee if this agreement is in the best interest of the people in Oregon \nwho I represent. If it is, then they, like I, will support it. If it is \nnot, then I will do, as I have sometimes done in the past, and vote \n``no'' on things I don't think measure up.\n  The time to draw the lines in the sand ``yes'' or ``no'' is after an \nagreement is reached, not before. And thanks to the new trade promotion \nauthority, everyone will have an opportunity to make that judgment for \nthemselves well in advance of any decision that Congress makes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3397-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Kinzinger) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I remember a few years ago \nvisiting Israel, standing in the Golan Heights and looking to the \nborder of Syria. At this time, our guide began talking about the \npeaceful protests in Syria, the beginning of an era of discontent.\n  As I looked into the seemingly peaceful area, I never imagined the \ncarnage that was to come: children who on that day attended school, \nfilled with hope for the future and with dreams of becoming a \nbusinessman, a policeman, an architect, or any of the host of things \nbuilding in the minds of such a young person at that age; children and \nparents who did not know that in a few short years, their lives would \nbe cut down by a ruthless dictator, bent on keeping power at all cost.\n  As the peaceful protests built in strength, Bashar al-Assad responded \nin violence. And so began what history will likely judge to be the \nstart of among the most brutal times in Middle East modern history.\n  Bashar-al Assad began using barrel bombs indiscriminately against \ninnocent people and infamously gassed thousands who struggled to get \nthat last breath of life, only to choke to death, completely aware that \nthat breath would be their last.\n  As family members died, others joined a group later dubbed the Free \nSyrian Army, a group the President referred to as a bunch of \npharmacists, lawyers, and businessmen, all standing up to reclaim what \nwas theirs rightfully, which was a free Syria. And they fight bravely \nfor a free Syria today.\n  Through the carnage of this terrible war, a more nefarious group \nbegan to assemble, a group not concerned with human carnage but \ninspired by it; a group not fighting to protect life but fighting to \ncut it down; and a group not inspired by freedom of religion but \ninspired by a hollow and a shallow world view. The group today is now \nknown as ISIS.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Mr. Speaker, before the world paid any attention, this group occupied \nnot just parts of Syria, but also Fallujah, an area fought with \nAmerican blood and treasure to bring peace and stability to the people \nof Iraq. The border of Syria and Iraq was torn down, and the world \ncontinued to sleep.\n  I called for America to lead airstrikes against this fledgling group \nat that time numbering in the low four figures. The reaction I received \nwas not unexpected: people angry that I was interested in starting \n``Iraq War III.'' Yet as this cancer continued to grow, the carnage \nbecame worse, and today we find ourselves engaged in limited action \nagainst a group growing in numbers faster than they are being \ndispatched by our airplanes.\n  Americans feel saddened that the areas that our brave military \nmembers fought so hard to win was being thrown away to political \nexpedience, and I am one of those people. I spent a little bit of time \nin Iraq, on behalf of the United States Air Force, flying airplanes, \nand I just saw a week ago or a few days ago that Ramadi, the capital of \nAnbar province, where we saw so much success in the Sunni awakening, \nhas fallen to ISIS.\n  Now, by the way, Anbar and Ramadi serve as a transportation center \nfor getting goods from Jordan and Syria into Baghdad and are resupply \nroutes for ISIS. So we are seeing not overmuch success in Iraq. But \nlest we think this fight is limited to just Iraq, all we have to do is \nlook all over the world and all over the Middle East and see ISIS' \ninfluence, from folks arrested near my district in the United States \nattempting to join and support ISIS, to the problems we see in Lebanon \nand in Saudi Arabia, and as we see ISIS grow and develop in Libya. This \nis something that, Mr. Speaker, the President has got to get a control \non and reassert American leadership.\n  We also see that these terrorist groups, these jihadist groups, are \ncoming under the umbrella of ISIS, whether it is al Shabaab, Boko \nHaram, or al Qaeda in Yemen, or we see the Taliban beginning to join \nunder this supposedly successful group.\n  What is it we need to do to push them back? In Iraq, I believe we \nneed to use the number of troops and the amount of military force \nnecessary to destroy ISIS and not just necessary to follow the \nPresident's promise of no troops on the ground. I don't think we need \nanother 200,000 troops in Iraq, and I haven't heard a single person \nactually ever suggest that, but we need to use what is necessary to \npush this back.\n  By the way, the American military is fierce and desperate to do what \nneeds to be done, and they are ready to do what the American people and \nthe President calls on.\n  Lastly, ISIS must be destroyed in Syria; and you can not destroy ISIS \nin Syria without destroying the incubator of ISIS, who is the evil \ndictator, Bashar al Assad. There are negotiations in progress now, but \nuntil the Syrian people know that the American people stand behind them \nthrough a no-fly zone and other means, ISIS will not be destroyed in \nSyria until that point.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time for the President to stand up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3397-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3397-H3398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REESTABLISH THE GOLDEN FLEECE AWARD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, at a time when our Nation is currently over \n$18 trillion in debt, we must carefully scrutinize our government \nprograms to ensure that we are funding essential programs, policies, \nand projects while eliminating frivolous and wasteful spending.\n  Every day in the news, Americans hear of government waste, fraud, \nabuse, and regulations that are hindering our small businesses and \ncosting American taxpayers billions of dollars that could be better \nspent in creating jobs and boosting our economy.\n  Today, I rise to establish the Golden Fleece Award to once again \nuncover and bring public attention to the wasteful spending across our \nFederal Government. The Golden Fleece Award will highlight some of the \nmost egregious examples of government waste of hard-working taxpayers' \ndollars and will shed new light on some of the rampant, unnecessary \nspending by our Federal agencies.\n  The inspiration behind the Golden Fleece Award was pioneered by the \nDemocratic U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, Bill Proxmire, in March 1975. \nFor the next 13 years, Senator Proxmire went on to issue bulletins \nannouncing a monthly Golden Fleece Award. The Golden Fleece Award \nbecame a staple in the U.S. Senate during this time. Senator Robert \nByrd once stated that the awards were ``as much a part of the Senate as \nquorum calls and filibusters.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the Golden Fleece Award will once again serve as an \nimportant reminder that taxpayers need to watch, control, and provide \nthe necessary reforms, through this Congress, about Federal spending \nand regulations.\n  I will utilize social media and the Internet to provide a unique \nplatform for my constituents to share with me examples that they spot, \nthat they see, of waste of our Federal Government resources by using, \n#goldenfleeceoversight on Twitter, or emailing me at \ngoldenfleece@mail.house.gov. I have\n\n[[Page H3398]]\n\nalso established a Web site that allows users to submit their \nrecommendations for future Golden Fleece Awards at hill.house.gov/\ngoldenfleece.\n  Americans are crying out for accountability from our leaders, and I \nlook forward to working with them and my colleagues to spot waste and \nfind ways to effectively eliminate that kind of spending and regulatory \noverreach in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3398-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DO UNTO OTHERS AS WE WOULD HAVE THEM DO UNTO US\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the great Mahalia Jackson was a \ngospel singer. The great singer and civil rights activist Mahalia \nJackson, once proclaimed by Harry Belafonte to be the most powerful \nwoman in America, the great Mahalia Jackson gave us some words to live \nby, some words that can add meaning to life. She, in one of her songs, \nindicated that, and I shall paraphrase, if I can help somebody as I \ntravel along, then my living shall not be in vain. Live not in vain; \nhelp somebody--that is the essence of the message that she presented.\n  I am here today to speak of persons who are in harm's way and who are \nsuffering. The people of Nepal have had two earthquakes visited upon \nthem: one a 7.8 magnitude, the other a 7.3 magnitude. These two \nearthquakes have done great damage. More than 8,000 people are dead. I \nam looking at the statistical information: more than 16,000 injured, 8 \nmillion persons affected, nearly 500,000 homes destroyed, another \n200,000-plus damaged. They are still in harm's way, but there is \nsomething we can do. We can do unto others as we would have them do to \nus if we had suffered a similar tragedy.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a great opportunity for us to do something to \nhelp without actually expending a lot of American dollars, although we \nhave spent quite a bit. I am proud to say that the United States has \naccorded approximately $40 million to this effort--$40 million. It will \ntake a lot more, but the United States is involved in doing its part. \nWe have had our rescue teams there; and one of our rescue teams, \nunfortunately, suffered some tragedy. One of our military helicopters \nwent down. We have lost lives there. People have been there living not \nin vain, trying to do what they can to be of assistance, doing unto \nothers as we would have them do for us under similar circumstances.\n  One of the things that we can do is sign on to a bill that will allow \nthose persons who are in this country from Nepal, who are here \nlawfully, to stay in this country for an extended period of time while \ntheir country is recovering. H.R. 2033 affords Nepalese who are in the \nUnited States of America to stay for a while longer. They will not have \ntheir status in the country change. They won't become persons on a \npathway to citizenship. They will simply have more time here. We will \nnot send them back in harm's way. We will do unto them what we would \nhave them do unto us if we were in a similar circumstance.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill has many persons who are supporting it. More \nthan 50 persons have supported this piece of legislation. I am proud to \nsay that some of the persons who have supported it are persons who have \ngreat Nepalese communities, and there are others who do not. They just \nwant to be of help.\n  I want to mention a few whose names I did not mention when I \nmentioned names previously, or I did not state them correctly. This is \na chance for me to correct the Record: Congressman Mike Capuano, \nCongressman Tony Cardenas, Congressman Joe Crowley, Congressman Mark \nDeSaulnier, Congressman Raul Grijalva, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, \nCongressman Jared Polis, Congressman Charles Rangel, Congressman Cedric \nRichmond, Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, and Congresswoman Linda \nSanchez--all persons who are supportive, along with many others, nearly \n50.\n  I am proud to say that the community in Houston, the Nepalese \ncommunity has come together, and they have a goal of raising $100,000. \nThey have exceeded that goal, under the leadership of Mr. Ghimirey and \nMr. Nepal. They have exceeded the goal of $100,000, and they are still \nraising additional funds.\n  I believe that H.R. 2033 affords all of us to live not in vain. I \nthink this is a great opportunity to do unto others as we would have \nthem do unto us. I ask that we support H.R. 2033 and live not in vain. \nHelp somebody as we travel along our way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3398-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

My colleagues, next week marks the 1-year anniversary \nsince General Eric Shinseki resigned as the Secretary of the Veterans \nAffairs Department.\n  At the time, the President promised reform. He said: ``The number one \npriority is making sure that problems get fixed.''\n  Instead of a new day at the VA, the American people are still seeing \nmore of the same. Last year, Congress gave the VA Secretary new \nauthority to fire employees. While some 110 VA facilities kept secret \nlists to hide their wait times, just one person has been fired--one.\n  What the hell happened to the rest of them? Some got to retire with \ntheir benefits, some got transfers, some got paid leave, some got a \nslap on the wrist. All of them went on collecting checks from \ntaxpayers. If only the Veterans Administration did half as good a job \nof taking care of our veterans as they do the bureaucrats, we would be \nin a lot better shape.\n  Congress also gave the VA more than $16 billion to improve care and \nto shorten waiting times, yet the number of patients facing long waits \nis about the same. The number of patients waiting more than 90 days has \ndoubled. At this point, the VA can't even build a hospital. Just about \nevery project ends up years behind schedule and hundreds of millions, \nif not billions, over cost.\n  Last week, the public learned that the VA is spending $6 billion a \nyear illegally. An internal report exposed examples of overspending on \nconferences, improper gifts, inappropriate purchases, and promotional \nitems--again, if only VA bureaucrats did as good a job taking care of \nour veterans as they do themselves.\n  The author of the report at the VA wrote, ``doors are swung wide open \nfor fraud, waste, and abuse,'' and that these actions ``may potentially \nresult in serious harm or death to America's veterans.''\n  That is their own expert saying this.\n  This isn't run-of-the-mill incompetence. It is arrogance; and it is \narrogance that allows our veterans to be lied to, ignored, and, \nfrankly, left to die.\n  My colleagues, it is almost Memorial Day. This is when we slow down \nand reflect on the debt of gratitude that we owe to our heroes.\n  I commend Chairman Miller and all of the members of the Veterans \nAffairs' Committee for striving every day to fulfill this obligation. \nCongress will continue to pass legislation to hold the VA accountable, \nbut only the administration can change the culture from within.\n  The President owes the American people a real, long-term plan to fix \nthe VA--not a promise, not a pledge, not rearranging the chairs on a \ndeck--a real plan to clean up this mess.\n  I will keep coming back to this podium until the administration \nproduces such a plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3399-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOLVO OCEAN RACE\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE.

Under heavy machine gun fire, Sergeant Dietz \nadvanced forward, clearing enemy obstacles, providing a path for the \nmen of his squad and platoon. This selfless act enabled the success of \nthis attack; but in the process, Sergeant Dietz lost his life.\n  With strong local support, we submitted a bill to rename the post \noffice in Kingston for Sergeant Dietz. Yesterday that bill passed in \nthe Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I thank Chairman \nChaffetz, his committee, and the entire New York delegation for their \nstrong support; and I look forward to its passage in the full House \nsoon.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we approach Memorial Day weekend, we pause to \nremember Sergeant Dietz and all those men and women who lost their \nlives in defense of our freedoms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3399-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BRING BACK OUR GIRLS\n\n  (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. WILSON of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary \nof the Head Start program.\n  Head Start is near and dear to my heart. I began my career as a Head \nStart teacher in the Chicago public schools. I have never forgotten how \nthe program made a monumental difference for its students, and this \nCongress should not forget those kids either.\n  Since its inception, Head Start has served 32 million children in all \n50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. \nterritories. Last year, in my home State of Illinois, there were 130 \nearly Head Start and Head Start providers providing quality teachers.\n  And there is an economic impact. Head Start accounted for more than \n7,950 jobs in Illinois last year. Yet sequestration cuts have done \nserious damage to the programs in Illinois and around the Nation. In my \nState alone, more than $16.5 million in funding has been cut, 1,900 \nchildren went unserved, and 549 jobs were lost.\n  Certainly none of us was elected to keep young children in need from \ngetting an education. We should celebrate the 50th anniversary by fully \nfunding Head Start and eliminating the sequester because every child in \nour country deserves a quality education and a good start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3400-6", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3400-H3401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    VETERANS DESERVE ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week, an internal \nreport from the Department of Veterans Affairs revealed that the \nDepartment annually spends $6 billion on illegal contracts and out-of-\ncontrol spending. This fraud is unacceptable, an insult to the men and \nwomen who have risked their lives in service to our country. \nUnfortunately, this lack of accountability at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs is all too common under President Obama's failed \nleadership.\n  Our veterans deserve the best care, and I will continue working to \ngive our veterans the treatment they have earned as promoted by \nVeterans' Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller of Florida. Congress has worked \nto promote change at the VA. For example, this week, we passed the \nEnsuring VA Accountability Act, sponsored by Congressman Ryan Costello. \nThis bipartisan effort clearly demonstrates meaningful reforms for our \nveterans and military families.\n  I hope President Obama can live up to his commitment to end delays \nand denial of services to our veterans.\n\n[[Page H3401]]\n\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3401-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF HEAD START\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nand celebrate May as National Foster Care Month and welcome many of the \nfoster care youth who are visiting the House of Representatives today.\n  This year's theme is ``Get to Know the Many Faces of Foster Care.'' \nThe goal of this special month is to celebrate the experiences of the \nmore than 400,000 youth in the child welfare system and raise awareness \nabout their needs.\n  Mr. Speaker, the foster care system has and always will hold a \nspecial place in my heart. When I was 11 years old, my family welcomed \na foster care child, Bob, into our home. Bob, throughout the years, has \ntaught me so much and will be my brother for life.\n  Today I have the honor of being shadowed for the day by Nyeelah Innis \nof Newnan, Georgia. Nyeelah has been in foster care for 8 years, with \nher first foster care setting starting when she was 10 years old. Mr. \nSpeaker, in just\n\n[[Page H3402]]\n\nthese few hours, Nyeelah has impressed me with her positive attitude \nand eagerness to learn about the legislative branch of our Federal \nGovernment. I know for certain that this young lady has a very bright \nfuture ahead, like so many other youth whom we will see through the \nHalls of Congress today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3402-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1230\n                 CONGRESSIONAL FOSTER YOUTH SHADOW DAY\n\n  (Ms. BASS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today in celebration of \n63 foster youth and 63 bipartisan Members of Congress who are \nparticipating in the fourth annual Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth \nShadow Day experience.\n  The goal of this event is to give foster youth the opportunity to \nshare their unique experience with Members of Congress, as well as gain \nintimate insight into the legislative process.\n  Far too often, we legislate from a glass tower, far removed from the \npeople and places that our laws affect. Shadow Day was created to \naddress this very issue, empowering foster youth from across the \ncountry to come to our Nation's Capital and share their stories, while \ngiving Members of Congress the opportunity to learn from the very young \npeople whose lives we genuinely want to improve.\n  Shadowing me today is Briana, a beautiful young woman from my \nhometown of Los Angeles. Briana became an open case of the department \nof child and family services at the age of 15 due to abuse by her \nfather. Multiple placements, neglect, and instability defined her \nfoster care experience.\n  As she pursues her bachelor's degree in accounting at Dillard \nUniversity in New Orleans, Briana strives to voice the real concerns of \nfoster youth and give strength to her foster peers by moving towards \nchange. Briana's ultimate goal is to become a foster care advocate, \nencouraging other youth like her to stand up for themselves in the \nchild welfare system.\n  I look forward to hearing more about Briana's experience and \nlistening to her legislative recommendations. Thank you, Briana, for \nyour resiliency and your commitment to reforming the child welfare \nsystem.\n  In honor of Briana and the other 62 foster youth here on the Hill, I \ninvite my colleagues to join the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3402-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH\n\n  (Mr. MARINO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize May as National \nFoster Care Month.\n  On September 30, 2012, there was an estimated 400,000 children in \nfoster care. Sixty-five percent of foster children experience at least \nseven school changes while in care. Fifty percent of former foster and \nprobation youth become homeless within the first 18 months of \nemancipation.\n  My foster shadow today is Damara. She is from Pennsylvania, and we \nare exchanging some great ideas about foster care.\n  All children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent home. Please \nbecome a foster care parent. My wife and I are foster care parents and \nassociated with working with children throughout my life. We have \nprovided so much for them, but equally important, they have provided so \nmuch for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3402-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GREEN SCHOOLS\n\n  (Mr. ASHFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ASHFORD.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate on behalf of a \ncause near and dear to my heart, fixing our mental health system.\n  As some of you may know, I have a family member with a mental \nillness. This has allowed me to witness firsthand where our system \nfails those with a mental illness and to see where the opportunities \nare for improvement.\n  As part of my effort to bring about change to New Hampshire's mental \nhealth system, I joined my colleague, Representative Kuster, last week \nin hosting a mental health summit with local advocates, healthcare \nproviders, and New Hampshire lawmakers.\n  These experts are essential in the fight to reform and strengthen our \nmental health system. It is with their feedback, perspective, and \nopinion that myself, Representative Kuster, and my colleagues in \nCongress can devise bipartisan solutions to fix this very important \nissue.\n  Together, we can bring about real bipartisan change for individuals \nand families affected by mental illness. We need to change this to a \npatient-centered and metrics-driven environment to ensure that Granite \nState patients and their families are provided with the necessary care, \nsupport, and resources they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3402-5", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. TITUS.

There is a \nthriving Filipino district along Maryland Parkway.

Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 50th anniversary of \nHead Start, a wonderful success story that empowered 32 million \nchildren in America.\n  Unfortunately, the future of Head Start today stands in grave peril \ndue to the misplaced priorities of the Republican budget which cuts \n$759 billion from nondefense discretionary funds and will result in \n35,000 fewer children participating in Head Start.\n  House Democrats want to embrace the future by investing in early \nchildhood education and enacting universal prekindergarten. Democrats \nstrongly support President Obama's initiative to fully fund Head Start \nand expand the Early Head Start-Childcare Partnerships. Research shows \nthat high-quality early education is a great investment in a child's \nlife and our Nation's future.\n  Mr. Speaker, our children are our future. As Head Starters across the \ncountry plant rose bushes this week to commemorate President Johnson's \nRose Garden launching of Head Start, this Congress must reject the \nmisplaced priorities of the Republican budget and embrace a brighter \nfuture for our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3403-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING WARRIORS WEEKEND\n\n  (Mr. FARENTHOLD asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to pay tribute to our \nveterans and to the men and women of our Armed Forces who wake up every \nday, put on our Nation's uniform, and don't know if they are going to \nbe home that evening safely with their families.\n  Last weekend, volunteers came together in Port O'Connor, Texas, to \nhonor more than 900 veterans and current members of the Armed Forces \nfor the ninth annual Warriors Weekend.\n  Warriors Weekend brings together military members who have been \nwounded during combat in the global war on terror--and not just those \nwho are wounded physically, but also those with invisible scars, like \nPTSD and depression.\n  Mr. Speaker, many of these current and former military members are \nstill in recovery and physical rehabilitation, but the weekend event \ngives them the chance to build a support network and have a great time \nenjoying the Texas outdoors.\n  Warriors Weekend was created in part by veterans who served during \nVietnam. They knew all too well how it felt to return home from war and \nbe looked down on. They wanted to make sure every member of the \nmilitary is welcomed home properly, and they knew that our wounded \nveterans oftentimes have needs that are overlooked.\n  I urge Members to support Warriors Weekend again next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3403-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPASS A LONG-TERM PLAN TO FIX OUR NATION'S TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

Mr. Speaker, the House voted \nyesterday to approve a 2-month extension of the highway trust fund. I \nam pleased we were able to pass a short-term fix, but it is time to \nstop kicking the can down the road.\n  I urge my colleagues to use the next 60 days to come up with a long-\nterm plan to invest in our Nation's transportation infrastructure, a \nplan that will create jobs, strengthen American competitiveness, and \nlay the groundwork for future economic growth.\n  I asked the Joint Economic Committee staff to analyze the costs of \nU.S. underinvestment in infrastructure, and this map tells an important \npart of the story.\n  Across the country, one in four bridges are structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete. That is scary, and it is a matter of public \nsafety. Americans are taking tens of millions of trips every day over \nbridges that are in need of repair.\n  As you can see on the map, in some States, over one-third of the \nbridges are failing. Here in the Nation's Capital, 70 percent of our \nbridges are failing. We should fix our crumbling infrastructure as a \nmatter of public safety and as a matter of national pride.\n  To see how your State is doing, you can download the map and the raw \ndata behind it from the JEC, jec.senate.gov.\n  I urge my colleagues to support infrastructure. It is time to move \nbeyond a 2-month extension and, instead, work on a long-term solution \nto this critical and important and economic development challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3403-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

House \nResolution 273 provides for a structured rule for the consideration of \nH.R. 2262 and a closed rule for the consideration of H.R. 880.\n  The resolution provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between \nthe chair and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Science, \nSpace, and Technology, for H.R. 2262, and 1 hour of debate, equally \ndivided between the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee \non Ways and Means, for H.R. 880.\n  The resolution also provides for the consideration of seven \namendments to H.R. 2262, and it provides for a motion to recommit for \neach bill. In addition, the rule provides for the normal recess \nauthorities to allow the chair to manage pro forma sessions; it \nprovides for the Committee on Appropriations to have the opportunity to \nfile reports during the district work period; and it provides for \nsuspension authority for Thursday to provide flexibility on the last \nday prior to the district work period.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and the \nunderlying legislation.\n  Both of these bills represent critical investments in science and \ntechnological innovation. On the floor this week, we have debated and \npassed several pieces of legislation to encourage the research and \ndevelopment of new technologies and ideas, moving our economy and our \ncountry forward and cementing our place in the world as the leader in \nscientific discovery.\n  These discoveries and the research they require will promote and \ncreate high-tech, high-paying jobs that can have untold benefits to our \neconomy, benefiting all Americans. The rule and the underlying \nlegislation we have under consideration today continues that objective, \nand I look forward to discussing these critical issues with our \ncolleagues here in the House.\n  H.R. 2262, the SPACE Act of 2015, is a package of four bills that \nwill update the Commercial Space Launch Act. H.R. 2262, the SPACE Act, \nas introduced by the majority leader, the gentleman from California \n(Mr. McCarthy), will facilitate a progrowth environment for the \ncommercial space industry by encouraging private sector investment and \nby creating a more stable and predictable regulatory environment.\n  H.R. 1508, the Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act, \nintroduced by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey), will promote the \ndevelopment of a United States commercial space resource exploration \nand utilization industry, and it will increase the exploration and \nutilization of resources in outer space.\n  H.R. 2261, the Commercial Remote Sensing Act, introduced by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine), will facilitate the \ncontinued development of the commercial remote sensing industry and \nprotect our national security.\n  Finally, H.R. 2263, the Office of Space Commerce Act, proposed by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), will rename the Office of \nSpace Commercialization to the Office of Space Commerce, and it will \nseek to foster the conditions for the economic and technological growth \nof the United States space commerce industry.\n  This package of bills will ensure American leadership in space by \nfostering a strong and vibrant commercial space industry. Without this \nlegislation, the commercial space industry may face a myriad of \nregulatory hurdles that would threaten America's continued \nexceptionalism in space exploration.\n  The other underlying bill in this rule, H.R. 880, addresses the \nresearch and development tax credit. In 1981, President Reagan signed \ninto law a critical research and development tax credit, but Washington \nhas let it expire and then has renewed it over a dozen times since \nthen.\n  As we discussed last month as to our tax credits, Mr. Speaker, the \nR tax credit was included in the package of retroactive bills and \nextenders that was signed by the President on December 19 of last year, \nproviding just 7 business days of certainty for businesses seeking to \nutilize this provision of our Tax Code. It, along with all of the \nothers that expired again on December 31 of last year, currently remain \nexpired. The temporary nature of the now expired research credit limits \nits effectiveness, which prevents some businesses from having certainty \non long-term investments in U.S.-based research and development.\n  More research and development means more innovation, greater economic \ngrowth, and more American\n\n[[Page H3405]]\n\njobs. In 2012, American companies invested $302 billion in research and \ndevelopment. As of 2011, 1.47 million Americans worked directly in \nresearch and development. Increased certainty, combined with the \nsimplification of our Tax Code, would lead to more research and more \nAmerican jobs.\n  Investment in research and development is the key to America \nremaining the world's leader in innovation. The percentage of patents \nawarded by the U.S. Patent Office has increased each year, but the \nshare awarded to U.S. innovators has declined. In the year 2000, 54 \npercent of the patents awarded were of American origin. By 2014, the \nnumber fell to 48 percent. From 2001 to 2011, America's share of global \nresearch and development declined from 37 percent to just 30 percent.\n  By making the research credit permanent, researchers can stop \nworrying about whether Congress is going to extend the tax credit and \ncan, instead, focus on new discoveries that will help fuel our economy \nand grow jobs.\n  I look forward to debating these bills with our House colleagues, and \nI urge support for the rule and the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding me the customary 30 \nminutes for debate.\n  I rise today in opposition to the rule and the underlying bills.\n  Before I proceed, I did not speak during the 1 minutes, and I want to \nalso take cognizance of this being the 50th anniversary of Head Start \nand, additionally, this month of May as being Foster Care Month. Like \nmany Members, I have a young person who has a more than compelling \nstory about foster care--Ke'Onda Johnson from Royal Palm, Florida--who \nis shadowing me today, and I am delighted that she and other youngsters \nhave this opportunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 880, \nthe American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015, and H.R. 2262, \nthe SPACE Act of 2015--two separate bills, wholly unrelated in content \nand purpose.\n  As a first order of business, I believe it is critical that I take a \nmoment to highlight the manner in which we are debating this rule \ntoday. The deliberation of multiple, unrelated bills under a single \nrule is a disturbing trend that has ballooned under Republican \nleadership and is one that threatens the very foundation of the \ndemocratic process. Forcing several pieces of legislation into a single \nrule not only prevents Members of this Chamber from making informed \njudgments about the proper floor procedure for each measure, but it \nalso leads to disjointed and often perplexing debates about an \nassortment of unconnected issues.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Votes on the House floor should reflect where Members stand on the \nspecific questions at issue, not on a set of complex and unrelated \nprocedures, some of which they support and others which they oppose.\n  Indeed, just yesterday, the House considered H. Res. 271, a rule \nproviding for consideration of three measures: the Highway and \nTransportation Funding Act, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, \nand the America COMPETES Reauthorization bill.\n  The debate on that rule vacillated from surface transportation \nprojects, to funding for the legislative branch, to the prioritization \nof science research development. Such debate erodes the integrity of \nHouse proceedings by creating confusing alternations in subject matter \nthat eliminate the ability to reinforce a line of reasoning or respond \nto opposing arguments.\n  The grab-bag approach has skyrocketed since Republicans assumed \ncontrol of the House in 2011, with a record 49 grab-bag rules reported \nout during the 113th Congress. Even more disheartening, we are on \nschedule to shatter this record during the 114th Congress, having \nalready approved an unconscionable 14 of these rules in less than 5 \nmonths.\n  In fairness, the chairman of the Committee on Rules did say, in \nresponse to one of my colleagues and myself the day before, that this \npractice is not likely to continue at its present pace, and I await the \nopportunity for him to fulfill his view with reference to that matter.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today for consideration of yet \nanother grab-bag rule governing two bills of significant importance \nthat, as a result of this rule, will undoubtedly escape the due \nconsideration each deserves.\n  H.R. 880, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015, \nwould make permanent a tax credit for qualified research expenses that \nexpired at the end of last year. It is my strong belief that Democrats \nand Republicans, alike, support a tax credit that will help facilitate \ninnovation and foster advancements in research, enabling American \ncompanies to grow and prosper. Technological innovation stemming from \nresearch and development serves as an important engine to our Nation's \neconomic growth.\n  My opposition to this piece of legislation, therefore, comes in first \npart from my Republican colleagues' decision to make this tax credit \npermanent in what I view as a fiscally irresponsible way.\n  Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends have long touted themselves as the \nparty of fiscal responsibility. For this reason, I find it a bit \ninsincere that they now seek to implement a tax credit with no offsets \nfor lost revenue. As a result, the Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimates that this bill would add almost $182 billion to the deficit \nover the next 10 years. I have stated time and time again that we \ncannot continue to provide tax cuts and credits without a mechanism to \npay for them. It is comical to me that my Republican friends claim to \nbe the party of fiscal responsibility while they, in the same breath, \nadvocate a measure that would add nearly $200 billion to the Federal \ndeficit.\n  In addition to this legislation's reckless budgetary impact, I \ndisagree with the piecemeal approach the majority has taken in making \nthese tax credits permanent. More than 50 tax provisions expired at the \nend of last year, many of them critical to the middle and working class \nand, yes, poor families. And yet, instead of addressing the issues \nfacing our Tax Code in a comprehensive, bipartisan way, the majority \nhas decided to leave certain tax credits--ones that would directly \nimprove the lives of hard-working American families, such as the work \nopportunity tax credit, the new markets tax credit, and renewable \nenergy tax credit--to an uncertain fate.\n  The American people expect, and I am sure that they deserve, a Tax \nCode that supports our shared priorities. Cherry-picking tax credits to \nextend, and then allowing those credits to dramatically increase the \ndeficit, is, in my view, a step in the wrong direction. It is an \nunacceptable step away from bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform.\n  I agree, as most of my colleagues likely do as well, that the \nresearch tax credit is critical for American innovation. That is why I \nam truly disappointed, although not surprised, that my Republican \nfriends have again chosen to place partisan politicking above the needs \nof our constituents.\n  This rule also provides for consideration of the SPACE Act of 2015, \nanother piece of once bipartisan legislation that has been distorted \ninto an unrecognizable measure that panders to industry giants without \nregard for the safety of the American public or of spaceflight \npassengers.\n  While the enticement of space travel hovers over the objectives of \nthis legislation, we must address the reality of what this bill seeks \nto accomplish. First, this bill reads like a laundry list of commercial \nspace launch industry requests, exempting it from needed safety \nregulations and providing essentially complete immunity for civil \nlawsuits by removing claims related to commercial space launches from \nState court and mandating that they be heard in Federal Court, where \nfew appropriate legal remedies exist. In practice, this measure will \nimmunize commercial space companies from legal liability, even in cases \nof recklessness or intentional misconduct.\n  Also troubling, this bill provides tremendous subsidies for insurance \ncoverage--and that is kind of interesting--to protect wealthy \nrecreational spacecraft passengers. Why on earth, and there is no pun \nintended here, are we spending taxpayer dollars on individuals wealthy \nenough to travel into space for sport?\n\n[[Page H3406]]\n\n  While it is uncontested that the issues these bills seek to address \nare important, the partisan way in which they have been presented \nprevents a robust deliberation, and I therefore oppose both the rule \nand the underlying bills.\n  I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to some of the \ncomments of the gentleman from Florida and remind him that each bill \nwill be separately debated and that, obviously, this combined rule is a \nfloor time management technique that the chairman of the Committee on \nRules yesterday said was an aberration. I take him at his word; and I \nthink it is important to note that, during Democratic majorities, this \nwas certainly not an unheard-of practice, either.\n  I do want to make sure that I reiterate that every bill will be \nseparately debated; and I would remind the gentleman that, during the \ntime we have to debate the rule, if we actually stick to the topics \nrelated to the bills and the rules, it will help us manage our floor \ntime even better.\n  With that, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nPosey).\n  Mr. POSEY. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying \nlegislation.\n  Despite some of the comments we have heard from across the aisle this \nmorning, I remember my first 2 years, my first term here, and not one \ntime was I allowed to even file a single amendment to a single bill \nhere. All the rules were closed, and it was run like a king would run a \nkingdom, not a democratic republic. Here, today, I think the other side \nhas already filed seven amendments on one of these bills. That is seven \ntimes more than I ever got to dream about filing when you ran this \nplace.\n\n  Another great thing about this bill, you actually get to read it \nbefore we pass it. We have done all our bills like that since we have \ntaken control. You actually get to read the bills before they are \npassed. When you all were in the majority, we had to pass them before \nyou read them. I think you remember the famous quote.\n  You refer to this as a grab bag. The only grab bag I see here is the \nlitany of totally unrelated subjects rattled off, as if they somehow \nrelated to this bill. I mean, that doesn't pass the straight face test.\n  Now to the bill. I would like to thank the majority leader, Kevin \nMcCarthy, and Chairman Lamar Smith for their hard work on the SPACE \nAct. The SPACE Act will help ensure American leadership in space, \nfacilitating the growth and stability of the commercial space industry. \nThis is an important, historic, and exciting piece of legislation.\n  This legislation includes many important provisions to update our \nlaws and the oversight of the commercial space industry, including \ntitle 2 of the Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act--\nhistoric, bipartisan, bicameral legislation introduced with my \ncolleague from the State of Washington, Derek Kilmer.\n  I appreciate the support H.R. 1508, incorporated herein, has received \nfrom many members of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology \nand the thorough work and research of Senators Patty Murray and Marco \nRubio, who introduced identical legislation in the United States \nSenate.\n  The SPACE Act also includes a provision which would streamline \nregulations and encourage cooperation between government agencies' \ncommercial space activities to eliminate red tape and bureaucracy that \nare impeding development of America's commercial space industry.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other agencies are \nall involved in overseeing many commercial space launches, and \nsometimes there are duplicative measures that could be streamlined, \ncutting costs to both the Federal Government and commercial companies \nand making the United States companies more competitive in the global \nmarketplace.\n  Let me add that this bill includes a provision requiring the FAA to \nprovide direction for space support vehicles, also known as \nexperimental aircraft. Unfortunately, for too long, the FAA has held \noff providing direction by means of a regulatory framework for these \nendeavors to safely support the United States commercial space \nendeavors. In Florida, there is such an entity, approved by NASA and \noperating out of the Kennedy Space Center, which the FAA grounded \nbecause they use experimental aircraft. This is a testament that FAA \nneeds serious reform and needs to be brought into the 21st century.\n  In short, the SPACE Act is a critical piece of legislation to the \nfuture of our commercial space industry, and it is important to our \nspace exploration efforts as well.\n  I thank my colleagues again for their work on the SPACE Act and urge \nall Members to support the rule today and passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Marchant). Members are reminded to \ndirect their remarks to the Chair and not to other Members in the \nsecond person.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), who is the ranking member on the \nCommittee on Ways and Means and a good friend of mine.\n  (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank Mr. Hastings for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, this debate is not about support for the R credit. \nDemocrats have a long track record of supporting the R tax credit. \nIndeed, I have often been the author of legislation to strengthen it.\n  This debate, purely and simply, is about fiscal responsibility, about \ntaking one tax provision and making it permanent without paying one \ndime for it.\n  When former Chairman Camp unveiled a tax reform proposal last year, \nhe undertook a comprehensive consideration of the more than 50 tax \nprovisions that expired at the end of last year, but in a fiscally \nresponsible manner.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  This bill does just the opposite. It continues a helter-skelter \napproach toward tax extenders, without any regard whatsoever for paying \nthe hundreds of billions of dollars they cost to make them permanent.\n  Last year, Ways and Means Republicans passed 14 permanent extensions \nat a cost of $825 billion. They went nowhere because the President has \nmade clear his opposition to this approach.\n  With this bill, this year's price tag has reached $586.3 billion. It \nis particularly glaring that the majority is passing unpaid-for tax \ncuts the very same week that they once again put off a long-term \nextension of highway funding because they are unable to find a revenue \nstream.\n  There is no lack of support for the R credit among us Democrats. It \nis the approach Republicans are taking that we oppose and strongly so. \nIt is fiscally irresponsible indeed, and it would leave behind vital \nprovisions that help hard-working American families, like the expansion \nof the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, and the American \nopportunity tax credit.\n  We stand ready to work with the majority on tax reform and on a long-\nterm extension of highway funding. Today's R bill is tax reform in \nreverse. It makes talk of fiscal responsibility hypocrisy and creates \nanother big financial pothole standing in the way of long-term highway \nfunding.\n  Vote ``no'' on this rule, and vote ``no'' on the bill relating to R \ntax credits.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I stand steadfastly against not only the way \nin which we have been conducting business with regard to the way we \nreport out rules, but also to both underlying bills for their partisan \nposturing and failure to address the important issues facing the middle \nclass in this country.\n  We cannot continue to provide tax credits without establishing a \nrevenue offset, enact tax policies that favor a partisan agenda and \npush us further away from needed comprehensive tax reform, or offer \nlegislative gifts to industry giants at the expense of the American \npublic.\n\n[[Page H3407]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, Memorial Day is next Monday. If we defeat the previous \nquestion, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up \nRepresentative Brownley's Help Hire Our Heroes Act, H.R. 607.\n  H.R. 607 would reauthorize the Veterans Retraining Assistance \nProgram, which expired in March 2014. That program paid for veterans to \nget training for high-demand occupations, and during its 3 years in \nexistence, it helped more than 76,000 veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and \ndefeat the previous question; vote ``no'' on the underlying bills.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I appreciate the remarks of the gentleman from Florida, but I would \nlike to respond to a few of the comments.\n  The R tax credit has been overwhelmingly supported for the last 16 \nextensions, the last time garnering 378 votes. Only 46 Members voted \nagainst the R tax credit.\n  The R tax credit will be passed again. In fact, the gentleman from \nMichigan admitted, Mr. Speaker, that the vast majority of Democrats \nwill vote to extend the R tax credit. In fact, they will do it every \nyear for the next 10 years, like they have the last few years. When it \nis done every year, they don't insist it is paid for.\n  If you will do it for 10 years in a row without paying for it--the \nentire budget window--why don't we just all create some certainty for \nour businesses so we can invest in high-tech jobs and growing our \neconomy, Mr. Speaker?\n  Let's create certainty for the American people. Let's pass the bill. \nLet's pass the rule. Let's pass the previous question.\n  I think, unfortunately, the arguments from the gentleman from \nFlorida, Mr. Speaker, really encourage cliff politics--high-stakes, \nexpiring legislation that the American people don't want. The American \npeople want us to create certainty. They want us to support jobs. They \nwant us to support our technological innovation in this country, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support the rule and support the \nunderlying bills, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support the Rule on H.R. 2262, the \nSpurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Act of \n2015 (the SPACE Act of 2015). And I thank Majority Leader McCarthy for \nsponsoring this important legislation. The space community is well \nserved having Leader McCarthy as a champion.\n  This bill is the product of over three years of work. Congress \nsolicited input from nearly every stakeholder group. That is reflected \nin the broad support that this bill has received.\n  From industry, to education groups, to grassroots citizen advocacy \ngroups, this bill has been praised by virtually every interested party.\n  The process to getting here was inclusive and exhaustive. The \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee held numerous hearings on the \ntopic over the last three years.\n  On November 19, 2013, the Committee held a hearing on the commercial \nspace industry. On February 14, 2014, the Committee held a hearing on \nupdates to the Commercial Space Launch Act. On April 29, 2014, the \nCommittee held a hearing on the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) \nspace traffic management proposal and orbital debris. On February 27, \n2015, the Committee held a hearing on the Commercial Crew program.\n  Last October, staff formally submitted a draft to the minority. \nWithin the last two months, the majority and minority have worked to \nwrite many of the provisions in the underlying bill.\n  For instance, Section 101, which deals with Consensus Standards, is \nthe result of bipartisan negotiations. The same can be said for Section \n102, which calls for an update to the maximum probable loss calculation \nunder indemnification.\n  Section 103, which pertains to Launch Vehicle Flexibility, is \nidentical to the bipartisan provision sponsored by Senators Heinrich \nand Rubio that easily passed the Senate Commerce Committee last year by \nvoice vote.\n  Section 104 clarifies the role of Government Astronauts and is almost \nidentical to the provision requested by the FAA and NASA.\n  The minority also played a role in writing Section 108 on Orbital \nTraffic Management. Section 109 on State Commercial Spaceports also \naddressed bipartisan requests.\n  Section 111 on the Streamlining of Commercial Space Launch Activities \nis similar to language already in the Senate's bill, and Section 112 \nwas the result of an amendment in Committee that earned bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Title 2 of the bill focuses on Space Resource Exploration and \nUtilization. As a standalone bill, it was the subject of a hearing last \nSeptember and it is cosponsored by both Republicans and Democrats. It \neven has a Democratic champion on the Senate side, Senator Murray.\n  Title 3 of the bill addresses Commercial Remote Sensing and also \nbenefits from bipartisan co-sponsorship. When it was marked up in \nCommittee last week, it enjoyed unanimous support. The same can be said \nof Title 4 of the bill that pertains to the Office of Space Commerce.\n  At the Committee's recent markup, eight amendments to the provisions \nwe are considering today were adopted--three of which were amendments \noffered by Democrats.\n  The Rule before us today allows for consideration of five Democratic \namendments and two Republican amendments. The majority has gone out of \nits way to include the minority in this process.\n  In fact, the Administration said in a statement that it, ``does not \noppose House passage of the bill''--a rarity for bills considered under \na Rule.\n  This bill facilitates a pro-growth environment for the developing \ncommercial space industry by encouraging private sector investment, \ncreating more stable and predictable regulatory conditions, and \nimproving safety.\n  The Act ensures American leadership in space and fosters the \ndevelopment of advanced technologies. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis Rule as well as the underlying bill, and I thank the Majority \nLeader once again for his initiative on this legislation.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the rule for H.R. \n2262, the SPACE Act of 2015.\n  Article 1 Section 8 of the United States Constitution states that \n``The Congress shall have Power to promote the Progress of Science and \nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the \nexclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries . . .''\n  It does not say that the Congress shall have the right to ignore.\n  The United States space program has existed for over half a century \nand my commitment to providing NASA with the resources to carry the \nagency forward with its ambitious agenda of research, exploration, and \ndiscovery is unwavering.\n  NASA continues to push the boundaries of what is possible, keeping \nour Nation on the forefront of innovation and exploration.\n  It is the responsibility of this Congress to ensure that the future \nof space exploration remains a part of our national destiny.\n  It inspires our children to look to the stars and dream of what they \ntoo, one day, may achieve.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendments made in order by the Rules Committee are \nintended to improve the Space Act.\n  My amendments are simple and will improve the bill.\n     1. Jackson Lee Amendments to H.R. 2262\n  This Jackson Lee Amendment Number 8, would facilitate the \nparticipation of HBCU, Hispanic Serving Institutions, National Indian \ninstitutions, in fellowships, work-study and employment opportunities \nin the emerging commercial space industry.\n  My amendment would increase awareness among underrepresented groups \nin STEM employment and education opportunities in the commercial space \nindustry.\n  One of the most enduring difficulties faced by underrepresented \npopulations in the STEM field is a lack of awareness and understanding \nof the connection between STEM and employment opportunities.\n  In 2012, a survey found that despite the nation's growing demand for \nmore workers in science, technology, engineering, and math, the skills \ngap among the largest ethnic and racial minorities groups remains \nstubbornly wide.\n  Blacks and Latinos account for only 7 percent, of the STEM workforce \ndespite representing 28 percent of the U.S. population.\n     2. Jackson Lee Amendment on Minority and Women Owned \n         Businesses\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment requires that provisions of the bill that \naddress future legislation also lay the foundation for the commercial \nspace industry include work on how to effectively conduct outreach to \nsmall business concerns owned and controlled by women and minorities.\n  I have worked hard to help small business owners to fully realize \ntheir potential.\n  That is why I support entrepreneurial development programs, including \nthe Small Business Development Center and Women's Business Center \nprograms.\n  These initiatives provide counseling in a variety of critical areas, \nincluding business plan development, finance, and marketing.\n\n[[Page H3408]]\n\n  Outreach is key to developing healthy and diverse small businesses.\n  There are approximately 6 million minority owned businesses in the \nUnited States, representing a significant aspect of our economy.\n  According to the most recent available Census data, minority owned \nbusinesses employ nearly 6 million Americans and generate $1 trillion \ndollars in economic output.\n  Women owned businesses have increased 20% between 2002 and 2007, and \ncurrently total close to 8 million.\n  My home city of Houston, Texas, the home of the Johnson Space Center, \nis also home to more than 60,000 women owned businesses, and more than \n60,000 African American owned businesses.\n     Final Jackson Lee Amendment Seeks Funding To Continue Space \n         Exploration R\n  The taxpayer has invested in space exploration for decades.\n  This investment is reaping benefits for the commercial space industry \ntoday.\n     3. The Jackson Lee Amendment not included in the Rule would \n         have provided revenue for research and development work \n         to continue on challenges that hinder manned and unmanned \n         space flight.\n  Many of the startup companies entering the space industry have few \nresources to dedicate to basic research.\n  There are still critical areas of research that must be done to make \nspace flight as safe as commercial transportation systems are today.\n  Although commercial transportation is not 100 percent without risk, \nit is much safer than it would have been without dedicated and focused \nbasic and applied research to address safety issues.\n  While the government supports the aspirations of companies large and \nsmall to become part of the commercial space industry, it should still \nbe the responsibility of NASA to pursue research that can save lives \nand improve space travel.\n  If the future we envision is one where thousands of businesses will \nbenefit from commercial and government space exploration and investment \nefforts then investing today in tomorrow's economy makes good sense.\n     Although I believe the Jackson Lee Amendments will improve \n         the Bill, there exist troubling aspects of the bill:\n  First, it is regrettable that the SPACE Act will restrict the \n``learning period'' of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \nregulation of spacecraft.\n  This learning period should be extended for a shorter period than the \nten-year extension through 2025 included in the bill.\n  Second, a voluntary industry consensus standard would provide a \nstrategy that improves the overall safety of the industry as opposed to \nperformance-based regulations.\n  Finally, I have concerns about the ability of U.S. companies to move \nforward with innovative space initiatives without authority to ensure \ncontinuing supervision of these initiatives as delineated in the Outer \nSpace Treaty.\n  Thus, I hope we can all work together in addressing these troubling \naspects of the bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for the Jackson Lee Amendments.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n     An amendment to H. Res. 273 Offered by Mr. Hastings of Florida\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     607) to amend the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 to extend \n     the Veterans Retraining Assistant Program, and for other \n     purposes. General debate shall be confined to the bill and \n     shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by \n     the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs. After general debate the bill shall be \n     considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All \n     points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At \n     the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the \n     Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with \n     such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous \n     question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and \n     amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 607.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of adoption of the resolution.\n  The vote was taken by electronic

Mr. Speaker, on rollcall vote 250, I was not \npresent because I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would \nhave voted ``nay.''\n  (By unanimous consent, Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania was allowed to speak \nout of order.)\n\n\n moment of silence for those lost in the philadelphia train derailment\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, May 12, we had a \nhorrific train derailment crash in the city of Philadelphia. So first \noff, our thoughts and prayers are with the eight men and women who lost \ntheir lives and the over 200 who were injured.\n  I have never been more proud of the men and women who live and work \nin the city of Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love and sisterly \naffection. We had this major catastrophe at 9:15 at night. Within 4 \nminutes, our first responders--our police, our fire, Police \nCommissioner Ramsey, Fire Commissioner Sawyer--were on the scene.\n  The scene was in total darkness, and we had volunteers from the \nneighborhood who even joined in. Imagine, total darkness. The only \nlight was flashlights flashing back and forth.\n  I stand here as proud as I could be of the mayor of the city of \nPhiladelphia, Michael Nutter, who, from Tuesday until Sunday, was on \nthat scene constantly, orchestrating the administration people, moving \nthem around, consoling families, making sure that all were accounted \nfor, and even making sure that their belongings were given back to \nthem.\n  I can't be more proud of our hospitals and our universities. \nUniversities opened their doors for loved ones to come. And our \nhospitals, the doctors, nurses, all the men and women who worked \nthere--there were doctors who worked 30 hours and went back home and \ncouldn't sleep and came back to work another 12 hours.\n  But most importantly, two things really struck me. Temple University \nHospital in the city of Philadelphia had a lot of the injured people \nadmitted to their hospital. The students who go to Temple University \nheard about it, jumped on their bicycles, and rode down to assist all \nthose in the hospital, whether it be by pushing a gurney or whether it \nwould be consoling a family member or putting a family member with a \nloved one.\n  And the neighbors, the neighbors ran out--again, in total darkness. \nThere were 200 people-plus injured. Neighbors ran through, helping out \nthrough all the soot, picking them up, pulling them out of the trains, \nbringing them into their house, bringing out water, going to a local \nstore and buying water, bringing towels, wiping them down.\n  One person said:\n\n       I am sorry I am in your home. I am full of soot, and I am \n     dirtying your rug and your couch.\n\n  And in response, the lady said:\n\n       That is okay. We can buy more couches, and we can buy more \n     things, more whatever we need to buy. But you can't buy your \n     health back. So we want to be here to be able to help you in \n     the best way we can.\n\n  I am honored to be standing here with my colleagues from Pennsylvania \nand some others from throughout the country. Some lost a loved one.\n  I am extremely proud to recognize Chairman Jeff Denham and Ranking \nMember Mike Capuano, who assisted me and toured the site with me. I \nappreciate their concern, and I appreciate them being there.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, the best way we can honor these men and women is to \nmake sure this accident never again happens in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  With that, I ask for a moment of silence.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, 5-minute voting will \ncontinue.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             recorded vote\n\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5-minute vote.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 240, \nnoes 185, not voting 7, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 251]\n\n

The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson) each will control 30 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 880, the American \nResearch and Competitiveness Act of 2015.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is really simple. We have had the research and \ndevelopment tax credit in law since 1981. It has periodic expirations \nin it. Every time the law expires, we renew the law. Why? Because we \nthink this is a good policy, and on a bipartisan basis our votes have \nalways reflected that.\n  We believe that since we renew this specifically 1 year at a time, it \ndoes not do very well in giving businesses the time to plan and the \nability to consider long-term investments. They need certainty. One of \nthe problems plaguing this economy is the lack of certainty. So what \nthis bill does is it makes it permanent. This is something that we \nthink ought to be a permanent feature of our Tax Code.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the arguments you are going to hear is, well, \nthis has to be paid for. I want people to understand what that means \nwhen people say that. They are saying that to keep taxes where they \nare, we need to go raise them on other people. To put it another way, \nthe minority is telling us they want a permanent extension of tax \ncredits from the stimulus bill which was temporary, but they are saying \nif we make permanent provisions that have bipartisan support that are \nextended on an annual basis, if we make them permanent, all of a sudden \nwe have to go raise taxes on some other hard-working Americans just to \nkeep these taxes in place.\n  I think that is incorrect. We don't think it jibes with reality. More \nimportantly, we think it is very important, to help unleash job \ncreation, to keep research and development jobs in America, that we \nmake the research and development tax credit permanent.\n\n\n        Permission to Postpone Proceedings on Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the \nquestion of adopting a motion to recommit on H.R. 880 may be subject to \npostponement as though under clause 8 of rule XX.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the author of H.R. \n880 and a Ways and Means Committee member, manage and control the \nremaining time for the majority.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to start by clarifying one thing. My friend \nfrom Wisconsin talked about what it means when you say ``paid for.'' \nWhat it means when you say ``paid for'' is you pay for the bill. There \nis a certain cost associated with any legislation that we do, and if we \ndon't pay for it, then it is added on to our deficits. So when we raise \nconcerns about whether or not this tax bill or any other bill that \ncomes to the floor for debate is paid for, the concerns that we are \nraising are in direct correlation to the fact that it needs to be paid \nfor, not it needs to be added to the deficit or it needs to be added to \nour national debt.\n  There is no debate on the issue of the merits of the R credit. A \nmajority of my Democratic colleagues and I, too, believe in and support \nthe R credit. It has proven to facilitate advancements in new \ntechnologies, sparked new innovations, and creates good-paying jobs for \nhard-working Americans, and it benefits hard-working American families. \nAnd it is critical to helping U.S. companies innovate and compete in a \nglobal marketplace.\n  However, what we do object to is the approach by which this is being \ndone. As I said, it is unpaid for, and it is outside of tax reform.\n  Last year, the previous chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, \nChairman Camp, unveiled a tax reform proposal that made the R credit \npermanent; but the cost of the provision was paid for. He did it \nresponsibly. It was responsibly offset. This bill, like all the other \nindividual tax bills we have considered thus far this year, does not \npay for any of them; it does just the opposite. It continues a helter-\nskelter approach toward tax extenders without any regard for paying the \nhundreds of billions of dollars it costs to make them permanent. \nMoreover, it poisons the bipartisan process that is going to be \ncritical if we are, in fact, going to get tax reform done.\n  This political exercise that we are doing today shows the misplaced \npriorities of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Not only \ndid they recently vote to raise taxes and cut programs for millions of \nhardworking American families in their budget resolution, they are also \nleaving behind important provisions to help them, like the expansion of \nthe earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, and the American \nopportunity tax credit.\n  When it comes to corporations and the wealthy, cost doesn't seem to \nbe a problem. Yet programs vital to the well-being of hard-working \nfamilies and communities are significantly cut or done away with.\n\n[[Page H3412]]\n\n  What is particularly glaring is that we can't even pass a long-term \ntransportation bill, which is, by far, more important to our national \nsecurity, our economic growth, and our competitiveness. The reason we \ncan't pass it is because the majority is unable to find a way to pay \nfor it.\n\n  Yet here we are taking up a bill that costs $181 billion. Add that to \nthe other unpaid-for tax cut bills that this body has already passed \nthis year, and we will have added $586 billion to the deficit. That is \nalmost half a trillion dollars. That is over half a trillion dollars.\n  And what do we have to show for it? The President has already said \nthat he is going to veto this bill, so what is the point? Why are we \nwasting the time and expense of debating this? It is going to be vetoed \nanyway.\n  What we should be doing is working together to pass legislation that \nis vital to every congressional district's long-term transportation \nbill and comprehensive tax reform.\n  Mr. Speaker, we stand ready to work with the majority on these \nimportant things. Today's bill just takes us further away from that \ngoal. Therefore, I ask that we vote ``no'' on this bill and make sure \nwe vote for America.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  When it comes to research and development initiatives, America is \nrapidly falling behind our global competitors. Unless the U.S. remains \nthe world's leading innovator, our economy will suffer while middle \nclass families and talented college graduates will see jobs and \nopportunities lost to foreign countries. Making permanent the tax \nincentive for companies to invest in research and development right \nhere in the United States will ensure lifesaving technologies, state-\nof-the-art computer systems, and breakthroughs in manufacturing \nproducts.\n  While America once led the world in R incentives, the U.S. has now \ndropped to--get this--27th among our global competitors. America's \nshare of global research and development, while it is still big, has \ndropped from 39 percent, before the turn of this new century, to 31 \npercent.\n  So look at China. By contrast, China's R spending has increased \nfourfold. It is poised to surpass that of America by 2022.\n  Permanency provides certainty to U.S. innovators. It makes the \nFederal budget scorekeeping far more honest, and it removes the \nasterisk from this temporary provision so that progrowth tax reform can \nadvance.\n  This year, we have added a new provision that will allow eligible \nsmall businesses to count the credit against the AMT, the alternative \nminimum tax. This is an important provision to enable America's newest \ninnovators to develop even more cutting-edge, market-dominating \ntechnologies.\n  I am proud to have worked on this important tax incentive with my \nfriend John Larson, a Democrat from Connecticut. The House passed this \nprovision with a strong bipartisan vote last year.\n  While the economy is improving, there are millions of Americans still \nlooking for full-time work and millions more middle class families \nwhose paychecks have been stagnant for years. If we want a permanently \nstrong economy, we need a permanent research and development tax \ncredit.\n  The time for excuses is over. Stand with innovation in America or \nstand with China and other countries with the R being shipped to the \nrest of the world. I say we stand with America, our innovators, our \ncollege graduates, and our businesses.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), former chair of the committee and \na strong proponent of responsible tax policy.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I was listening to the eloquent words of my \nfriend from Texas about the importance of research and development, and \nI can't think of any member on our committee that could not agree with \nhim more.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  While he was eloquently speaking about how important it was to our \ngreat Nation, I was even thinking about our trade bill if this is \npackaged in such a way that we would have our workforce with the backup \nof research and development, a trade bill that would include in it \neducational possibilities for the workforce, that would have \ninfrastructure there and would have America knowing that we just \nweren't talking about success of the corporations, but for success of \nAmerica.\n  Also, the part that he mentioned--continuity--so that our \nbusinesspeople would know exactly what they could depend on. I just \ncan't, for the life of me, see how they will know which part of the Tax \nCode or which week that we intend to bring up knowing it is going to be \nvetoed, if really in our hearts what we want is continuity. There is \nonly one way to get continuity, and that is to review the Tax Code, to \nreform the Tax Code.\n  If you take out all of the gems just to get a ``no'' vote against it \npolitically, you are really harming bipartisanship. That is what we \nneed; that is what the Tax Code needs; that is what our country needs, \na Tax Code that eliminates all of the loopholes, and concentrate on \nthose things our country needs.\n  Of course, if politics is more important than policy, if all we are \ntrying to do is play ``I gotcha,'' if all we want to say is we love \nresearch and development, but we know darn well politically it is not \ngoing to pass, if we are going to say that we all want reform, but now \nthat we have both Houses Republican--House and the Senate--but we dare \nnot talk about tax reform, well, I don't think we want to play this \npolitical game.\n  What we do want to do--and I want to agree with the majority--\nresearch and development is what keeps America competitive. It should \nnot be played with. It should not be politicalized. It should be a part \nof the tax reform bill.\n  If you can't do it when you have control of the Finance Committee in \nthe Senate and refuse to do it when you are in charge of the Ways and \nMeans Committee and have a President that is calling out for overall \ncomprehensive fairness and equity and tax reform, it is painful to see \nhow the eloquence of love for this country can be distorted by having \nvotes on legislation that we know is never to become law.\n  I say, as I take my seat, I am not giving up on tax reform. I hope \nthat the Republicans come together and have a meaningful bill not for \nour committee, but for our conscience.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  The President has threatened to veto this bill. The question is \nclear: Why is the President standing for those who would ship jobs \noverseas? Why isn't he standing with Republicans and Democrats in \nCongress in this House to keep those jobs in research here in America?\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding), \na new member of the Ways and Means Committee, who understands research \nand development in the Triangle of North Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Brady for offering \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  The research and development credit plays a crucial role in the \ncontinued economic growth of our Nation, spurring innovation and \nsupporting high-skilled, high-paying jobs.\n  Innovation has been a huge driver of growth in my district. Because \nof the breakthrough technologies coming out of Research Triangle Park, \nNorth Carolina has become a leader in American innovation.\n  In and around my district, I have seen how important the R credit \nhas been to our Nation's innovative companies, like Biogen, Cisco, GSK, \nSAS, UTC, and Siemens, amongst a host of others. I urge my colleagues \nto support such companies and their employees and the families of those \nemployees by making this important credit permanent.\n  Right now, Mr. Speaker, a growing number of foreign countries are \nincreasing innovation and advancing manufacturing by providing generous \nand permanent R tax credits along with lower corporate tax rates.\n  In fact, according to an OECD study, the U.S. ranks 22nd in research \nincentives among industrialized countries. We owe our innovators \nbetter, and in order to remain a leader in the increasingly global \neconomy, we must continue to support and incentivize research and \ninnovation here in the United States.\n\n[[Page H3413]]\n\n  Passage of this bill will provide companies and researchers with the \ncertainty and support they need to keep America and my district and \nNorth Carolina in the forefront of global innovation and send a strong \nmessage that we stand behind the groundbreaking research being \nconducted by our Nation's innovators.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I just want to point out that the President is standing with those of \nus who support the R credit, but he wants it done responsibly. He \nwants it paid for, and he wants it part of tax reform. Just like all of \nus, we support the R credit. We want it paid for, and we want it part \nof tax reform.\n  To suggest that voting against this is standing with China, I find \nsomewhat an ironic statement made by my friend from Texas, given the \nfact that China already holds so much of the U.S. debt. All this does \nis empower them more, give them more of our debt.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, there is one type of innovation in which \nthese Republicans are truly unexcelled--there is no competition. And \nthat is the innovation in names, in naming these bills.\n  They salute climate deniers and The Flat Earth Society by slashing \nfunding for earth science that is strongly opposed by geophysicists and \none academic after another. What do they call it? The ``America \nCOMPETES Act.''\n  On this measure, its companion, they borrow almost $200 billion from \nanyone who will lend it to us to give mostly to the largest \ncorporations, largely for doing research that they would be doing, even \nif they weren't rewarded. And they call that the ``American Research \nand Competitiveness Act.'' Now, that is true innovation. They don't \nneed a credit; they ought to get a prize for being contortionists when \nit comes to labeling these measures.\n  This particular bill just digs us deeper and deeper into debt, while \nadding very little to our research capability. That is truly \nunfortunate, since America's future competitiveness is in jeopardy. And \nthat is outlined this very day in ``Innovation Lies on Weak \nFoundation,'' a New York Times economic column.\n  As Eduardo Porter notes, ``Investment in research and development has \nflatlined over the last several years as a share of the economy . . . \nother countries are now leaving the United States behind . . . \ngovernment budgets for basic research, the biggest source of financing \nfor scientific inquiry . . . fell in 2013 to substantially below its \nlevel 10 years earlier.''\n  Indeed, the Republican budget makes significant cuts to research, \nincluding hundreds fewer research grants that the President sought at \nboth the National Institutes of Health and the National Science \nFoundation. I think we need more than another Ice Bucket Challenge to \nfund research for cures for cancer and diabetes, ALS, AIDS, and the \nlike. We need the resources to tackle problems that are touching every \nfamily in this country.\n  Unfortunately, this R credit that is being made permanent without \nreform has required American taxpayers to subsidize the development of \nelectronic cigarettes and other products to addict our children to \nnicotine, instead of using those dollars to fight those dreaded \ndiseases to which nicotine contributes.\n  Corporate research generally is focused more and more on the next \nquarter's reports to Wall Street to which excessive corporate \ncompensation is tied, instead of focusing on basic research. Porter \nconcludes in the same article that this particular bill is ``unlikely \nto help much.'' And he notes the conclusion of the Congressional \nResearch Service, an objective source, that this regularly renewed \ncredit ``delivered, at most, a modest stimulus to domestic business R \ninvestment from 2000-2010.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. I support a permanent research and development credit to \nincentivize more research. The question is: How do we pay for it, and \nhow do we ensure that it actually encourages more jobs, leads to more \nresearch and more economic development, instead of just giving a reward \nto those who are already doing something in this area to advance their \nproduct?\n  Nothing, of course, prevents multinationals from taking the credit \nand then putting the patent or the copyright in some foreign tax haven \nand avoiding paying their American taxes, another reform that is \nnecessary.\n  We should reject this proposal in favor of a strong research credit \nthat actually incentivizes necessary research here in America and which \nis paid for, in part, by comprehensive reform of this very credit. \nSurely, we don't need any more research today to know that today's \nbills are the wrong way to go for America.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), one of our leaders of the Ways \nand Means Committee, who understands you can't keep making excuses \nabout bringing R to America; you have to act.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on \nthis legislation and on the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, America has long been a place where an idea \nthat is thought up in a garage or in the backyard can become the next \nrevolution in manufacturing or the next lifesaving technology.\n  We need a Tax Code that promotes innovation, that promotes \nentrepreneurship, that promotes growth. We need a Tax Code that allows \nthe inventors and the dreamers with a good idea to be able to go out \nthere and succeed.\n  This is critical legislation that comes at a very critical time. \nModernizing and making the research and development tax credit \npermanent will ensure that the United States remains competitive in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  It has been around since 1981; it has been renewed 16 times, but when \nyou renew a credit for 1 year, for 2 years, or you make it retroactive, \nthat doesn't work very well for some companies that are allocating \ntheir capital for 5 or 10 years on the horizon that want to invest in \nresearch and development.\n  In Minnesota, we are the home to 400 medical device companies. \nResearch and development is their lifeblood, and these manufacturers \nuse research and development to invent new devices, new techniques, new \nprocedures. These companies are also a very essential component to our \neconomy in Minnesota and also around the United States.\n  We should be making America the number one destination to create and \ngrow a business. Making the research and development credit permanent \nwill provide our Nation's innovators that incentive and that certainty \nthat they need to develop the next big idea and help America win the \nfuture.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a distinguished member of our \nWays and Means Committee, from a district filled with innovators, all \nof whom would benefit from doing this policy the right way.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.\n  I was listening to my dear friend, the gentleman from Texas, who is \nmanaging the bill for our Republican friends, and I was struck for a \nmoment when he talked about the disadvantage vis-a-vis China, how--in a \nfew years--we are going to slip behind China in R development.\n  He talked about the hundreds of thousands of jobs that could be made \navailable if we were able to redouble our efforts in research and \ndevelopment and the concerns about the overall slippage of the United \nStates into the middle of the pack when it comes to research.\n  I was struck by those words. For a moment, I thought he was talking \nabout the United States infrastructure because we don't have to wait \nfor 3 or 4 or 5 years to slip behind China; we are already being \novershown by their efforts. We are investing less than 2 percent of our \ngross domestic product in infrastructure; the Chinese are investing 8 \npercent or more.\n  The United States once had the finest infrastructure in the world--\nnot anymore. Those international ratings that my good friend from Texas \ntalked\n\n[[Page H3414]]\n\nabout are very much the case for our infrastructure. We have dropped \nfrom 1st to 5th to 16th to 27th.\n  I want to know where the alarm for my Republican friends is about our \nfalling behind while America falls apart.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  We are going to pass before the year is out the research and \ndevelopment credit. I hope we do it the right way, but we will do it.\n  What we haven't done in the 55 months since the Republicans took \ncontrol of the House of Representatives is we have not had a single \nhearing on how we are going to finance our crumbling infrastructure--\nnot one. In the meantime, we are told that this is off the table, that \nthe gas tax is off the table. We are going to do some smoke and mirrors \nor something. We just passed the 33rd short-term extension of the \nsurface transportation bill.\n  What country became great in having built its infrastructure 9 months \nat a time?\n  While my Republican friends refuse to even consider the gas tax that \nRonald Reagan championed--in fact, urged and Congress more than doubled \nunder his watch--in the last 6 months, we have had Georgia, Utah, South \nDakota, Nebraska, Idaho, and Iowa all raise their gas taxes, hoping \nthat the Federal Government will meet its obligations and be a partner \nin rebuilding and in renewing America.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Where is the sense of urgency for the cost to \nfamilies who are having $300 a year or more in damage to their cars? \nThe fact that we are not being able to move product because we are \nstuck in traffic? Then our ports, our airports, our roads, our rail--we \njust had an example of its instability--where is the urgency?\n  I would, respectfully, suggest that we reject this wrongheaded \napproach and deal with real tax reform and the R tax credit. But in \nthe meantime, maybe the Ways and Means Committee could find a week that \nwe could spend working together to rebuild and renew America.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold), a new member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee who comes from a research-driven State.\n  Mr. DOLD. I want to thank my good friend from Texas for his \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to just address my good friend from Oregon to \nsay, as someone on this side of the aisle, I, too, sense an urgency on \ntransportation and infrastructure. I know that we need to step up and \ndo something about it so that we can have a robust economy, so that we \ncan be moving our goods and services around. I do look forward to our \nworking on tax reform, but, today, we are talking about research and \ndevelopment.\n  As we talk about certainty, certainly we need certainty with regard \nto our transportation and infrastructure system, but we need certainty \nwhen it comes to research and development. Businesses all across our \ncountry, as they are looking to try to create that next new product, as \nthey are looking to innovate, as they are looking to create that next \nnew thing in order to improve the lives of individuals and to enhance \nour Nation, they need to have that certainty to be able to look around \nthe corner.\n  We are moving forward on research and development a step at a time. \nWe are reauthorizing it a year at a time. Sometimes we are doing it \nretroactively, which means that those businesses don't have the ability \nto plan and oftentimes don't. They are happy to take the tax relief, \nbut they are not really willing to plan and invest in it, oftentimes \nhaving, year after year, programs in which they are investing billions \nof dollars, creating thousands of jobs.\n  Innovation, Mr. Speaker, is something that we should all be united \nbehind. We want to innovate here in the United States. We want to \ncreate things here in the United States. We do not want to have a \nresearch and development situation which really fosters innovation \noutside of the United States. Yes, we have slipped behind, and \nRepublicans and Democrats alike want to make sure that the United \nStates is leading the charge. We need to be globally competitive. We \nare not in a domestic economy--we are in a global economy. If we want \nto be globally competitive, we cannot be ranked 22nd when it comes to \nresearch incentives.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I come from a northern district in Illinois. \nWe are the fourth-largest manufacturing district in the Nation. Yes, we \nrely on that infrastructure because we need to know how our raw \nmaterials come in, how our finished product goes out, and how we move \npeople around. We also realize that those manufacturers rely on that \nresearch and development tax credit in order to innovate, in order to \ncreate that next new thing, that next new innovation. If we don't do it \nin the United States, they will be doing it elsewhere.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just got back from Israel. One of the things that \nstruck me as I swung by one of their companies is that they had a sign \nout front that read: ``Where Innovation Never Stops.''\n  We either choose to innovate here, or they will do it elsewhere. This \nis a bipartisan initiative, and I ask my colleagues to support this \ninitiative.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I just want to point out that my friend who just spoke said that he, \ntoo, believes in transportation, that we should be working on \ntransportation and tax reform, but that, today, we are talking about \nthe R credit.\n  Mr. Speaker, the majority party sets the agenda. The reason we are \nnot talking about transportation or tax reform is that they don't want \nto talk about it. They set the agenda. They are the ones who decided \nthat today we were going to do this irresponsible tax bill rather than \nlook at comprehensive tax reform or look at transportation funding for \nour crumbling infrastructure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Becerra), my colleague and friend and the chair of the \nDemocratic Caucus.\n  Mr. BECERRA. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's make sure we get something straight. I don't think \nthere is a Member here on the floor who doesn't agree that we want to \ninvest in research and development so that we keep that innovation here \nat home and create jobs that pay well here at home. We all want to \nincentivize that job creation. We all want to make sure that the \neconomy grows in the future. That is not what is at issue here. What is \nat issue is that this bill sends exactly the wrong message about our \ncommitment to invest not just in our future but in our children and in \nwhat we call the middle class and the American Dream.\n  See, there is a cost involved in doing research and development tax \ncredits. That is a tax break. We are willing to give companies a tax \nbreak that the families who are up in this gallery won't get. When they \nfile their taxes, they won't get to write off some of their costs for \ndoing certain things because they are not companies, and they are not \ndoing research and development.\n  We, as a community, as a country, are saying it is valuable to give a \ncountry a tax break to do that research that gives us the next \ninvention. Great, but there is a cost. How much? $180 billion. It ain't \nfree. We have got to pay for it. So it is not an issue of not \nsupporting research and development; it is wanting to be responsible \nand wanting to be honest with the American people in saying let's pay \nfor it. Democrats are saying we can pay for it. Let's close those tax \nbreaks that are essentially tax loopholes that everyone in America \nwould agree are not fair. Use the money you save from closing tax \nloopholes to pay for something we all want, which is research and \ndevelopment tax credits.\n  Now, this isn't free. If we don't pay for it, what happens? Guess \nwhat? You don't want to pay for it? You know this is going to cost \nthree times more than what we spend on our veterans. So we\n\n[[Page H3415]]\n\nare going to say, Veterans, you shouldn't get any services because we \nhad to do this research and development tax credit, and we didn't pay \nfor it.\n\n  Perhaps you want to tell that to all of those folks who are looking \nfor the cure for cancer or for the cure for diabetes. Guess what? We \nare spending about three times as much with this research and \ndevelopment tax credit--unpaid for--than what we pay for all of that \nmedical research we do through the National Institutes of Health. This \nis not free.\n  Student loans. How many folks have to worry about paying for their \nstudent loans for their kids to go to college? Guess what? The cost of \nthis bill is about what it would cost to continue the programs that we \nhave in place for our kids who go on to college so we can keep the cost \nof student loans low. You want to eliminate that so people have to pay \na lot more--market rate interest rates--for those student loans? Guess \nwhat? That is what we would have to do.\n  There are consequences. If we are going to get away from deficit \nspending, you have got to pay for things. If you think it is a \npriority, then let's pay for it, but don't act like you can do these \nthings for free. They cost money. All we are saying is let's pay for \nwhat we all agree is important--a research and development tax credit \nfor companies that will do that research here in America. Let's not try \nto hoodwink the American public. This is not free. It is the right \nthing to do. Just about every American family would say, Guess what? \nMaybe I have to pay a few more dollars in taxes, but I am keeping that \nAmerican company here, investing in innovation here, creating jobs in \nAmerica.\n  Priorities. Let's make the tough choices. Let's vote against this and \nvote for a bill that actually pays for the cost of something we want to \ndo with the research and development tax credit.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader of the \nUnited States House of Representatives.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nwant to take a moment to thank the gentleman from Texas for his \nleadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have listened to a lot of speakers on this floor. What \nis the cost not to invest in the future? There are 4 out of 10 \ngraduates out of college today who can't find a job. How do you pay for \nthat?\n  You look towards the future. I will tell you many in this country \nhave followed the innovators in our history. Mr. Speaker, one happened \nto be Steven Jobs. Steven Jobs said that innovation distinguishes \nbetween a leader and a follower.\n  That is true with people, and it is also true with countries. America \nleads because we take the principles of our past, and we apply them to \na changing future. We are the pioneers who always look to the next \nfrontier, ready to challenge what others believe is impossible. \nInnovation is key to our leadership and is essential to our economic \nprosperity in an increasingly competitive 21st century. What Washington \nneeds to understand is that the greatest innovations don't come from \nWashington--they come from the people.\n  It reminds me of what was going on in the early 1900s in this \ncountry. Washington wanted to figure out the invention of flight, so \nthe wisdom of government said, ``Let's just pay Samuel Langley to \ndiscover how to fly,'' but we all knew what came true. We watched two \nbrothers who owned a bicycle store take to the skies from a small field \nin Kitty Hawk, transforming what we know of today.\n  The R tax credit harnesses that American spirit. It makes space for \nthe American people to lead us into the future. When Ronald Reagan \nfirst signed the R tax credit into law, he knew it would grow our \neconomy and make America strong because it put our faith in the \ncountry's greatest assets--its people and the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, we are voting to make this tax credit permanent. \nI think that is very good policy. I also think it shows what our values \nare. It shows that it is everyday heroes who can lead us into the \nfuture of tomorrow. So I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and \nI urge my colleagues to give the American people the tools to move \nAmerica forward.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.\n  Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank Mr. Thompson \nand the ranking member, Mr. Levin, and members of the committee for \nbringing clarity to this debate today.\n  Mr. Speaker, Democrats have always believed that innovation is what \nkeeps America number one. I think that that is a view that is shared by \nall of us in the Congress. Our commitment on our side of the aisle, I \nknow, is to science and to research and development, which create jobs, \nlaunch entire new industries, and give the miraculous power to cure.\n  For Americans to continue to lead in the 21st century, for us to meet \nthe challenges of our time, for us to secure a strong and sustainable \nfuture for America's families and the next generation, we must commit \nto fueling the engines of innovation.\n  When President Kennedy challenged Americans to reach for the Moon, he \nreminded us that America must lead in innovation:\n\n       The vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we are \n     first, and, therefore, we intend to be first. Our leadership \n     in science and in industry, our hopes for peace and security, \n     our obligations to ourselves as well as to others, all \n     require us to make this effort.\n\n  However, according to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, \nthese days, the United States has dropped to 10th place in national R \ninvestment as a percentage of the GDP.\n  As their report makes clear:\n\n       Unless basic research becomes a higher government priority \n     than it has been in recent decades, the potential for \n     fundamental scientific breakthroughs and future technological \n     advances will be severely constrained.\n\n  Instead of meeting this urgent need and challenge, Republicans are \ncoming to the floor of this House today with not one but two bills that \ndo violence to that aspiration.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  First of all, we have the so-called Republican R bill, a completely \nunpaid-for, permanent, and deficit-exploding tax extension. Democrats \nsupport the R tax credit, and we will be offering a motion to \nrecommit for a 2-year extension to give Congress--Democrats and \nRepublicans--time to work together to pass comprehensive tax reform \nthat closes loopholes and pays for making this tax credit permanent.\n  With this bill alone, Republicans will explode the deficit by $182 \nbillion. This is just a part of a larger package of permanent, \ncompletely unpaid-for Republican tax measures this year that will add \nalmost $600 billion to the deficit--over half a trillion dollars added \nto the deficit--including this bill, their bill to hand $269 billion to \nthe 5,400 richest families in America. 5,400 families, and their estate \ntax bill would be getting the benefit of $269 billion paid for by the \nmiddle class in our country, depriving us of investments in our \nchildren's future.\n  The fact is that House Republicans have spent this entire Congress \nblowing up the deficit with unpaid-for tax giveaways overwhelmingly \ntilted toward wealthy special interests. My colleagues, hear this: it \nis worth noting that this bill on the floor has nothing to do with \nenterprising startups that are unable to claim the R tax credit. Some \nof you have said to me: Well, we have all these startups in my \ndistrict. By and large, they cannot benefit from this bill the way it \nis written.\n  We would like to have written our motion to recommit to go further, \nto do that, but the Parliamentarians say, because you prevent it in \nyour base bill, we can't go further.\n  This is what is really stunning in the look of it all. On the same \nday as you are saying we are going to do a gotcha bill on R and \nchallenge you all who support R not to vote for our approach, on the \nvery same day--lest anybody think that this is an overwhelming interest \nin R on the Republican side of the aisle--Republicans are bringing to \nthe floor a COMPETES Act that completely undermines everything to do \nwith science and innovation in our country. It completely upsets our \nInnovation Agenda.\n\n[[Page H3416]]\n\n  In the 110th Congress we put forth the Innovation Agenda, a bill \ndeveloped in a totally nonpartisan way. Anna Eshoo, Zoe Lofgren, and \nGeorge Miller took the lead going across the country, getting input, \nnonpartisan input, academic input, venture capital input, technological \ninput, into an Innovation Agenda. That Innovation Agenda really calls \nfor making permanent and modernizing the R tax credit. We see the \nrelationship between science, technology, innovation, and progress to \nkeep America number one with R tax credits, but not done this way as \nwe do here.\n  This is a trap in order to keep us from investing in Innovation \nAgenda, and that was something that Bart Gordon, as chair of the \nScience and Technology Committee, fought for and achieved. ARPA-E, you \nknow that, to name one thing. But instead, today, Republicans are \nbringing a bill that totally does violence to all this. I hope Members \nwill listen to and support the alternative presented by Congresswoman \nEddie Bernice Johnson, our ranking member on the committee.\n  But, anyway, the original COMPETES Act by the Democratic Congress was \nsupported by an overwhelming number of Republicans. A majority of the \nRepublicans defied their leadership and voted for the COMPETES Act in \nthe 110th Congress, and that original bill passed in a bipartisan way. \nWe laid the foundation for new industries that provide jobs for our \nworkers, that open new markets for American products, that ensure that \nwe continue to ``rise above the gathering storm.'' Norm Augustine and \nothers led the way to show what the gathering storm was unless we made \nthose investments in science and technology. As I said, we created \nARPA-E, so important.\n  This Republican bill betrays everything that the COMPETES Act did. \nThe Republican bill betrays everything that the COMPETES Act did. It is \nan assault on science and a plan to surrender American leadership on \ninnovation. Instead of investing in research and development, their \nbill slashes funding for essential initiatives at the National Science \nFoundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy, the Department of Energy \nresearch.\n  It cuts energy efficiency and renewable energy R by $496 million. \nIt is huge, half-a-billion-dollar cut, nearly 30 percent below what was \nappropriated last year. It cuts ARPA-E by $140 million, 50 percent \nbelow the level in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill passed last \nweek.\n  Most insidiously, Republicans are attacking science they don't even \nwant to hear. Just because you don't want to hear it doesn't mean it \nisn't true. In this COMPETES bill that they are presenting, they are \ntrying to silence the climate, environmental, and social science they \nhave consistently tried to ignore. The Republican bill goes so far as \nto forbid Federal agencies such as EPA and FERC from using any research \nfunded or developed by DOE, a brazen attempt to divorce their decisions \nfrom scientific inquiry.\n  So again, the very idea that, on this floor today, they come out with \nthis masquerade of R tax credits, $182 billion added to the deficit, \nwith the impression that they care about R R into what? R into \nnothing that is about innovation to keep America number one. These \nRepublican bills represent a perfect manifestation of Republican \ntrickle-down economics.\n  The choice that our country has to make in the economy as we go \nforward is trickle-down economics versus middle class economics. \nTrickle-down theories have not worked. They are what got us in trouble \nin 2008, and it is exactly what the Republicans are trying to take us \nback to. Today is one manifestation of that.\n  Republicans are seeking to ransack our Nation's investments in the \nfuture, our commitment to science, our commitment to our children's \neducation, our commitment to bigger paychecks, and our commitment to \nbetter infrastructure for every American family.\n  We need to come together in a bipartisan way, and that is very \npossible. We did it with the COMPETES Act before. To pay for R tax \ncredit extension, we need to reject this Republican assault on science \nthat will happen later today. We need to invest in the future of \ninnovation of our country, of hard-working American families. We need \nto reject failed trickle-down economic theories and accept that the \nsuccess of our Nation depends on bigger paychecks for America's working \nfamilies. R tax credits made permanent and modernized are a \nsignificant part of that, but they are not a part of it if they take us \ndeeper into debt, preventing us from making the investments in the \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this fiscally irresponsible \nR bill, ``no'' on their destructive COMPETES Act, and ``yes'' on the \nproposal made by Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, who I thank for \nher great leadership for keeping America number one.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank Mr. Brady for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my colleagues on the other side \nthat, under the leadership of the former presenter, almost a trillion \ndollars was spent on a stimulus package with nothing to show for it.\n  I was in the business world then, and I have been in the business \nworld 37 years. The reason I ran for Congress was to bring real-world \nexperience to this body. That is why I rise today in support of H.R. \n880. The reason for that is because, when you invest and you invest \nproperly, there is a return. Those families find jobs, and that is what \nthis bill is about.\n  H.R. 880 is to simplify and make permanent the research and \ndevelopment tax credit. Despite the fact that the research tax credit \nhas been extended 16 times since its enactment, it remains a temporary \nmeasure. It is very difficult to plan based on temporary measures. \nClearly, it is high time that we provide certainty for innovators in \nGeorgia and across the Nation by making this tax credit permanent.\n  Innovation is the lifeblood of the small-business community, which \nemploys over 70 percent of the workforce. Innovation in the private \nsector is essential to driving our economy forward and in fostering \ngrowth and creating jobs for Americans now and in the future. It is our \nduty in Congress to incentivize businesses so that innovators and \nentrepreneurs can do what they do best and fill the ever growing demand \nfor jobs across our great Nation.\n  We have so many capable men and women willing to work, so let's get \nout of the way of the entrepreneurial American spirit and pass H.R. \n880.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out \nthat small businesses and the startups are disadvantaged if this bill \npasses. They can't take advantage of this real-world experience and \nbusiness-world experience. I am here to tell you, as a small-business \nperson, if you don't pay your bills, you go out of business. The leader \nhad mentioned that this bill is going to cost $181 billion, but, Mr. \nSpeaker and Members, if you add that $181 billion to everything else \nthat the majority has passed in regard to unpaid-for tax cuts, that \nnumber jumps to $586.3 billion of unpaid-for tax policy.\n  Now it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a distinguished member of our Committee \non Ways and Means.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the \ngentleman from California for yielding me time. I also want to thank \nRepresentative Brady for his characterization of my State, the State of \nIllinois, as being research driven, and indeed it is. I am also proud \nto know that, from the time I have been here, I have always been number \none or number two in our delegation of supporting research, so I am \nresearch oriented.\n  It amazes me how much doubletalk we engage in. We talk a great deal \nabout deficit reduction and reducing spending, and yet, at the same \ntime, we are passing a bill that is not paid for while we cut greatly \nneeded programs and activities that could give balance to individuals \nall over the country who are just simply trying to survive and to make \nit, activities like Medicaid and SNAP.\n  In my communities and in many others throughout America, we are \nstruggling right now with the idea of how do you develop summer work \nopportunities for young adults so that we could\n\n[[Page H3417]]\n\nhave a real attack on some of the rash of violence and activity that we \nsee approaching and being engaged in throughout urban America.\n  I have always been in favor of research and development, and I have \nalways been in favor of using tax incentives as a way of spurring \neconomic development and stimulating the economy. But, you know, I am \nalso interested in passing credits. I am interested in credits for \nbusinesses. We have talked about businesses. Well, let's pass some \ncredits so that businesses can hire hard-to-employ individuals, so that \nthey can hire these young people looking for summer jobs, for something \nto do.\n  So I am in favor of credits, but I am not in favor of a bill that is \nnot paid for, a bill that will not be comprehensive across the board, \nand a bill that will put more wealth in the pockets of the 1 percent \nand do nothing to aid the overall economy.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney).\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, President Ronald Reagan \nonce observed that the government's view of the economy is pretty \nsimple: ``If it moves, tax it.''\n  Well, today, more than ever, President Reagan's words ring true. \nTaxes are prohibitively high. We can take a step in a new direction by \npassing H.R. 880, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of \n2015. This legislation is simple; it will make the R tax credit \npermanent. By doing so, we reduce the amount of taxes that America's \ninnovators pay by providing a 20 percent credit on research expenses.\n  According to a recent study, this policy will increase overall \ninvestment in research by $33 billion and result in 300,000 research-\nrelated jobs. In practical terms, this means that a small business in \nthe beautiful State of West Virginia--which I represent--or where you \nlive that spends $5 million a year on research could be eligible for a \n$500,000 tax credit.\n  That is enough money to hire 10 new employees at $50,000 a year. We \nare talking about 10 new, hard-working American taxpayers. We are \ntalking about men and women who are given the dignity of work. They \nwill pay taxes rather than possibly take government assistance.\n  When I ran for office, I promised West Virginians that I would fight \nfor policies that create jobs and bring economic freedom back to \nAmerica. This bill takes us a step in that direction. I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson) \nhas 6 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) has 14 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support, as I said earlier, of the R tax \ncredit. My colleagues on this side of the aisle support the R tax \ncredit. As we have been saying here today on the floor, it is an \nimportant credit that is vital to our global competitiveness, job and \neconomic growth, and maintaining our position as the world's leader in \ninnovation.\n  As I have also stated--and I will say it again--this bill isn't paid \nfor. The majority is adding $181 billion to the deficit with just this \none bill. This is fiscally irresponsible.\n  What I haven't been able to understand--and I am having trouble today \ntrying to figure it out--is how we can pass bills that help \ncorporations and the wealthy, adding the cost of that to the deficit, \nbut then turn around and try to balance the budget and close the \ndeficit on the backs of hard-working American families.\n  They are trying to do this by cutting the programs we need to grow \nour economy, like education and infrastructure. We have an \ninfrastructure bill that we are still waiting for a hearing on, which \nwe are still waiting to see scheduled.\n  It is a double standard; it is hypocritical, and it is harmful to the \npeople that all of us represent. We are ready and willing to work with \nthe majority to strengthen the economy, including progrowth reforms \nthat benefit businesses and comprehensive tax reform that will benefit \nall of America, but this is the wrong approach, and we should not be \nparty to this political gamesmanship that is taking place on the floor \ntoday.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I think one of the big problems with Washington is that everyone \nfinds excuses not to do the right thing. The truth is we need research \nand development here in America, not overseas. We need the jobs that \ncome with that here in America, not overseas. We need, frankly, the \nfuture of America here, rather than overseas. Republicans and Democrats \nboth agree on that; both sincerely agree on that. Today, we heard \nexcuses, and we will hear excuses.\n  We are told this doesn't fund infrastructure. It doesn't. This is \nabout funding the infrastructure of research and development and \ninnovation, but not through the government. This is through our \nentrepreneurs, like Apple and Microsoft, and all the new research and \ngroundbreaking drugs and medical breakthroughs. That is how we are \nfunding the infrastructure of our future. Roads and bridges, we will \ntackle in another bill.\n  We are told this isn't comprehensive tax reform. No, it is not. It is \na critical step forward in that by taking a provision that has been \ntemporary far too long and making it a permanent part of our Tax Code \nso that we can invest in R with certainty, so we can have honest \nscorekeeping in our budget, and so we can take that first step toward \nreal, comprehensive progrowth tax reform.\n  We are told today, as we have heard in the past, that it is not paid \nfor, but in fact, to the extensions since 1981, these provisions \nhaven't been paid for. Our Democrat friends passed these bills and \nsupported them. They weren't paid for. We have done the same. It was 1 \nyear or 2 years at a time. To say this is fiscally irresponsible, when \nthey voted so many times to do the same thing, seems to me to be \nanother excuse.\n  The cost of doing this permanently is no more than the cost of doing \nit 1 or 2 years at a time. To think otherwise is sort of in the line of \nsaying: You know, that dessert doesn't have calories if I eat it \nstanding up.\n  Well, the cost of R is the same, but the cost of not making it \npermanent is very much not the same. We know the impact will be fewer \njobs here in America, more R in China, and we will lose our lead in \nthe world as the world's innovator.\n  No more excuses--what we are looking for today is a bipartisan effort \nto make sure those jobs are here in America, that our companies have a \nchance to invest more and more and more each year. That is what we want \nthem to do.\n  We want to give college graduates hope. As the majority leader from \nCalifornia noted, 4 out of 10 college graduates either can't find jobs, \nor they are working behind a cash register. Well, it is wrong. We ought \nto give them an opportunity. We ought to give them some jobs and some \nhope. Those college graduates are skilled and talented, and they \ndeserve to be part of America's innovative society. That is what they \ndeserve. That is what we are going to deliver to them.\n  While I am thrilled my Democrat friends are talking about the \ndeficit, I wish they would have acted upon it earlier. The first year \nthey took control of this House under the former Speaker, they doubled \nthe deficit. The second year, they tripled the deficit. The third year, \nthey took it over a trillion dollars and a trillion dollars again, \nuntil the American public said enough.\n  What we got for all that spending was the worst economic recovery in \nhalf a century. We are missing 6 million jobs from the American \neconomy. We have fewer people working the workforce than we did before \nthe recovery actually began. In some ways, we are going backwards, \nespecially for our young people.\n  Today, with this bill, this is research and development both parties \nsupport. The only reason we are hearing the excuses is that it is a \nRepublican bill this time. That is the only reason.\n\n[[Page H3418]]\n\n  Research and development is not a Republican proposal, it is not a \nDemocrat proposal. It is an American proposal we all support. We think \nour economy ought to grow not in Washington, but back home, and that \ninnovation matters. The way we do that is to recapture America's \nleadership in R\n  For all those reasons--and for the support of entrepreneurs, \nmanufacturers, and technology companies back home all across America--I \nurge that we stop the excuses, we join together as Republicans and \nDemocrats, we take back America's leadership in innovation and create \nthe jobs that our young people deserve.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan bill \nH.R. 880 the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 to make \npermanent and simplify an important tax credit, which promotes job \ncreation and economic growth.\n  Unfortunately, Congress did not address this issue last year, so I \napplaud Mr. Brady for continuing to work on this important measure to \nbring certainty to an important sector of the U.S. economy.\n  By simply enhancing and making permanent the now expired research tax \ncredit, H.R. 880 increases the ability of businesses to compete in an \nincreasingly globalized marketplace by rewarding investments in \ninnovation technologies and manufacturing. These new technologies \nprovide the basis of new consumer products, increased scientific \ndiscovery, and technological improvements across numerous fields and \ndisciplines.\n  The common sense American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 \nlowers the cost of innovation, creates high wage jobs, and lays the \nfoundation for a strong economy in the 21st century. The U.S. is facing \nincreasing competition around the globe from countries with more \nadvantageous tax structures, so it is critical that Congress extend \nthis credit to remain competitive in the future.\n  As a cosponsor of the bipartisan H.R. 880, I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to join me in support of this common sense \nlegislation to provide the tools necessary to create jobs, promote \neconomic growth, and create the innovations of tomorrow--right here in \nAmerica.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder). All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 273, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. NEAL. I am opposed to the bill in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Neal moves to recommit the bill H.R. 880 to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       Strike section 2 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2. NO INCREASE IN DEFICIT OR DELAY OF COMPREHENSIVE TAX \n                   REFORM.\n\n        Nothing in this Act shall result in--\n       (1) an increase in the deficit, or\n       (2) a delay or weakening of efforts to adopt a permanent \n     extension of the research credit in a fiscally responsible \n     manner.\n\n     SEC. 3. TWO-YEAR EXTENSION OF RESEARCH CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 41(h) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended by striking ``December 31, 2014'' and \n     inserting ``December 31, 2016''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, \n     2014.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to this bill in its current form, \nand I want to remind my colleagues that this will not kill the bill, \nnor will it send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will \nproceed immediately to final passage as amended.\n  Well, we are 6 months into the new Congress; and what do we hear from \nthe majority? It is more of the same, more of the same assurances: \nTrust us on tax reform; it is on the way.\n  First, it was: Do not introduce tax bills. Trust us, tax reform is on \nthe way.\n  Then it was: If we make some extenders permanent, trust us, tax \nreform is just around the corner.\n  The new refrain is: If we want to fix the highway trust fund, let's \ndo tax reform at the same time.\n  Mind you, we have just voted to extend the highway trust fund for the \n33rd time, and in December, we will most likely vote to extend the R \ntax credit on another short-term basis. Let's stop playing these games.\n  By the way, when my friend from Texas talked about Democrats \nextending the deficits, did he forget that Bill Clinton left us with \nfour straight balanced budgets, and in 8 years, they wrecked the \ntrajectory of those balanced budget with $2.3 trillion of tax cuts? \nThat is the reality. When I heard him say the Democrats ran up the \ndeficits, I guess they forgot there was a President George W. Bush in \nbetween.\n  What do we do here? We do the estate tax repeal. That takes care of \n5,400 families in America. How universal is that? If we weren't doing \nthe estate tax bill--repealing it, by the way--then what we could have \ndone was perhaps extend and agree upon a robust R tax credit, which \nyou all know I support. How about, for 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 years, put it \nin line and let private investment build around it?\n  If you are from Massachusetts, obviously, you are for a more robust \nR tax credit. Who in Massachusetts could be against that? World class \nuniversities, hospitals, businesses, incubators--we produce some of the \nhighest and best tech advancements in the world. Kendall Square in \nCambridge has the highest concentration of R in the whole world.\n  We know this credit is vital to keeping America at the innovation \nforefront, and we know that the start-and-stop nature of this credit \nhas put a damper on the willingness of firms to invest because they \ndon't know if the credit is going to be gone tomorrow.\n  Now, a chance to point something out that I think bears noting, as a \npercent of gross domestic product, research and development now is the \nlowest it has been in decades. Why is that? Because of the rejection of \nscience on my Republican friend's side, private sector R is way down.\n  The encouragement in the Tax Code is simply to buy smaller companies, \nmerge, and take advantage of the innovation they have done. There is \nthe opportunity here to build something around the R that we should \nbe taking advantage of here today, but we are not doing that because of \nthe notion of having rejected this science.\n  The fickle nature of Congress toward this credit is attributable to \none fact: we have not reformed the Tax Code since 1986. Now, \nCongressman Brady wasn't even born the last time that we did tax reform \n30-some odd years ago. He was but a wish in a couple's eye. That is how \ndated this argument is.\n  He said: Why can't we agree on some things here?\n  There are some things we can agree upon: Barack Obama was not born in \nKenya; secondly, and just importantly, there is no imminent invasion of \nTexas that is being planned; And third, very simply, the tax cuts don't \npay for themselves. They have to score some place.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  We are taking up the time today debating this extender--or \nextenders--when we should be talking about tax reform that works for \nthe middle class, a tax reform that does not reward investment; \ninstead, we are doing this hodgepodge effort on tax extenders that \nreally make no sense. Guess what, come December, we are going to be \nright back here on this floor tackling the R credit for another year \nor two.\n  Now, before they say to me, Mr. Neal, you are wrong, I certainly have \nbeen right in the last two cycles about what happened as to where we \nended up with tax extenders. The President has already said he would \nveto a permanent R at this point, and I understand the whole nature \nof why we need to do talking points.\n  I would submit this to my friend, Mr. Brady, and he is my friend, and \nwe work together on many pieces of legislation. Why don't we commit \nourselves to building an R tax credit for 10 years, so it can be \nbuilt into the investment code of the American entrepreneur, so they \nknow precisely what\n\n[[Page H3419]]\n\nis going to be out there, instead of taking this tactic today that is \nnever going to see the light of day as we go forward?\n  This Congress could have been spending its time today talking about \nincome disparity, downward pressure on wages, robotics, and what is \nputting the American worker behind the curve of opportunity; but, no, \nwe can't do that. We spend our time instead on these sorts of \narguments.\n  I hope that we can send this back to committee and come up with \nsomething that we can all live with.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this Democrat proposal does violence \nto America's research infrastructure. It does violence to America's \neconomy, and it does violence to the future of our economy and to the \nhope of young people.\n  We will not stand for this. Vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1806.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Denham). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 271 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1806.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Yoder) to preside \nover the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1519\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 1806) to provide for technological innovation through the \nprioritization of Federal investment in basic research, fundamental \nscientific discovery, and development to improve the competitiveness of \nthe United States, and for other purposes, with Mr. Yoder in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) and the gentlewoman from Texas \n(Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to sponsor H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES \nReauthorization Act of 2015, a pro-science, fiscally responsible bill \nthat sets America on a path to remain the world's leader in innovation.\n  This bill reauthorizes civilian research programs at the National \nScience Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nthe Department of Energy, and the Office of Science and Technology \nPolicy. H.R. 1806 prioritizes basic research and development, while \nstaying within the caps set by the Budget Control Act.\n  America's businesses rely on government support for basic research to \nproduce the scientific breakthroughs that spur technological \ninnovation, jump-start new industries, and spur economic growth. Title \nI of the bill reauthorizes the National Science Foundation for 2 years \nand provides a 4.3 percent increase for research and related \nactivities.\n  The bill prioritizes funding for the Directorates of Biological \nSciences, Computer and Information Science and Engineering, \nEngineering, and Mathematics and Physical Sciences and recognizes the \nneed to make strategic investments in basic R for the U.S. to remain \nthe global leader in science and innovation. The bill reprioritizes \nresearch spending at NSF by cutting funding for the Directorate for \nSocial, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences and the Directorate for \nGeosciences.\n  Federal budget restraints require all taxpayers' dollars to be spent \non high-value science in the national interest. Unfortunately, NSF has \nfunded a number of projects that do not meet the highest standards of \nscientific merit, from climate change musicals, to evaluating animal \nphotographs in National Geographic, to studying human-set fires in New \nZealand in the 1800s. There are dozens of other examples.\n  The bill ensures accountability by restoring the original intent of \nthe 1950 NSF Act and requiring that all grants serve the ``national \ninterest.'' The NSF has endorsed this goal.\n  Title II represents the Science, Space, and Technology Committee's \ncommitment to enhancing STEM education programs. A healthy and viable \nSTEM workforce is critical to American industries and ensures our \nfuture economic prosperity.\n  The definition of STEM is expanded to include computer science, which \nconnects all STEM subjects. The bill also creates an advisory panel on \nSTEM education to ensure outside stakeholders have a role in assessing \nthe Federal STEM education portfolio.\n  Title III includes three bipartisan bills the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee approved in March. Those bills, H.R. 1119, the \nResearch and Development Efficiency Act; H.R. 1156, the International \nScience and Technology Cooperation Act of 2015; and H.R. 1162, the \nScience Prize Competitions Act, passed the committee by voice vote. Two \nof these were sponsored by the Democrats.\n  Title IV supports the important measurement, standards, and \ntechnology work taking place at the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology laboratories, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nprogram, and the recently authorized Network for Manufacturing \nInnovation.\n\n  Measurement science conducted at NIST contributes to industrial \ncompetitiveness by supporting the technical infrastructure and \nadvancements for nanotechnology, global positioning systems, material \nsciences, cybersecurity, health information technology, and a variety \nof other fields.\n  Title V reauthorizes the Department of Energy Office of Science for 2 \nyears, at a 5.4 percent increase over fiscal year 2015. It prioritizes \nbasic research that enables researchers in all 50 States to have access \nto world-class user facilities, including supercomputers and high-\nintensity light sources.\n  This bill also prevents duplication and requires DOE to certify that \nits climate science work is unique and not being undertaken by another \nFederal agency.\n  Title VI reauthorizes the DOE applied research and development \nprograms and activities for fiscal year 2016 and 2017. They include the \nOffice of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, the Office of \nNuclear Energy, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, \nthe Office of Fossil Energy, and the Advanced Research Projects Agency-\nEnergy.\n  H.R. 1806 refocuses some spending on late-stage commercialization \nefforts within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to \nresearch and development efforts.\n  The bill requires DOE to provide a regular strategic analysis of \nscience and technology activities within the Department, identifying \nkey areas for collaboration across science and applied research \nprograms.\n  Title VII proposes to cut red tape and bureaucracy in the DOE \ntechnology transfer process. It allows contractor-operators at DOE \nnational laboratories to work with the private sector more efficiently \nby delegating signature authority to the directors of the labs\n\n[[Page H3420]]\n\nthemselves, rather than to DOE contracting officers, for cooperative \nagreements valued at less than $1 million.\n  This title also requires DOE to assess its capability to authorize, \nhost, and oversee privately funded fusion research and the next \ngeneration fission reactor prototypes. Currently, the private sector \nhas little incentive to build reactor prototypes due to regulatory \nuncertainty from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  In summary, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1806 sets the right priorities for \nFederal civilian research, which enhances innovation and U.S. \ncompetitiveness without adding to the Federal deficit and debt.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Today, I must unfortunately rise in opposition to the America \nCOMPETES Reauthorization Act. It is unfortunate because I was a strong \nsupporter of both the original COMPETES Act, as well as the 2010 \nreauthorization.\n  Both of those bills passed with bipartisan support, and both bills \nreflected the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences' \ngroundbreaking 2005 report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.''\n  It is worth reflecting on what the National Academy's panel found and \nwhy they made the recommendations they did.\n  First, the panel that wrote the report was composed of a \ndistinguished group of individuals from industry, academia, and \nscience; and it was headed by the former Lockheed CEO Norm Augustine.\n  The panel noted that much of America's economic growth and success in \nthe decades following World War II was the direct result of our \nNation's sustained investment in research and development. However, \nthey noted that a gathering storm was approaching. America's economic \nand military competitors around the world had begun to catch up with \nour Nation's technological lead.\n  Moreover, research and development budgets in the United States were \nstagnating. The panel determined that America was sorely in need of a \nrecommitment to research and development in order to maintain our \ncompetitive edge.\n  The Augustine panel gave specific recommendations that we increase \nR spending, revitalize STEM education across the country, and also \ncreate and support a new ARPA-E for breakthrough energy research \nmodeled on the renowned DARPA program at the Department of Defense.\n  The original COMPETES Act implemented these recommendations across \nthe board. Supporting this bill was one of the highlights of my two \ndecades of service here in Congress.\n  I have highlighted this history because it is important to understand \nwhat we are doing here today and why these issues are so important. \nSince 2010, when we passed the last COMPETES reauthorization, R \nspending in America has begun to stagnate again and, by some measures, \neven declined.\n  In the meantime, our economic competitors have doubled down on their \ninvestments in research and development. Over the past decade, China \nhas averaged a 23 percent increase in R spending each year. Perhaps, \nnot surprisingly, in 2014, China overtook the United States to become \nthe world's largest economic power.\n  The crisis that the Augustine committee warned us about in 2005 has \nnow arrived.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  What is the response of our majority to this crisis? Absolutely \nnothing. That is what is in H.R. 1806: absolutely nothing.\n  H.R. 1806 completely abandons the recommendations of the Augustine \ncommittee and the original COMPETES Act. It abandons the legacy of \nCOMPETES by flat-funding R investments. It abandons the legacy by \nslashing funding for the very ARPA-E program envisioned by this \ncommittee, the Augustine committee. It abandons that legacy by \npoliticizing the scientific grant-making process and pitting different \nresearch disciplines against each other.\n  I want to be clear about what it is that this majority is abandoning. \nThey are abandoning our future.\n  America is the greatest nation on Earth, but our greatness is not \nguaranteed. We have to work for it. We have to do the things that are \nnecessary to ensure a bright future for our country. That means making \nthe same kinds of investments in science and technology that previous \ngenerations made. Our predecessors understood what was at stake. They \nmade a commitment to invest in research and development and science \neducation, and we still benefit from those past investments today.\n  The world is not standing still. If we do not recommit to our \ninvestments in science education, research, and development, we will be \nsurpassed.\n  The bill before us fails to secure our Nation's future, and for that \nreason, I must strenuously oppose it.\n  I am not alone in my opposition. We have received more than 40 \nletters or statements of concern or outright opposition from over 70 \ndifferent groups, including the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science, the Association of American Universities, the \nAssociation of Public and Land-grant Universities, the Business Council \nfor Sustainable Energy, the Coalition for National Science Funding, the \nSTEM Education Coalition, the Truman National Security Project, and \nmany, many others.

Again, I strongly, strongly \noppose this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Weber), who is the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee \nof the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank Chairman Smith for yielding me time to \nspeak on this important legislation that is on the floor today.\n  Mr. Chair, H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of \n2015, authorizes the science and energy research programs at the \nDepartment of Energy, providing funding for research and development \nconducted in our universities and national labs across the country.\n  DOE is the largest Federal supporter of basic research in the \nphysical sciences and provides user facilities for over 31,000 \nscientific researchers each year.\n  The America COMPETES Act prioritizes funding for the Office of \nScience, which conducts critical research in high energy physics, \nadvanced scientific computing, biological and environmental research, \nnuclear physics, fusion energy sciences, and basic energy sciences.\n  This basic R has broad applications for our economy and for our \nnational security, providing tools and user facilities for researchers \nin all energy fields.\n  The America COMPETES Act also reauthorizes the Department's applied \nenergy programs in nuclear energy, fossil energy, energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy, and electricity research and development.\n  By prioritizing research and development in these programs, we can \nmaximize Federal dollars and leave commercialization and deployment to \nthe private sector, Mr. Chairman, which has the most incentive to bring \nnew, cost-effective, and efficient technologies to market.\n  This legislation is fiscally responsible and cuts funding to lower-\npriority and duplicative programs like EERE, which has grown by almost \n60 percent in the last decade. With our national debt of $18 trillion \nand rising, Congress must prioritize fundamental research to lay the \nfoundation for the next technological breakthrough.\n  We simply cannot afford to spend limited Federal dollars on promoting \ntoday's technology. This is so yesterday when we do that. Instead of \nduplicating work that could be done in the private sector, the America \nCOMPETES Act prioritizes basic research and development with broad \napplication to all forms of energy and energy efficiencies.\n  Mr. Chairman, over the past 5 months, the Science Committee has held \nhearings on the Department of Energy research and development for \nadvanced nuclear reactors, high-performance computing, energy \nefficiency and renewable energy, energy storage, and the Department of \nEnergy budget proposal. With limited time, this Science Committee in \nthis Congress has conducted five hearings in support of this \nlegislation, prioritizing oversight of the DOE programs authorized in \nthis bill.\n  By supporting the America COMPETES Act, Congress can promote \nfundamental research, build a foundation for the private sector to \nbring innovative new technologies to market, and grow the American \neconomy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the America COMPETES Reauthorization \nAct.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I now yield 3 \nminutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, it is actually quite disappointing that we \nare here at this point today. And I join the ranking member and our \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle in opposing this harmful \nantiscience bill, H.R. 1806.\n  When I first came into Congress, I was excited because we were \nactually working on reauthorizing the COMPETES Act. We were making \ninvestments in important research and development and technologies for \nthe 21st century. And we were doing that in a bipartisan fashion based \non bipartisan scientific and research-based recommendations. But that \nis not where we are today.\n  H.R. 1806 contains severe funding cuts to the Department of Energy, \nincluding cutting close to one-third of the budget of the Office of \nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and half the budget of ARPA-E. \nIn fact, you could argue that this is not an investment in the 21st \ncentury at all: it is a throwback bill to the 20th century.\n  These cuts are going to cripple our Nation's research into high-\nimpact technologies to generate, store, and use energy and will harm \nour ability to compete successfully with other countries.\n  The bill also contains many harmful provisions restricting the \nDepartment of Energy, such as a provision preventing the results of any \nDepartment of Energy-supported fossil fuel energy research and \ndevelopment from being ``used for regulatory assessments or \ndeterminations by Federal regulatory authorities.'' That would \nessentially bar the EPA or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nfrom using the most current research results when they set rules to \nprotect our air, our land, and our water.\n\n  How unfortunate that this antiscience bill also includes a misguided \nattempt to impose a level of political review on the National Science \nFoundation's gold-standard merit review system.\n  This is the National Science Foundation, not a political \norganization.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I yield the gentlewoman an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. This is a dangerous proposal that would stifle the kind \nof high-risk, outside-the-box thinking that has put the United States \non the cutting edge of scientific research.\n  If this bill were to become law, it would eliminate valuable and \nscientifically sound research on climate change within the Department \nof Energy under the guise of a cost-cutting measure.\n  After all, Mr. Chairman, isn't that what this is about? It is about \nthe other side just not believing in climate change, despite the \nscience.\n  In addition to all of the dangerous and harmful things that this bill \ndoes do, it lacks any substantively helpful provisions in a number of \nareas.\n  I actually proposed an amendment that would simply look at our 21st \ncentury workforce by supporting research at minority-serving \ninstitutions, growing STEM fields for young people who we know have to \ngo into the 21st century workforce. It flat-funds the education \ndirectorate at the National Science Foundation.\n  I can't think of anything more harmful than doing a COMPETES \nlegislation that is, at its core, the most anticompetitive legislation \nthat could be put on this floor. It is a danger to the 21st century.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), who is the majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank my colleague, the chairman from Texas, for \nyielding and for his leadership in bringing the America COMPETES Act to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the America COMPETES Act. \nIf you look at what we are trying to do here, we want America to \nmaintain our competitive edge, to create good-paying jobs here at home. \nBut to do that, we need to invest wisely and responsibly in basic \nscientific research.\n  After years of overspending and the administration expanding programs \nway beyond the core missions of the National Science Foundation and the \nDepartment of Energy, the COMPETES Act prioritizes taxpayer dollars to \nsupport basic research in biology, chemistry, math, engineering, and \ncomputer science. American taxpayers' dollars are being spent on \nprograms that do\n\n[[Page H3422]]\n\nnot meet the national interest or help invest in our future.\n  I want to point out some of the wasteful spending that is being \neliminated by this legislation, the America COMPETES Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, $340,000 of taxpayer money is being spent to study \nhuman-set fires in New Zealand in the 1800s--taxpayer dollars here in \nAmerica are being spent on that; $50,000 to study civil lawsuits in \nPeru from 1600 to 1700; $487,000 to study textiles and gender in \nIceland from 874-1800, during the Viking era; $697,000 for ``The Great \nImmensity,'' a musical about climate change.\n  This is what taxpayer dollars are being spent on, Mr. Chairman, at a \ntime when Americans are tightening their belts and are looking to \nWashington to do what they are doing in being fiscally responsible.\n  This refocuses what we are supposed to be trying to do to promote \nscience, to promote computer science, as a computer scientist, the \nthings that are going to help American workers be successful--not all \nof this foolishness that is wasting taxpayer money. It is a great bill \nthat actually prioritizes the taxpayer dollars of this country. I urge \nmy colleagues to pass it.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes \nto the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the COMPETES Reauthorization \nAct, which is an attempt to disinvest, in my view, in research, \ninnovation, and education at a time when we ought to be investing in \nthose areas even more greatly.\n  This bill places our competitiveness at a serious risk over the long \nterm. The public must be awfully confused, I understand, by both sides \nclaiming that they are enhancing research. Many interest groups, \nhowever, disagree with our Republican friends.\n  I had hoped that this year's COMPETES legislation would have been \nwritten so that we could continue the tradition of the strong \nbipartisan support that it received in 2007 and 2010. Overwhelmingly, \nRepublicans voted for these bills initially and the reauthorization.\n  Unfortunately, the severe cuts and partisan policy changes it makes \npreclude that from happening. The Republicans who wrote this \nlegislation have decided that they know better than America's \nscientists and innovators. They arbitrarily pick and choose research \nprograms they like at the expense of those they ideologically oppose--\nin other words, not peer review but political review. And they cut key \nareas of research far below the levels appropriated for fiscal year \n2015, including the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program and R \nfor renewable energy technologies.\n  How ironic that we have an R bill on the floor and they are cutting \nR technology here.\n  Furthermore, this bill would slash our investments in the cutting \nedge ARPA-E program by 50 percent, which funds high-risk and high-\nreward research in energy technologies that might not otherwise be \npursued.\n  Now, of course, if global warming is not an issue, who cares.\n  This bill, though called the America COMPETES Act, really ought to be \ntitled the Everyone Else Competes Act because it will cause us to fall \nfarther and farther behind our overseas competitors, who are already \nfar outpacing us in how much they invest in science and technology \nresearch.\n  Alongside this bill today, the House also is considering a bill that \ntries to do something many of us agree ought to be done but it does it \nin a fiscally irresponsible way. I am opposing and urge my colleagues \nto oppose making the R tax credit permanent because we ought to pay \nfor it, Mr. Chairman--not make our children and grandchildren pay for \nit.\n  Over and over and over again, the Republicans claim that the tax cuts \nthat they are passing will pay for themselves. I came here in 1981. \nThat was the claim. Under President Reagan, we increased the debt 189 \npercent.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I yield the gentleman from \nMaryland an additional 1 minute.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. HOYER. Now, Bush did better after 2001 and 2003. He only \nincreased the deficit 87 percent, or almost three times that increased \nunder President Clinton; and none of the tax cuts ended up paying for \nthemselves, and Greenspan said so.\n  Since the beginning of this Congress, Republicans have brought to the \nfloor and passed nine tax cuts. It is so easy to vote for tax cuts. It \nis so hard to pay for what we are buying. And that is why we have a \ndeficit, because we do not pay for what we buy.\n  Today the House is being asked to vote on another unpaid-for tax \nextender that, on its own, would increase the deficit by $182 billion. \nThat is a total of $586 billion--over half a trillion dollars--that \nRepublicans are proposing to add to the deficit this year.\n  We have heard Republicans argue that making the R tax credit \npermanent would benefit the economy.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield the \ngentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HOYER. They are right about that, and I support the R being \nmade permanent--if we pay for it. That is a principle the American \npublic expects us to pursue. Many Democrats agree as well.\n  However, what will be an even greater benefit to the economy is for \nCongress to set aside the misguided mantra that tax cuts pay for \nthemselves and, instead, put America's fiscal house in order. Let's \nstart a real conversation about fixing our broken Tax Code in a \nfiscally sustainable way. Passing this R tax credit will undermine \nthat effort.\n  I am urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who care deeply \nabout fiscal sustainability, about tax reform, and about economic \ncompetitiveness to oppose these bills.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Knight), an active member of the Science, Space, \nand Technology Committee.\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the America COMPETES \nAct, and I would like to thank the chair for his leadership in this \nfield.\n  Mr. Chairman, today the Federal Government spends about $3 billion \nacross STEM education efforts. This bill creates a new STEM education \nadvisory panel to provide feedback and advise the President and Federal \nagencies with STEM programs to better inform plans and budgets. The \nbill directs that STEM education efforts are to be coordinated across \nthe Federal Government to limit duplication. Industry also recognizes \nthe benefits of STEM. This is evidenced by its support of various STEM \nprograms with equipment, facilities, and volunteers.\n  In my district alone, aerospace thrives with high-technical, high-\npaying jobs. Without STEM, without reaching out with STEM education, we \ndon't get those folks to jump in there. We have to talk about other \nthings like visas and bringing people in for these types of jobs \ninstead of working with our kids to get them educated and moving toward \na good career.\n  This bill provides for grants for research on STEM programming that \nengages underrepresented students. Again, in my district, we have the \nLancaster Robotics Team. It started more than 10 years ago. When it \nstarted, it was about 2 percent women, or 2 percent girls; today it is \nover 40 percent. Forty percent of the Lancaster Robotics Team is girls \nworking towards a STEM degree, working towards an engineering degree, a \nmathematics degree, and a computer science degree. Again, aerospace \nbrings many of the highest paying and most technical jobs not just to \nmy district, but to this country.\n  Mr. Chairman, STEM education is not just a buzzword; it is something \nthat actually works. STEM education is the lifeblood for what we do in \na high technical society. If we don't do it, someone else will. We \nshould do it right here in America. I ask for an ``aye'' vote.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1806, the America \nCOMPETES Reauthorization Act. The original\n\n[[Page H3423]]\n\nCOMPETES Act was visionary in its commitment to increased R funding, \nand I strongly believe we should continue to increase funding for \nworthwhile investments in our Nation's future. However, I have serious \nconcerns with this bill that the majority has offered.\n  In 2010, as a member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, \nI had the opportunity to work on a truly bipartisan reauthorization of \nCOMPETES. We worked together and chose to make certain that we innovate \nand we made certain that we would compete.\n  This year I returned to the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, \nexcited to again work on a smart and targeted COMPETES reauthorization. \nUnfortunately, there was no bipartisan process, and the result is a \nbill that does not live up to the original COMPETES vision. It would be \nmore appropriately named the ``America Concedes'' bill. Why? Because at \na time when the rest of the world is taking extraordinary steps to \ninnovate, this bill would have America do the opposite. Its efforts are \nmisguided, at the least. Major areas of research are not adequately \nfunded, and the policy changes would take us in the wrong direction.\n  Mr. Chair, I am concerned by the majority's fixation on allocating \nfunding for NSF by directorate. This creates a dangerous precedent in \ndenying NSF adequate flexibility and instead places political whims \nahead of the need to independently foster true innovative research. I \nam also concerned by the effort to impose political review on NSF's \ngold-standard merit review system. The scientific community in our \nNation and around the world agrees that NSF's review system works, and \nworks very well. So why would we make it more difficult to encourage \nhigh risk, high rewards research?\n  Instead, we should be increasing research funding, providing NSF the \nappropriate flexibility to fund innovative research, and we should be \ninvesting in a sustained commitment to STEM education. My district \nneeds and deserves STEM as an education process. It doesn't want simple \nbuzzwords. It wants a real STEM education effort.\n\n  As a nation, we are woefully underproducing scientists and engineers. \nIn order to remain a competitive global economic power in the 21st \ncentury, we must place a strong focus on STEM education. Instead, this \nbill provides flat funding for STEM education along with increased \nadministrative burdens. That is not a commitment to STEM education. In \npractical terms, it is a decrease in funding.\n  I am also concerned by the cuts in funding for the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership program and by the strike in funding for the \nNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation, or NNMI. These \ninitiatives are smart investments and opportunities for our Nation to \ntruly collaborate, to compete, and to be truly cutting-edge. This bill \ndenies our American pioneer spirit.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield the \ngentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. TONKO. This bill also makes huge cuts to funding for Energy \nEfficiency and Renewable Energy research and development as well as the \nfunding for ARPA-E. These cuts ignore the reality that a modern society \nneeds energy, and the only way we are going to meet our energy \nchallenge is through smart investments in research and development.\n  Energy is essential to our economy, and if we pull back resources and \ndo not invest, we will put our economic and national security at risk. \nWe will also not meet the energy challenge if we blindly ignore \nexisting research and refuse to access the most up-to-date information.\n  We also cannot solve our budget deficit with these types of cuts. In \nfact, they are more likely to make the problem worse. The best way to \nreduce our budget deficit is by fostering new businesses and industries \nthat generate economic wealth, revenue, and jobs, and the fuel for that \ntask is research and development. We are missing a golden opportunity \nwith this measure. For these reasons I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this bill does not touch merit \nreview.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nBabin), who is a valuable member of the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1806, \nthe America COMPETES Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, when the American people pay their taxes, they expect \ntheir tax dollars to be spent effectively and efficiently. Too often \nthat has not been the case across government, and there is nothing \nworse than seeing taxes taken out of their paychecks and wasted. Not \nonly is that fiscally irresponsible, it is insulting to the taxpayers.\n  The bill before us is fiscally responsible and takes important steps \nto cut wasteful spending. Traditionally, when the National Science \nFoundation was mentioned, Americans thought of hard sciences--basic \nresearch, advanced technologies in biology, engineering, mathematics, \nand the physical sciences. It is investments in these fields that \nadvance American technology and help the United States maintain its \ncompetitive edge.\n  Unfortunately, some recent National Science Foundation expenditures \nhave brought widespread criticism to the NSF and its priorities. There \nwas the expenditure, for example, of $856,000 on a grant to teach three \ncaptive mountain lions how to use a treadmill. NSF spent another \n$387,000 on a mechanical device that simulates Swedish massages for \nrabbits. This is unquestionably a waste of taxpayer money, particularly \nwhen we are over $18 trillion in debt.\n  Our bill cuts spending on lower priority government social and \nbehavioral programs at the National Science Foundation by 45 percent, \nsaving taxpayer dollars and setting a higher priority on the harder \nsciences. The American people want Washington to be responsible with \ntheir money, and when Federal agencies get out of hand, they need to be \nreined in, and our bill does just that.\n  I want to thank Chairman Smith and his staff for their hard work and \nleadership on this bill, and I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting it.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes \nto the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas for yielding.\n  Bentley University is a renowned business school in my district, and \nwhen a class from Bentley visited me just a few weeks ago, they were \nadvocating for a critical underpinning of our economy. These students \ncame to discuss the importance of funding the geosciences in the NSF. \nWhy? Because it is good business.\n  These students and the business community understand the critical \nrole that geoscience has in disaster resilience, helping us to address \ndrought, looking at solar storms that can cripple our electric grid, \nimpacts on fisheries and ocean health, and in maintaining agriculture \nand in healthy soil.\n  Business leaders know that extreme weather like hurricanes, droughts, \ntornadoes, and landslides result in billions of dollars in damage, and \nby using what we learn from geoscience, we can identify ways to \nmitigate these costs and save us money. Business leaders understand \nthis connection, so why doesn't Congress?\n  Rather than support investment in geoscience research, this \nlegislation specifically targets it for drastic cuts in funding. \nClimate change is real. Human activity contributes to it, and it is bad \nfor the bottom line. It is irresponsible for us to cut funding for \nresearch that helps us understand what is happening and how to address \nit.\n  Adequately funding geoscience research is critical to protecting and \ngrowing our economy and to the security of the American people. Let's \nvote for our economy, let's vote for our security, and let's reject \nthis bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Chairman, as set forth in the report that accompanied the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee approval of the America \nCOMPETES Act, NSF will maintain full funding for research in the hard \nscience areas of geoscience like deep-ocean drilling and geological \nresearch to find new energy resources. What our bill does do is reduce \nfunds that have been used by NSF to fund low priorities like a survey \nof\n\n[[Page H3424]]\n\nNorwegian tourism, teaching TV meteorologists about climate change, and \ncreating climate change video games.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nMcCaul), my colleague and the chairman of the Homeland Security \nCommittee.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of reauthorization \nof the America COMPETES Act. In this tough budget environment, I \napplaud Chairman Smith and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee \nfor crafting a bill that provides for much-needed investments in \nscientific research in a fiscally responsible manner. By setting \npriorities and eliminating duplicative activities, we are actually able \nto increase funding for new and promising research while keeping \noverall spending constant.\n  This bill is designed to secure America's premier status in \nscientific and technological advancement in several ways. First, it \nimproves our STEM education programs by adding computer sciences to the \ndefinition of STEM education, which will allow these programs to be \nused to train the next generation of high-tech workers and \ncybersecurity professionals. As our high-tech sector continues to \nexpand in places like my hometown of Austin, it is important to make \nsure that we are producing enough qualified workers to fill these jobs.\n  Second, this bill also helps researchers at our national labs \ncommercialize their discoveries by removing bureaucratic obstacles. \nThis will bring innovative new products to market faster, encouraging \njob creation and private sector investment.\n  Most importantly, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act provides a \nsubstantial increase in funding for research activities at the National \nScience Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nand the Department of Energy. This will allow the scientists at our \nuniversities, such as the University of Texas, to advance our \nunderstanding of the physical world and provide the foundation for \nfuture innovations by business and new entrepreneurs.\n  I urge strong support of this bill.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON. Mr. Chairman. I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose the \nAmerica COMPETES Act in part because it cuts over $62 million of \nfunding to the hard science of studying the effects of climate change.\n  The effects of climate change are not a partisan issue. We know that \nour sea levels have risen by over 6.7 inches in the last century, and \nthey have accelerated in the last decade. Rising sea levels affect not \njust Democratic districts; it also affects Republican districts.\n  We can measure with precision that we have had, over 20 years, the \nhottest records in terms of temperatures in recorded history having \noccurred since 1980. We know that, in 2012, over 19 States broke the \nhottest records in their States. More extreme weather events and more \nweather uncertainty affect not just red States and blue States and \npurple States, it affects all of America. And that is why, last month, \nformer Reagan Secretary of State George Shultz wrote an op-ed in The \nWashington Post saying: Climate change is happening. We need to take \naction on it, and we need to ensure our future against climate change. \nHe called it the Reagan way. He said that is what President Reagan \nwould have done.\n  As you know, this America COMPETES Act, the funding for the hard \nscience of the effects of climate change, was put in place under \nPresident Bush in 2007. Just today, our President announced what the \nU.S. military is saying about climate change.\n  I served on Active Duty in the United States Air Force. I am now 19 \nyears in with the Reserves. One of the amazing strengths of America is \nthat our military is nonpartisan, nonideological; and our military \ntakes the world as it is, not as they hope it to be. Our military does \nnot live in a fantasy world, and they understand that climate change is \nhappening. They know it is a national security threat. They are telling \nthe American public we need to act on climate change now because we \ncan't have flooding of our bases; we can't have droughts and more \nsevere weather events that cause conflicts in all the parts of the \nworld.\n  So I ask the American public to trust former Reagan Secretary of \nState George Shultz, trust President Bush, trust our United States \nmilitary who are saying climate change is a problem. Keep in mind, our \nmilitary relies on hard science and technology and all that makes this \nworld possible. So trust our military, and trust everyone who has \nlooked at it. Please reject the America COMPETES Act because we need to \ndeal with climate change. We need to deal with it now.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar), who is a member of the Science Committee \nand also a vice chairman of the Research and Technology Subcommittee.\n  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Chairman, the America COMPETES Act is good \nlegislation that will help build a better future for our country. The \nCOMPETES Act expands the definition of STEM education to include \ncomputer science.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for every computer \nscience graduate between 2013 and 2023, there will be two jobs \navailable. That is why programs in my district like Go IT, offered free \nof charge to middle and high school students, are so important to \ncreating career awareness in computer science and other STEM fields.\n  This legislation increases government accountability. It requires the \nNational Science Foundation grants meet a national interest standard \nand to publicly justify why they should receive taxpayer dollars. \nRequiring government agencies to prioritize the national interest is \ncommon sense. It enhances accountability to the American people.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the America COMPETES Act, and I urge \nmy colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers at this time \nas well, so I will reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON. Mr. Chair, I have no further requests for \nspeaking.\n  I just urge everyone to vote ``no'' on this bill, and I yield back \nthe balance of time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle today would have you \nbelieve that the only way you can be pro-science is to spend more \ntaxpayer money than the Budget Control Act allows. That is \nirresponsible.\n  If everything is a priority, then nothing is. Real priorities require \nmaking real choices.\n  If synthetic biology research at NSF is a priority, we should stop \nusing the American people's tax dollars to fund reviews of animal \nphotographs in National Geographic magazine. If robotics and batteries \nare priorities, we should not continue to spend taxpayer dollars on \nclimate change musicals.\n  H.R. 1806 proves that we can set priorities, make tough choices, and \nstill invest more in breakthrough research and innovation.\n  I thank the members of the Science Committee who provided valuable \ninput into H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015; \nand that includes the cosponsors of the bill: Committee Vice Chairman \nFrank Lucas; all of our subcommittee chairs, Barbara Comstock, Randy \nWeber, Barry Loudermilk, and Jim Bridenstine; as well as \nRepresentatives Steve Palazzo, Randy Hultgren, Steve Knight, Brian \nBabin, and John Moolenaar.\n  I urge the adoption of this pro-science, fiscally responsible bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into the Record an exchange of \nletters between the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the \nCommittees on Education and the Workforce, Oversight and Government \nReform, and Energy and Commerce.\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Education and the \n           Workforce\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Chair, I would like to submit for the Record my \nstrong opposition to H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization \nAct of 2015.\n  This harmful bill undermines key investments in science and \ninnovation, as well as our nation's commitment to world class research, \nincluding the research that is taking place in my congressional \ndistrict on the Central Coast of California.\n  Specifically, this bill cuts several important programs at NSF, \nincluding research and development related to climate science, natural \nhazards, and renewable energy.\n  Furthermore, H.R. 1806 cripples support for international research \ncollaborations--an instrumental tool at UC Santa Barbara, which has led \nto groundbreaking research and produced multiple Nobel Prize winners.\n  As we move to affirm our nation's leadership in science and \ntechnology, we should be working in a bipartisan manner to strengthen \nour investments in scientific research--not weaken them.\n  This bill is sadly a step backward for American innovation, and I \nurge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 1806.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). All time for general debate has \nexpired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, printed in the bill, \nit shall\n\n[[Page H3426]]\n\nbe in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of \namendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-15. That \namendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as \nfollows:\n\n                               H.R. 1806\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Taxpayer-supported research investments administered by \n     the Foundation should serve the national interest.\n       (2) The Foundation has made major contributions for more \n     than 60 years to strengthen and sustain the Nation's academic \n     research enterprise.\n       (3) The economic strength and national security of the \n     United States, and the quality of life of all Americans, are \n     grounded in the Nation's scientific and technological \n     capabilities.\n       (4) Providing support for basic research is an investment \n     in our Nation's future security and economic prosperity.\n       (5) Congress applauds the Foundation's recognition that \n     wise stewardship of taxpayer dollars is necessary to maintain \n     and ensure the public's trust for funding of fundamental \n     scientific and engineering research.\n       (6) Other nations are increasing their public investments \n     in basic research in the physical sciences in order to boost \n     long-term economic growth.\n       (7) Longstanding United States leadership in \n     supercomputing, genomics, nanoscience, photonics, quantum \n     physics, and other key technological areas is jeopardized if \n     United States investments in basic research in the natural \n     sciences do not keep pace.\n       (8) Redundant regulations and reporting requirements \n     imposed by Federal agencies on research institutions and \n     researchers increase costs by tens of millions of dollars \n     annually.\n       (9) The Foundation carries out important functions by \n     supporting basic research in all science and engineering \n     disciplines and in supporting STEM education at all levels.\n       (10) The research and education activities of the \n     Foundation promote the discovery, integration, dissemination, \n     and application of new knowledge in service to society and \n     prepare future generations of scientists, mathematicians, and \n     engineers who will be necessary to ensure America's \n     leadership in the global marketplace.\n       (11) Many of the complex problems and challenges facing the \n     Nation increasingly require the collaboration of multiple \n     scientific disciplines. The Foundation should continue to \n     emphasize cross-directorate research collaboration and \n     activities to address these issues and encourage \n     interdisciplinary research.\n       (12) The Foundation should meet the highest standards of \n     efficiency, transparency, and accountability in its \n     stewardship of public funds.\n       (13) The Foundation is charged with the responsibilities--\n       (A) to develop and encourage the pursuit of a national \n     policy for the promotion of basic research and education in \n     the sciences;\n       (B) to initiate, support, and conduct basic scientific \n     research and to appraise the impact of research on industrial \n     development and the general welfare;\n       (C) to initiate, support, and conduct scientific research \n     activities in connection with matters relating to the \n     national defense, at the request of the Secretary of Defense;\n       (D) to award scholarships and graduate fellowships in the \n     sciences;\n       (E) to foster the interchange of scientific information \n     among scientists and across scientific disciplines;\n       (F) to evaluate scientific research programs undertaken by \n     agencies of the Federal Government, and to correlate the \n     Foundation's scientific research with that undertaken by \n     individuals and by public and private research groups;\n       (G) to communicate effectively to American citizens the \n     relevance of public investments in scientific discovery and \n     technological innovation to the Nation's security, \n     prosperity, and welfare; and\n       (H) to establish such special commissions as the Board \n     considers necessary.\n       (14) The emerging global economic, scientific, and \n     technical environment challenges long standing assumptions \n     about domestic and international policy, requiring the \n     Foundation to play a more proactive role in sustaining the \n     competitive advantage of the United States through superior \n     research capabilities.\n\n     SEC. 103. POLICY OBJECTIVES.\n\n       In allocating resources made available under this title, \n     the Foundation shall have the following policy objectives:\n       (1) To renew and maintain the Nation's international \n     leadership in science and technology by--\n       (A) increasing the national investment in basic scientific \n     research and increasing interdisciplinary investment in \n     strategic areas vital to the national interest;\n       (B) balancing the Nation's research portfolio among the \n     life sciences, mathematics, the physical sciences, computer \n     and information science, geosciences, engineering, and \n     social, behavioral, and economic sciences, all of which are \n     important for the continued development of enabling \n     technologies necessary for sustained economic \n     competitiveness;\n       (C) encouraging investments in potentially transformative \n     scientific research to benefit our Nation and its citizens;\n       (D) expanding the pool of scientists and engineers in the \n     United States, including among segments of the population \n     that have been historically underrepresented in STEM fields; \n     and\n       (E) modernizing the Nation's research infrastructure and \n     establishing and maintaining cooperative international \n     relationships with premier research institutions.\n       (2) To increase overall workforce skills by--\n       (A) improving the quality of STEM education and tools \n     provided both inside and outside of the classroom, including \n     in kindergarten through grade 12; and\n       (B) expanding STEM training opportunities at institutions \n     of higher education.\n       (3) To strengthen innovation by expanding the focus of \n     competitiveness and innovation at the regional and local \n     level.\n\n     SEC. 104.

Mr. Chairman, this manager's amendment makes some \nchanges to improve the underlying legislation.\n  The amendment shifts $48 million in funding within the research and \nrelated activities account at the National Science Foundation. This is \nat the request of Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science and Related \nAgencies Subcommittee chairman, John Culberson of Texas, and provides \nadditional funding for integrative activities to keep it at the fiscal \nyear '15 level.\n  This account includes the Graduate Research Fellowship Program and \nthe Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, which will \nbe fully funded at this level.\n  The amendment directs the Department of Energy to develop \ntechnologies to enhance security for electrical transmission and \ndistribution systems.\n  The amendment includes additional direction on the development of \nhubs, innovation institutes, and research centers at the Department of \nEnergy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition to this amendment, although I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I appreciate that this amendment makes a few small improvements to \nthe bill, so I will not oppose it. However, I want to take a moment to \nreflect on how this amendment demonstrates how flawed the process on \nthe majority's bill has been.\n  In this amendment, the chairman restores an arbitrary 11 percent cut \nto the EPSCoR program, in addition to the prestigious NSF Graduate \nResearch Fellowship Program, scientific instrumentation for smaller \ninstitutions that cannot afford their own, and interdisciplinary \nresearch centers.\n  Even our colleagues on Appropriations prioritized full funding for \nthis account at NSF while they made steep cuts to other accounts.\n  It just happens that EPSCoR States overall are represented by many \nmore Republicans than Democrats; so, when the Science Committee \nRepublicans proposed cutting funding for the EPSCoR program by 11 \npercent, their caucus took notice.\n  If only the chairman had actually given the stakeholder community, \nhis colleagues, and the research and development agencies an \nopportunity for a hearing or to see and respond or work in subcommittee \non it and respond to this bill before introducing it, we wouldn't have \nhad to fix all of these very big mistakes today.\n  I am glad the chairman is now restoring the cut to EPSCoR and the \nother important programs in that account. I only wish he would have \nlistened to an overwhelming call by the stakeholder community and even \nsome of his own colleagues to restore the other arbitrary and \nshortsighted cuts in this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers on this \nside, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-120.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment \nat the desk as the designee of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nFoster).\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 15, line 13, through page 17, line 9, strike section \n     106.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. \nFoster for his leadership on this important issue.\n  Section 106 exemplifies the majority's efforts to impose their own \npersonal beliefs and ideologies on the process of scientific discovery. \nColleagues, science is not about belief; it is about discovery and the \npursuit of questions about both the natural world and the human world.\n  We should hold NSF accountable, and NSF should hold its grantees \naccountable. However, accountability should be measured according to \nthe transparency and integrity of the grant review process, not \naccording to what types of science some of us believe in and some \ndon't.\n  Had we imposed the section 106 requirement on NSF earlier, they may \nhave never funded the grant that led to billions in revenue from the \nspectrum auction. They may never have funded the grant that the DOD now \nuses to help train our soldiers on the front lines to differentiate \nbetween friend and foe. They may never have funded the grant that led \nto the creation of Google.\n  Chairman Smith has been investigating NSF grants he doesn't like \nsince he became chairman of this committee. The entire purpose of \nsection 106 is to give him a bigger club to continue his unfounded \ninvestigations in the future.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  This is bad for NSF, and it is worse for the U.S. leadership in \nscience and innovation. I urge my colleagues to think long and hard \nabout the consequences of imposing our own political views and review \non the NSF's gold-standard scientific merit review process, and I urge \nthe support of Mr. Foster's amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, it is just inconceivable to me that \nany U.S. Representative would oppose requiring government grants funded \nby the U.S. taxpayer to be spent in the national interest.\n  Throughout its history, the National Science Foundation has played an \nintegral part in funding breakthrough discoveries in fields as diverse \nas mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, engineering, and \nbiology.\n  However, the NSF has approved a number of grants for which the \nscientific merits and national interest are not obvious, to put it \npolitely. These include a climate change musical costing $800,000, \nevaluating animal photographs in National Geographic for at least \n$200,000, and studying early human-set fires in New Zealand, in the \n1800s, for several hundred thousand dollars.\n  The section this amendment strikes ensures that the NSF is \ntransparent and accountable to the taxpayers about how their hard-\nearned dollars are spent. The bill requires that every NSF public \nannouncement of a grant award be accompanied by a nontechnical \nexplanation of the project's scientific merits and how it serves the \nnational interest.\n  The NSF itself has recognized the need for this transparency and \naccountability. Last January, the NSF released a new policy that \nacknowledges that the NSF must communicate clearly and in nontechnical \nterms the research projects it funds. The policy\n\n[[Page H3447]]\n\nemphasizes that the title abstract for each funded grant should explain \nhow the project serves the national interest, a requirement first cited \nin the 1950 legislation that created the National Science Foundation. \nAgain, the national interest standard that the gentlewoman from Texas \nopposes was in the NSF's first charter.\n  The current Director of the NSF herself has endorsed the national \ninterest standard. In her testimony before the House Science, Space, \nand Technology Committee on February 25, NSF Director France Cordova \nspoke about the very section the gentlewoman seeks to eliminate.\n  Dr. Cordova said: ``It is very compatible with the new internal NSF \nguidelines and with the mission statement of NSF.''\n  The national interest standard does not interfere with the merit \nreview process. The bill clearly states: ``Nothing in this section \nshall be construed as altering the Foundation's intellectual merit or \nbroader impacts criteria for evaluating grant applications.''\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to support the \nunderlying legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time \nas he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), a \nphysicist.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment, which I understand has been \nintroduced, would strike section 106 of the bill, which, in my view, \nadds a dangerous political filter to NSF's gold-standard merit review \nprocess.\n  I do not stand alone in this view. The overwhelming majority of my \ncolleagues in the scientific community are still quite uncomfortable \nwith this language that would, as the American Society for Microbiology \nstated, ``have an adverse impact on NSF's peer review process, which is \nessential to funding meritorious research.'' All of us here want to be \ngood stewards of taxpayer money.\n  This is also true of the National Science Foundation, which currently \nalready requires that the NSF public award abstract consist of a \nnontechnical component which will include ``a public justification for \nNSF funding by articulating how the project serves the national \ninterest,'' as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of \nscience; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; or to \nsecure the national defense.\n  As the Biophysical Society has pointed out: ``NSF is committed to . . \n. offering the public a better understanding of a research project's \nintent, which will satisfy this section's objective.''\n  The whole intent of this mystifies me a little bit. I serve on two \ncommittees--the Financial Services Committee and the Science, Space, \nand Technology Committee. On the Financial Services Committee, there is \na steady drumbeat of Republican proposals to remove duplicitous and \nredundant requirements that just waste everyone's time; whereas, it \nseems to me that section 106 is exactly along this line. While it may \njust seem an innocuous waste of time to some, we know that for the past \n2 years scientists have had their projects targeted as potentially \nwasteful or not ``in the national interest,'' often based on nothing \nbut their titles. Not only is this wrong, it is blatantly political.\n  It is easy to make cheap shots here. My parents, actually, both \nworked for Senator Bill Proxmire, who for years and years did the \nGolden Fleece Awards. He was a wonderful and thoughtful Senator, but on \nthis one, he consistently missed the mark. It is easy to make fun of \nprojects with funny sounding names or with strange topics, but the NSF \nis the gold standard for a reason.\n  Take, for example, anthropologist Dr. Scott Atran, who received \nfunding from the NSF in 1994 for a study that was entitled, ``Local \nEcological Knowledge of Common-Pool Resources in Campeche, Mexico.'' \nDr. Atran subsequently applied what he learned to questions of \nextremism in the Middle East and is now a key national expert on \ncountering extremism in the Middle East, valued as a consultant by the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of State.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman from Texas has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I will simply say to the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Foster) that I recognize and appreciate him. He is a \nsmart, thoughtful, and well-motivated member of the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee, so I am really sorry he opposes this national \ninterest standard that, I think, is the right thing to do for America \nand for the American taxpayers.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nLipinski), who is a very active and talented member of the Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend my good friend from \nIllinois for his strong commitment to advocating for scientific \nresearch. I share many of his concerns about the underlying bill, and I \nwill be voting against this bill. However, I must also oppose this \namendment. I agree with Mr. Foster and I disagree with the chairman on \nsome of the attacks on some past grants that have been granted by the \nNSF. I think section 106 helps to avoid that.\n  The first incarnation of what is now section 106 was the High Quality \nResearch Act, which was unveiled nearly 2 years ago. I strongly opposed \nthat, as did the vast majority of the research community, and we set \nabout getting that changed. Through a series of discussions, the \ncurrent language--vastly different and vastly improved from the \noriginal--was reached with a broad definition of national interest that \ndoes not do anything to undermine the gold-standard NSF peer review \nsystem. I invite all to read the section and decide for themselves, or \nto simply listen to the NSF and to the NSB, which oversees the NSF.\n\n  As the chairman said, NSF Director France Cordova stated her support \nfor section 106 at a committee hearing in February, saying it is ``very \ncompatible with the NSF internal guidelines and with the mission \nstatement of NSF.''\n  I applaud NSF for these new guidelines which explain to the public \nwhy each proposal is being funded and how it is in the national \ninterest. This will help the NSF defend worthwhile grants that are \nattacked by critics who sometimes misrepresent projects. In doing so, \nit will also protect the NSF.\n  While the National Science Board does not formally endorse \nlegislation, at the meeting 2 weeks ago, the board passed a resolution \nstrongly endorsing the principle that all Foundation-funded research \nmust further the national interest by contributing to the Foundation's \nmission.\n  So, while I agree with my friend on almost everything related to \nscience policy, I must reluctantly oppose this amendment. I wish we \ncould have been able to have worked out a COMPETES bill we could all \nsupport. Regrettably, we did not, but let's not throw out this language \nthat was worked out and that will help the NSF defend its peer review \nprocess.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-120.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 29, line 20, strike ``and''.\n       Page 29, line 23, strike the period and insert a semicolon.\n       Page 29, after line 23, insert the following:\n       (K) creating State and regional workshops to train K-12 \n     teachers in science and technology project-based learning to \n     provide instruction in how to initiate robotics and other \n     STEM competition team development programs; and\n       (L) encouraging and supporting efforts led by institutions \n     of higher education, businesses, and local public and private \n     educational agencies to establish collaborative\n\n[[Page H3448]]\n\n     efforts to provide K-12 students residing in areas with \n     unemployment rates that exceed the national average by 1 \n     percent or more.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, let me take a moment to thank both of my \nfellow Texans and to acknowledge that I know that there is a difference \nof opinion, but no one can disagree with the crucialness of America's \ncompetitiveness and of the necessity for creating a workforce that can \ncompete.\n  Allow me to acknowledge Congressman Johnson for the steadfast \ncommitment and service to the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. \nI had the privilege of serving with her in the early stages of my \nmembership here in this august body, and I want to thank her personally \nfor the great strides and successes that she has had in expanding \nopportunities for the most vulnerable in our community.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment speaks to this issue, and it continues to \nseek to address the STEM education gap for K-12 students. Jackson Lee \namendment No. 3 creates State and regional workshops to train K-12 \nteachers in project-based science and technology learning, which will \nallow them to provide instruction in initiating robotics and other STEM \ncompetition team development programs.\n  I now serve on the Homeland Security Committee, and I note that the \nextent of technology in securing this Nation is without comparison. It \nis necessary. It is crucial. This amendment also leverages the \ncollaboration among higher education businesses and local and private/\npublic education agencies to support STEM efforts at schools located in \nareas where unemployment is 1 percent or more above the national rate.\n  We want to get right to the core of the most vulnerable and the most \nneedy students. Robotic competitions and other similar competitive \nopportunities have proven to be one of the most successful paths for \nengaging young minds in STEM education. I have held a robotics \ncompetition, and it is absolutely amazing to see the young people's \nminds and hearts gather around it. My amendment has that capacity to \nit. Of course, it responds to the fact that only 1 out of 10 high \nschools in the U.S. offers computer science programs, and it is \nestimated that the education systems in 25 States do not count computer \nscience classes toward high school graduation.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment, although I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would include \nteacher training for STEM competitions and collaborations as permitted \nactivities under a program in the bill to encourage engagement in STEM \neducation activities. Supporting out-of-school activities, like \ncompetitions, is consistent with the underlying bill, so I accept the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to focus just a little bit on \ncompetitions regarding this amendment, competitions such as FIRST, \nwhich is a national robotics competition that engages 400,000 students \neach year and that awards millions of dollars in scholarships, paving \nthe way for future STEM success.\n  I submit for the Record a document entitled, ``Disparities in STEM \nEmployment by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin.''\n\n                     [From census.gov, Sept. 2013]\n\n    Disparities in STEM Employment by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin\n\n                      (By Liana Christin Landivar)\n\n\n                   american community survey reports\n\n     Introduction\n       Industry, government, and academic leaders cite increasing \n     the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) \n     workforce as a top concern. The National Academy of Sciences, \n     National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of \n     Medicine describe STEM as ``high-quality, knowledge-intensive \n     jobs . . . that lead to discovery and new technology,'' \n     improving the U.S. economy and standard of living. In 2007, \n     Congress passed the America COMPETES Act, reauthorized in \n     2010, to increase funding for STEM education and research.\n       One focus area for increasing the STEM workforce has been \n     to reduce disparities in STEM employment by sex, race, and \n     Hispanic origin. Historically, women, Blacks, and Hispanics \n     have been underrepresented in STEM employment. Researchers \n     find that women, Blacks, and Hispanics are less likely to be \n     in a science or engineering major at the start of their \n     college experience, and less likely to remain in these majors \n     by its conclusion. Because most STEM workers have a science \n     or engineering college degree, underrepresentation among \n     science and engineering majors could contribute to the \n     underrepresentation of women, Blacks, and Hispanics in STEM \n     employment.\n       This report details the historical demographic composition \n     of STEM occupations, followed by a detailed examination of \n     current STEM employment by age and sex, presence of children \n     in the household, and race and Hispanic origin based on the \n     2011 American Community Survey (ACS). The report concludes \n     with an examination of the demographic characteristics of \n     science and engineering graduates who are currently employed \n     in a STEM occupation.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Specifically, the language says: ``Industry, \ngovernment, and academic leaders cite increasing the science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce as a top \nconcern.''\n  This is in the American Community Survey Reports.\n  ``One focus area for increasing the STEM workforce has been to reduce \ndisparities in STEM employment by sex, race, and Hispanic origin. \nHistorically, women, Blacks, and Hispanics have been underrepresented \nin STEM employment,'' and it goes on to elaborate.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  This amendment gives an added opportunity to focus in, to hone in on \nteacher training and reaching out to those very hungry minds in the \nminority communities who are eager to be part of the changing fabric of \nAmerica that focuses on science, technology, engineering, and math. \nFrom financial services, to homeland security, to space and \naeronautics, to manufacturing, to the Silicon Valleys of the Nation, \nSTEM is crucial.\n  I would like to now acknowledge both the committee staff on the \nmajority and minority who assisted us, and I would like to acknowledge \nmy staff, Lillie Coney, for her excellent work on these matters.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee \namendment.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson for the opportunity \nto speak on my amendment to H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES \nReauthorization Act of 2015.\n  My amendment included in the Rule to H.R. 1806 would improve the bill \nby addressing the STEM education gap for K-12 students.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #3, creates state and regional workshops to \ntrain K-12 teachers in project-based science and technology learning, \nwhich will allow them to provide instruction in initiating robotics and \nother STEM competition team development programs.\n  This amendment also leverages the collaboration among higher \neducation, businesses, local private and public education agencies to \nsupport STEM efforts at schools located in areas with unemployment is 1 \npercent or more above the national rate.\n  Robotics competitions and other similar competitive opportunities \nhave proven to be one of the most successful paths for engaging young \nminds in STEM education.\n  Competitions such as FIRST, a national robotics competition that \nengages 400,000 students each year and awards millions of dollars in \nscholarships are paving the way for future STEM success.\n  This Jackson Lee amendment focuses on reducing the STEM gaps that \ncurrently exists between K-12 students attending schools in different \ngeographic regions or who come from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.\n  Only 1 out of 10 high schools in the U.S. offer computer science \nprograms\n  It is estimated that the education systems in 25 states do not count \ncomputer science classes toward high school graduation.\n  Both economists and business leaders have identified that the future \nof the American economy will be in STEM fields, which the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics estimates will create more than 9 million jobs between \n2012 and 2022.\n  The STEM gap is more pronounced when considering minority groups.\n\n[[Page H3449]]\n\n  U.S. Census 2010 data from the National Science Foundation and the \nU.S. Census Bureau, showed that underrepresented minorities earned 18.6 \npercent of total undergraduate degrees from 4-year colleges, but only \n16.4 percent of the degrees in science fields and less than 13 percent \nof degrees in physical sciences and engineering.\n  Many historically underrepresented groups, including low income \nurban, rural and Native American communities have difficulty accessing \nSTEM education and job training opportunities.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #17 would have increased awareness among \nunderrepresented groups in STEM employment and education opportunities \nby providing information on certification, undergraduate and graduate \nSTEM programs.\n  One of the most enduring difficulties faced by underrepresented \npopulations is a lack of awareness and understanding of the connection \nbetween STEM and employment opportunities.\n  In 2012, a survey found that despite the nation's growing demand for \nmore workers in science, technology, engineering, and math grows, the \nskills gap among the largest ethnic and racial minorities groups remain \nstubbornly wide.\n  Blacks and Latinos account for only 7 percent, of the STEM workforce \ndespite representing 28 percent of the U.S. population.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #18 would have made sure that the issue of \nreducing the skills and education gap of underrepresented groups in \nSTEM degree programs is considered as current STEM education federal \nprograms were reviewed.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #19 could have furthered the skills development \nand training of teachers who provide instruction in K-12 STEM courses \nwhere 40 percent of the students are on free or reduced lunch programs \nor in areas where unemployment is 1 percent or more above the national \naverage.\n  Although most STEM specific education occurs in college and graduate \nschool, interest in STEM fields must be fostered from a young age \nthrough successful K-12 programs.\n  Many schools serving low-income students lack the resources to \nprovide continuity of STEM K-12 education, and as a result, students \nlose the opportunity to develop the skills that will prepare them for \nhigher STEM education.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #21 was an effort to identify no-cost or low-\ncost summer and after school science and technology educations programs \nand have that information broadly disseminated to the public.\n  Throughout primary and secondary education, skills retention is one \nof the most pressing concerns facing underrepresented students.\n  Without access to after-school and summer programs, even those \nstudents with a passion for STEM risk falling behind their peers.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #22 made grants available to local education \nagencies to support training in STEM education methods to teachers to \nimprove their instruction at schools serving neglected, delinquent, and \nmigrant students, English learners, at-risk students, and Native \nAmericans as determined by the director.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment #23 establishes within the Directorate for \nEducation and Human Resources an Office of STEM Education Gap Awareness \nwith the duties of reducing the STEM gap in K-12 and post-secondary \neducation among underrepresented populations.\n  The Jackson Lee amendments are intended to bridge the STEM gap in \nrural and urban areas where opportunities for training in STEM that can \nenhance the productivity of businesses large and small are lacking.\n  The Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program's report ``The Hidden STEM \nEconomy,'' reported that in 2011, 26 million jobs or 20 percent of all \noccupations required knowledge in 1 or more STEM areas.\n  Half of all STEM jobs are available to workers without a 4 year \ndegree and these jobs pay on average $53,000 a year, which is 10 \npercent higher than jobs with similar education requirements.\n  There will be STEM winners and losers not because the skills needed \nare too difficult to obtain, but because people are not aware of the \njobs that are going unfilled today nor do they know what education or \ntraining will create job security for the next 2 to 3 decades.\n  I am very aware of the importance of STEM job training and education.\n  A third of Houston jobs are in STEM-based fields.\n  Houston has the second largest concentrations of engineers (22.4 for \nevery 1,000 workers according to the Greater Houston Partnership).\n  Houston has 59,070 engineers, the second largest populations in the \nnation.\n  STEM jobs are at the core of Houston's economic success, but what we \nhave done with STEM innovation and job creation in the city of Houston \nis not enough to satisfy the regions demand for STEM trained workers.\n  Houston anticipates that in the next 5 years the gap in the number of \npeople with STEM skills and training will not keep up with the number \nof positions requiring those skills.\n  This is not just true for Houston, Texas--it is true for every region \nof the nation--whether you live in a rural community or urban center.\n  By 2018 the United States will need: 710,000 Computing workers; \n160,000 Engineers; 70,000 Physical Scientists; 40,000 Life Science \nworkers; 20,000 Mathematics workers.\n  STEM Computing Jobs are critical to America's future: Software \nengineers; Computer networking workers; Systems analysis; Computer \nresearcher or support workers.\n  Types of STEM Engineering Jobs: Structural Engineers; Mechanical \nEngineers; Software Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Automotive \nEngineers; Aeronautical Engineers; Naval Engineers; Architects.\n  Types of STEM Physical Sciences Jobs: Biologists; Zoologists; \nAgricultural; Food Scientists; Conservation Scientists; Medical \nScientists; Climatologists.\n  Types of STEM Life Scientists [PhDs]: Political Science; Economists; \nAnthropologists; Archaeology; Cultural Researchers; Language Experts \n(Linguistic and Language Skills).\n  Types of STEM Mathematics: Teachers; Physicists; Cryptographers; \nStatisticians; Accountants.\n  In order to ensure that underserved populations reach the level of \nSTEM education and opportunity they choose to pursue, I believe it is \nintegral to create an office that will focus on closing the STEM \neducation gap.\n  I ask that my colleagues from both sides of the aisle support this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Esty\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-120.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 41, line 7, strike ``and'' after ``society;''.\n       Page 41, line 12, strike the period at the end and insert \n     ``; and''.\n       Page 41, after line 12, insert the following new paragraph:\n       (4) I-Corps should continue to promote a strong innovation \n     system by investing in and supporting female entrepreneurs, \n     who are historically underrepresented in entrepreneurial \n     fields, through mentorship, education, and training.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentlewoman \nfrom Connecticut (Ms. Esty) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase support for women \nin entrepreneurship at the National Science Foundation's Innovation \nCorps, also known as the I-Corps. It has been an honor and privilege to \nmeet with women across Connecticut who are creating and building their \nown startups and small businesses.\n  In March I hosted a Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and \nMath roundtable, bringing together educators, innovators, and business \nowners to identify barriers that women face when looking to advance in \nthe critical STEM and entrepreneurial fields.\n  These local leaders all agreed that one of the biggest problems for \nwomen in the STEM fields is the lack of mentorship and support, and, \nquite simply, women do not have the same support and mentorship as \ntheir male counterparts because they are often the first women in \nleadership positions in their fields.\n  In fact, our Smaller Manufacturers Association in Connecticut just \nelected their first female president, Anne Strobel, and she has already \nhit the ground running to build on our State's strong manufacturing \ntradition.\n  National studies and experts echo the concerns women raised at the \nSTEM roundtable in my own district. The Kauffman Foundation recently \nsurveyed 350 female tech startup founders and found that the number one \nshared concern is a lack of role models and mentors for women thinking \nof going into business for themselves.\n  Recent news reports have noted the chronic underrepresentation of \nwomen\n\n[[Page H3450]]\n\nin the booming tech sector, including startups. In fact, women make up \nonly 30 percent of the tech workforce and 22 percent of the leadership \nroles, despite being 60 percent of the workforce. It is clear that we \nmust do more for women so they can build businesses and create good-\npaying jobs.\n  My amendment would provide that support to women through the NSF's \nInnovation Corps, known as the I-Corps, by expanding their mission to \nspecifically include support for and investment in female entrepreneurs \nthrough mentorship, education, and training.\n  The I-Corps program fosters entrepreneurship by giving students the \ntools they need to move discoveries and technology from the research \nlab to the market. I-Corps is making a difference in helping teach and \nsupport entrepreneurs across the country.\n  In my own State, the University of Connecticut recently received I-\nCorps funding, and it is designated as an I-Corps site. Accelerate \nUConn will build on the investment the State of Connecticut is already \nmaking to ensure that they remain a leader in our national innovation \necosystem.\n  Our competitiveness as a nation depends on robust research and \ntechnology and on ensuring that we draw on the best and the brightest, \nwhether they be men or women. By increasing the number of women \nentrepreneurs in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and \nmath, we as a nation will all benefit from the innovation that comes \nfrom a diverse workforce.\n  It is not only morally right, but economically smart to foster \nentrepreneurship of women. I encourage all my colleagues to support my \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment, though I don't oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would add a sense of \nCongress of Congress' support for the NSF's Innovation Corps program in \nthe underlying bill. This language would include the promotion of a \nstrong innovation system with investments and support for female \nentrepreneurs. I-Corps is an excellent program. I support the \ngentlewoman's amendment and appreciate her offering it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Connecticut has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding and for her \nleadership on this important issue. I especially enjoy being on the \nsame side of this issue with the chairman of the Committee on Science, \nSpace, and Technology.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to add my voice to Representative Esty's \nvoice in support of her amendment. I-Corps is a revolutionary \npartnership that helps maximize the economic impact of taxpayer-funded \nresearch by connecting the brilliant minds at NSF to the brilliant \nminds in the private sector.\n  This amendment offered by Representative Esty today ensures that we \nfoster all of the brilliant minds by supporting female entrepreneurs. \nGender diversity makes good business sense. Research conducted by Dow \nJones on venture-backed companies found that successful ones had twice \nthe number of women on the founding teams, and there is more research \nthat shows that women-owned firms outperformed those owned by male \ncounterparts. Despite this and despite the fact that women earn more \ncollege degrees than men, they comprise only 5 percent of Fortune 500 \nCEOs and only 19 percent of corporate board seats. Clearly, something \nis wrong.\n  For us to fully realize our economic potential, we have got to do a \nbetter job of supporting female entrepreneurs. That is why I strongly \nsupport her amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I do not think I am going to \ndisagree with what the gentlewoman from Connecticut has to say during \nher remaining time, so I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Connecticut has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Ms. ESTY. I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), the ranking member, with my \nthanks.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support \nof this amendment and want to thank the author for bringing it forward \nand thank the chairman of the committee for supporting it.\n  Our support historically goes back to Congresswoman Connie Morella. \nThe two of us did a study maybe 15 or 16 years ago, and we both have \nbeen very, very supportive of women in the sciences and hope that we \ncan get a better bill so that we can address getting them ready for \nthese jobs.\n  Ms. ESTY. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Crowley\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-120.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 45, after line 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 127. HISPANIC OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM IN EDUCATION AND \n                   SCIENCE.\n\n       Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Director of the National Science Foundation shall \n     establish the program described in section 7033 of the \n     America COMPETES Act (42 U.S.C. 1862o-12) for Hispanic-\n     serving institutions (as defined in section 502 of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1101a)).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Crowley) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, 8 years ago when the House first considered the America \nCOMPETES Act, I offered an amendment with my then-colleague Gabby \nGiffords as well as Congressman Jerry McNerney to correct a \nlongstanding inequity at the National Science Foundation. Unlike their \ncounterparts in higher education, Hispanic-Serving Institutions have \nnot benefited from a specific program at the NSF to provide them with \ngrants for research, curriculum, and infrastructure development.\n  The amendment corrected this inequity, requiring the NSF to create a \nseparate program for HSIs. It was adopted, and it became law. But to \nthis day, the NSF has not implemented the program as codified in law. \nThis bipartisan amendment would correct that and require the HSI \nprogram to finally be implemented within 4 months of the enactment of \nthis measure.\n  Hispanic-Serving Institutions serve the majority of nearly 2 million \nLatino students enrolled in college today. In my district alone, about \n10,000 students attend Hispanic-Serving Institutions offering degrees \nin these fields of science. Without access to targeted grants, HSIs \nhave difficulty increasing the ranks of Latinos in the STEM fields, \nwhere they have been historically underrepresented.\n  We must ensure that Latinos, the youngest and fastest growing ethnic \ngroup in our Nation, are prepared with the knowledge and skills that \nwill contribute to our Nation's future economic strength, security, and \nglobal leadership, because when education is available to everyone, our \nentire Nation is stronger.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who worked with me on this issue: Mr. \nSerrano, who has a stand-alone bill to make this fix permanent, and Mr. \nLujan, Mr. Hurd, as well as Mr. Curbelo, who have cosponsored this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment, though I don't oppose the amendment.\n\n[[Page H3451]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require NSF to \nestablish a program originally authorized in the 2007 COMPETES Act. I \nsupport the gentleman's amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments from the \nchairman.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano), my \nfriend and a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SERRANO. I thank my colleague for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. Chairman, as my colleague has said, in 2007 he added a provision \nto the original America COMPETES Act to give the NSF the discretion to \nestablish a dedicated grant program. However, after years of \npersistence, the NSF has refused to act. That is why last month Mr. \nCrowley, Mr. Lujan, and myself introduced the HOPES Act.\n  Today's amendment replicates the HOPES Act and requires the NSF to \nestablish an undergraduate grant program for Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions. Hispanics are underrepresented in the STEM fields, and \nmore needs to be done to ensure that we are not missing the best and \nthe brightest from all the parts of America in developing the next \ngeneration of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians.\n  This amendment is a big step in the right direction. I thank \nRepresentative Crowley for his leadership on this issue. I thank the \nchairman for accepting the amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Hurd).\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, \nwhich will benefit the students at several fine institutions in the \n23rd Congressional District of Texas.\n  One thing that everybody here wants is a healthy economy. We want the \nAmerican economy to continue to be the strongest in the world, and if \nAmerican businesses are going to compete and win in a global economy, \nwe have to have the best trained and best equipped workforce possible.\n  This means our institutions of higher learning need to be fully \ncapable of offering their students the opportunities to learn the \nskills that are going to drive a 21st century economy, and that means \nSTEM degrees must be a priority for our colleges and universities. This \namendment will allow institutions that are designated as Hispanic-\nServing Institutions to have access to grant programs with the National \nScience Foundation that they have been limited from participating in in \nthe past.\n  There are 47 institutions like this in the State of Texas, and more \nthan a dozen of them serve students in my district. This increased \naccess to grants will help increase the recruitment, retention, and \ngraduation rates of Hispanic students pursuing degrees in STEM fields. \nThat is good for these students; that is good for our universities, our \ncommunities, our businesses, and our economy.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from New York, Mr. Crowley, for \nintroducing this amendment. I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. I thank Mr. Hurd for his comments.\n  I want the Record to reflect that I was willing and expecting to be \nyielding the gentleman 1 minute. Since the cooperation is running so \nsmoothly, Mr. Chairman, thank you for yielding the 2 minutes to Mr. \nHurd.\n  With that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Ben \nRay Lujan).\n  Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in \nsupport of this amendment that I am proud to offer with my colleagues.\n  I want to thank Congressman Crowley for his leadership. I want to \nrecognize Chairman Smith for his responsibility in working and looking \nout for these students as well.\n  In today's world, science, technology, engineering, and math degrees \ntranslate into high-paying, in-demand jobs. While we are still \nstruggling with high unemployment in my home State of New Mexico, there \nare sectors, especially in STEM, that are having difficulty finding \nqualified workers. To help meet this demand, the National Science \nFoundation manages a number of programs at minority-serving \ninstitutions, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities \nand Tribal Colleges and Universities.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  These programs have filled an important void by preparing minority \nstudents for meaningful careers in STEM. However, there is no such \nprogram and, therefore, a lack of critical support for Hispanic \nAmericans. This is also evident in the fact that Hispanics are severely \nunderrepresented in the STEM workforce.\n  It is time that we fund the creation of a program for Hispanic-\nServing Institutions to develop infrastructure, curriculum, and recruit \nHispanic students into STEM fields. To do what is best for America, we \nneed to invest and promote these programs.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) has 1\\1/\n2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the \ngentleman and all of the persons who sponsored this amendment. I want \nto commend them.\n  When Mr. Lujan was on the Science Committee, we actually developed \nthat language that did pass in the last COMPETES Act, so I fully \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, let me just use the remaining time to \nthank Chairman Smith for his cooperation and that of his staff, as well \nas the cooperation of Ms. Johnson and her staff.\n  I do think that this amendment is the final tooth we need to make \nthis law work and to drive the money and the resources to the people we \nintended for them to go to, and that is Latino or Hispanic young men \nand women who want to strive to succeed in the fields of science and \nmedicine to help make our country an even better country.\n  I thank you both again for your cooperation, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Griffith\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-120.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 49, line 2, insert ``The Advisory Panel shall consist \n     of 15 members, with 3 members appointed by the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives and 2 members appointed by the \n     Majority Leader of the Senate.'' after ``other appropriate \n     organizations.''.\n       Page 171, line 2, insert ``, except that 3 members shall be \n     appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and \n     2 members shall be appointed by the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate. The total number of members of the advisory committee \n     shall be 15.'' after ``by the Secretary''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Griffith) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would make a couple of \nslight changes to two new advisory boards created in this bill: the \nSTEM education advisory panel and a new Department of Energy advisory \ncommittee.\n  My amendment sets the total number of members for these two new \nadvisory boards at 15 each, and most importantly, it ensures that five \nof the members on each board are chosen by Congress, three by the \nSpeaker of the House and two by the Senate majority leader.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the advisory boards \nhave congressional representation, that we have people on there who \nwork with Congress. The legislative branch is a\n\n[[Page H3452]]\n\ncoequal branch of government, and I believe that, as an institution, \nCongress should more aggressively assert itself as a coequal branch.\n  This amendment has nothing to do with which party controls the \nlegislative branch of government or which party, for that matter, \ncontrols the executive branch at any given time, nor does it ask for a \nmajority of the members of these new boards to be congressionally \nappointed.\n  The amendment would simply ensure that the legislative branch is \ninvolved in these boards that it, the legislative branch, is creating \nand that we are involved in the process of creating the reports which \nboth the legislative branch and executive branch will rely on to make \nimportant decisions for these United States.\n  If Congress deems an issue important enough to warrant an advisory \nboard that is included in a bill we are passing, it just makes sense \nthat we also appoint a portion of that board's membership.\n  I hope we will do that as we go forward with many of our boards. I \nalso think it will facilitate more conversation between the executive \nbranch and the legislative branch as time goes forward.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  This amendment allows the Speaker of the House of Representatives and \nthe majority leader of the Senate to appoint members to two scientific \nadvisory boards created in the bill. This amendment is the very \ndefinition of politicalizing science when we have politicians choosing \nwho sits on scientific advisory boards.\n  While my colleagues across the aisle suggest that this amendment \nensures accountability, in reality, it only ensures the political \nmeddling in science. Unfortunately, this is consistent with many \nprovisions in the underlying bill.\n  Scientific advisory boards provide expert scientific advice and make \nrecommendations on subject matter from STEM education to energy \nresearch and development. It is essential that advisory board members \nbe qualified and nonpolitical to provide nonpartisan advice and give \nappropriate recommendations that are free of bias, advice and \nrecommendations based on the best available evidence, and advice and \nrecommendations that will further science in the country, not inhibit \nit.\n  In this amendment, the Speaker of the House would appoint three \nmembers, while the majority leader of the Senate would appoint two \nadditional members to this advisory board.\n  Some of these advisory boards have only 15 members. This amendment \nwould allow Republican--and only Republican--leaders of Congress to \nappoint one-third of these members.\n  This amendment is clearly meant to politicize these advisory boards. \nWhile the sponsor of this amendment is messaging it as giving Congress \na bigger voice, that is just not accurate, asked for, or necessary. \nCongress already has the biggest and final voice. We control the \nFederal budget. Congress writes authorization bills such as the one \nbefore us today. We do not lack influence.\n  Let's keep our scientific advisory boards free from political \ninterference. If we choose to ignore the advice from our scientific \nadvisory boards, as we are doing with H.R. 1806, that is our right. \nCongress doesn't also have to put its fingerprints directly on the \nadvice itself. We know by what has been said today that we are trying \nto take over the responsibility on this bill that I am against, so that \nis one way you can do it.\n  This amendment follows the underlying attack on science in this bill, \nbut this amendment goes further. It gives Republican politicians a \nchance to directly influence the scientific process in our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and the underlying \nbill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I feel so bad that the gentlewoman thinks \nthis is politicizing this bill. That is the furthest thing from my \nintent.\n  I know the gentlewoman does not know me and she does not know that, \nfor 17 years, I served in the Virginia House of Delegates. In Virginia, \nany time we created a board or policy advisory group like this, we \ngenerally had legislative members on there.\n  What we found when we did that was that, when an idea came from the \nadministrative branch, whether it was of the party that I was in or of \na different party, we generally found that, by having people that were \nfamiliar with both sides of the issue, but people who also relied on \nand came to talk to us on a regular basis in the legislature, we felt \nmore comfortable with those recommendations that had been made. We \nunderstood better what the background was. It made for better \ngovernment.\n  That is what this is intended to do. I didn't ask for a majority. I \ndidn't say that Congress should have complete control. It just says \nthere ought to be some members appointed by the Senate and appointed by \nthe House. It doesn't matter which party is in control of the House or \nSenate. Recently, that was divided. It doesn't matter which party is in \nthe executive branch.\n  It just says this is a way to make sure that when you think it is \nimportant enough--when Congress thinks it is important enough to create \nan advisory board--that we both have some members, both the House and \nSenate, on that advisory board to make sure that there is interaction \nwith us, as well as with the executive branch.\n  Unless the belief is that the executive branch wants to politicize it \nbecause they get all the appointments, I don't know why they would \nthink these appointments would be politicizing it. It is just for \ninformational purposes and to make sure that everybody is heard at the \ntable and that those ideas are shared.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. I yield to the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I served in both the house and \nsenate in Texas before coming here; I believe strongly in input, but \nthis very bill and its structure has become so political and so \npolitically tainted in attempting to manipulate what is going on in our \nagencies, I just don't trust your amendment.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Reclaiming my time, I would say that I don't know the \ngentlewoman's concerns on this particular bill. I do believe, as a \nCongress, we ought to be working to make sure that we have input on all \nof these advisory committees, whether it is on this bill or any other \nbill.\n  Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSmith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief. I support the gentleman's \namendment that will ensure that Congress has input on the composition \nof the new boards and panels created in the bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment as well.\n  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded \nvote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Kelly of Pennsylvania\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-120.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 71, line 21, strike ``$933,700,000'' and insert \n     ``$938,700,000''.\n       Page 72, line 6, strike ``$130,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$135,000,000''.\n       Page 72, line 8, strike ``$125,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$130,000,000''.\n\n[[Page H3453]]\n\n       Page 72, line 19, strike ``$933,700,000'' and insert \n     ``$938,700,000''.\n       Page 73, line 3, strike ``$130,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$135,000,000''.\n       Page 73, line 5, strike ``$125,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$130,000,000''.\n       Page 178, line 4, strike ``$1,198,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,193,500,000''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, my amendment increases the \nauthorized funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership by $5 \nmillion and it offsets it by decreasing the authorized funding for the \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by $5 million, for \nlevel funding.\n  If our goal is to create and retain more American jobs, there is no \nbetter program to fund that than the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership. Administered by the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, with centers in every single State, for every $1 of Federal \ninvestment, this public-private partnership generates nearly $21 in new \nsales. As a result, this translates into $2.5 billion annually. For \nevery $2,001 of Federal investment, MEP creates or retains one American \nmanufacturing job.\n  The MEP programs provides our Nation's nearly 350,000 small \nmanufacturers with services and access to resources that enhance \ngrowth, improve productivity, and expand capacity. This program is a \nwin-win for our hard-working American taxpayers. Few, if any, other \nFederal programs can claim such a good return on our taxpayers' \ninvestment.\n  Considering this amendment authorizes the program at $130 million \nthat helps small American manufacturers directly and at a 50 percent \ncost share, this gives taxpayers more bang for their buck.\n  The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy has a total \nbudget of over $1 billion, so moving $5 million to this valuable \nprogram for small businesses is simply good economic policy.\n  This program is not a government handout. Instead, it requires small \nmanufacturers who partner with their local MEP to have skin in the game \nwith a 50 percent cost share. That is good for our taxpayers; it is \ngood for manufacturing sectors, and it is good for American jobs.\n  Since 1988, MEP has worked with nearly 80,000 American manufacturers, \nleading to $88 billion in sales and 14 billion in cost savings. It has \nhelped create more than 729,000 American jobs.\n  Last year alone, MEP projects created or retained nearly 64,000 \nAmerican jobs, generated more than $6.7 billion in new and retained \nsales, and provided cost savings of more than $1.1 billion to small \nAmerican manufacturers.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  With the average small- and mid-size American manufacturing employee \nearning more than $77,000 a year in pay and benefits, these are exactly \nthe types of jobs that policymakers need to be encouraging. And at a \ntime when our economy is starting to recover, the MEP's work is crucial \nin helping America's small manufacturers be stronger long-term \ncompetitors, both domestically and internationally.\n  In turn, this will allow them to create good-paying, high-skilled \njobs for America's workers across the country. A growing manufacturing \nsector in America means more well-paying jobs for low- to moderate-\nincome American families, reduced trade deficit and a robust economy, \nand a flourishing innovation sector which can drive future growth.\n  By supporting this amendment, Congress will be sending a clear signal \nto our small American manufacturers and our job creators that they will \ncontinue to play a vital role in the reinvigoration of our economy.\n  MEP is currently appropriated at $130 million, and this amendment \nwould simply ensure that this popular, bipartisan program continues to \nbe authorized at its current funding level.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I strongly support the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, \nor the MEP, at NIST. Since its establishment in 1988, the MEP program \nhas generated billions of dollars in new sales; it has saved MEP \nclients billions of dollars; and it has helped create more than 700,000 \njobs.\n  However, I cannot support this amendment because it increases the \nauthorization for MEP by decreasing the authorization for the Office of \nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the Department of Energy. \nEERE conducts important research on energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy technologies, including critical advance manufacturing \ninitiatives.\n  Unfortunately, EERE has become a favorite target for my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle. The underlying bill cuts this office by \nalmost 30 percent, and this amendment would make that cut even larger.\n  I supported an amendment that would have increased MEP authorization \nto $141 million for fiscal year 2016, at the President's request, \nwithout cutting EERE. But the amendment was not made in order.\n  I strongly believe in MEP and want to see this funding level \nincreased. I think it is important to note that this bill is an \nauthorization bill, not an appropriations bill. In authorization bills, \nCongress should be deciding authorization levels by determining what \nthe program needs to accomplish its responsibilities.\n  Notwithstanding current Republican protocols, authorization bills \nshould not have the same constraints as appropriation bills, including \nneeding to offset any increases. This is a bizarre approach to \nlegislating.\n  Because of the unnecessary cut to EERE, I cannot support this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nreject the false notion of needing to offset authorizations.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from \nPennsylvania for yielding me this time.\n  I just simply want to say that I believe his amendment restores \ncurrent funding levels for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nprogram at the National Institute of Standards and Technology while \noffsetting those costs. It is a great amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I continue to \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I would just remark that if \nwe are really trying to create jobs, if we are really trying to boost \nour economy, if we are really trying to do all these things, if we are \nreally trying to help small manufacturers, I don't think that asking to \ntransfer $15 million out of a $1 billion allotment is going to really \nhave that much effect on that.\n  This is not turning our back on some of the issues that you have, but \nthis is looking forward to the future and saying we have got to help \nthese people move forward.\n  This is not a government handout. This is not a free amount of money. \nThis is a 50 percent match. There are very few programs in our \ngovernment that require that.\n  This is something that just makes sense for America. It makes sense \nfor all those folks that I represent and you represent back home.\n  I have got to tell you something. Back in Western Pennsylvania, where \nI live, in Pennsylvania's Third District, every morning, moms and dads \nget up and they throw their feet out over their bed and they go to work \nso that they can put a roof over the head for their children, food on \ntheir table, clothes on their back, and a promise for the future.\n  This is a small investment. All we are doing is keeping it at $130 \nmillion. And in a government that spends trillions of dollars every \nyear, I don't know why we would quibble over $5 million because it is \ngoing to help job creation and job retention. It allows us to compete \nin a global market in a way that we actually win.\n\n[[Page H3454]]\n\n  We don't have to get political about this. What I want to do is, I \nwant to think about all the people we represent and where those dollars \ngo because every single dollar belongs to the American taxpayer.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is reminded to address all of his \nremarks to the Chair and not to other Members of the House.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate those \nremarks. He is describing my constituents as well. And if we had done \nas requested by the President, we would have left the authorization \nlevels at the level he is trying to bring it to, and it would not have \ntaken away from the other part of the research that is needed so badly \nin the other areas.\n  I do not oppose what he is trying to do. What I oppose is how he is \ntrying to do it. And for that, I still oppose the total amount because \nit is not treating the other program fairly.\n  It is not that I oppose MEP. My constituents are no different than \nyours. They get up every day to work hard and need opportunities. I am \nsure many of yours get more opportunities than some of mine. And so I \nagree with that totally.\n  I agreed with the President's level of recommendation of where he \nwants to take it. What I disagree with is he is taking it out of \nanother area when it is not necessary.\n  We are not appropriations. We are to recommend authorizations. We can \ndo the authorization for his level without taking away from an area \nthey don't like.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Members are advised to address their remarks to the \nChair and not to each other.\n  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-120.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 114, line 23, through page 115, line 18, strike \n     subsections (b) through (d).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Lowenthal) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My amendment would do two important things. First, it would preserve \nthe Energy Department's ability to select projects based on merit, and, \nsecond, it would preserve a very basic scientific tenet, the ability of \nthe Department of Energy to replicate scientific results.\n  Right now, the underlying bill mandates the prioritization of certain \nscientific fields over others, and it terminates science initiatives \nthat can validate or question the results of previous scientific \nresearch.\n  It is additionally unfortunate that in this formerly bipartisan bill, \nthe majority is again attempting to specifically target and terminate \nthe valuable research programs of some of our Nation's brightest \nscientists if they study climate change. I think this is shortsighted, \nI think it is irresponsible, and I believe it is wrong.\n  In order to ensure America's energy security, we must understand the \nmultiplying risks to our energy infrastructure due to a changing \nclimate. In order to ensure America's energy security, we must \nunderstand the lifecycle impacts of the fuels we use. And in order to \nensure America's energy security, we must lead the world in developing \nclean renewable sources of energy.\n  For this vision to become a reality, the Department of Energy must \nsupport sound scientific processes that include selecting the most \nmeritorious methods and questions that they wish to research and \nverifying those results through replication.\n  H.R. 1806, as it is currently written, specifically targets the \nclimate change research program in the Energy Department and instructs \nthe director to cease ``those climate science-related initiatives that \nare identified as overlapping or duplicative.''\n  A basic tenet of science is that you have to reproduce scientific \nresults. You don't run an experiment once and go to the world and say, \n``It's true. We've figured it out.''\n  No--science requires separate and independently verified results in \norder to draw conclusions. But now Congress is trying to legislate \nchanges to the scientific method, and I think that is a shame.\n  Science works best when multiple groups and agencies collaborate to \nfind answers to important questions. And guess what? Congress has \nalready created a way to coordinate among the 13 Federal agencies to \nensure that each agency is researching the causes and effects of global \nchanges most relevant to their missions. And it is called the U.S. \nGlobal Change Research Program. The proposed requirements in section \n505 of H.R. 1806 are really just an attempt to create more roadblocks \nto studying climate change.\n  My amendment preserves the scientific integrity of the Office of \nScience, the U.S. Global Change Research Program and, more importantly, \nthe scientific process.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Lowenthal amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), who is a member \nof the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment and in support of the underlying reforms included \nin H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015.\n  This amendment would remove important measures that ensure greater \ntransparency for the Federal Government's climate science initiative \nand require accountability for the Office of Science to justify the \nvalue of related work going forward.\n  The gentleman's amendment would also remove underlying language in \nthe America COMPETES Act that would require the Government \nAccountability Office to identify duplicative climate science \ninitiatives across the entire Federal Government.\n  All Members of Congress should support transparency in federally \nfunded research. It is our core responsibility to provide oversight for \nFederal programs and make sure American taxpayer dollars are being \nspent responsibly, not duplicating work that has already been done.\n  That said, the language in the America COMPETES Act does not ban any \nparticular area of science but, instead, requires that DOE justify the \nscience's merit and provide greater transparency if climate science \nwork is intentionally duplicated.\n  This provision in the America COMPETES Act is simply good governance \nand is more important now than ever. The Obama administration has \nunapologetically pushed forward a politicized climate agenda through \nthe Federal Government, prioritizing climate change research above all \nelse. Better transparency can help prevent wasteful spending and \nprioritize the most valuable research.\n  H.R. 1806 authorizes the Office of Science within the Department of \nEnergy to support basic research in the physical sciences, including \nresearch on Earth's atmosphere. By including these good government \nmeasures, the America COMPETES Act gives Congress appropriate \noversight, funds valuable research, but does not provide a blank check \nfor the President's climate agenda.\n  This amendment would strike these important accountability measures \nfrom the America COMPETES Act research. For that reason, I oppose the \namendment and encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, could you tell me how much time I have \nleft.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n\n[[Page H3455]]\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nEddie Bernice Johnson).\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is not surprising that the Biological and \nEnvironmental Research program at DOE is targeted with harmful \nprovisions in this bill. It is targeted because the program is a leader \nin advancing our understanding of the causes and impacts of climate \nchange.\n  Hiding our heads in the sand will not solve anything, and it \ncertainly won't stop the Earth from warming. Allowing partisan politics \nto skew the scientific understanding of climate change is cynical and \nshortsighted.\n  It is especially cynical considering that in the majority's own bill, \nthey state that climate change is happening. They just had to take the \nstatement out that it is caused by human beings.\n  The gentleman from California's amendment would simply strike those \nharmful provisions so that scientists supported by BER can continue \ntheir important work without political interference.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close, so I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I repeat: duplication is good science. Let \nme repeat that: duplication is good science.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Lowenthal amendment to maintain the \nDepartment of Energy's ability to select scientific projects based upon \nscientific merit, that support the mission of the Department of Energy \nand the broader energy security of our country.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike good \ngovernment accountability measures within the COMPETES bill that \nrequire DOE's Office of Science to prioritize biological systems and \ngenomic science. It would also strike reforms included in the America \nCOMPETES Act that prevent duplication of research, which saves taxpayer \ndollars.\n  I encourage Members to oppose the amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-120.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 133, before line 19, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 604. ENERGY INNOVATION HUBS.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Program.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Energy shall carry out a \n     program to enhance the Nation's economic, environmental, and \n     energy security by making awards to consortia for \n     establishing and operating Energy Innovation Hubs to conduct \n     and support, whenever practicable at one centralized \n     location, multidisciplinary, collaborative research, \n     development, and demonstration of advanced energy \n     technologies.\n       (2) Technology development focus.--The Secretary shall \n     designate for each Hub a unique advanced energy technology \n     focus.\n       (3) Coordination.--The Secretary shall ensure the \n     coordination of, and avoid unnecessary duplication of, the \n     activities of Hubs with those of other Department of Energy \n     research entities, including the National Laboratories, the \n     Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, Energy Frontier \n     Research Centers, and within industry.\n       (b) Consortia.--\n       (1) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive an award under \n     this section for the establishment and operation of a Hub, a \n     consortium shall--\n       (A) be composed of no fewer than 2 qualifying entities; and\n       (B) operate subject to an agreement entered into by its \n     members that documents--\n       (i) the proposed partnership agreement, including the \n     governance and management structure of the Hub;\n       (ii) measures to enable cost-effective implementation of \n     the program under this section;\n       (iii) a proposed budget, including financial contributions \n     from non-Federal sources;\n       (iv) a plan for managing intellectual property rights; and\n       (v) an accounting structure that enables the Secretary to \n     ensure that the consortium has complied with the requirements \n     of this section.\n       (2) Application.--A consortium seeking to establish and \n     operate a Hub under this section, acting through a prime \n     applicant, shall transmit to the Secretary an application at \n     such time, in such form, and accompanied by such information \n     as the Secretary shall require, including a detailed \n     description of the elements of the consortium agreement \n     required under paragraph (1)(B). If the consortium members \n     will not be located at one centralized location, such \n     application shall include a communications plan that ensures \n     close coordination and integration of the Hub's activities.\n       (c) Selection and Schedule.--The Secretary shall select \n     consortia for awards for the establishment and operation of \n     Hubs through competitive selection processes. In selecting \n     consortia, the Secretary shall consider the information a \n     consortium must disclose according to subsection (b), as well \n     as any existing facilities a consortium will provide for Hub \n     activities. Awards made to a Hub shall be for a period not to \n     exceed 5 years, subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, after which the award may be renewed, subject \n     to a rigorous merit review. A Hub already in existence on the \n     date of enactment of this Act may continue to receive support \n     for a period of 5 years, subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, beginning on the date of establishment of \n     that Hub.\n       (d) Hub Operations.--\n       (1) In general.--Each Hub shall conduct or provide for \n     multidisciplinary, collaborative research, development, and \n     demonstration of advanced energy technologies within the \n     technology development focus designated under subsection \n     (a)(2). Each Hub shall--\n       (A) encourage collaboration and communication among the \n     member qualifying entities of the consortium and awardees by \n     conducting activities whenever practicable at one centralized \n     location;\n       (B) develop and publish on the Department of Energy's \n     website proposed plans and programs;\n       (C) submit an annual report to the Secretary summarizing \n     the Hub's activities, including detailing organizational \n     expenditures, and describing each project undertaken by the \n     Hub; and\n       (D) monitor project implementation and coordination.\n       (2) Conflicts of interest.--\n       (A) Procedures.--Hubs shall maintain conflict of interest \n     procedures, consistent with those of the Department of \n     Energy, to ensure that employees and consortia designees for \n     Hub activities who are in decisionmaking capacities disclose \n     all material conflicts of interest, and avoid such conflicts.\n       (B) Disqualification and revocation.--The Secretary may \n     disqualify an application or revoke funds distributed to a \n     Hub if the Secretary discovers a failure to comply with \n     conflict of interest procedures established under \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Prohibition on construction.--\n       (A) In general.--No funds provided pursuant to this section \n     may be used for construction of new buildings or facilities \n     for Hubs. Construction of new buildings or facilities shall \n     not be considered as part of the non-Federal share of a Hub \n     cost-sharing agreement.\n       (B) Test bed and renovation exception.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall prohibit the use of funds provided pursuant \n     to this section, or non-Federal cost share funds, for \n     research or for the construction of a test bed or renovations \n     to existing buildings or facilities for the purposes of \n     research if the Secretary determines that the test bed or \n     renovations are limited to a scope and scale necessary for \n     the research to be conducted.\n       (e) Termination.--Consistent with the existing authorities \n     of the Department, the Secretary may terminate an \n     underperforming Hub for cause during the performance period.\n       (f) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) Advanced energy technology.--The term ``advanced energy \n     technology'' means--\n       (A) an innovative technology--\n       (i) that produces energy from solar, wind, geothermal, \n     biomass, tidal, wave, ocean, or other renewable energy \n     resources;\n       (ii) that produces nuclear energy;\n       (iii) for carbon capture and sequestration;\n       (iv) that enables advanced vehicles, vehicle components, \n     and related technologies that result in significant energy \n     savings;\n       (v) that generates, transmits, distributes, utilizes, or \n     stores energy more efficiently than conventional \n     technologies, including through Smart Grid technologies; or\n       (vi) that enhances the energy independence and security of \n     the United States by enabling improved or expanded supply and \n     production of domestic energy resources, including coal, oil, \n     and natural gas;\n       (B) research, development, and demonstration activities \n     necessary to ensure the long-term, secure, and sustainable \n     supply of energy critical elements; or\n       (C) another innovative energy technology area identified by \n     the Secretary.\n\n[[Page H3456]]\n\n       (2) Hub.--The term ``Hub'' means an Energy Innovation Hub \n     established or operating in accordance with this section, \n     including any Energy Innovation Hub existing as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Qualifying entity.--The term ``qualifying entity'' \n     means--\n       (A) an institution of higher education;\n       (B) an appropriate State or Federal entity, including the \n     Department of Energy Federally Funded Research and \n     Development Centers;\n       (C) a nongovernmental organization with expertise in \n     advanced energy technology research, development, \n     demonstration, or commercial application; or\n       (D) any other relevant entity the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Grayson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to authorize the Energy \nInnovation Hubs program within the Department of Energy.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Smith and his staff for working with \nme to craft this amendment. Because I know that the chairman supports \nthe amendment, I will keep my remarks brief.\n  Energy Innovation Hubs are collaborative research centers that bring \ntogether teams of scientists and engineers from academia, industry, and \nnational laboratories in order to accelerate scientific discoveries \nthat address critical energy issues. They were created in 2010 and have \nreceived almost $500 million in funding already.\n  The four hubs currently focus on everything from improving nuclear \nreactors through computer-based modeling to improving battery \ntechnology for transportation and the grid.\n  The amendment before us would not only authorize this important \nresearch but would also provide critical guidelines and accountability \nmeasures for the program.\n  A rigorous merits-based renewal process would be implemented. The \nSecretary would be empowered to terminate underperforming hubs at any \ntime, and funds would be prohibited from being used for the purpose of \nconstructing buildings so that every taxpayer dollar goes toward the \nresearch for which it is intended.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from Texas, Chairman Smith, for his help \nand guidance in developing this amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment, though I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would authorize the \nDepartment of Energy Innovation Hubs. These integrated research \nplatforms conduct fundamental research to address critical challenges \nin energy technology.\n  Currently, DOE operates four hubs, which all focus on the critical \nenergy issues. They include the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of \nLight Water Reactors, which uses high performance computation modeling \nto simulate and improve reactors. And it includes the Joint Center for \nEnergy Storage Research, which focuses on developing the next \ngeneration of battery technologies.\n  My thanks go to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson), a very \nactive and alert member of the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee, for offering this amendment and for working with us to \ndevelop this bipartisan amendment. I encourage Members to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 10 Offered by Ms. Bonamici\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-120.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 162, lines 3 through 5, strike subsection (d).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentlewoman \nfrom Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to address an issue of national security.\n  The Department of Defense is the world's largest institutional \nconsumer of fuel. As a result, the volatility of oil prices directly \naffects military readiness. Every $10 increase on a barrel of oil costs \nthe Department of Defense an additional $1.3 billion a year.\n  To reduce our military's and our Nation's dependence on a single \nsource of fuel, the Departments of Defense, Energy, and Agriculture \nhave been working closely over the past 4 years with the private sector \nto scale up an advanced ``drop-in'' biofuel production capability.\n  One of those projects is in Lakeview, Oregon, where a forest biomass \nplant will produce fuel for the U.S. Navy and Marines. It is one of \nthree companies selected by the Departments of Defense, Energy, and \nAgriculture to produce cost-competitive drop-in military biofuels. Once \nat scale, these biorefineries will have a combined capacity to produce \n100 million gallons of fuel for military ships and planes while \nreducing their greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent compared to \nconventional fuels.\n  Our military and Nation are faced with a growing global demand for \nenergy. We need to have a greater emphasis on renewable energy and \nenergy-efficient technologies. Yet, without any apparent logic, this \nbill would prohibit the Department of Energy--the lead agency with \ndeep, technical expertise in this area--from partnering with the \nDepartment of Defense to develop biofuels.\n  The amendment that I am offering strikes this prohibition and would \nallow the Departments of Energy and Defense to continue their efforts \nto learn from each other's expertise.\n  Mr. Chairman, I will introduce into the Record a letter opposing the \nprohibition from the Truman National Security Project, where they \nnote--these are retired military--that 4 years of partnership between \nthe Departments of Defense, Energy, and Agriculture have seen \nimpressive progress in the development of advanced drop-in biofuels \nthat will allow the military to turn away from an outdated fuel source. \nMembers of the military from every rank and service have spoken out in \nfavor of the continued investment in biofuels for the reasons of cost \nand capability.\n\n                                               Operation Free,\n\n                                                   April 21, 2015.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,\n     House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: The \n     American military is the greatest fighting force the world \n     has ever seen. The United States Congress has the critical \n     responsibility of empowering our military leaders by \n     equipping that force with the tools they need to engage \n     effectively in a world of ever-increasing security threats. \n     Accordingly, we urge you to withdraw the America COMPETES \n     Reauthorization Act of 2015, which would bar the Department \n     of Energy from continuing a four-year collaboration with the \n     Departments of Defense and Agriculture to develop cost-\n     effective advanced biofuels.\n       Time and again throughout our history, the military has \n     chosen to innovate towards new solutions. While the advances \n     resulting from these efforts have often benefited our nation \n     as a whole, they are undertaken not for the sake of novelty \n     or adventure but to fill a key operational or tactical need. \n     Advanced biofuels fills such a need: Reducing the dangerous \n     dependence of the U.S. military on fossil fuels.\n       The Department of Defense is the world's largest \n     institutional consumer of fuel. With approximately $15 \n     billion per year budgeted simply to maintain freedom of \n     movement, the U.S. military is dangerously sensitive to the \n     volatility of oil prices; a $10 change in the price per \n     barrel of crude oil leaves the Department of Defense with a \n     $1.3 billion shortfall and sees increased profits to \n     countries who oppose our interests around the world. And \n     because oil is priced in a global market, no amount of \n     domestic production can insulate the military from these \n     effects.\n       We have learned firsthand that oil truly is the Achilles' \n     heel of our military. With most\n\n[[Page H3457]]\n\n     of the world's oil traveling through two or three major \n     chokepoints, the military must allocate significant manpower \n     and resources to keeping those sea lanes open and secure. \n     Moreover, as the military transitions from large-scale land \n     engagements in the Middle East and towards a broader \n     engagement in the Asia-Pacific, the costs and logistical \n     challenges associated with moving fuel over thousands of \n     miles of ocean will only increase.\n       The threat of oil dependence along with the need for energy \n     security isn't going away any time soon. And we shouldn't \n     impede progress of alternatives that are moving forward now. \n     Four years of partnership between the Departments of Defense, \n     Energy, and Agriculture have seen impressive progress in the \n     development of advanced, ``drop in'' biofuels that will allow \n     the military to turn away from an outdated fuel source. Top \n     line military platforms as diverse as the super-sonic F/A-18 \n     ``Green Hornet,'' the Air Force's F16 fighter jets, the MH-\n     60S Seahawk helicopter, the AV-8B Harrier, the Fire Scout \n     unmanned vehicle, the Riverine Command Boat (RCB-X) and the \n     frigate USS Ford have all operated at full capacity and with \n     no averse side effects using American-made biofuels.\n       Members of the military from every rank and service have \n     spoken out in favor of the continued investment in biofuels \n     for reasons of cost and capabilities alike. These voices, \n     rather than political leanings or parochial interests, must \n     steer national security policy. Accordingly, we urge you to \n     withdraw the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 and \n     to ensure that the U.S. military is free to pursue the fuel \n     sources its leaders deign necessary for maximum operational \n     and tactical success.\n           Respectfully,\n     Michael Breen,\n       Executive Director, Truman National Security Project Army \n     Captain (Fmr.).\n     RADM Leendert ``Len'' Hering,\n       USN (Ret.).\n     Lt Gen Norman Seip,\n       USAF (Ret.).\n\n  Ms. BONAMICI. I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Weber), who is the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding to \nme.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to the gentlewoman's amendment \nand in support of the underlying reforms included in H.R. 1806, the \nAmerica COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015.\n  This amendment would remove a limitation included in the underlying \nbill that prevents the Department of Energy from using funding \nauthorized for the EERE Biofuels program to conduct commercial \nproduction of biofuels for defense purposes.\n  The fact is that EERE already spends too much of their current budget \non deployment and commercialization of renewable and energy efficient \ntechnologies instead of research and development.\n  The DOE's ongoing effort to fund commercial-scale biofuels production \nfor military purposes in cooperation with the Department of Defense and \nUSDA is just one example.\n  Redirecting funds from biofuels R is part of a broader problem. \nDepartment of Energy research and development programs should be \nfocused on science, not creating a market for certain types of fuels. \nThe DOE should focus on a new idea for the market, not a market for the \nnew idea.\n  The Department of Defense spends billions annually on fuel costs, \nbillions. When viable biofuels technology is able to compete with \nconventional fuels--trust me--the private sector can and will develop \ncommercial-scale biofuels production to meet demand. It is just that \nsimple, Mr. Chairman.\n  And despite significant Federal programs to support the use of \nbiofuels, a recent GAO, Government Accountability Office, study \nconcluded that the long-term viability of alternative fuels is \ndependent on market factors, not Federal funds or mandates. That same \nstudy reported that the Department of Defense paid $150 per gallon for \n1,500 gallons of alternative jet fuel derived from algal oil. Taxpayers \nshould be outraged.\n  The other side may be, in fact, promoting their global warming theory \nbecause when taxpayers find out about this kind of waste, there are \ngoing to be a lot of them hot under the collar.\n  The Department of Energy should focus on research and development, \nnot commercial biofuels production. This limitation is consistent with \nthe broader goals of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act, which \nprioritizes research and development in all R program areas while \ncutting spending on deployment and commercialization.\n  I am aghast, Mr. Chairman, that the other side somehow thinks \nCongress shouldn't be paying attention to the way taxpayer dollars are \nspent.\n  For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this \namendment.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chair, may I please inquire as to the amount of \ntime remaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Oregon has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nPeters), a member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.\n  Mr. PETERS. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise as a cosponsor of this amendment, and I am glad \nto be working with Congresswoman Bonamici and my colleague on the Armed \nServices Committee, Ranking Member Adam Smith.\n  Our amendment simply allows the Department of Energy to continue its \ncollaborative work with the Department of Defense to produce biofuels \nfor the military.\n  The Department of Defense is the single largest institutional \nconsumer of fuel in the world, and this is all about saving money \nbecause our military spends about $20 billion a year on energy, $16 \nbillion of which goes to oil fuels.\n  As we have seen in recent years, global oil markets are volatile. And \ndespite massive production increases in the United States, according to \nthe Energy Information Administration, last year, our net imports of \npetroleum were 5 million barrels per day, with our top five suppliers \nbeing Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Iraq. That reliance \non a volatile, foreign-produced source of fuel puts our national \nsecurity at risk, particularly when we face dynamic, new threats from \nnonstate actors such as ISIS, al Qaeda, or individual terrorists who \ncan disrupt oil production and supply lines in new and intimidating \nways.\n  The constraints of depending so heavily on a single source of fuel \nalso puts our readiness at risk, a problem that will only increase as \nwe are forced to respond to international incidents across the globe at \na moment's notice and as our military makes its strategic pivot toward \nthe vast Pacific Ocean.\n  Instead of standing idly by and waiting for a fuel-supply crisis that \nwould endanger our ability to confront those wanting to harm our \ncountry, the Departments of Defense, Energy, and Agriculture have been \nworking with private sector innovators to develop renewable biofuels \nthat could be used by planes, tactical vehicles, and ships.\n  The Navy already has innovative partnerships with algae producers and \ntheir high-skilled workers in my district in San Diego.\n  Congress should be laying the groundwork for more strategic public-\nprivate partnerships to develop like those in San Diego, not mandating \nthat they cannot exist.\n  The military is not pursuing this fuel supply diversity because they \nare tree-hugging environmentalists but because it is a national \nsecurity imperative.\n  Foolishly, today's COMPETES Act would bar the Department of Defense \nfrom working with the Department of Energy on developing biofuels. Why \nwould we undercut an effort that our military commanders are for and \nsay will save lives?\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer), a member of the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my dear friend, Ms. Bonamici, for \nyielding and for her leadership on this important issue.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this commonsense amendment to \nallow\n\n[[Page H3458]]\n\nthe Department of Energy and the Department of Defense to continue \nworking together to develop biofuel options for our Nation's military.\n  DOD's reliance on a single source of fuel deepens dependence on \nforeign oil, threatens our national security, and contributes \nsignificantly to spending. Why would we not want the Department of \nEnergy with their deep technical expertise in this area to assist DOD \nto create alternatives for petroleum-based fuels? It makes no sense, \nand I urge my colleagues' support.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, in closing, the gentlewoman's \namendment would remove an important limitation from the underlying bill \nthat prevents the Department of Energy from spending research dollars \nto fund commercial-scale biofuels development for defense purposes. DOE \nshould focus on innovative research and development, not commercial \nproduction of any particular form of energy.\n  For those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I encourage Members to oppose this \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Oregon \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Beyer\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-120.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk for Mr. \nDeSaulnier and myself.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 174, lines 18 through 24, strike paragraph (1).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Beyer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to speak in support of our amendment, which \nwould restore the ARPA-E goal of developing energy technologies that \nresult in reductions in energy-related emissions, including greenhouse \ngases. I believe this is an important and urgent area of research and \nthat it should remain explicitly stated in the statute as a goal for \nARPA-E.\n  When I look at the existing statute, it says:\n\n       The goals of ARPA-E shall be reductions of imports of \n     energy from foreign sources; reductions of energy-related \n     emissions, including greenhouses gases; and improvement in \n     the energy efficiency of all economic sectors.\n\n  These are the three goals which have been removed from the current \nbill. Global carbon dioxide concentrations have risen more than 120 \nparts per million since preindustrial times, half of that arrived just \nsince 1980. The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas is driving the \nacceleration of greenhouse gas concentrations in our atmosphere. Just 2 \nweeks ago, NOAA reported that the monthly global average of \nconcentration of carbon dioxide has surpassed 400 parts per million. \nThe last time this happened was over 1 million years ago.\n  We must look to develop alternative energy sources that will reduce \nmanmade emissions. ARPA-E is a unique agency that can help us with this \nmission. Since 2009, it has funded over 400 potentially \ntransformational energy technology projects. A number of these projects \nhave spurred follow-on private sector funding, and a number of ARPA-E \nawardees have formed startup companies or partnered with other parts of \nthe government and industry to advance their technologies.\n  Reducing energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases, is an \nimportant component to our Nation's economic and energy security. \nTherefore, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support our amendment \nto reinstate these three goals for ARPA-E, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume \nto the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), who is also the \nchairman of the Oversight Subcommittee of the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment to H.R. \n1806 because I support research that will enhance both the economic \nsecurity and the energy security of the United States.\n  The original America COMPETES Act, which established the Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency within the Department of Energy, ARPA-E, \nrequired the agency to only pursue projects that reduce greenhouse \ngases. The bill before us today, the America COMPETES Reauthorization \nAct, allows any advanced energy technology that could enhance U.S. \neconomic and energy security to compete for ARPA-E funding. This levels \nthe playing field and ensures that ARPA-E funds research with the \ngreatest potential to have a positive impact on the American economy.\n  The COMPETES Act provides a balanced approach to ARPA-E by \nreprioritizing funding towards innovative projects that are truly in \nneed of Federal research dollars. The bill also removes restrictions \nthat allow the administration to play favorites in the energy sector. \nHowever, this amendment would strike the language which expands the \nARPA-E project eligibility. As a result, this amendment would then \nlimit innovative research and development.\n  With all of the national security challenges we face today, from \nterrorism, to cybersecurity breaches, to our skyrocketing national \ndebt, we should focus our attention on broadening our energy base and \nachieving energy independence, not limiting ourselves to one small area \nof environmental science. I believe we must adopt an all-of-the-above \nenergy strategy that improves our energy security and emphasizes all \nenergy opportunities, including those which reduce greenhouse gases.\n  Congress should not put in place arbitrary limits on innovation that \nwill prevent groundbreaking technologies from across the energy sector \nfrom participating in ARPA-E programs. I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas \n(Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), the ranking member of the Science, Space, \nand Technology Committee.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the \ngentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is deeply troubling to me that this amendment had to \nbe offered. This amendment fixes a provision in this bill that strips \naway a foundational component of the ARPA-E program.\n  As virtually every preeminent climatologist in the world agrees, \ngreenhouse gas emissions are growing so rapidly and are a growing \nthreat to our way of life. Why wouldn't we want one of the most \ninnovative agencies to develop technologies that could address this \ncritical issue?\n  ARPA-E has made good funding choices supporting valuable research, as \nproven by its impressive track record of successful projects since it \nwas first authorized. I certainly see no value in changing something \nthat no serious energy policy analyst believes is broken.\n  Mr. DeSaulnier's and Mr. Beyer's amendment sets this clearly \nmisguided provision aside. I enthusiastically support it and urge my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I listened with great interest to the rebuttal of the \nalternative argument from my friend, Mr. Loudermilk, and I found myself \nagreeing with almost everything that he said, but misunderstanding why \nretaining these three goals somehow played favorites, how they created \narbitrary limits on innovation, and how they opposed efforts to find \nour economic and\n\n[[Page H3459]]\n\nenergy security. The purpose of the amendment is to recognize that \nreducing dependence on foreign oil, that trying to find ways to limit \ngreenhouse gases, and improving the energy efficiency of all economic \nsectors are worthy goals.\n  Perhaps what we need to do is add a fourth one, which I would be \nhappy to place first if the chairman would agree, that says the goals \nwill be, first, to develop any breakthroughs in innovation that help \nthe economic and energy security of the Nation so that there is no \nplaying of favorites and there are no arbitrary limitations. If we \ncould work that out, that would be great. Otherwise, Mr. Chairman, I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment as offered, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment would \nremove key policy reforms to ARPA-E from the COMPETES bill and instead \nplace limitations on the research and development conducted at ARPA-E. \nFederally funded research should include innovative technologies for \nall forms of energy, not just the President's personal preferences. So \nI encourage Members to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 12 Offered by Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The predominant driver of gross domestic product growth \n     over the past half century has been scientific and \n     technological advancement.\n       (2) Investments in research and development have also \n     delivered significant benefits for national security, health, \n     energy security, education, and the personal well-being of \n     all Americans.\n       (3) Virtually every new technological product is traceable \n     to a research discovery, often one pursued with no \n     application in mind.\n       (4) Nondefense Federal research and development accounts \n     for only 1.7 percent of the\n\n[[Page H3460]]\n\n     Federal budget. Federal basic research accounts for only 1 \n     percent of the budget.\n       (5) There is a deficit between what America is investing \n     and what it should be investing to remain competitive, not \n     only in research but in technology transfer, innovation, and \n     job creation, thereby causing America's highly successful \n     science and technology enterprise to atrophy.\n       (6) Many research and development initiatives, due to the \n     long time periods required to achieve completion, have \n     benefited from stable and predictable investments and from \n     multiyear financial planning.\n       (7) The Federal science agencies should receive sustained \n     and steady growth in funding for research and development \n     activities, including basic research, across a wide range of \n     disciplines, including physical, geological, and life \n     sciences, mathematics, engineering, and social, behavioral, \n     and economic sciences.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Pursuant to House Resolution 271, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, so much of today's debate has been about how harmful \nthe underlying legislation is for our Nation and how it violates every \none of the principles of the original COMPETES bill. I am now pleased \nto be offering a positive way forward in the form of a substitute bill \ncosponsored by every Democratic member of the committee in addition to \nthe minority leader, Mr. Hoyer.\n  I spoke earlier about the history of the COMPETES bill and the \nprinciples it has embodied since the Rising Above the Gathering Storm \nreport set us on this path 10 years ago. The substitute amendment, \nwhich we introduced as H.R. 1898, stays true to one of these \nprinciples.\n  It sets targets that provide for steady and sustained real growth in \nfunding for our research and development agencies. It makes a strong \nstatement that the U.S. Congress sees funding for research across all \nfields of basic research as a top national priority. It does not \ninclude false and detrimental choices and tradeoffs among different \nfields of science and engineering. It ensures that scientific experts, \nnot politicians, continue to set priorities for funding within and \namong different fields of basic research and for individual grants.\n  The principles embodied in my substitute amendment continue a pact \nthat the Federal Government made with our Nation's great research \nuniversities following our victory in World War II and the onset of the \nspace race that led us to the creation of NSF and NASA.\n  This pact is what has made NSF, the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology, or NIST, and the Department of Energy among the world's \ngreatest and most admired research agencies.\n  Specifically, my amendment fully funds these agencies at the fiscal \nyear 2016 request level and continues to provide 5 percent annual \nincreases for 5 years. This modest investment is already a compromise, \ngiven the immense economic return on our basic research investments. \nThe original Rising Above the Gathering Storm report called for even \ngreater increases.\n  My amendment also reauthorizes and fully funds ARPA-E, which was \ncreated in the 2007 COMPETES Act and has exceeded every expectation for \ncreating innovative new energy technologies and spurring private sector \nfollow-on investment.\n  In addition, my amendment authorizes and funds important innovation \nprograms at the Department of Commerce, including an innovation voucher \npilot program that will help small- and medium-sized manufacturers \nacross the country grow their businesses and create new jobs.\n  My amendment fully funds the standards work of NIST, in addition to \ntheir work to help accelerate growth in U.S. advanced manufacturing. We \nneed to bring those manufacturing jobs back home, and we need to Make \nIt In America. NIST is an essential partner in this effort.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Finally, my amendment takes seriously the issue of STEM education, \nincluding broadening participation in STEM. Our STEM language is not \njust senses of Congress about how important STEM is and other filler \nprovisions.\n  Our language directs real important policy changes to help ensure \nthat all U.S. students and researchers have the opportunity to fully \ndevelop their talents in STEM and pursue successful STEM careers.\n  We are facing a demographic imperative. If we do not find a way to \nturn around the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM \nfields, our Nation will fall well short of the skilled workforce our \nindustries demand. Our substitute puts our money before where our mouth \nis when it comes to STEM and corrects a glaring deficit in the \nunderlying legislation.\n  I am proud of my work that I have done on this committee for many \nyears and of the contributions that many of my colleagues made to this \nsubstitute amendment. It truly is a COMPETES Reauthorization Act in \nevery way.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to carefully consider \nthe fork in the road before us. If you really want to do right by this \ngreat Nation and by our children and our grandchildren, you will vote \nfor the substitute amendment and replace the underlying legislation \nwith a positive path forward.\n  This amendment will open the doors for innovation and education for \nour Nation's future. It will not be trade, as many have said, that will \ncause us to lose these jobs; it will be our companies searching around \nthe world looking for talent and innovation.\n  Look out for America's future. Vote for this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n\n[[Page H3484]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gentlewoman's \namendment.\n  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I support a responsible and \nsustainable path forward for U.S. science, research, and development. \nWe must prioritize the areas of basic research to ensure future U.S. \neconomic competitiveness and spur private sector innovation.\n  This amendment ignores the caps set by the Budget Control Act, which \nthe ranking member herself supported, and ignores the tough choices \nthat must be made to protect the American taxpayer and future \ngenerations from more debt. It is irresponsible not to adhere to the \nBudget Control Act, which was signed into law by President Obama.\n  The Budget Control Act was a bipartisan agreement that 95 Democrats \nvoted for, including the ranking member. Now, she wants to ignore that \nparticular law. Although many Members would like to see the Budget \nControl Act replaced, it is the law of the land, and we should abide by \nit.\n  Of course, it is easy just to propose more spending, knowing it will \nsound good, even if it is irresponsible and against the law. In fiscal \nyear 2016 alone, this amendment would increase spending by $600 million \nover the current level and the underlying bill. The amendment increases \nspending on later-stage research and technology, best done by the \nprivate sector.\n  Since last Congress, we have worked hard to reach an agreement with \nthe minority on numerous policy issues, and we have accepted many of \ntheir provisions and ideas to make this bill stronger.\n  For example, we strengthened STEM provisions related to a new \nadvisory panel and coordinating office. We also included language in \nsupport of NIST that passed the House floor on a bipartisan vote last \nyear.\n  Also, in title III of the bill are three pieces of bipartisan \nlegislation that passed the Science Committee by voice vote in March. \nTwo of those three pieces of legislation were sponsored by Democrats.\n  I urge my colleagues to support a balanced approach of fiscal \nresponsibility and targeted investments in priority science and basic \nresearch and vote ``no'' on the Democratic substitute. The Democratic \nsubstitute ignores the Budget Control Act and does not advance good \nscience in America.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes \nto the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski).\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ms. Johnson for yielding.\n  I am proud to rise in support of Ms. Johnson's amendment in the \nnature of a substitute, and I am also proud to cosponsor H.R. 1898, \nwhich contains the same language, because this alternative is much more \nin keeping with the principles of the original America COMPETES Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, in 2007, I served on the conference committee that \nworked out the House-Senate compromise on the original COMPETES bill. \nIn 2010, I wrote the NSF title on the reauthorization. These are two of \nmy proudest moments in Congress because those were bipartisan bills \nthat set us on a path to continue leading the world in scientific \nresearch and innovation for the next generation.\n  Sadly, in recent years, we have let that progress stall. Make no \nmistake, other nations are continuing to invest and are continuing to \ninnovate. If we don't come together to send a strong message and \nprovide strong support for scientific research, America will no longer \nbe able to compete.\n  The COMPETES bill is an investment bill. I understand the threat of \nour enormous Federal debt; but, without the types of investments that \nare made in the COMPETES bill, we will not promote the economic growth \nthat we need to end our deficits and pay down our debt.\n  Ranking Member Johnson's alternative makes those investments. Unlike \nthe base bill, it does not make drastic cuts to Advanced Research \nProjects Agency-Energy, which promotes and funds research and \ndevelopment of advanced energy technologies.\n  It does not make drastic cuts to the Office of Energy Efficiency and \nRenewable Energy that invests in high-risk, high-value research and \ndevelopment in the fields of energy efficiency and renewable energy \ntechnologies. It doesn't cut the geosciences or make a more than 50 \npercent cut to research in the social, behavioral, and economic \nsciences.\n  Some might think that last one is warranted; but, in the Science \nCommittee, we are constantly hearing from witnesses about how social \nscience is vital to the work going on in other fields. Members of \nCongress have frequently relied on spectrum auctions, developed by NSF \nsocial science research, to raise billions of dollars.\n  Social science is perhaps the most critical component to preventing \ncyber crimes. Considering that the majority of all cyber breaches occur \nbecause of social factors, like using easy-to-guess passwords or \nclicking on a link in a phishing attack, we should want to increase \nfunding in these areas.\n  Mr. Chairman, Ms. Johnson's amendment provides robust support in all \nof these areas. I agree that the chairman's bill has gotten better and \nthings have been added to the bill which have made it a better bill, \nbut still, I think there is no question that Ms. Johnson's substitute \nis a much better bill for making the types of investments we need in \nscientific research right now if we want to make sure that America \nstill competes. This is critical to the future of our country; this is \ncritical to innovation.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Babin), who is a member of the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee.\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's \namendment.\n  The gentlewoman's amendment makes everything a priority so that \nnothing really is. This amendment rubberstamps the administration's \nbudget request, which fails to make choices, spreading a little bit of \nresearch funding around to try to please everyone.\n  Compared to the gentlewoman's proposal, H.R. 1806 funds 329 more new \ngrants in biology next year, 398 more new grants in computer science, \n457 more new grants in engineering, and 955 more new grants in math and \nthe physical sciences.\n  These are research grants that are going to universities and research \ninstitutions across the country, fueling innovation and driving \neconomic competitiveness in the United States.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I \nhave remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  I rise today in support of the substitute amendment to H.R. 1806 and \nfocus on one issue. The underlying bill would set a harmful new \nprecedent by authorizing funding at the directorate level.\n  Currently, funding levels for the National Science Foundation for \neach directorate are based on strategic priorities and science-based \nrecommendations from the National Science Board. This is how it should \nbe and how it remains under the substitute amendment.\n  By setting authorization levels according to directorate, this bill \nwould limit the flexibility NSF needs to set strategic priorities and \nadapt and capitalize on unanticipated discoveries.\n  I share the concerns of many experts that the underlying bill would \nreduce authorized funding levels for specific directorates: the \nDirectorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences and the \nDirectorate for Geosciences.\n  Some of this funding has been used, for example, for Oregon State \nUniversity to conduct research on ocean acidification. It has also been \nused critically to support the work in Oregon to develop our \nunderstanding of the risks posed by a Cascadia subduction zone \nearthquake. Other examples are around the country.\n  In summary, the underlying bill diminishes the ability of the \nNational Science Foundation to make strategic science-based decisions.\n\n[[Page H3485]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the substitute \namendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, we are prepared to close, so I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I simply will close \nby saying, as we have been on this floor, we continue to get emails and \nletters from universities and scientists around this Nation.\n  I am not presenting this substitute to be funny; I am presenting this \nsubstitute to take us to the professional level that the research \nbrought us when we first had America COMPETES. It is not a picking and \nchoosing; it is a professional approach to funding scientific projects.\n  If we mean to look out for the future of the Nation, as we say we \nare, this is the legislation that will do it.\n  I urge everyone to support it, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman's amendment ignores \nthe law of the land. She and more than 90 other Democrats supported the \nBudget Control Act, which was signed into law by the President. This \namendment ignores those budget caps.\n  I support a responsible and sustainable path forward for U.S. \nscience, research, and development; but it is neither responsible, nor \nsustainable, to spend more and more taxpayer dollars and increase the \ndebt that future generations will inherit. We must prioritize the areas \nof basic research to ensure future economic competitiveness and spur \nprivate sector innovation.\n  Since the last Congress, we have worked hard to reach an agreement \nwith the minority on numerous policy issues, but we have been clear \nsince the beginning that increases in spending need to have reasonable \noffsets. This amendment fails to include any offsets and openly ignores \nthe Budget Control Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support a balanced approach of fiscal \nresponsibility and targeted investments in priority, science, and basic \nresearch. Vote ``no'' on the amendment and ``yes'' on the underlying \nbill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I request a \nrecorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments printed in part A of House Report \n114-120 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following \norder:\n  Amendment No. 2 by Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas.\n  Amendment No. 6 by Mr. Griffith of Virginia.\n  Amendment No. 8 by Mr. Lowenthal of California.\n  Amendment No. 10 by Ms. Bonamici of Oregon.\n  Amendment No. 11 by Mr. Beyer of Virginia.\n  Amendment No. 12 by Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I \ncall up House Resolution 274 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 274\n\n         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of \n     the bill (H.R. 1335) to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act to provide flexibility for \n     fishery managers and stability for fishermen, and for other \n     purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed \n     with. All points of order against consideration of the bill \n     are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and \n     shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by \n     the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Natural Resources. After general debate the bill shall be \n     considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu \n     of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \n     the Committee on Natural Resources now printed in the bill, \n     it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the \n     purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule an amendment \n     in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules \n     Committee Print 114-16. That amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute shall be considered as read. All points of order \n     against that amendment in the nature of a substitute are \n     waived. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute shall be in order except those printed in the \n     report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this \n     resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the \n     order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member \n     designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall \n     be debatable for the time specified in the report equally \n     divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may \n     be withdrawn by the proponent at any time before action \n     thereon, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be \n     subject to a demand for division of the question in the House \n     or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against \n     such amendments are waived. At the conclusion of \n     consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall \n     rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as \n     may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote \n     in the House on any\n\n[[Page H3492]]\n\n     amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill \n     or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made in \n     order as original text. The previous question shall be \n     considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to \n     final passage without intervening motion except one motion to \n     recommit with or without instructions.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Young of Iowa). The gentleman from \nAlabama is recognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alabama?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 274 provides a structured rule for \nconsideration of the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing \nFlexibility in Fisheries Management Act. The rule makes in order eight \namendments, five of which are from Democratic sponsors. One of the \namendments is a Democrat substitute, which will be debated for twice as \nlong as the other amendments.\n  As someone who has lived his whole life on the Gulf Coast, I can tell \nyou just how important this bill is. For many people who live on our \nNation's coast, this bill is about a way of life.\n  This bill is for our Nation's commercial fishermen, who depend on a \nreliable fishing stock in order to make a living. This bill is also for \nour Nation's charter boat fleets, which are an important source of \ntourism. That means jobs, Mr. Speaker, and all too often people in this \ntown and government scientists seem not to care about that.\n  Just as importantly, this bill is for our recreational fishermen and \neveryday anglers who just enjoy spending time on the waters. For my \nfamily, this is a lifelong tradition. I remember fishing with my dad on \nthe Gulf of Mexico. I treasured opportunities to fish with my four \nchildren, and as a new grandfather, I look forward to fishing with my \ngrandson.\n  This is a good bill, and as a former member of the committee of \njurisdiction, the Natural Resources Committee, I can tell you that a \ngreat amount of time and effort have gone into this bill. This process \nstarted over 2 years ago, and there was a lot of work to bring our \nparties together to get a bill that everyone can agree on.\n  Unfortunately, as happens far too often here in Washington, my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided to make this \ninto a partisan fight. President Obama has said he will veto this bill. \nAll this despite real efforts to work together, across the aisle, to \nget a bill that works for everyone.\n  Now I want to briefly talk about the idea of science that the \nPresident and my colleagues on the other side claim the bill \nundermines. All too often here in D.C., what passes for science is just \npolitical ideology dressed up with some technical language with no real \nbasis in observable data.\n  I don't know if the gentleman from Colorado has ever been fishing for \nred snapper in the Gulf Coast--if he hasn't, then I invite him to do \nso--but I can tell you that there are more red snapper there than there \nhas ever been before. Despite that good news, NOAA and the Federal \nGovernment is consistently undercounting the number of fish in the Gulf \nof Mexico.\n  Here is the craziest part of all: NOAA is not sampling for red \nsnapper on reefs, despite the fact that the red snapper is a reef fish. \nThat is simply absurd. If you look for red snapper somewhere other than \nthe reefs, you are not going to find them because they live on reefs.\n  Now, NOAA is also overestimating the number of red snapper caught \neach year. For example, last year the Federal Government estimated that \n1,041,000 pounds of red snapper were caught off the coast of Alabama, \nwhere I am from. The Alabama red snapper reporting system, which is run \nby the State, only estimated a catch of 418,000 pounds. That is a \nremarkable disparity.\n  So what has happened is a very dangerous combination of NOAA \nunderestimating how many fish are actually out there and overestimating \nthe number of fish caught each year. This has resulted in a \ndramatically shortened season for our red snapper fisherman. Last \nyear's red snapper season was only 9 days. This year it has been \nincreased to 10 days. That is simply unacceptable.\n  I support science-based management, and the committee supports \nscience-based management, but I don't support and the committee doesn't \nsupport flawed science-based management. And this House shouldn't \neither.\n  So that is why I get so frustrated when I hear my colleagues say that \nthis bill undermines good science. Come tell that to my fishermen on \nthe Gulf Coast. Come tell that to the marine scientists on the Gulf \nCoast who have done extensive scientific research on this.\n\n  This bill is important because it includes real reforms that are \ndesigned to get some better science for all of our fisheries, not only \nas it relates to red snapper, but as it relates to the fisheries all \naround the United States of America. Why don't we encourage stronger \npartnerships with local colleges and universities that have done great \nwork in the past?\n  Mr. Speaker, I do want to touch on that red snapper issue a little \nmore because it is so important to the people I represent, and it is \nvery important to debate on this bill. This bill includes three \nimportant reforms that local scientists, stakeholders, and I believe \nwill get us a real red snapper season. Number one, it repeals \ninflexible quotas that have been in place up to this point. Number two, \nit creates jurisdictional parity by expanding State waters out to 9 \nnautical miles gulfwide. Number three, it shifts the stock assessment \nand data collection responsibilities from the Federal Government and \ngives those responsibilities to the Gulf States so we can get some real \nscience, not flawed science.\n  Far too often people in Washington think we know best; people in \nWashington think we have all the answers. This is an issue where that \nsimply is not the case. This bill empowers our Nation's fishing \ncommunities and gives them the flexibility they need.\n  So regardless of whether or not you go fishing, this issue should \nmatter to all Americans because this issue is about freedom and \nlimiting the role of the Federal Government in areas where it just \ndoesn't belong.\n  This is an extremely fair rule. I urge its support, Mr. Speaker, and \nI reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. The gentleman from Alabama said there are more red snapper \nthan there have ever been before, and that would seem to indicate that \nthe policies are working, and I don't think it is a time to reverse \ncourse.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Huffman), the ranking member of the Natural \nResources Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Oceans and the author of \nthe Democratic substitute, which is a cleaner reauthorization.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Like the gentleman from Alabama, I do represent a coastal district, a \nfishing district. In fact, the Second District of California includes \nabout one-third of the California coastline and many working harbors \nand ports where fishing men and women have been catching fish with \ntheir families for many, many generations, as well as the Native \nAmerican tribes that I represent, who have been depending on healthy \nfisheries for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.\n  So this is important to me. I share the gentleman's concern that we \ncontinue to make fishing available for ourselves and for future \ngenerations. We have some disagreements on how to get there, and we \nwill talk about that.\n  I think the thing that we have to recognize at the outset of this \ndebate is that the Magnuson-Stevens Act has been a great success by \njust about any measure. It succeeded initially in helping us protect \nand rebuild fisheries from the threat of foreign fleets that were \ncoming into U.S. waters and overfishing and harming our American \nfishing communities and fishing families. It then went on to succeed in \npreventing overfishing by U.S. fishermen\n\n[[Page H3493]]\n\nby a number of mechanisms in the bill that we will talk about in a \nmoment.\n  The other way in which Magnuson-Stevens has been a huge success is \nthat it has always been bipartisan. Both the original act and the \nsubsequent reauthorizations of Magnuson-Stevens have always been \nstrongly bipartisan. And unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we are departing \nfrom that positive history with the bill we have before us today, and \nwe need to get it back on track.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  The keys to Magnuson-Stevens' success have included strict rules on \nrebuilding of fishery stocks and also very strict fishery specific \nquotas, so that we can make sure that we prevent overfishing and ensure \na sustainable fishery population. This is not so that we stop fishing, \nquite the contrary. The purpose of these mechanisms is so that we can \ncontinue to fish for future generations by maintaining sustainable \npopulations.\n  Absent these mechanisms, these very successful provisions in \nMagnuson-Stevens' history teaches us what would happen. We have a \nhistory that is played out over and over again in this country and, \nfrankly, around the world--that, without strict protections for \nsustainable fish populations, we will overfish them, we will deplete \nthem.\n  It puts us on a path where the tragedy of the commons plays out over \nand over again, and the end result of that is fisheries closures. We \nare not helping the folks who want to fish. When we don't manage these \npopulations, we are actually hurting them in the long run.\n  Now, Democrats have put forward a substitute amendment that is much \ncloser to a clean reauthorization of Magnuson-Stevens. We think that is \nreally the conversation we need to be having. What kind of clean \nreauthorization can we have? And are there consensus areas where we can \nactually improve Magnuson-Stevens?\n  The gentleman from Alabama might be surprised to find Democrats \nstrongly agreeing with him, that we could benefit from additional \nscience, better science. There may be better data available on the red \nsnapper in the Gulf. We are also working with Republicans to try to get \nthat science and make it available to the decisionmakers who set those \nrules for that fishery.\n  There is also more than meets the eye, even for that red snapper \nfishery because, while you are talking about a small number of days for \nrecreational fishermen in Federal waters, you have got a much greater \nnumber of days in State waters.\n  You also can fish for red snapper and any other species just about \nany day you want. When you are in Federal waters, you can only keep \nthem during those certain number of days. The reason for that is \nbecause approximately half the fish caught are reserved for commercial \nfishermen who have made their case to the regional council that it is \nonly fair that about half the fish ought to be available to them and \nabout half the fish are allocated to recreational fishermen.\n  In those small number of days, believe it or not, the recreational \nfolks catch almost the same amount of fish that the commercial \nfishermen catch during a much greater number of days. There is always a \nlittle more than meets the eye. You hear sensational statistics perhaps \nabout the very small number of days available. There is, frankly, much \nmore to the story.\n  Where we do agree is, if we can get better data, better science, \nbetter monitoring, all of this should be subject to discussion and \nrevision in the councils. That is the flexibility of the Magnuson-\nStevens Act, and that ought to be something that we can work on here \ntogether.\n  Unfortunately, though, Mr. Speaker, we have a Republican bill that is \ntaking away some of the key provisions of the act that have actually \nbeen the very source of its great success over the years, so that heads \nin a wrong direction.\n  Then, unfortunately, we have the obligatory runs at NEPA and various \nenvironmental laws, including the Antiquities Act. This is no place to \nbe carrying out that endless assault on America's environmental laws.\n  Let's get back to that point of consensus, sustainable management of \nour fisheries. If we can do that, I think we have something we can work \non together in this House.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's comments. It is very important that we \ntry to find ways to try to work together when the form of this bill \nthat we worked on in the committee last year, which is almost identical \nto the one that we adopted this year, was before the Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  In Mr. DeFazio's opening statement, he said:\n\n       Thank you, Chairman, and I appreciate the changes that were \n     negotiated on a number of provisions in the bill.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       This has been traditionally a very bipartisan exercise, and \n     this is, in good part, bipartisan.\n\n  Mr. Pallone, same time, his opening statement in the committee last \nyear on a virtually identical bill was:\n\n       I do want to say that I do appreciate the fact that you \n     reach out to us on the Democratic side of the aisle; and many \n     of the provisions, as you mentioned, that are in the bill did \n     come from input from the Democratic side.\n\n  The gentleman referenced the substitute:\n\n       The substitute has been made in order and has given more \n     time than anything else for us to debate.\n\n  We have really leaned over backwards, particularly when you consider \nthat the majority of amendments that we have made in order in this rule \nare amendments offered by the Democrats.\n  Now, I appreciate that the gentleman has a substitute--and we are \ngoing to give him an opportunity to talk about it--but if you look at \nhis substitute, we might as well call his substitute ``The \nEnvironmental Litigation and Fisheries Disaster Creation Act of 2015'' \nbecause that is what it is going to do.\n  This amendment would allow the Secretary of Commerce to accept \noutside funds from NGOs to support cooperative research projects. This \ngives the litigation community of the world an avenue to influence NOAA \ndecision making.\n  This amendment requires the Secretary of Commerce to ignore current \nprocedure and forces the Secretary to retroactively declare a fishery \ndisaster in California from a January 2004 emergency proclamation on \nCalifornia drought.\n  Mr. Huffman's amendment seems to single out and blame the Central \nValley Project for a fishery disaster. As we all know, there are many \nfactors for fish declines, mainly including ocean conditions.\n\n  This amendment seeks to blame farmers for a fishery disaster. Above \nall, this amendment erases the flexibilities, transparency, and science \nimprovements made in the underlying bill, but we give him the \nopportunity to make his case before this House to show our willingness \nto work with them.\n  I was greatly surprised when I read the Statement of Administration \nPolicy that we received from the administration when we were marking \nthis bill up in Rules Committee yesterday, and I was most surprised at \nwhat they had to say about the snapper language. Now, that language \ncame from me. I asked the committee to put it in the bill, and I am \ngreatly appreciative of the fact that they did.\n  Remember what I said about what the science has done to our fishery \nin the Gulf of Mexico. Here is what the administration says:\n\n       H.R. 1335 would also severely undermine the authority of \n     the Gulf of Mexico Regional Fishery Management Council by \n     extending State jurisdiction over the recreational red \n     snapper fishery to 9 miles in the Gulf of Mexico. We intend \n     to give the States more authority by going out.\n\n  Now, yes, that would give us some flexibility for the fishing out \nthere, but a lot of the reefs that these red snappers grow on are \nfurther out than 9 miles, so it doesn't solve the whole problem.\n  The administration goes on to say:\n\n       This proposed extension of jurisdiction would create an \n     untenable situation where recreational and commercial \n     fishermen fishing side by side would be subject to different \n     regulatory regimes.\n\n  How do they know in advance what the States are going to do? Why do \nthey presume that that is going to be the case? They do so because they \nhave such an aversion to the States having any control, any input, in \nthe way that this fishery is governed.\n\n[[Page H3494]]\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Absent an agreement among the States as to how to allocate \n     recreationally caught red snapper, the bill would encourage \n     interstate conflict and jeopardize the sustainability of this \n     gulfwide resource.\n\n  No one has a greater stake in making sure we keep this fish stock \nhealthy than those of us that live on the Gulf Coast do. Whether we are \nin commercial fishing, whether we are in charter boat fishing, whether \nwe are in recreational fishing, if we overfish this stock, it is gone; \nI won't get to fish it with my grandson.\n  Future commercial fishermen won't get to make money off of this and \nprovide jobs. Charter boat people won't be able to come down to the \nbeach and enjoy themselves. No one wants that to happen.\n  The administration presumes that we are going to be so self-defeating \nthat we would allow that to happen. I am greatly disappointed that, \nafter all the work we did to solve this problem that was created by the \ngovernment scientists, that still the administration is attacking us, \nstill they are trying to keep us from solving this problem.\n  I appreciate what the gentleman had to say. I think we should try to \nwork together on every bill we try to pass in this House; but, at some \npoint, we have got to stand up for people who fish in this country. We \nhave a right to fish in the waters of the United States, and the waters \nof the United States don't belong to the government scientists; they \nbelong to the people of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Here we are debating the gutting of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which \nboth sides agree has successfully helped restore some of our counts of \nwild stock, including snapper. It hardly seems the time to reverse \ncourse without any scientific evidence that, somehow, we will get to a \ndifferent place than we were when Congress wrote the Magnuson-Stevens \nAct to address the very issue, which it seems to be successfully \naddressing.\n  The gentleman from Alabama mentioned some remarks from Mr. DeFazio. I \nwanted to be clear that then-Ranking Member DeFazio opposed a similar \nbill, this similar bill, in the last Congress. I am not sure of the \ncontext of the remarks he made, but he stood here on the floor urging \nhis colleagues to oppose the bill. He opposed it as well in committee.\n  He was not happy with the result last time; he is not happy with the \nresult this time, nor is our new ranking member of either the \nsubcommittee or the committee. I should add it passed out of committee \nwithout a single Democratic vote. To be clear, there was not a \nbipartisan effort in committee to talk about the best policy with \nregard to fisheries.\n  Now, before I jump into the debate about fish populations and \nfisheries in our oceans--something I have to admit, as representing the \nlandlocked State of Colorado, I had to take a crash course on in the \nlast few days--I want to talk about some of the events from the last \nweek that I think should merit congressional attention.\n  One item that happened in the last week is a 16-year-old student from \nthe Atlanta Public School system in Georgia was attacked in his \ncourtyard just because he was gay. A crowd surrounded to watch as 15 \npeople beat this young person into a bloody pulp while yelling \nderogatory slurs at him.\n  Again, we could be addressing that through passing the Student Non-\nDiscrimination Act or the antibullying act from Representative Sanchez, \nbut instead, we are talking about gutting Magnuson-Stevens' protections \nof our fisheries.\n  Also this week, a south Texas family detention facility, similar to \nfacilities in other parts of the country for immigrants who were caught \nin the wrong place at the wrong time, testimony came out that women and \nchildren were severely punished, abused, and neglected. We could be \npursuing detention reform or immigration reform; but, again, we are \nnot.\n  This last week, Los Angeles raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour. \nNow, in LA, that puts families closer to a living wage, but the bad \nnews is this Congress refuses to take up any minimum wage hike. Whether \nit is a $12 proposal, which Democrats put forward, whether it is a \n$10.10 proposal, whether it is even a $9 proposal, this Congress has \nnot, instead of bringing forward a bill to increase the minimum wage--\nby the way, when somebody works full time at minimum wage, they earn \nabout $14,500 a year. I don't know what we are saying to people where \nyou work full time and we are forcing you to rely on government \nprograms to subsist.\n  Republicans are keeping people on public housing, on food stamps, on \nwelfare, rather than helping them support their own way and regaining \ntheir dignity in the process, which is what raising the minimum wage \nwould do; but, no, we are not talking about that here today. We are \ntalking about gutting the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n  21,000 gallons of oil spilled in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of \nSanta Barbara County--that is probably not good for the fish there \neither--following the eruption of an 11-mile long underground pipeline; \nbut, instead of talking about a renewable energy future, instead of \ntalking about ending our reliance on fossil fuels or a national \nrenewable energy portfolio standard, we are talking about gutting our \nfisheries protection and gutting the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n  Tragically, we had funerals for eight people who were killed in the \nderailment of the Amtrak train in Pennsylvania; our House observed a \nmoment of silence earlier on that, but rather than discussing measures \nthat can prevent future derailment accidents--and I understand there is \nsome technology that, when implemented, could have helped avoid this \nkind of accident--here we are again, discussing gutting the Magnuson-\nStevens Act that has successfully protected our wild fisheries and \nhelped restore some of the stock so that precisely the recreational and \ncharter fishermen and the gentleman from Alabama can continue to enjoy \nfishing. Absent the support of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, it is likely \nwe would not be able to support the level of recreational and \ncommercial fishing that we can today.\n  Seven people were shot in Baltimore yesterday amid a recent spike in \nviolence following the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody; \nbut, instead of addressing nonlethal use of force or video cameras on \npolice officers, we are discussing gutting the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n  We all know that the Federal highway reauthorization is running up \nagainst the May 31 deadline. The body of this Congress chose to renew \nit for 60 days and just created another crisis in another 59 days; yet \nwe are not discussing what a deal would look like, a bipartisan deal, \nfor a longer-term reauthorization of the Federal highway trust fund.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  One hundred eighty Democrats signed a discharge petition for a bill \nthat seeks to renew the charter of the Export-Import Bank, a critical \ndriver for job creation and American competitiveness, fully permissible \nunder WTO rules, under proposed trade agreement rules. Other countries \nhave these kinds of banks, and to unilaterally disarm would cost \nAmerican jobs. But instead of talking about how Congress gets out of \nthis political box on the Export-Import Bank, we are discussing gutting \nthe Magnuson-Stevens fisheries protection legislation.\n  This Congress could do a lot better with regard to dealing with \nissues that I hear about from my constituents every day, day in and day \nout, whether that is fixing our broken immigration system, whether it \nis protecting our country from terrorism, whether it is preventing \nfuture Amtrak derailments. Those are the kinds of topics that, I think, \nthe American people want to see us discussing here today rather than \ngutting an important piece of legislation which many charter fishermen, \nrecreational fishermen, and commercial fishermen applaud in having \nsuccessfully sustained their livelihoods or their passions for the last \ngeneration.\n  Let's talk about fish.\n  The bill we are looking at today would devastate our wild fisheries. \nIt would make our waters much more of a ``free for all.'' Under the \nguise of flexibility, it would allow for the overfishing of critical \nspecies, risking not only their sustainability and the future enjoyment \nof recreational fishermen but also the health of entire ecosystems that \nrely on the fish stocks that we are debating.\n\n[[Page H3495]]\n\n  It would set an alarming precedent for the circumvention of our \nbedrock environmental laws by allowing fishery management councils to \nsupersede NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act; the Endangered \nSpecies Act; the Antiquities Act; and the National Marine Sanctuaries \nAct.\n  The Fishery Conservation and Management Act was introduced in 1976 to \nstop unregulated fishing that had demonstrably led to the depletion \nacross a number of wild fisheries. In both 1996 and 2007, the \nlegislation was reauthorized--bipartisan bills again. This bill passed \ncommittee without a single Democratic vote. Each time, through a \ncomprehensive drafting process, good ideas from both sides of the aisle \nwere put to paper.\n  Ironically, the one thing that, I think, the gentleman from Alabama \nand I can agree on is that the 2007 authorization has been successful. \nWe have shown the increased health of our wild fish stocks. So the \nquestion is: Do we want to reverse course and jeopardize that, or do we \nwant to move forward with scientific-backed evidence?\n  Unfortunately, the Republicans are trying to make sweeping changes to \ngut the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Protection Act. This iteration of \nthe bill was drafted with almost no Democratic input, and it passed out \nof committee without a single Democratic vote.\n  Look, if we want to go through this kind of exercise with a bill that \nthe President has said he would veto--a bill that breaks with the proud \nbipartisan tradition of fisheries protection--why aren't we spending \ntime on some of the issues I mentioned earlier, like immigration \nreform, like protecting LGBT students from discrimination, like \nsocioeconomic disparities in our country, how we can deal with mental \nhealth among returning veterans who fought overseas, or the risk of \nterrorism here at home? Let's do that.\n  If we are going to talk fish, Mr. Speaker, let's at least bring up a \nbill that has been drafted by all stakeholders. Let's at least bring up \na bill that ensures that the fishing community will have an industry in \n10 years, in 20 years, in 50 years--a bill that protects the interests \nof our recreational fishermen and that preserves the health of our \noceans for the enjoyment of all Americans and for the health of our \nplanet now into the future.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I was listening to the gentleman from Colorado speak. We heard about \nimmigration, minimum wage, LGBT, renewable energy, highways, the Ex-Im \nBank, and a little bit about fish. This is a bill about fish. It is not \nabout all of that stuff.\n  We have heard from our friends on the other side of the aisle that we \nin the majority are using too many combined rules, where you have more \nthan one bill in the rule, which they say confuses the debate and \ndistracts from the individual merits of each bill and the process by \nwhich it will be considered. I have just got to tell you that it seems \nto me we had a lot of confusion and distraction with the interjection \ninto this debate of a bunch of issues that have nothing to do with \nfishing. Today, we have one rule covering one bill; yet the gentleman \njust spent the majority of his time discussing issues not covered in \nthe rule before us.\n  Let me tell you that the people in my area are suffering. Charter \nboat people have lost their boats. Dads who want to take their children \nfishing can't take their children fishing. It is destroying a way of \nlife for people. I am not saying those other issues aren't important, \nthat they are not serious, but they are not covered by this rule, and \nthey are not in this bill. We need to debate that.\n  The gentleman said something about the 2007 act, that it was \nsuccessful. Let me tell you what it has been successful in doing. It \nhas taken a summer red snapper season and reduced it to 10 days. That \nis what it has been successful in doing. It has been successful in \nalmost decimating our charter boat fleets and in putting a lot of \npeople out of work. I hear a lot from the other side about needing to \nput people to work. The people on these charter boats work. They lost \ntheir jobs because of this. It was successful all right. It was \nsuccessful in destroying something that worked for people for \ngenerations.\n  I have great respect for my fellow colleague from Colorado who is on \nthe Rules Committee. I know he doesn't get to fish much in the Gulf of \nMexico, but I extend an invitation to him. I will take him out there \nand let him catch some red snapper. I believe, Mr. Speaker, once he \ndoes that, he will be as enthusiastic for this bill as I am.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire if the gentleman has \nany further speakers or is prepared to close.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I invite the gentleman from Alabama to come to Colorado to fish our \nwonderful mountain trout, which we have in our streams and rivers. \nObviously, he is no stranger to a different kind of fisheries \nmanagement policy where, of course, our economy in Colorado relies on \nfishing and sportsmen as well, and I certainly understand that driver \nof jobs locally.\n  I think the disconnect here is that the gentleman talks about what \nthe 2007 Magnuson-Stevens bill has accomplished in that it has reduced \nthe number of days that people can fish. That was the action that \nwas taken. The effect of that is that the wild stocks are up, so there \nare more snapper. I think both sides agree on that. I believe there is \na direct causal link to the fact that there are more snapper because \nthere have been fewer that have been taken out of the water. If we \nmanage our fisheries for the short term, if we throw caution to the \nwind, people might have a good season or two, but it simply won't be \nthere either for the future generation of recreationists or for those \nwhose livelihoods depend on a viable commercial fishing stock.\n\n  Now, this bill is about fish. If this rule allowed for the discussion \nof some of the other bills I mentioned, I could support it. If this \nbill allowed a debate of #raisethewage, either to our Democratic \nproposal of a $12 an hour minimum wage or to whatever number the \ngentleman from Alabama would like--if he would like to propose $9 an \nhour, $8.50--I would be willing to support this rule, or if it even \nallowed 2 minutes of debate for raising the minimum wage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would support this bill if it allowed for us to \nconsider our bipartisan immigration reform measure. If we allowed that \ndebate under this bill, I would do that. I would support this rule if \nit allowed debate about the Student Nondiscrimination Act to make sure \nthat LGBT students don't face bullying in our schools and so that it is \na safe learning environment for all students. I would support this rule \nif it addressed what we have learned from the Amtrak derailment and \nprevented future derailments and saved lives.\n  None of those items, along with countless others, are included under \nthis rule. In fact, all of the amendments under this rule, as well as \nthe underlying bill, are related to fish.\n  No, I don't know deny that fish are important. We might be discussing \nour mountain trout someday here on the floor of the House and defending \nthe President's efforts around clean water or on protecting some of our \nwatersheds in Colorado. We have a lot of interest in protecting our \nfishing stock as well. But I would be proud to be able to bring forth \nsome of the priorities that I hear from my constituents that are so \ncritical.\n  Rather than continually bringing up bills that attack the integrity \nof our environment--in this case, a bill that would gut the fisheries \nprotections that have been afforded under the Magnuson-Stevens Act and \nthat both sides have acknowledged have successfully helped restore the \nred snapper population--I would hope that perhaps our next rule will \nallow us to raise the minimum wage, that perhaps our next rule will \nallow us to consider immigration reform, that perhaps our next rule \nwill help us deal with the bullying in schools, that perhaps our next \nrule will save lives and prevent future derailments, and so many other \nissues.\n  I say to my colleagues that this particular bill needs to go back to \nthe drawing board. It needs to go back to the drawing board to have a \nbipartisan effort in a committee I serve on, the Natural Resources \nCommittee, to include priorities from both sides and good science and \ncontinue to build upon the legacy of success that the 2007\n\n[[Page H3496]]\n\nbipartisan reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act has had in \nincreasing the health of our wild fishing stocks. I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I was listening very carefully to the gentleman from Colorado, and I \naccept his invitation to go trout fishing. I would love to do that. \nFishing of all kind is great for everybody to do, and I appreciate his \ninvitation.\n  The reason we have the problem we have today is not because the \nFederal Government knows how many fish are out there. It doesn't. \nRemember what I said earlier--this is a reef fish, and they don't \nsample for reef fish on reefs. So, if you don't sample for reef fish on \nreefs, you are not going to find the fish. Now, we know there are so \nmany fish out there because we haven't been allowed to fish them and \nthat snapper are not only eating other species but they are eating \nother snapper.\n  What our scientists have done is they have actually gone out there \nwith submersible vehicles with high-def cameras, and they count the \nfish on the reef and sample them that way. They have a real number. \nThey do a real sampling so they get accurate data, and these government \nscientists don't.\n  My friend said that we should go back to the drawing board. We have \nwaited too long already. We should have done this last year so that we \ncould have had a real snapper season this year. If we wait again, we \nwon't have a snapper season next year, and that is not acceptable. We \nhave enough fish out there--and the science from our region has proven \nit--to have a real snapper season. It is not just about snapper. We \nhave these problems in other areas of the fishery that need to be taken \ncare of and taken care of in a responsible way. No one is more \nenvironmentally conscious than someone who hunts and fishes, because \nthat is where we get our enjoyment, and we want it to be there for us \nand for our children and, now that I have a grandson, for my \ngrandchildren.\n  I have appreciated this debate today. I always welcome the \nopportunity to draw attention to some of the real issues which are \naffecting my constituents back on the Gulf Coast. To some people up \nhere, this issue doesn't mean much. To some people, they only listen to \nthe political talking points put out by lobbyists or by political \nparties or by environmental groups. But to the small restaurant \nemployees in Gulf Shores or to the charter boat captain in Orange Beach \nor to the gas station in Foley or to the condo owners on Dauphin Island \nor to the thousands of families who spend time fishing on the Gulf \nCoast and all around our country, this bill is critically important. \nThis bill is about getting the Federal Government off our backs so that \nwe can fish.\n  Let's not fall back into another political debate. Let's come \ntogether on behalf of our Nation's coastal communities. Let's get some \nreal relief for our fishermen. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis rule and to support this commonsense bill and to support the \npeople of America and their freedom to fish in our waters.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS.

Mr. Speaker, today it is with great sorrow that I rise to \nmark the loss of one of Aurora's brightest lights. On May 12, 2015, \nwhile performing relief work following the Nepal earthquake, Corporal \nSara Abigail Medina and five other marines tragically lost their lives \nin a helicopter crash.\n  Corporal Medina was from Aurora, Illinois, and graduated from East \nAurora High School in 2010. While still in high school, she decided to \nserve her country by joining the Marines.\n  In the face of such a tragedy, we often ask why; and to paraphrase \nthe President, whenever a disaster strikes, the world looks to America \nto lead because of our extraordinary people who rise to the challenge.\n  As a father, I know that no words that I say on this floor will be \nable to fill the hole in the hearts of all those who knew and loved \nSara, but still we must speak because all should know that Corporal \nSara Medina gave her last full measure of devotion in service to her \ncountry, helping those who needed it most.\n  For her sacrifice and for her family's terrible loss, we offer our \ncondolences and thanks of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3496-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Newhouse).

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague, the gentlewoman from Florida, as we discuss an \nissue of great importance to my district and, quite frankly, to every \nMember of Congress: transportation infrastructure.\n  Last week our Nation endured a terrible tragedy as Amtrak Northeast \nRegional train 188 derailed in Philadelphia on its way to Trenton en \nroute to New York. That accident killed eight Americans, including one \nof my constituents, injured more than 200, and disrupted service on the \nbusiest rail corridor in the Nation for nearly a week.\n  In the days since the accident, investigators have indicated that \nhigh speeds may have played a significant role in the derailment, \nspeeds that were more than double the limit in that stretch of the \ntrack. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have used those \ndetails to deflect attention away from discussing our Nation's \ninvestments, or the lack thereof, in rail and all of our other surface \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  Mr. Speaker, burying our heads in the sand and waiting until an \naccident indisputably caused by lack of funding or maintenance to \ndiscuss that funding is dangerous, irresponsible, and, frankly, \nunacceptable: dangerous because millions of Americans every day are \ndriving across dilapidated bridges, riding on outdated trains, and \nstuck in endless traffic when traveling to work, to school, and medical \ncare; irresponsible because news coverage and the looming highway trust \nfund depletion have made transportation infrastructure a national \nfocus; unacceptable because transportation infrastructure has \ntraditionally been a bipartisan issue that affects how every single one \nof our constituents gets where they need to go. Still we stand here \ntoday waiting for the House majority to bring forth a good-faith, \ncomprehensive surface transportation reauthorization that makes \ninvestments to give us the transportation system--rail, car, air, and \nsea--that we need.\n  Transportation infrastructure is critical for the businesses and \nemployers in our district that ship goods to consumers across the \nglobe. Transportation infrastructure creates good-paying jobs here, \njobs that can't be outsourced, and jobs that will actually\n\n[[Page H3497]]\n\ngive working Americans a chance to climb into the middle class and \nbeyond.\n  But like I mentioned earlier, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle would rather have us wait until an accident that we can attribute \nto infrastructure decay to invest in our roads, our bridges, and our \nrailways. In fact, a Los Angeles Times report recently noted that the \nlast time Congress significantly increased Amtrak funding was 2008, \nfollowing the 2008 Union Pacific-Metrolink crash in California that \nkilled 25 people.\n  This year, the day following the Philadelphia crash, my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle voted to cut Amtrak funding by one-fifth. \nThat is wrong; it is just plain wrong. It is insane, and it is out of \ntouch.\n  Earlier this year, my Congressional Progressive Caucus colleagues and \nI introduced the People's Budget, a budget that would fix our economy \nso that it will once again provide opportunity for everyday working \nclass Americans. A key provision in the People's Budget was an \ninvestment of $820 billion to close our Nation's infrastructure gap, \nfunded by raising the gas tax by just 15 cents for the first time in \nmore than two decades so that we can maintain and improve our Nation's \ninfrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, instead of the People's Budget, Congress passed a far \nmore dangerous Republican budget; and unfortunately, our infrastructure \ncontinues to crumble. Our roads are frequently congested, limiting \nproductivity for millions of American workers; our airports appear run \ndown compared to their competitors in Europe and Asia; and rail speeds \naround the world have long eclipsed even Amtrak's fastest trains.\n  Our bridges continue to deteriorate and present real safety hazards, \nand our ports are in terrible disrepair, having negative economic \nimpact. In fact, a report last week in The New York Times noted that \nwhile the train that derailed was traveling well above the speed limit, \nat 106 miles per hour, its speed was about half of the average speed of \na French train from Paris to Marseille.\n  Federal and State investments in infrastructure have plunged in \nrecent years, even as economists have repeated over and over and over \nagain that infrastructure spending would bring massive economic \nbenefits and overhaul our transportation networks. This has to change \nbefore it is too late, Mr. Speaker.\n  The Congressional Progressive Caucus is here on the floor today to \nimplore our colleagues to put transportation spending front and center. \nI know that the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) agrees with me. I \nwant to thank her for her leadership as a member of the House Committee \non Transportation and Infrastructure.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), who shares our \npassion about the importance of funding a comprehensive transportation \nbill.\n  Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, for well over a decade we have failed to adequately \ninvest in transportation infrastructure. According to DOT, there is an \n$808 billion backlog of investment needs on highways and bridges, \nincluding $480 billion in critical repair work. Public transit has an \n$86 billion backlog of critical maintenance and repair needs, which \nincreases by $2.5 billion each year as bus and rail infrastructure \nages.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers has given U.S. infrastructure \nan overall grade of D-minus because 54 percent of our major roads are \nrated poor or mediocre. One out of every four bridges in the United \nStates, or 147,000 bridges, is structurally deficient or functionally \nobsolete, and 45 percent of Americans do not have access to transit.\n  Federal land management agencies need over $11 billion to address \ndeferred maintenance needs on our roads and bridges. The Federal \nHighway Administration estimates that the cost of upgrading and \nrepairing our deteriorating bridges is over $106 billion. An investment \nof $20 billion annually by all levels of government is needed through \n2030 to draw down the backlog.\n  Bringing existing transit assets just up to a state of good repair \nwill require an annualized investment level of $18.5 billion through \nthe year 2030, an amount far in excess of current funding levels. An \nadditional $4.3 billion over current spending levels from all levels of \ngovernment is needed annually to eliminate the current backlog by 2030.\n  To accommodate future transit ridership growth and preserve transit \nsystems, as much as $24.5 billion per year would need to be invested \ncompared to only $14.2 billion currently invested, a gap of $10 billion \na year.\n  The cost to our economy of not meeting our infrastructure needs is \ngreat. According to the 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers \nreport, 42 percent of America's major urban highways remain congested. \nCongestion costs commuters $121 billion a year in wasted time and fuel, \nor an average of $818 per commuter. I would guarantee you each commuter \nwould rather spend the equivalent amount in taxes than waste that money \nsitting on a clogged highway.\n  In 2011, congestion caused urban Americans to travel 5.5 billion \nhours more and to purchase an extra 2.9 billion gallons of unnecessary \nfuel. Without existing transit services in place in 2011, travelers \nwould have suffered an additional 865 million hours of delays and \nconsumed 450 million more gallons of fuel.\n  Despite the condition of our infrastructure system caused by years of \nunderinvestment, we are spending way too little today on roads, \nbridges, transit, and rail. The highway trust fund currently collects \nabout $35 billion per year for the highway account and $5 billion for \nthe transit account. According to CBO, the highway trust fund faces a \nshortfall of about $170 billion over the next 10 years. By 2020, the \nhighway trust fund's purchasing power will have dropped by nearly half \nsince 1990 because of inflation at a time when the country's population \nwill have increased 30 percent.\n  We currently spend about $50 billion a year on highways and transit, \nand most of the recent fights over revenue for the transportation bill \nhave been merely to fill the gap to maintain current funding levels. \nThe discussion should be much broader. It should be about how we can \nfund the program at a higher level to eliminate the backlog, increase \ncapacity, meet a state of good repair, and eliminate the congestion in \nthis country.\n  Today, this country spends about 1.7 percent of GDP of the entire \neconomy on infrastructure. We used to spend almost 4 percent on \ninfrastructure. Europe is spending 4 to 5 percent, and China is \nspending 9 percent. Who do you think, 30 years from now, is going to \nhave a competitive economic system which depends on adequate up-to-date \ncompetitive transportation infrastructure and broadband?\n  In particular, for example, we have been underinvesting in our rail \ninfrastructure as well. The passenger rail system needs at least $52 \nbillion, or $2.5 billion per year for 20 years, just to meet ridership \ndemands such as capacity improvements, such as tunnels to New York and \nto bring the system into a state of good repair. Of that amount, $21 \nbillion is necessary for the backlog of projects on the Northeast \ncorridor.\n  The Northeast corridor serves 51 million people and is the major \ncorridor for Amtrak in the country. The $21 billion for the backlog of \nprojects includes $13.8 billion in major infrastructure project backlog \nand $7.2 billion in basic infrastructure backlog.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Some of these major project needs include $1.5 billion to replace the \nBaltimore and Potomac Tunnel, which dates back to 1873; $950 million to \nreplace the Gunpowder and Bush River Bridges; $850 million to replace \nthe Susquehanna River Bridge; $350 million to replace the Highline \nBridge and add a fourth track between Newark and New York; $750 million \nto replace the Portal Bridge, which can stop the entire Northeast \ncorridor if it should fail; $1 billion for catenary, communication, and \nsignal upgrades and bridge replacements near New Haven; $2.8 billion in \nupgrades to other movable bridges; $1.8 billion in additional catenary \nupgrades from Washington, D.C., to New York.\n  All this is basic backlog, just to make sure that the current system \ncontinues to operate and doesn't fail. Additional funding over and \nabove the $21 billion backlog, for a total of $64\n\n[[Page H3498]]\n\nbillion, is needed for service improvements and projected increases in \ncapacity on the Northeast corridor; yet Amtrak gets just $1.4 billion \nin the annual appropriations bill--or less than 2 percent of Federal \ntransportation funding.\n  The Appropriations Committee recommended the other day that this be \nreduced to $1.1 billion, with a $64 billion backlog.\n  The fiscal year 2016 transportation appropriations bill, just marked \nup in committee the day after the accident north of Philadelphia, cuts \ncapital funding for Amtrak by $290 million, providing only $1.1 billion \nin FY 2016, $1 billion below the President's request.\n  The President's request for this year's budget includes $5 billion \nfor rail. Half of that is for Amtrak, to bring the system to a state of \ngood repair, including $550 billion for the Northeast corridor.\n  As we await the results of the full investigation, the tragedy of \nAmtrak train 188 shows the importance of a reliable rail system to the \nNortheast region of this country. We cannot continue the decades of \nneglect that have left our system desperately underfunded and resulted \nin a multibillion-dollar backlog to bring the system to a state of good \nrepair.\n  It should not require a tragedy to spur action to address the glaring \ndeficiencies in our transportation and infrastructure network. We \nshould act before accidents occur.\n  Rail safety is not a luxury; it is of fundamental importance to our \ncitizens and our economy. Thousands of businesses and commuters in the \nNortheast depend on the rail for commerce and transportation every day. \nCongress must finally provide the resources necessary for ensuring the \nsafety and reliability of our transportation and infrastructure system.\n  While this Congress has failed to make transportation funding a \npriority, the administration has taken the lead and proposed a long-\nterm surface transportation reauthorization bill.\n  The GROW AMERICA Act provides a total of $478 billion over 6 years, a \n45 percent increase for highways, bridges, public transportation, \nhighway safety, and rail programs. It provides $317 billion for \nprograms under the Federal Highway Administration, an increase of 29 \npercent over current levels. It allocates $18 billion for a new \ndedicated multimodal freight system. How is our economy supposed to \noperate without an efficient freight transportation system?\n  It provides $115 billion for programs under the Federal Transit \nAdministration, an increase of 76 percent over current levels, and \nsignificantly boosts New Starts funding.\n  It provides $28 billion for programs under the Federal Railroad \nAdministration, $6 billion for vehicle safety programs under the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, $4.7 billion for truck \nand bus safety programs, and $16 billion for the Highway Safety \nImprovement Program.\n  It provides $7.5 for TIGER grants and $6 billion for TIFIA that could \nsupport $60 billion in loans. It provides $3.5 billion to leverage \nresearch and innovation to move people.\n  Several of the members of the Transportation Committee just \nintroduced the GROW AMERICA Act in the House. Not all of us agree with \neverything in that bill.\n  For example, the Transportation Committee's Special Panel on Freight, \nwhich I was the ranking Democrat on, made several unanimous bipartisan \nrecommendations, including providing dedicated guaranteed funding for \nprojects of national and regional significance. Reauthorizing this \nprogram is a top priority for many of us on the committee and should be \nincluded in any final bill.\n  It is important to start moving a long-term bill, where we can have \nan opportunity to shape these policy provisions, and the GROW AMERICA \nAct would serve as a good starting point.\n  The last surface transportation bill, MAP-21, expired last fall. The \nPresident first proposed the GROW AMERICA Act last spring to provide an \nalternative for MAP-21 before it expired.\n  Unfortunately, we failed to reauthorize MAP-21 on time and passed an \nextension until the end of this month, to give us more time to work on \na long-term bill. We just passed another 2-month extension, the 33rd \nextension, to take us to the end of July.\n  We have known for months that this day was coming; yet we have made \nno progress in finding a solution to funding highways, transit, and \nother important surface transportation programs.\n  MAP-21 itself was only a 2-year bill, breaking the tradition of \nCongress passing 5- or 6-year bills to provide the reliable funding \nnecessary to complete long-term capital plans and projects that require \na commitment beyond 1 fiscal year.\n  The last time we passed a long-term bill was 10 years ago, in 2005, \nin SAFETEA-LU. That bill was underfunded because of a resistance to \nraising the gasoline tax and identifying new revenue sources.\n  House and Senate leadership couldn't come up with the additional $60 \nbillion needed to fill the gap in the highway trust fund just to do a \nlong-term bill at current levels, but this week, they put on the floor \na tax extender that will cost $182 billion over 10 years, completely \nunpaid for.\n  The priorities of this Congress are completely out of whack. Our \ninfrastructure is crumbling around us, and the majority continues to \nspend hundreds of billions of dollars on tax cuts for corporations and \nthe wealthy, while leaving transportation funding to wither on the \nvine.\n  I am concerned we will be back here in July having this same \nconversation. We must demand now that this Congress spend the next 2 \nmonths, once and for all, making transportation funding a priority.\n  We must realize that what we have based our transportation program on \nsince 1955, the gasoline tax, is a wasting asset. It is down 30 percent \nsince 1993 because of inflation, and every year, we use fewer gallons \nbecause of an intelligent policy of energy conservation, of higher \nmileage per gallon; but that means fewer gallons of gasoline. We must \neither raise the gasoline tax or bring in a new source of revenue or \nboth.\n  Finally, let me say that interest rates are at negative rates now. \nWhen interest rates are at negative rates, when you can borrow money \nand pay it back more cheaply, that is the time to borrow money to \ninvest so that our children inherit not a great debt, but inherit an \nefficiently functioning economy and an investment in the country that \nmakes the economy function.\n\n  We have always known this. The Republican Party and their precursor, \nthe Whigs, have always known this. They were the party in the 19th \ncentury of the American systems. What was the American system? Henry \nClay's system to invest public funds in internal improvements in roads \nand canals and bridges and railroads, rather than the European system \nof letting the private sector do it.\n  Abraham Lincoln continued that tradition with the transcontinental \nrailroad at a time of civil war, and Dwight Eisenhower did the \nInterstate Highway System, which we are still living with. These were \nRepublican Party projects. I only wish the Republican Party wasn't \ncompletely turning its back on its own heritage.\n  We have, for the last century, a bipartisan heritage of funding our \ninfrastructure so that the country can grow and the economy can \nprosper, but the Republican Party seems to have turned this back on \nthis. I urge you to reconsider.\n  Stop turning your back. Join us in the Democratic Party in continuing \nour tradition of making this an economy that can function for all our \npeople, where people can move and not waste their time sitting in \ntraffic jams, where goods can move and the economy can function, \nbusinesses can flourish. That is what is at stake.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Nadler, first of all, I want to thank you \nfor your comprehensive information about transportation infrastructure.\n  In my home State of Florida, we bring many visitors to Florida \nthrough Amtrak through the Auto Train. We have colleagues on the other \nside that want to privatize that system, and I want to know how that \nwill affect New York, privatizing that Northeast corridor.\n  Mr. NADLER. Well, you have to remember the reason why Amtrak was \ncreated in the first place. We didn't have public railroads in the 19th \ncentury. We didn't have public railroads in\n\n[[Page H3499]]\n\nthe first half of the 20th century, but by 1960 and 1970, many of the \nfreight railroads were going bankrupt, and certainly, the passenger \nlines could no longer pay for themselves. They were all going bankrupt.\n  Congress faced the reality in 1970 that if it didn't create something \ncalled Amtrak--it was named Amtrak--but something as a public \ncorporation or publicly funded corporation, there would be no passenger \nrail in the United States.\n  The States did the same thing. What became various commuter rail \nagencies, like MTA in New York or SEPTA in Philadelphia and others, \nwere created out of the bankrupt passenger operations of the private \nrail lines. No one could make money at it.\n  Amtrak has survived and has flourished in the sense of attracting \nmore and more passengers, and it now has 77 percent of the market \nagainst the airlines in the Northeast corridor; and, thank God, it \nsaves energy and time and congestion, despite the fact that it has been \ngrossly underfunded by Congress.\n  The only section of Amtrak that makes money is the Northeast corridor \nfrom Washington to Boston. It subsidizes everything else. There would \nbe no rail lines outside the Northeast corridor--not to Florida, not to \nChicago, not to Denver, not to any place outside the Washington to \nBoston corridor--if they had to pay for themselves.\n  We, the Northeast corridor, subsidize the rest of Amtrak. From my \npoint of view as a New Yorker, I would rather that weren't the case; \nbut I am an American. I think everybody ought to have the ability to \ntravel and the ability to have an economy that functions, and so we \ncross-subsidize.\n  It would be better if Congress put money in and other sections of the \ncountry could become self-sustaining in rail, but the fact is the \nhistory is that is very difficult.\n  I am not aware of any rail system or public transit system in the \nworld that isn't publicly subsidized. We subsidize every transportation \nsystem in this country. We subsidize the highway; we subsidize the \nairlines with the air traffic control, and we do it because we know the \ncountry has to move.\n  If we want an economy that generates goods and services for people, \nit has to move. Freight has to move. It has to move by rail. It has to \nmove by barge, by boat. We have to invest in it.\n  If Amtrak stops funding the line to Florida, that line wouldn't exist \nanymore; everything would be on the road. The roads would be more \ncongested; people would waste more time. The one exception to that \nright now is the Northeast corridor. We are willing, because we are \nAmericans, to participate in a national system, and the rest of the \ncountry should be willing, too.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Nadler, when I travel to different \ncountries, they always ask us about our freight rail. We are the \ncaboose when it comes to funding Amtrak, and we started the rail \nsystem, and they don't use cabooses any more.\n  I don't understand why it is that we, as Members of Congress, don't \nunderstand the importance of having a safe, efficient transportation \nsystem. Rail has to be a part of it.\n  When I think about Katrina and I think about over 3,000 people died \nbecause they couldn't move out of harm's way, that is a reason why we \nneed a comprehensive transportation system in this country.\n  Our competition in Florida is not Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi--\nnothing personal to the people here from Georgia. We are competing with \npeople from other countries, and we must develop an efficient rail \nsystem in conjunction with all of our other transportation needs\n  Mr. NADLER. You are obviously completely right, and that is why I \nquoted the figures I did earlier in my remarks.\n  Prior to 1980, roughly, we used to spend about 4, 4\\1/2\\ percent of \nGDP on infrastructure. Now, we are spending 1.7 percent of GDP on \ninfrastructure. Of course, we are underinvesting, and our \ninfrastructure is decaying. By infrastructure, I mean roads, highway, \nbridges, rail, airports, broadband--you name it.\n  China is spending 9 percent of GDP on infrastructure. We are \ncompeting with China. We are competing with other countries. If they \ncan move goods and people more efficiently, that means their economy is \ngoing to be more efficient; their economy is going to be more \ncompetitive; they are going to be able to sell things more cheaply, \ngenerate things more cheaply, and outsell us.\n  We have to compete in a world economy. We can't be insulated. If we \nare going to compete in a world economy and have an economy that can \ngenerate the jobs, we can only compete if we have a transportation \nsystem. We also need an efficient energy system and other things, too, \nbut an efficient transportation system. We are eating our seed corn. We \nbenefited from prior generations' investment, and now, we are not doing \nthat investment.\n  I hear rhetoric on this floor all the time that we shouldn't leave a \ndebt. We have to have a balanced budget, and we shouldn't leave a debt \nto our children.\n  Frankly, I would rather leave a debt to our children if we use that \ndebt to build up the investments in this country so that there are \nroads for our children to travel on, rails to ride on, airports to land \nin, schools to attend. That is an investment.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  We have to make a distinction. It is one thing to waste money or \nspend it on something ephemeral. But to invest it so that our children \ninherit a country with a functioning economy and with assets that we \ngive them that they can use to make a more functioning economy, that is \nworth it.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. I thank the gentleman for his contribution.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Watson Coleman, and Members of the House, \nit amazes me that the House practices what I call ``Reverse Robin \nHood.'' In other words, robbing from transportation to give tax breaks \nto their friends.\n  Recently, they passed close to $300 billion for tax breaks. But, yet, \nwe can't pass a comprehensive transportation bill that will put people \nto work.\n  Yesterday, in the House, we passed another extension of surface \ntransportation programs, once again, failing in our duties to provide a \nworld-class transportation system for our country.\n  Transportation programs are much too critical to our economy to be \ndelayed any longer. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in \nWashington continue its long-running failure to fund surface \ntransportation infrastructure programs.\n  While our international competition is investing heavily in \ntransportation and infrastructure to move people, goods, and services, \nthe leadership of this House is passing tax cuts for their wealthy \ncontributors, while Congress sticks their heads in the sand and passed \nanother continuing resolution.\n  Just a few weeks ago, House Republicans passed a bill cutting taxes \nby $269 billion for the richest 1 percent of Americans, with no \noffsets. But we have failed to pass a real transportation \nreauthorization bill since 2005 because they can't find the money.\n  Clearly, this Nation's transportation infrastructure is not a \npriority for the Republican leadership in this House.\n  Transportation infrastructure funding is absolutely critical to this \nNation and, if properly funded, serves as a tremendous economic boost \nand job creator. In fact, the Department of Transportation statistics \nshow that for every billion dollars that we invest in transportation \ninfrastructure, it creates 44,000 permanent jobs, along with $6.2 \nbillion in economic activity.\n  Mr. Speaker, the traveling public is pleading with you to make \ntransportation infrastructure a priority. When this happens, we can put \nmillions of hard-working Americans back to work fixing our Nation's \ncrumbling infrastructure, and preparing our country for the future.\n  In the words of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx: ``All of us \nhave a role to play in shaping our Nation's infrastructure.''\n  And as we saw during the last tragic train derailment in \nPhiladelphia, Congress urgently needs to increase funding for our \nNation's passenger rail systems to make them safe for the traveling \npublic and prevent future tragedies on our Nation's rail system.\n  Madam Coleman, I understand that the gentleman from New Jersey wants \nto join us. And as he joins us, I would like for him to answer that \nquestion, as he makes his remarks, How would prioritizing Amtrak affect \nNew Jersey?\n\n[[Page H3500]]\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Before the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) \nbegins, I really think I want to share something that I think is very \ngermane to where the gentleman may be going.\n  Both of us live on and travel the Northeast corridor on the train \nback and forth to New Jersey, and we depend upon an efficient and a \nsafe train ride to get us back to our homes and to get us back down \nhere to do the people's business.\n  I did mention that I lost a constituent because that train was on its \nway to Trenton, and it was letting off people in my district, and that \ntrain would have ultimately gone on up to Newark and then on to New \nYork.\n  I know that the Congressman has been tremendously impacted by the \ntragedy that took place, and knowing how important it is for us to be \nable to move back and forth efficiently, effectively, and safely in the \nNortheast corridor. And I just wanted to sort of preface the \nintroduction of your coming to the microphone with sort of remembering \nthat this is really close to home for you and me.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne.)\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida and the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey for affording me this opportunity to \ndiscuss a tragedy, as the gentlewoman from New Jersey stated, that has \nhit very close to home.\n  And the reason I say that is, as stated by the gentlewoman from New \nJersey, the Northeast corridor is the way we are able to travel back \nand forth from our home to Washington, D.C., to do the people's \nbusiness. And so it is not uncommon that I could have been on train \n188. I have taken it on numerous occasions.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this horrific Amtrak \ntrain derailment and their families at this difficult time.\n  I am grateful for the first responders who put themselves in harm's \nway to rescue passengers, and I wish all those injured a full and \nspeedy recovery.\n  This tragedy, as we stated, has hit so close to home. Sometimes \nweekly, I travel, as do many of my constituents and colleagues, on this \nrail line. I have taken Amtrak's 188 and had my wife and children on \nthat specific train leaving here going back home.\n  As a Member of Congress, we have a responsibility to ensure and \nenhance the public safety.\n  The derailment of Amtrak train 188 serves as an important reminder \nthat if we are to meet this responsibility, we need to invest in our \ninfrastructure.\n  There is no doubt that our Nation's infrastructure is crumbling. The \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers has rated it as a D-plus\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I know all of us find education important. If you \nwere given a D-plus on the work that you do, on the quality of your \nservice, what would that say?\n  There is no doubt that we are falling behind other nations in the \nquality of our infrastructure. Long-term investments in our Nation's \ninfrastructure are essential for achieving economic growth and \ncompetitiveness throughout the world.\n  Yet, Republicans refuse to address this very real crisis. This only \ncompounds the problem, costing American jobs and undermining our \neconomy.\n  We don't need shortsighted thinking. We need to stay competitive, \nboost commerce, invest in economic growth and job creation, and protect \nour communities. These are the benefits of modernizing our Nation's \ninfrastructure.\n  One day after the derailment of Amtrak train 188, my Republican \ncolleagues voted to cut Amtrak funding. While the Amtrak investigation \nremains ongoing, we know that slashing funding will hamper safety \nimprovements and upgrades.\n  We shouldn't stand in the way of this wise infrastructure investment. \nLet's commit to ensuring modern, safe, and reliable infrastructure that \nreflects the greatness of this Nation.\n  And as I go to my seat, I just want to, once again, thank the \ngentlewomen from Florida and New Jersey respectively for giving me the \nopportunity to have several moments to discuss what is an issue that \nimpacts the safety, the productiveness, the competitiveness of our \nNation and our infrastructure.\n\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit more \nabout Amtrak, because I am the past chair and ranking member of the \nRailroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee, and I think \nAmtrak is more and more important.\n  As more Americans are turning to rail as their preferred mode of \ntransportation, Amtrak is building the infrastructure and organization \nto meet that demand.\n  Amtrak carried a record total of 31.6 million passengers in 2013. \nTheir ridership has been growing across the system for over a decade, \nwith last year's ridership being the largest in the history.\n  Currently, they serve more than 500 destinations in 46 States and \nprovide the only public transportation option for millions of people in \nrural areas.\n  Let me repeat. Amtrak is the only mode of transportation for people \nin certain rural areas.\n  Amtrak has increased their revenue, reduced debt, has new passengers, \nimproved their infrastructure, and purchased trains that are built 100 \npercent in America. That is where those parts are made, 100 percent in \nAmerica.\n  Amtrak reduces congestion and improves our energy independence and \nplays a vital role in emergency preparation.\n  And I often talk about 9/11. Amtrak was moving. It was the only way \npeople could move in this country. And Katrina.\n  So Amtrak plays a very important part in making sure that we can \ncontinue to move people, goods and services.\n  Madam, I want to thank you for your leadership in this area.\n\n\n                           This Is Our Watch\n\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Before you close out, I want to mention \nsomething about veterans because we are getting ready to have a recess, \nand I have to thank all of the veterans for their service.\n  This morning at 9 a.m. we went over to the Women's Memorial Wall. And \nit is what we have done for 18 years to honor women veterans who have \nserved in this country.\n  I want to thank all who have served America. We have the freedoms \nbecause of their service. I want to, once again, thank them.\n  But I must mention the fact that on the 24th of this month, if the \nHouse does not move, the project in Denver will shut down, and it will \ncost over $20 million to shut down. In addition, it will be $2 million \na month. We are talking about the VA facility in Denver, Colorado.\n  Now, we want to blame the VA, but this is our watch. The Denver \nhospital has been a political hot potato for over 10 years; different \nsecretaries, different administrations.\n  But the point is, this is our watch, and it is unacceptable that we \nshut down this project.\n  One of the slogans of the Army is, ``Failure is not an option.'' We \nneed to get it done.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  We appreciate the service that the men and women have provided for \nour freedom, but we need to do our part in making sure that we take \ncare of them.\n  I want to paraphrase the comments of the first President of the \nUnited States, George Washington. He said, No matter how justified we \nthink a war may be, what is important is how we treat the veterans.\n  Now, this is our watch. This is our responsibility. And we have to \nmake sure that we take care of the veterans.\n  With that, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for her \nleadership and for providing this opportunity to discuss transportation \ninfrastructure, Amtrak, and also to thank the veterans for their \nservice.\n  A lot of us talk the talk, but we need to walk the walk and roll the \nroll for the veterans.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for \neverything that she has brought before us this evening. I thank my \ncolleagues for raising the issues regarding the significance, the \nimportance of, and the economic benefits, as well as the safety and \nsecurity needs, of an efficient, effective, and safe transportation \nsystem.\n  I want to also thank the gentlewoman for reminding us that we are \nhaving our Memorial Day holiday, and it gives us an opportunity to \nthank those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep us safe and to \nkeep the freedoms that we hold so dear.\n\n[[Page H3501]]\n\n  And at the end of this, Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity \nto simply remind us that the transportation needs of our community both \nrepresent safety and security that we hold very sacred in our \ncommunities, but it also provides an economic benefit that we all can \nbenefit from. Irrespective of Republican or Democrat, rural, urban, or \nsuburban, there is a benefit to a transportation system that moves \npeople, goods, and supplies where they are needed.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, \nCongresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman and Congresswoman Corrine Brown for \norganizing this Congressional Progressive Caucus Special Order Hour on \nTransportation Infrastructure Spending.\n  Last night, the House passed H.R. 2353 to extend the federal surface \ntransportation programs for two months, through July 31st. If these \nprograms had been allowed to expire, all federal transportation funding \nto states and local governments would have stopped on May 31st, and \nnumerous constructions jobs on highways, bridges and transit systems \ncould have been cancelled. According to the American Association of \nState Highway and Transportation Officials, this needless crisis \nbrought uncertainty to 6,000 critical construction projects across the \ncountry, and left 660,000 good-paying construction jobs hanging in the \nbalance.\n  I voted for this bill, but I did so reluctantly because what we \nreally need is a multi-year transportation bill that will bring our \nnation's transportation system into the 21st century. A multi-year \ntransportation bill with robust funding for highway, bridge and transit \nconstruction will create thousands of good jobs and provide certainty \nto states and local governments.\n  Federal investment in our nation's transportation system is \nessential. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the public \ninfrastructure of the United States a grade of ``D+'' in 2013 and \nestimated that we will need to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020 in order to \nimprove the condition of our infrastructure.\n  Rebuilding our nation's transportation infrastructure creates jobs \nthat are desperately needed throughout the country. The economy is \nstill struggling to recover from the recession. The unemployment rate \nis 5.4 percent nationwide and is significantly higher in some minority \nand disadvantaged communities. Transportation funding is clearly good \nfor the economy.\n  Congressional Republicans have had months to prepare a multi-year \ntransportation bill. Unfortunately, all they did last night is punt the \ndeadline two months deeper into the critical summer construction \nseason. I urge my Republican colleagues to work with us over the next \ntwo months so we can finally pass a multi-year transportation bill \nbefore the July 31st deadline.\n  Congressional Republicans are further jeopardizing our nation's \ntransportation system by slashing funding for TIGER. TIGER--formally \nknown as Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery--is a \nnationwide competitive grant program that creates jobs by funding \ninvestments in transportation infrastructure by states, local \ngovernments, and transit agencies. TIGER funds innovative projects that \ngenerate economic development and improve access to safe, reliable, and \naffordable transportation alternatives.\n  Earlier this year, the President requested $1.25 billion for TIGER in \nfiscal year 2016, as part of an expanded TIGER program that would \nprovide $7.5 billion for TIGER over 6 years. This expanded TIGER \nprogram will create jobs, encourage innovation, and modernize \ntransportation infrastructure for the 21st century.\n  I sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee urging full funding \nof the President's $1.25 billion request for TIGER in FY 2016, and a \ntotal of 146 Members of Congress signed my letter.\n  Nevertheless, the House Republicans' version of the FY 2016 \nTransportation and Housing Appropriations (THUD) bill provides only \n$100 million for TIGER. That's an 80 percent cut from FY 2015 and a \nsmall fraction of the President's request. This kind of drastic cut in \nTIGER will needlessly cripple highway and transit construction plans \nthat are already struggling due to the uncertainty surrounding the \nfuture of the transportation bill.\n  We need more federal investment in transportation infrastructure, and \nwe need it now! That is why I am introducing the TIGER Grants for Job \nCreation Act. This bill will provide an emergency supplemental \nappropriation totaling $7.5 billion dollars over the next six years for \njob creation through investments in transportation infrastructure. This \nemergency supplemental appropriation will fully fund the President's \nproposal for an expanded TIGER.\n  Passage of an emergency supplemental appropriation will provide \nfunding for TIGER free from sequestration and without reducing funding \nfor other important domestic priorities. It will also allow states, \nlocal governments, and transit agencies to begin immediately to plan \nprojects and prepare grant applications. Thus, it will ensure an \nefficient use of funds and timely job creation.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the TIGER Grants for Job \nCreation Act and fully fund the President's request for TIGER, and I \nurge my colleagues to pass a multi-year transportation bill to bring \nour highways, bridges and public transit systems into the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3501-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. JODY B.

The \npurpose of this Special Order is to talk about how the relationship \nbetween police and local communities can be repaired.\n  Over the last year, we have witnessed tensions rise between local law \nenforcement officers and local communities. The events we have \nwitnessed across the country have highlighted the need for mending the \nstrained relationships between police and communities across the \ncountry.\n  This week, the Judiciary Committee in the House held a hearing \nentitled, Policing Strategies for the 21st Century. The purpose of this \nhearing was to look at how law enforcement is trained and how it is \nreceived in our communities across the country.\n  The Senate also held a hearing this week. Their focus was on the use \nof body cameras.\n  I applaud my colleagues for holding hearings on criminal justice \nreform this week, but I hope that this is just the beginning and not \nthe end of the hearings that need to be held on so many different and \nvery important and fundamental issues on the topic of\n\n[[Page H3502]]\n\ncriminal justice reform. All of these issues scream out for public \nattention and for new solutions by this Congress.\n  There are many conversations that need to be had about the best ways \nto improve policing practices, including ways to curb the use of \nexcessive force, the use of body cameras, and mental health evaluations \nfor law enforcement. The list goes on and on.\n  I would like to start out by talking about three of my bills: the \nGrand Jury Reform Act, the Police Accountability Act, and the Stop \nMilitarizing Law Enforcement Act.\n  Police militarization is an important subject that President Obama \neven weighed in on yesterday with the issuance of an executive order \nthat incorporates my Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act. Both my \nbill and the President's executive order call for a ban on the transfer \nof certain surplus military-grade weaponry and both impose strict \noversight and transparency measures to ensure that the equipment that \nis transferred is used properly.\n  President Obama's Law Enforcement Equipment Working Group called for \nlaw enforcement agencies to ``embrace a guardian--rather than a \nwarrior--mindset'' to build trust and legitimacy both within agencies \nand with the public.\n  This statement is at the very core of what we need to change in our \ncountry. Military-grade weapons are made for one purpose, and that is \nto conduct war.\n  When we see tanks and grenade launchers and this type of equipment \nbeing used by police, it enforces a message that we are at war in the \nstreets of our very own country, the same way that we are at war in the \nstreets of other countries. This has to change because our streets are \nnot war zones, and we should not allow the unbridled proliferation of \nmilitary weaponry onto our streets.\n  When we allow our streets to be flooded with surplus weaponry from \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we set the stage for a military \nmindset to take hold throughout the law enforcement community. We \nshould not allow things to get twisted. There is a big difference \nbetween the law enforcement mentality and the military mindset.\n  The creed of an Army soldier is to ``deploy, engage, and destroy the \nenemies of the United States of America in close combat.''\n  Conversely, the classic police motto is ``to protect and serve.''\n  So when we start flooding our streets with military-grade weaponry, \nwe start to allow the creeping in of a different mindset. And when we \nfactor in the fact that many of our law enforcement officers have \nactually had to be deployed to war zones during the last 12 or 13 years \nbecause the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been fought by a \nvolunteer Army, with a healthy dose of deployment of Reserve and \nNational Guard units to the battle--when we consider that, we consider \nthe fact that many law enforcement officers are also reservists or \nNational Guardsmen or -women, and they have been deployed to war zones. \nThen they come back to their jobs in the Nation, and sometimes they \ncould get it twisted in terms of what their actual goal and mission \nshould be.\n  On the streets of America, the mission is not to deploy and to engage \nthe enemy and destroy the enemy in close combat. That is not what law \nenforcement officers should be about. And we don't need to let that \nmindset creep into law enforcement.\n  When you have the experience and when you have the equipment and when \nyou have inherent biases and prejudices that exist in the mindset of \nall Americans, regardless of whether or not it is law enforcement or \ncivilian, then you get a situation where your minority communities can \nthen be at severe risk. And that, I am afraid, is what has occurred in \nthis country because so many of our young people have lost confidence \nin our police departments and in our law enforcement community. And \nthat, ladies and gentlemen, is definitely unhealthy. It is not good for \nour democracy. We need to try to do something to change it. And we \ncan't make effective changes without understanding the problem.\n  Now some would say that we need a military solution on the streets of \nAmerica because the streets have become so lawless, but I would beg to \ndiffer. I would beg to differ strongly, as a matter of fact. We are \ndealing with citizens who still need to be protected.\n  By the way, most people in America are law-abiding citizens. There \nare some who become criminals, who stray and commit criminal acts. \nSometimes those criminal acts actually place people's lives at risk. \nAnd police and law enforcement are there to make sure that we keep \npeople safe.\n  All people want to be safe and secure in their homes and walking down \nthe streets and in doing their business, in their life, work, and play \npursuits. All of us want to be safe, and all of us realize that we must \nhave law enforcement enforce the laws. All of us should have a \nresponsibility to each other to stay within the boundaries of the law, \nand we are partners in that regard. We, the citizens, partner among \nourselves; and then we must partner with our law enforcement community \nto enable law enforcement to do the job that we need them to do.\n  So it is a relationship that is built on trust, and it is built on \ncommunication because law enforcement can only be as effective in \nenforcing the law as it is with respect to the relationships that it \nhas among people in the community.\n  That is why community-oriented policing is so important, to get \npolice officers involved in the communities within which they serve; \nfor them to get out of the car, go meet people, go develop \nrelationships, and start the flow of dialogue. The citizens are who \nenable law enforcement to be most effective because that is where they \nget most of their information.\n  I will admit that people don't communicate with law enforcement as \nmuch as they should, and it hurts us all. The reasons for that are this \nbreakdown in trust, which is exacerbated by the military equipment and \nby the military mindset, both of those going hand in hand.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  Now, how do we stop it?\n  First, by stopping the flow of that free military equipment onto our \nstreets. We must cap that. I am not here to say that law enforcement \nshould not have what it needs in order to do what it is supposed to do, \nand that is to protect and serve, but it should not have a pipeline \ndirectly between the Department of Defense and law enforcement which \nsupplies equipment to law enforcement, leaving out the civilian \nauthority to make the determination of whether or not the equipment is \nneeded.\n  So that is what the 1033 program does. That is what President Obama's \nexecutive order, which tracks the language of the Stop Militarizing Law \nEnforcement Act, does, and that is to stop that flow and return control \nof the process of acquisition of law enforcement equipment back to the \nhands of the civilian authority. So that is the first thing that we \nneed to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, the second thing we need to do is to ensure good \nanalysis of the personnel that we have doing the law enforcement, \nbecause as I said, if you have been to a war zone, the statistics show \nthat many of those who return from the battle suffer from post-\ntraumatic stress and other illnesses that affect the mental health of \nthe people. So we must take better care of the mental health of our law \nenforcement personnel, having been deployed or not. Being involved in \nlaw enforcement is very stressful, and sometimes that mental health can \nbreak down and people start making bad decisions. So we really must get \na handle on that in this country.\n  Then once we get a handle on the militarization, there are some \nstructural issues that need to be dealt with. One is the loss of \nconfidence in the criminal justice process, i.e., the grand jury, the \nsecret grand jury process as it relates to law enforcement officers, \nbecause what has become clear is that whenever there has been a killing \nof a civilian by law enforcement officer, it often results--or it most \noften results--in a finding of justifiable homicide. Indeed, most \nkillings by law enforcement are justifiable; there is no question about \nthat. But there is also no question about the fact that some of the \nkillings are unjustifiable. When they are unjustifiable, they need to \nbe dealt with in accordance with the law, which means prosecution.\n  The problem that we get with law enforcement officers who have acted \noutside of the law and have committed a\n\n[[Page H3503]]\n\nkilling, what we get is a finding that the killing was justified \ndespite the clear evidence to the contrary. I am not going to cite any \nspecific cases, but I will say that these cases are well-known to the \npublic. They appear on video. Even if your eyes deceive you and the \nkilling was justified, you are certainly justified in not having \nconfidence in the process by which the finding that the killing was \njustified was rendered through. Basically I am talking about a secret \ngrand jury process. That is why I filed the Grand Jury Reform Act, to \nget at this secret grand jury process and to bring transparency into \nthe process.\n  Now, what usually happens, or what is the course of conduct in a \npolice killing case, is that the killing itself will be investigated \nfirst, and oftentimes only by the very law enforcement agency that \nemployed the officer involved in the incident. So what you have are \nfriends and coworkers investigating each other.\n  So when that happens, it tends to not be impartial. It tends to be \nbiased in favor of the accused. What usually happens is, despite what \nmay be clear about the facts, the decision always comes down as a \njustifiable homicide by the law enforcement agency that is rendering \nthe decision against its own.\n  Then the case goes to the local grand jury or to the local \nprosecutor, who is well-known and knows well the law enforcement agents \ninvolved who may be the subject of the investigation. They know each \nother. They work together regularly to bring cases before the grand \njury.\n  So when an officer is brought before the grand jury, often that \nofficer is known to and by the district attorney. And even if not \nknown, the fact that they are law enforcement gives them an inherent \nbenefit; it gives them credibility; it gives them an edge, a positive \nedge, with the prosecution.\n  So the prosecutor then takes the investigation by the law enforcement \nagency that knows and loves the officer, takes that investigation \nbefore a grand jury in a secret proceeding. No one is in there from the \npublic to understand the quality of the evidence being presented, \nwhether or not there is any evidence being presented. We have to just \nsimply rely on the result that comes out of the grand jury proceeding \nbecause the grand jury proceedings are secret by law. Nothing that \nhappens inside can be revealed.\n  So it is a process that usually results in what we all are awaiting, \nand that is an exoneration of the police officer despite the clear \nevidence to the contrary. Once you have that determination, it is \na closed case. So when you have that happening repeatedly over and over \nagain over the course of time, it erodes public confidence in the \ncriminal justice process.\n\n  So my legislation, the Grand Jury Reform Act, would simply mandate \nthat whenever there is a killing during the course of a policeman's use \nof his or her authority in the line of work, in the line of duty, \nwhenever there is a killing, then there would have to be appointed an \nindependent law enforcement agency, the top law enforcement agency of \nthat particular State, to take over the investigation and to perform \nthe investigation. That would give it a little more sense of being \nimpartial.\n  Once that impartial investigation has concluded, then the matter \nwould be presented to a judge in open court by a special prosecutor \nappointed by the Governor, who would then be charged with presenting \nthat independent investigation to a judge in a probable cause hearing \nin open court. And that judge could then make a determination of \nwhether or not probable cause existed; and if it did or if it did not, \nthat judge would then issue a written finding of fact and deliver the \ncase back to the local prosecutor who would then, in accordance with \nexisting State law, proceed through the secret grand jury process or \nwhatever other process was available to that district attorney--who is \nelected by the people, by the way.\n  So this probable cause hearing would enable there to be some \ntransparency so that the public would understand, hear the evidence and \nsee the evidence. Then there would be accountability that would be \nestablished on behalf of the people based on what the elected \nprosecutor decided to do with the case.\n  So it is hard to hold a local prosecutor accountable after a secret \ngrand jury process, and the only thing you can rely upon is the earnest \npresentation in a press conference by the prosecutor that we did our \nbest, we presented the evidence, and the grand jury came back finding \nthat the killing was justified.\n  We need more than that. We saw that in the case of Michael Brown in \nFerguson where they did release the grand jury transcripts, and you \ncould see where the evidence, a boatload or a truckload, a dump truck \nof evidence was just dumped on the confused grand jury members who were \ncharged on a law that was not even applicable, given bad law upon which \nto decide the case.\n  So we saw what happened in the grand jury proceeding in that case, \nand that, ladies and gentlemen, is not the only time I am sure that \nthere has been abuse within the grand jury room. But we will never know \nbecause it is secret.\n  Lastly, I have filed a bill which is called the Police Accountability \nAct. What it would do would be to provide another tool for Federal \nprosecutors to be able to prosecute law enforcement officers for the \noffense of murder and all of the lesser included offenses should it \nappear that the process within the State did not work.\n  So those three bills I have discussed.\n  Now I see my colleague has arrived, Sheila Jackson Lee, who, out of \nHouston, Texas, has ascended to the top spot, the ranking membership on \nthe Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, upon which I also serve along \nwith her. So with that, I will yield to the gentlewoman from Houston.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the distinguished \ngentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has approximately \n4 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the distinguished gentleman from \nGeorgia.\n  He is right. We serve on the Judiciary Committee. He serves with \ngreat distinction as the ranking member on the Regulatory Reform, \nCommercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee, and I have the privilege of \nworking and serving with him on the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland \nSecurity, and Investigations Subcommittee.\n  Although we have been working on these issues for any number of \nyears, he is a practicing lawyer, a graduate of the distinguished \nThurgood Marshall School of Law, which I have the privilege of \nrepresenting. We know that we are now in a significant moment of \nhistory, and that is, if I might use language that is not particularly \nlegislative, we can't fool around.\n  There are issues that the American public, I believe, want remedies \nfor, and that is persons who are civilians and persons who are law \nenforcement officers.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  The police accountability hearing that we just held, Mr. Speaker, \nheld in front of the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday--and we thanked \nChairman Goodlatte and we thanked Ranking Member Conyers for heeding \nour voices asking for this hearing. It was a hearing of information, \nbut I think it did evidence that there is a divide that must be \nbridged.\n  Today, I stand on the floor to acknowledge and honor, Mr. Johnson, a \nfallen officer in my district. None of us want to consent to actions \nagainst law enforcement officers in the line of duty protecting our \ncommunities and our Nation.\n  At the same time, I believe that we have the opportunity to confront \nserious issues developing a roadmap for better police community \nrelations. In addition to the legislation that I know Mr. Johnson has \nalready elaborated on--and I support him in his efforts--we will be \nlooking at legislation that deals with holding the standard matrix to \nprovide a roadmap of training for police officers and law enforcement \nofficers from deescalation, to ideas of interaction with community, \nprofessional training, educational training.\n  We will also, hopefully, pass the CADET bill, which talks about \ngathering the appropriate data related to excessive force being used by \ncivilians or police officers and using that material to be able to \nformulate the right kind of approach to protect all.\n\n[[Page H3504]]\n\n  In addition, I just introduced today the Private Prison Information \nAct, which indicates that the same requirements for the Federal prison \nsystem should be for the private, nonpublic prison system providing \nreports of injuries or behavior that should be reported, and we hope \nthat bill will move quickly.\n  We have also introduced a good time, early release bill that argues \nfor the early release dealing with incarcerated persons responding to \nmass incarceration, which we believe is very important. This deals with \na certain age.\n  I am also introducing, Mr. Johnson, a bill that indicates 1 day for 1 \nday; if you have 54 days of good time, then you get 54 days. Now, it is \nnot the case.\n  Let me just say this, as I yield back to you, we will not pass \nlegislation unless we can all understand each other's pain. The \nhorrific pain of losing law enforcement officers and them not going \nhome to their families, I mourn--the horrific pain of a Michael Brown \nor Eric Garner and a Tamir Rice and a Walter Scott and any number of \nothers--and, of course, Freddie Gray.\n  What we need to do is, in understanding that pain, not be accusatory \nand get bills before the Judiciary Committee to make our system the \nbest justice system in the world. That is what I would like to see \nhappen. I know that you, as a practicing lawyer and who have addressed \nthese issues, would like to see that happen as well.\n  I would like to join you on the floor over and over again for these \nkinds of Special Orders, to speak to our colleagues about getting \nsomething done, passing comprehensive criminal reform, getting it done \nto answer the pain of all Americans.\n  We honor those who have lost their lives, and we honor the men and \nwomen in uniform who wear the uniform on our behalf, to be able to walk \nalongside us in dignity.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/house-section/article/H3504-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
