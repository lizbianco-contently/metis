Mr. Speaker, I have spent the past year \nworking with Illinois families to see how we could make this year a \nyear of action and progress for Second District families. Keeping that \nin mind, I wanted to end this year on a high note by providing a brief \nsnapshot on the state of my district on the education and economic \nfront.\n  This year, I donated over 1,000 books to Second District's school \nlibraries, even as we faced a tough State budget crisis. Illinois \nstudents should have the best educational resources possible, and I am \nworking with my community to ensure just that. I also kicked off my \n``Robin's Readers'' reading challenge. More than 3,000 kids \nparticipated, reading over 20,000 books in a 10-week period.\n  On the economic front, I held my third annual job fair, where I \nconnected 500 jobseekers with 70 businesses looking to hire. We also \nheld our second job and resource fair for our youth, as well as a \nveterans event.\n  This is just a sample of the work we were able to accomplish, and I \nlook forward to continuing our success in the new year.\n  Happy holidays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10694-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H10694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OBAMACARE DESTROYS JOBS\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last Monday, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirmed what we have seen for \nthe last 5 years: ObamaCare destroys jobs.\n  Over the next 10 years, ObamaCare is expected to significantly reduce \nAmerican work hours, destroying nearly 2 million jobs. The impact will \nalso reduce America's workforce by nearly 1 percent.\n  The cause is clear. Workers cannot afford the excessive mandates and \nchanges in tax rates. ObamaCare not only hurts wallets by increasing \npremiums, but it also hurts workers by destroying jobs. Last month, we \nlearned that major insurance companies, like UnitedHealthcare, may not \nremain in the exchanges because of high costs. Obamacare is \nunsustainable.\n  We have seen time and time again how ObamaCare has harmed jobs and \nfamilies. Its architect, Jonathan Gruber, admitted that it was built on \n``the stupidity of the American voter.'' We must repeal it and replace \nthis broken law with patient-centered solutions.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10694-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H10694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATING EAST NICOLAUS HIGH SCHOOL ON GOING TO THE STATE AA \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GARAMENDI.

Merry Christmas to the East Nicolaus Spartans from the \nBiggs Wolverines. Congratulations this year.\n  Mr. Speaker, the tax credit package we have passed will not only \nlower taxes for families across the Nation, it will spur more \ninvestment and growth by small businesses and farms, like in my \nnorthern California district.\n  For too long, Americans have had to wait until the last few days of \neach year to find out under which laws they will be taxed and at what \nrates. If the Senate will join us, this package will end that vicious \ncycle, and Americans can finally make financial decisions with greater \nstability to plan for the future.\n  We have supported education through tax credits for students and \nteachers, and we have increased protections to rein in the IRS.\n  Particularly important components for the First District are \nprovisions that allow farmers, ranchers, as well as mining operations, \ntimber operators, and construction contractors to make informed \ndecisions about how they can buy new equipment for the coming years and \nhow it will be taxed.\n  Families and businesses have been asking and begging for us to have \nthe stability and predictability in what their tax rates are going to \nbe. I am very happy that we were able to get this done, and I urge the \nSenate to also get that done so we can have predictability in tax rates \nand go about our business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10694-7", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H10694-H10695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FUNDING FOR NEUROSCIENCE\n\n  (Mr. FATTAH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Speaker, over 50 million Americans suffer from a \nneurological disease or disorder, over 1 billion worldwide. I authored \nlanguage that created an interagency working group that brought \ntogether dozens of federal agencies years ago, and we have laid out a \nmap, a plan, over the last 4 years now including mapping the human \nbrain with the BRAIN Initiative and funding a host of specific efforts.\n  I am so pleased that the bill that we will pass today will have a \nhistoric level of funding for neuroscience, over $7 billion in efforts \nat the National Institutes of Health, a historic investment at the \nNational Science Foundation, and now we have brought together our \nnational labs to create a national brain observatory.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Oklahoma, Tom Cole, for working \nwith me as the chair of our Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education, and Related Agencies. And in my role on the \nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, there is \nso much more for us to do.

Mr. Speaker, Lillian Vernon, a \nwoman who personified the American Dream and inspired generations of \ngirls and boys, passed away this week.\n  Lillian was born Lilli Menasche in Leipzig, Germany, in 1927. Her \nfamily arrived here in 1937 after fleeing the new Nazi regime. She \nattended NYU for a couple of years before leaving to get married. And \nshortly after her nuptials, the newly pregnant Lillian gathered \ntogether what little wedding money she had to start a mail order \nbusiness from her home in Mount Vernon, New York. She took the name \nVernon as her own, and the Lillian Vernon Company was born.\n  She put an advertisement in ``Seventeen'' magazine for a personalized \npurse and belt for $5; and within weeks, she had $34,000 dollars in \norders.\n  By 1970, Lillian Vernon had her first million-dollar year. A few \ndecades later, she had nine catalogues, 15 outlet stores, two Web \nsites, a business-to-business division, and yearly revenue close to \n$300 million.\n  She was a role model for women. She started her company when working \nmothers were often criticized and female entrepreneurs could rarely get \ncredit. But undeterred, she persevered.\n  She was also a trailblazer outside the business world and was known \nfor her charity and her devotion to so many causes, including her \ndedication to the Lillian Vernon Foundation, which supports the U.S. \nMarine Toys for Tots Foundation, Literacy Volunteers of America, and a \nnumber of other charities. In 2011, Vernon was honored with the Project \nSunshine Award for Philanthropic Leadership and was appointed by \nPresident Clinton as chairwoman of the National Women's Business \nCouncil in 1995.\n  Above all, she was a mother. She was dedicated to her two sons, David \nand Fred, both of whom worked in the family business with her.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Lillian throughout the years. And I can \nsay that even a reading of her accolades and accomplishments would fail \nto give a sense of just how special this wonderful woman truly was.\n  We have lost a great American, and she will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10695-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H10695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0915\n                         PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY\n\n  Ms. PELOSI.

Under guidelines consistently issued by \nsuccessive Speakers, as recorded in section 956 of the House Rules and \nManual, the Chair will not entertain a unanimous consent request for \nthe consideration of a measure unless it has been cleared by the \nbipartisan floor and committee leaderships.\n  Ms. PELOSI.

MARTIN\n\n  (Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, this has been a busy month for \nall of us. We have passed more major legislation in a few weeks than we \nhave in a few years. And now I want to thank all of the people who made \nit possible. I am talking about all the committee staff and all the \npeople behind the scenes here in the Capitol who make this work. Thank \nyou very, very much.\n  In particular, Mr. Speaker, this includes, of course, our legislative \ncounsel. I don't think you could find a group of people more dedicated \nto their jobs. These people work late nights every night. They work \nweekends. They are always on call.\n  So I want to put into the Record a statement thanking every one of \nthem by name. They were a part of history, and history should know \ntheir names.\n  I also want to thank one person in particular, and that is Jo-Marie \nSt. Martin. Today is Jo-Marie's last day on the Hill. She has been \nworking for this House for over 20 years, most recently as general \ncounsel and chief of legislative operations for the Speaker. I could \nnot even begin to list everything that she has accomplished.\n  We all know her so well. She is a legend in her own right. But as her \ncolleagues will tell you, what is even more impressive than her career \nis her character. She is simply unflappable. When everyone else is on \nedge, she is calm. When they are flustered--and, believe it or not, \nsome people get flustered around here from time to time--she is steady.\n  And though other people might like to show off their brains and their \nknow-how, she is the definition of kindness, of humility. I have never \nheard her dismiss a question, no matter how small. She is always eager \nto help people understand. And her enthusiasm is nothing short of \ninfectious. You can see it when she walks into a room. She has an \neffect on people. Everyone feels more at ease. The word that comes to \nmind is Zen--except, of course, when she is at a Caps game.\n  She knows the law backwards and forwards because she loves the law. \nShe cares about the law. She cares about this House. For over 20 years, \nshe has done her part to uphold its rights, to make sure that every \nvoice was heard. Everyone here owes her a debt of gratitude.\n  If I could use an old-fashioned word, I would say she is a true \npatriot. We salute her.\n  So please join me one last time in thanking our friend Jo-Marie St. \nMartin.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the \ndistinguished minority whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of those who have been flustered by Jo-\nMarie.\n  Jo-Marie, as all of you know, has been with this institution for over \ntwo decades. She started as an intern in the Committee on Rules, \nunfortunately, because she got to know the rules very, very well.\n  And as majority leader for 4 years, as Jo-Marie ran the opposition--\nthe constructive opposition, I will say, the friendly opposition but, \nnevertheless, the opposition--her intellect, her judgment, her \ntenacity, her focus was always a challenge. But it has always been good \nfor this institution, because she made sure that the minority was \nheard. Unfortunately, for us, she has also made sure that the majority \nwas loudly heard when the Republicans were in the majority.\n  Jo-Marie, as some of you know, is a mathematician by training. She is \nalso a lawyer. She is also a scholar. She is also somebody who cares \ndeeply about this institution.\n  Jo-Marie is my friend. Now, that does not mean that Jo-Marie and I \nalways had an even-keeled relationship. Sometimes, as I said, she \nflustered me and us by her skill and by her devotion and loyalty to the \nRepublican Party. But more than that, as the Speaker has said, she had \na loyalty to this institution and to our country.\n  Jo-Marie, you have been an extraordinary representative not only of \nyour party, but of this House. You have been an extraordinary friend of \nmine and so many.\n  I know Alexis Covey-Brandt, my chief of staff, and you have worked \ntogether a lot. Sometimes you agreed, and sometimes you didn't. Two \nbrilliant women who cared, however, about this institution and making \nit work for the people.\n  We call this the people's House. Jo-Marie, you have been one who has \nalways kept that uppermost in your mind. We, on this side of the aisle, \nshare a great respect and affection for you, and we wish you the very \nbest. As a young woman, you still have a lot of contributions to make, \nand we know you will make them.\n  We have mixed emotions about your leaving. To some degree, frankly, \nwe think we are advantaged by your leaving. But as an individual and as \nsomeone who is your dear, dear friend, I will lament your not being on \nthe floor and ever present, for your advice and counsel, always honest; \nsometimes in opposition, but always positive. Thank you for all you \nhave done.\n  God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10697-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H10697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed without amendment a bill of the House of the \nfollowing title:\n\n       H.R. 4246.

Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to congratulate two high \nschool football teams that continue to establish central Washington as \nthe football powerhouse of Washington State.\n  On December 5, the 13-1 Prosser Mustangs rolled over the Tumwater \nThunderbirds to claim the Washington State 2A high school football \nchampionship. Led by a stellar defense, the Mustangs amassed four \ninterceptions for the third time in the playoffs. This is Prosser's \nfifth State football championship.\n  Not to be outdone, the also 13-1 Okanogan High School Bulldogs pulled \noff an amazing nail-biter win, a win you usually only see in the \nmovies. Rallying from a 27-14 third quarter deficit, the Bulldogs \npulled off a late fourth-quarter touchdown to defeat the Napavine \nTigers 36-34. This was Okanogan's second straight Washington State 2B \nhigh school football championship.\n  Both teams have proudly represented their schools and demonstrated a \nlevel of skill, teamwork, and tenacity that will prepare them well for \nfuture seasons and for future success in life.\n\n[[Page H10698]]\n\n  Congratulations to both Prosser and Okanogan on well-played seasons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10698-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H10698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING OUR MILITARY\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nrecognize and honor all the brave men and women who have served and are \ncurrently serving our country today in the Armed Forces.\n  Today over 70,000 servicemembers are overseas protecting America and \nAmericans. These men and women sacrifice their lives fighting wars \noverseas so that the wars don't come to our shores. This year many \nAmerican families have endured the tragedies of war through the loss of \ntheir family members. We must never forget their service.\n  As we celebrate this holiday season, let us remember all of our \nmilitary servicemembers and their families as they continue to serve \nour country and fight for our security and freedoms. Too many American \nsoldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, and airwomen will be away from \ntheir families at this holiday season.

Thus, I call on him to \nanswer the questions my House colleagues and I are sending to the White \nHouse on Monday:\n  First, consider that Washington Post fact-checkers have confirmed \ntheir agreement with the sad truth that none of the recent months' and \nyears' major shootings would have been prevented by stricter gun \ncontrol laws. Why would the President think his proposal would be any \ndifferent?\n  Second, if this is good policy, why wasn't it included in the \nexecutive actions announced by the President in January 2013?\n  Our remaining questions ask whether the President relied on \nappropriate data to choose this executive order and how it would be \nenforced.\n  Mr. Speaker, this kind of secretive, unilateral action is not just \nwrong; it results in bad policy. I call on the President to answer our \nletter as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10698-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H10698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PROUD MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. COHEN.

Mr. Speaker, this is the season of \ngiving. Today I rise in recognition of a community in Pennsylvania's \nFifth Congressional District, which banded together after a fire \ndestroyed the home of a local charity.\n  On the evening of December 12, flames ripped through the Huntingdon \nSalvation Army Church, destroying everything inside. Toys and clothes \ndonated for the holiday season were left ruined by smoke and water \ndamage. These items would have made the holiday season a little better \nfor around 300 local families.

Mr. Speaker, at the height of the cold war, Ethiopia \nfell to the Communists in 1974. Shortly thereafter, an Ethiopian \nfamily--the Berhane family--ended up in Huntington Beach, California, \nand for a long time they have been proud Americans and good citizens.\n  After the Communist regime in Ethiopia collapsed in 1991, thanks to \nRonald Reagan's global efforts to undue the Communist establishment, \nthe government in Ethiopia, which was replaced in 1991, has refused to \nreturn the confiscated property the Communists took from the Berhane \nfamily.\n  I rise in support of my constituents. I ask my fellow colleagues to \njoin me in opposing any aid or activities helping the Ethiopian \nGovernment until they have returned the property of American citizens \nconfiscated by the Communists.\n  It is our job to stand up for American citizens, whether they come \nfrom Ethiopia or are born in Brooklyn. They are now proud Americans. We \nneed to stick together and refuse to give support to regimes like \nEthiopia that refuse to turn confiscated property.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10698-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H10698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EPA SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE\n\n  (Mr. GIBBS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. GIBBS.

Mr. Speaker, for quite some time there has been an \neffort at the U.N. to delegitimize the Jewish State of Israel and to \ntry to whitewash the Jewish people's historical and biblical connection \nto Israel.\n  Denying the historical connection of the people to Jerusalem is \nfalse, and\n\n[[Page H10699]]\n\namazing archaeological discoveries are frequently made that prove the \nroots of the Jewish people are in Israel.\n  Earlier this month a Hebrew University archaeological team unearthed \nan unprecedented impression of a royal seal of King Hezekiah from the \nFirst Temple period. This marks the first time that a seal impression \nof an Israelite or Judean king has ever been discovered, and it proves \nthat not only is Israel the religious center for Jews, but it is their \nancestral and historic homeland.\n  I want to thank the Ir David Foundation's Director of International \nAffairs, Ze'ev Orenstein, for sharing this and many other amazing \ndiscoveries with me.

I will head into 2016 with the same \ngoals of creating jobs, growing this economy, and keeping the American \npeople safe.\n  It has been an honor to serve the folks of the 12th District of \nGeorgia.

Over the years, after \ninitially greeting each other every day, the greeting became a genuine \nfriendship of respect and kindness, and even a joke or two.\n  I am honored today to recognize one of our first responders, Capitol \nPolice Private First Class Tommy Wisseman. Officer Wisseman exemplifies \na model officer who takes his job very seriously, but finds the time to \nget to know Members of Congress on a more personal level.\n  Officer Wisseman has given the Capitol Police 29 years of service, \nall 29 at the Capitol building. He has worked every Presidential \ninauguration since 1989; was the lead officer for the construction of \nthe Capitol Visitor Center; one of the head trainers for the Capitol \nVisitor Center officers; received multiple awards and citations.\n  He is the father of four daughters, and married to a lovely wife, who \nis with the Capitol Police.\n  Let me thank him and salute him as I salute all of the police.\n  Mr. Speaker, since 1828, the United States Capitol Police have \nprovided protection for our Congress, ensuring a safe and open \nenvironment to facilitate the legislative process and the security of \nCongressional Members, staff and employees, and visitors and members of \nthe public. This protection was magnified in 1998 when a shooter \nentered the Capitol killing Officer Gibson and Officer Chestnut who was \nprotecting Majority Whip Tom DeLay and also in 2001 during the 9-11 \nattacks when our men and women in uniform literally moved our \nleadership and Members of Congress to safe havens away from the \nCapitol. We are grateful to all of them and the more than 2000 sworn \nand civilian employees who serve and protect the Congress.\n  As Members of Congress, we come in contact with Capitol Police every \nday and in the course of our days on this campus and years in Congress \nwe get to know many of them on a first name basis. That is the case \nwith an officer and a gentleman I have gotten to know and which started \ninitially from just a simple greeting to each other. Over the years \nthat initial greeting has evolved into a genuine friendship of respect \nand kindness and even a joke or two. I am honored today to recognize \none of our first responders, Capitol Police, Private First Class Thomas \nWisseman.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time.\n  At 1:00 today, back home in Georgia, we are going to lay to rest Reva \nMae Jennings.\n  Reva Jennings is an institution in my part of the world, Mr. Speaker. \nThis photo here, you can see, is in the midst of a parade. She helped \nto found the Republican Party in Forsyth County back when it could meet \nin a telephone booth. She used to say that she never minded being the \nonly one who was right in a room.\n  From the moment I decided to pursue this position, Mr. Speaker, Reva \nhas been a fixture by my side. She passed away a week ago in a traffic \naccident.\n  She graduated from the University of North Carolina, Mr. Speaker. And \neven though she was passionate about Georgia, she was passionate about \nher Tar Heels. If I had a Tar Heel blue suit, I would have worn it down \nhere to the floor today in tribute to her.\n  She defined her life by passion, Mr. Speaker. She has had every \nleadership position you can imagine in the Republican Party in our part \nof the world; president of the Georgia Federation of Republican Women, \nMr. Speaker. She earned the title of Republican Woman of the Year. She \ntraveled as a delegate from Georgia to the Republican National \nConvention.\n  She believed in our community. She believed in our party. She \nbelieved in America.\n\n[[Page H10700]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I came to know Reva through her political activities, \nbut they did not define her. Passion defined her, and there is nothing \nthat she was more passionate about than her family.\n  The wife of Dr. Bruce Jennings, Mr. Speaker, who passed away far too \nsoon, the mother of three, the grandmother of her beloved grand twins.\n  Mr. Speaker, the entire community is gathering this afternoon to say \ngoodbye. It seems so cliche to talk about folks who are irreplaceable, \nbut Reva truly is.\n  You can't put a marker on commitment, Mr. Speaker. There was never a \nresponsibility, never a responsibility in the community that Reva \ndidn't step up and say: Pick me. It characterized the community.\n  As Forsyth County became one of the fastest growing counties in the \nNation, Mr. Speaker, her commitment was contagious.\n  When car accidents take our loved ones, Mr. Speaker, it happens when \nyou least expect it. No one was prepared to say goodbye to Reva. No one \nhad said all the things that they had to say to Reva.\n  But she used to pull me aside and take a picture out of her wallet, \nshow me that beloved dentist that she married back during the Vietnam \nWar. It was a picture they had taken in Hawaii, as I recall.\n  I never remember her dating. She never remarried. She said: ``Rob, I \ngot it right the first time.''\n  As the entire community is struggling with Reva's loss, this is the \nimage that I am left with, Mr. Speaker. She has waited decade upon \ndecade to be united with her beloved husband, Bruce, and today, Mr. \nSpeaker, we lay her to rest so that they can be together with their \nMaker once again.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I offer my heartfelt condolences to the \nJennings family.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10700-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H10700-H10703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OUR JUDEO-CHRISTIAN HERITAGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized \nfor the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this will be the last session before we \nenter Christmas. And, Mr. Speaker, I have noted from a couple of \narticles that have been in the news this week, this one from December \n17, a story from Minnesota, the title: ``Parents Question Choice to \nSing `Allahu Akbar' at Holiday Concert.''\n  It is intriguing that, in an age when groups are attacking our Judeo-\nChristian heritage, trying to rewrite our history, trying to prevent \nany mention of our Christian heritage--I am looking at the full face of \nMoses directly above me in front of me because we have, in this \nChamber, profiles of people who were considered to be the greatest \nlawgivers of all time. And until recent years, Moses was considered the \ngreatest lawgiver of all time. The Founders believed that.\n  The Supreme Court now has relegated Moses to the ash heap of history. \nHis revelation that he said came from God, that a man shall leave his \nfather and mother, a woman leave their home, the two shall become one \nflesh. Jesus doubled down on that. He said not only is that what \nmarriage is, what God joined together, let nobody pull apart.\n  So we have relegated Moses to the ash heap. We have had the Supreme \nCourt, for years now, saying, first, you can't have prayer in public, \neven though the Founders started each day of the Continental Congress \nwith prayer; and although the Constitutional Convention didn't start \neach day with prayer, when they hit a brick wall and could go no \nfurther, Benjamin Franklin made his powerful speech about how they had \nbegun each day with prayer, as he said, his exact words: ``In the \nbeginning contest with Great Britain, when we were sensible of danger, \nwe had daily prayer in this room. Our prayers, sir, were heard and they \nwere graciously answered.''\n  He went on to say: ``If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without \nHis notice, is it probable an empire could rise without His aid? We \nhave been assured, sir, in the sacred writing, that `except the Lord \nbuild the house, they labor in vain that build it.' ''\n  He said: I also firmly believe that without His--God's--concurring \naid, we will succeed in our political building no better, than the \nBuilders of Babel: We will be confounded by our local partial interests \nand we, ourselves, shall be bye words through time.\n  So I know our heritage. They didn't have money to pay for a chaplain \nthat they could all agree on to do the prayer every day. He pointed out \nin the debate that we agreed on a chaplain. We didn't agree on any \nspecific person here to do the prayer for all the different \ndenominations. But we don't have a treasurer. We don't have money. We \ncan't hire a chaplain.\n  And that is when Randolph made his motion. Okay, basically, they had \nhit a brick wall. They were making no progress. As Franklin had said, \nwe have more noes than ayes on virtually every vote.\n  So he moved that they recess--here it was the end of June--they \nrecess and reconvene to celebrate the country's birthday in early July, \nand worship together. So they did. That one passed. They reconvened to \nworship God at the Reformed Calvinistic Church there in Philadelphia.\n  You can go online, Mr. Speaker, and find what is reported to be the \nprayer that he gave. It had a powerful influence. And when they \nreconvened, there was a new spirit. They were able to come together and \nend up arriving at the Great Compromise.\n  Founder after Founder, including Washington himself, pointed out that \nclearly God's hand was upon them in the preparation of the \nConstitution, and then, ultimately, resulting in the Bill of Rights.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  The first right within the Bill of Rights was basically to make clear \nthat government would never interfere with religion.\n  Basically, we have come to a place after all these years where the \nUnited States Supreme Court has said not only can you not have the \nJudeo-Christian God as part of any government--the same God that the \nFounders were giving credit to and praying to--but now this year the \nSupreme Court took the ultimate step of saying: Forget Moses. Forget \nJesus. We are the new God and here is what we pronounce in place of \nMoses and Jesus and our founding principles. So this is a big year.\n  I know the President says we are not a Christian nation, and I won't \nargue that point with him. I won't debate him. I think he is right. I \nknow where we started, and I know every time, according to my staff, I \nmention God here where--in this Capitol, God's name has been invoked \nfrom the very beginning of this Capitol and before this Capitol and \nwhen it was in Philadelphia and when the first Congress was sworn in \nand President George Washington was sworn in at Federal Hall in New \nYork City. It was his idea to bring his Bible and put his hand on the \nBible, his idea to add the words ``so help me God.''\n  It was all their idea that the first thing they would do as a \nCongress together, after being sworn in, was to walk down, basically, \nWall Street to St. Paul's Chapel there in New York and dedicate this \ncountry there in 1789 to God Almighty.\n  I won't debate the President saying we are not a Christian nation, \nbut the Bible has been quoted over our history in this Chamber more \nthan any other book as a reason for or against legislation passing. It \nis a part of our heritage, to a much lesser extent in more recent \nyears, as the Supreme Court--at least the five majority in the Supreme \nCourt becoming our God instead of the God that was acknowledged by Ben \nFranklin, George Washington, basically every President.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a job to represent our constituents. We have an \noath to the Constitution. I know we take that seriously. Part of our \njob in representing our constituents is to educate people on the issues \nand what has been important and what has been our strength, what has \nbeen our weaknesses. If you don't know our history, then, as the saying \ngoes, those who refuse to learn from history are destined to repeat it. \nIt is important to know history.\n  It is important to note the official words of the United States' \nhighest magistrate, our President. Jefferson was asked once as he rode \nhis horse\n\n[[Page H10701]]\n\ndown Pennsylvania Avenue on a Sunday morning--he had a big Bible in his \nhand, it was reported. I have had this verified by the Congressional \nResearch Service.\n  When Jefferson was President for those 8 years, when he was in \nWashington, not only did he condone the church service, the largest \nChristian church service in Washington that occurred just down the \nhall, but he participated. He would even have the Marine Band come and \nplay the hymns on many occasions for the Christian church service.\n  As he rode down this one occasion, he was asked, ``Mr. President, \nwhere are you going?''\n  He said, ``I am going to church up in the Capitol.''\n  The statement was made, ``Mr. President, you don't believe everything \nthey do.''\n  Because he had questions about some of the miracles reported in the \nBible.\n  But it was reported that his response was, ``Sir, I am the highest \nelected magistrate in this country. It is imperative that I set the \nproper example.''\n  Now, I asked the Congressional Research Service is it true what has \nbeen attributed to the person people claim to be the father of the \nConstitution, James Madison, that when he was President for his 8 \nyears, that he also condoned and participated in church services just \ndown the hall here every Sunday he was in Washington?\n  The Congressional Research Service, a bipartisan, nonpartisan \nservice, reported, yes, but he was different from Jefferson. Jefferson \nnormally rode a horse down Pennsylvania Avenue whereas Madison would \nnormally come to church up here in the Capitol in a coach drawn by \nhorses rather than on horseback.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, as we take the traditional Christmas recess, no \nmatter what your religious preference is or no preference at all, it is \na fact this is a Christmas recess.\n  Although this was not a statement at Christmastime, the commander of \nour military in 1778, George Washington, made this order as commander \nof our military. Some say this is really the reason God blessed their \nefforts, is because of their commitment and dedication. This is an \norder of George Washington to the troops at Valley Forge. This is \nGeorge Washington's order, Mr. Speaker. I will read it verbatim:\n\n       The Commander in Chief directs that divine service be \n     performed every Sunday at eleven o'clock in each brigade \n     which has chaplains. Those brigades which have none will \n     attend the places of worship nearest to them. It is expected \n     that officers of all ranks will, by their attendance, set an \n     example for their men. While we are zealously performing the \n     duties of good citizens and soldiers, we certainly ought not \n     to be inattentive to the higher duties of religion. To the \n     distinguished character of patriot, it should be our highest \n     glory to laud the more distinguished character of Christian.\n\n  Those are George Washington's words as commander of our military.\n  Well, John Adams, without whom it is unlikely we would have arrived \nat the place we did with the Declaration--he is the one that directed \nThomas Jefferson to do the first draft of the Declaration of \nIndependence. He was critical in holding things together. Even though \nhe only won one term as President, he was Vice President for two terms. \nHe was very important in arriving at our Constitution.\n  John Adams on October 11, 1798, said this to the First Brigade, Third \nDivision, of Militia of Massachusetts:\n\n       We have no government armed with power capable of \n     contending with human passions, unbridled by morality and \n     religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry would \n     break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes \n     through a net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and \n     religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government \n     of any other.\n\n  This is from a Founder that knew how the Constitution was forged, \nmade a difference in our country's beginning. He says our Constitution \nis not fit as a governing document for any but a moral and religious \npeople. So over the years we have been taken down the road away from \nbeing a moral and religious people.\n  Franklin Roosevelt started many social programs. He made a lot of \ndecisions, I think, that were dramatic mistakes. The man deserves \ncredit for leading this Nation through a time of war, mistakes being \nmade.\n  He got us through a war and helped with Winston Churchill and other \nleaders to keep freedom alive so that it would be present in our \nlifetime, even as we see our freedoms being taken by government the \nfurther we go along.\n  Exactly 2 weeks after the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor on December \n7, 1941, a day he said in this very Chamber from right up here at this \nlevel--he had a marble podium and not this wooden one--but he said \nthat was a day that would live in infamy.\n\n  Exactly 2 weeks later, December 21, 1941, this was Franklin \nRoosevelt's message to our Nation:\n\n       Sincere and faithful men and women are asking themselves \n     this Christmas: How can we light our trees? How can we give \n     our gifts? How can we meet and worship with love and with \n     uplifted spirit and heart in a world at war, a world of \n     fighting and suffering, and death? How can we pause even for \n     a day, even for Christmas day, in our urgent labor of arming \n     a decent humanity against the enemies which beset it?\n\n  Parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, he didn't mean holiday. He meant what \nhe said, Christmas day.\n  Roosevelt goes on:\n\n       How can we, as men and women, put the world aside in \n     peaceful years to rejoice in the birth of Christ? Looking \n     into the days to come, I have set aside a day of prayer and \n     in that proclamation I have said: The year 1941 has brought \n     upon our Nation a war of aggression by powers dominated by \n     arrogant rulers whose selfish purpose is to destroy free \n     institutions. They would thereby take from the freedom-loving \n     peoples of the Earth the hard-won liberties gained over many \n     centuries. The new year of 1942 calls for the courage. Our \n     strength, as the strength of all men everywhere, is of \n     greater avail as God upholds us. Therefore, I do hereby \n     appoint the first day of the year 1942 as a day of prayer, of \n     asking forgiveness for our shortcomings of the past, of \n     consecrations to the task of the present and of asking God's \n     help in days to come. We need His guidance that this people \n     may be humble in spirit, but strong in the conviction of the \n     right, steadfast to endure sacrifice, and brave to achieve a \n     victory of liberty and peace.\n\n  Franklin Roosevelt says our strongest weapon in this war is that \nconviction of the dignity and brotherhood of man which Christmas day \nsignifies against enemies who preach the principles of hate and \npractice them. We set our fate in human love and in God's care for us \nin all men everywhere.\n  A year later, on Christmas Eve, Franklin Roosevelt said:\n\n       To you who serve in uniform, I also send a message of cheer \n     that you are in the thoughts of your families and friends at \n     home and that Christmas prayers follow you wherever you may \n     be. To all Americans, I say that loving our neighbor as we \n     love ourselves is not enough, that we, as a Nation and as \n     individuals, will please God best by showing regard for the \n     laws of God. There is no better way of fostering goodwill \n     toward men than by first fostering goodwill toward God.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Then Franklin Roosevelt basically takes a quote from John 14:15 in \nsaying:\n  ``If we love Him, we will keep His Commandments.\n  ``In sending Christmas greetings to the Armed Forces and merchant \nsailors of the United Nations, we include therein our pride in their \nbravery on the fighting fronts and on all the seas.\n  ``It is significant that tomorrow--Christmas Day--our plants and \nfactories will be stilled. This is not true of the other holidays we \nhave long been accustomed to celebrate. On all other holidays work goes \non--gladly--for the winning of the war. So Christmas becomes the only \nholiday in all the year.\n  ``I like to think that this is so because Christmas is a holy day. \nMay all it stands for live and grow throughout the years.''\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, 5 years later exactly, Harry Truman nationally \nbroadcast this address at the lighting of the National--not holiday \ntree but Christmas Tree--on the White House lawn. Again, Mr. Speaker, \njust as those who failed to learn from the mistakes of history are \ndestined to repeat them, we can avoid the mistakes by looking at what \nstrengthened America and what caused God to bless America.\n  We won a war against evil fascism that is raising its head yet again. \nJust as Hitler colluded with radical Islam, agreed with some of his \nfascist ideas against Jews, against Christians, there is so much \nignorance. Some people try to say Hitler was a Christian. It is the \nfarthest thing from it.\n  These are Harry Truman's words, December 1947 on Christmas Eve:\n  ``My fellow countrymen: We are met on the South Lawn of the White \nHouse.\n\n[[Page H10702]]\n\nAbove the barren treetops rises the towering shaft of the Washington \nMonument. The scene is peaceful and tranquil. The shadows deepen, and \nthe holy night falls gently over the National Capital, as we gather \naround our Christmas tree.\n  ``Down the ages, from the first Christmas through all the years of 19 \ncenturies, mankind, in its weary pilgrimage through a changing world, \nhas been cheered and strengthened by the message of Christmas.\n  ``The angels sang for joy at the first Christmas in a faraway \nBethlehem. Their song has echoed through the corridors of time and will \ncontinue to sustain the heart of man through eternity.\n  ``Let us not forget that the first Christmas was a homeless one. A \nhumble man and woman had gone up from Galilee, out of the city of \nNazareth, to Bethlehem. There is a sense of desolation in St. Luke's \nbrief chronicle that Mary `brought forth her firstborn son, wrapped Him \nin swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger because there was no \nroom for them in the inn.'\n  ``For many of our brethren in Europe and Asia, this too will be a \nhomeless Christmas. There can be little happiness for those who will \nkeep another Christmas in poverty and exile and in separation from \ntheir loved ones.\n  ``As we prepare to celebrate our Christmas this year in a land of \nplenty, we would be heartless, indeed, if we were indifferent to the \nplight of less fortunate peoples overseas.\n  ``We must not forget that our Revolutionary fathers also knew a \nChristmas of suffering and desolation. Washington wrote from Valley \nForge 2 days before Christmas in 1777: `We have this day no less than \n2,873 men in camp unfit for duty because they are barefooted and \notherwise naked.'\n  ``We can be thankful that our people have risen today, as did our \nforefathers in Washington's time, to our obligation and our \nopportunity.\n  ``At this point in the world's history, the words of St. Paul have \ngreater significance than ever before. He said, `And now abideth faith, \nhope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.'\n  ``Let us then put our trust in the unerring star which guided the \nWise Men to the manger of Bethlehem. Let us hearken again to the angel \nchoir singing, `Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth peace, \ngoodwill toward men.'\n  ``With hope for the future and with faith in God, I wish all my \ncountrymen a very Merry Christmas.''\n  A year later, Harry Truman, as President of the United States, \nofficially said:\n  ``For of all the days of the year, Christmas is the family day. \nChristmas began that way.\n  ``The moving event of the first Christmas was the bringing forth of \nthe first born in the stable in Bethlehem. There began, in humble \nsurroundings, the home life of the Holy Family, glorified in song and \nstory and in the hearts of men down through the centuries. The great \njoys and mysteries of that event have forever sanctified and enriched \nall home life.\n  ``The hallowed associations of Christmas draw all hearts toward home. \nWith one accord, we receive with joy and reverence the message of the \nfirst Christmas: `Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth peace, \ngoodwill to men.'\n  ``What could be more appropriate than for all of us to dedicate \nourselves to the cause of peace on this holy night. As a Nation, we \nhave a history of little more than a century and a half. But the \nreligion which came to the world, heralded by the song of the angels, \nhas endured for 19 centuries. It will continue to endure. It remains \ntoday the world's best hope for peace if the world will accept its \nfundamental teaching: that all men are brothers.''\n  Then he quotes from Scripture:\n  ``God that made the world and all things therein hath made of one \nblood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth.''\n  Then Truman says: ``In the spirit of that message from the Acts of \nthe Apostles, I wish all of you a Merry Christmas.''\n  I know, Mr. Speaker, there are people that go nuts when we talk about \nthese official pronouncements by government officials as part of their \ngovernment duty, but it is part of our history.\n  For those who go ballistic when this part of our history, that led us \nto being the greatest nation in the history of the world--more assets \nfor individuals; a country where the number one health problem for the \nNation's poor is obesity; a country where we have sacrificed our \ngreatest treasure, American lives, for other people's freedom without a \ndemand for imperialism, without a demand that they convert to our \ngovernment's leadership--that is why they speak French in France, \nJapanese in Japan, and German in Germany.\n  Dwight Eisenhower, who knew something about fighting, said this 7 \nyears after the last statement I read from Harry Truman. This was his \nofficial pronouncement. President Eisenhower said:\n  ``This evening's ceremony here at the White House is one of many \nthousands in America's traditional celebration of the birth, almost \n2,000 years ago, of the Prince of Peace.\n  ``For us, this Christmas is truly a sense of goodwill--and our first \npeaceful one since 1949. Our hopes are bright, even though the world \nstill stands divided in two antagonistic parts.\n  ``More precisely than in any other way, prayer places freedom and \ncommunism in opposition, one to the other. The Communist can find no \nreserve of strength in prayer because his doctrine of materialism and \nstatism denies the dignity of man and, consequently, the existence of \nGod.\n\n  ``But in America, George Washington long ago rejected exclusive \ndependence upon mere materialistic values. In the bitter and critical \nwinter at Valley Forge, when the cause of liberty was so near defeat, \nhis recourse was sincere and earnest prayer. From it, he received new \nhope and new strength of purpose out of which grew the freedom in which \nwe celebrate this Christmas season.\n  ``As religious faith is the foundation of free government, so is \nprayer an indispensable part of that faith.\n  ``Would it not be fitting for each of us to speak in prayer to the \nFather of all men and women on this Earth, of whatever nation, and of \nevery race and creed--to ask that He--God--help us and teach us and \nstrengthen us and receive our thanks?\n  ``Should we not pray that He help us?''\n  He always capitalized ``He'' when he spoke of God.\n  ``Should we not pray that He receive our thanks? For certainly, we \nare grateful for the opportunity given us to use our strength and our \nfaith to meet the problems of this hour. And on this Christmas Eve, all \nhearts in America are filled with special thanks to God that the blood \nof those we love no longer spills on battlefields abroad. May He--God--\nreceive the thanks of each of us for this, His greatest bounty--and our \nsupplication that peace on Earth may live with us, always.''\n  So the leader of our fight against fascism, world domination of hate \nin World War II, Dwight Eisenhower, made those rather profound words.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, we see through our history when our Nation was \ndeeply troubled--whether it was Washington, whether it was Lincoln, \nwhether it was Franklin Roosevelt in World War II, Eisenhower in the \nKorean war, Kennedy during Vietnam--all of our Presidents have known up \nto this point that our greatest hope comes through prayer to God.\n  I am not speaking these words and reading our historic statements by \nPresidents--by our leaders--to try to convert anybody, but just so our \nhistory is understood, as our way continues to grow darker, critical \nviolence is escalating again, racial divides are growing deeper when I \nthought we had--we have--we have come so far. We need to turn, \naccording to our former leaders, historically--what they said is: Turn \nto God.\n  This is not to convert anybody. It is simply so that this record of \nwhere Presidents, leaders, and Americans used to turn be part of the \nRecord today.\n  So John Kennedy's words, as President, December 17, 1962--at this \ntime, there were only advisers in Vietnam--at the official lighting of \nthe National Christmas Tree. It was still a Christmas tree for John \nKennedy:\n  ``With the lighting of this tree, which is an old ceremony in \nWashington and one which has been among the most important \nresponsibilities of a good many Presidents of the United States, we \ninitiate, in a formal way, the Christmas season.\n\n[[Page H10703]]\n\n  ``We mark the festival of Christmas, which is the most sacred and \nhopeful day in our civilization. For nearly 2,000 years, the message of \nChristmas, the message of peace and goodwill towards all men, has been \nthe guiding star of our endeavors.\n  ``I had a meeting which included some of our representatives from \nfar-off countries in Africa and Asia. They were returning to their \nposts for the Christmas holidays.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  ``Talking with them afterwards, I was struck by the fact that in the \nfar off continents Moslems, Hindus, Buddhists, as well as Christians, \npaused from their labors on the 25th day of December to celebrate the \nbirthday of the Prince of Peace. There could be no more striking proof \nthat Christmas is truly the universal holiday of all men. It is the day \nwhen all of us dedicate our thoughts to others; when all are reminded \nthat mercy and compassion are the enduring virtues; when all show, by \nsmall deeds and large and by acts, that it is more blessed to give than \nto receive.\n  ``It is the day when we remind ourselves that man can and must live \nin peace with his neighbors and that it is the peacemakers who are \ntruly blessed. In this year of 1962 we greet each other at Christmas \nwith some special sense of the blessings of peace. This has been a year \nof peril when the peace has been sorely threatened. But it has been a \nyear when peril was faced and when reason ruled. As a result, we may \ntalk, at this Christmas, just a little bit more confidently of peace on \nEarth, good will to men. As a result, the hopes of the American people \nare perhaps a little higher. We have much yet to do. We still need to \nask that God bless everyone.''\n  Of course, each President has made pronouncements of a similar nature \nvarious times.\n  This was Jimmy Carter, President Carter, December 15, 1977, at what \nhe described as the Christmas Pageant of Peace Ceremony on the White \nHouse Ellipse:\n  ``Christmas has a special meaning for those of us who are Christians, \nthose of us who believe in Christ, those of us who know that almost \n2,000 years ago, the Son of Peace was born to give us a vision of \nperfection, a vision of humility, a vision of unselfishness, a vision \nof compassion, a vision of love.''\n  President Carter in 1978 said:\n  ``Rosalyn and I send our warmest wishes to our fellow citizens who \ncelebrate the birth of Christ and who rejoice with us in the coming of \nthe peace He symbolizes.\n  ``We welcome this opportunity to offer our thanks to those who have \ngiven us their encouragement and prayers.\n  ``We also join in this season's traditional expression of \nappreciation to God for His blessings in the past year, and we ask for \nHis continuing guidance and protection as we face the challenges of \n1979.''\n  President George W. Bush, President Clinton, President George W. \nBush, and President Obama have delivered Christmas messages, and \nPresident Obama his holiday messages.\n  I would like to conclude at this time with President Reagan's \nmessage, as he says on the observance of Christmas, December 19, 1988, \nhis last Christmas message as President:\n  ``The themes of Christmas and of coming home for the holidays have \nlong been intertwined in song and story. There is a profound irony and \nlesson in this, because Christmas celebrates the coming of a savior who \nwas born without a home.\n  ``There was no room at the inn for the Holy Family. Weary of travel, \na young Mary close to childbirth and her carpenter husband Joseph found \nbut the rude shelter of a stable. There was born the King of Kings, the \nPrince of Peace--an event on which all history would turn. Jesus would \nagain be without a home, and more than once; on the flight to Egypt and \nduring His public ministry, when he said, `The foxes have holes, and \nthe birds of the air have nests; but the son of man hath nowhere to lay \nhis head.'\n  ``From His very infancy, on, our Redeemer was reminding us that from \nthen on we would never lack a home in Him. Like the shepherds whom the \nangel of the Lord appeared on the first Christmas Day, we could always \nsay: `Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is \ncome to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us.'\n  ``As we come home with gladness to family and friends this Christmas, \nlet us also remember our neighbors who cannot go home themselves. Our \ncompassion and concern this Christmas and all year long will mean much \nto the hospitalized, the homeless, the convalescent, the orphaned--and \nwill surely lead us on our way to the joy and peace of Bethlehem and \nthe Christ child who bids us come. For it is only in finding and living \nthe internal meaning of the nativity that we can be truly happy, truly \nat peace, truly home.''\n  He concludes, as I will--President Reagan:\n  ``Merry Christmas, and God bless you.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10703-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H10703-H10706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PAYING DOWN THE DEBT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nPrice) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. I thank the Speaker for the recognition and \nthe opportunity to address the House on this the final hour of the \nfinal day of the final week of the final month of this year in \nCongress.\n  It has been a remarkable year. The Congress--the House especially--\nhas seen some remarkable changes. I would like to share with you a \nlittle perspective on where we find ourselves now from a budgetary \nstandpoint.\n  For the last year, I have had the privilege of chairing the Budget \nCommittee in the House of Representatives. That is the committee that \ndeals with all of the spending that occurs in our Nation from the \nFederal Government standpoint.\n  I would like to start by saying: What is it defining the goal that we \nhave at the Budget Committee and in the Republican Conference here in \nthe House of Representatives?\n  That goal is broadly to create the greatest amount of opportunity and \nthe greatest amount of success for the greatest number of people so \nthat the greatest number of American Dreams can be realized in a fair \nand a compassionate system.\n  That is kind of the 60,000-foot view that we have here in the House \nof Representatives at the Budget Committee among Republicans who have \nallowed me the privilege of chairing the Budget Committee.\n  So from that point of view, in terms of the perspective of where we \nfind ourselves and what our goal is, what does that have to do with the \nbudget? What does that have to do with the numbers that get crunched in \nthis town all the time and that we just finished a remarkable week \ntalking about how to get the progrowth policies that are so necessary \nto get our economy growing and how do we move forward from a spending \nstandpoint?\n  Folks all across the country have differing views about how that \nought to be done. But I think it is helpful to kind of step back and to \nlook at the overall picture, the big picture.\n  From a spending standpoint, the Nation understands and appreciates \nthat Washington spends a lot. $3.8 trillion is the amount of money that \nyour Federal Government will spend in this fiscal year. That is 3.8 \nwith too many zeros after it. It is hard to get your arms around the \namount of money that that is. But it is important for all Americans to \nappreciate kind of how that breaks down.\n  The point I want to begin with is this point about mandatory spending \nand discretionary spending. Folks tend to think mostly, if they don't \nknow how Washington works, that this $3.8 trillion is the money that \nCongress deals with every single year. Right? It is the spending that \ngoes out the door here in Washington every single year and that \ncontinues to grow and grow and grow. We will go over some of those \nnumbers.\n  The fact of the matter is that this spending is broken down into two \nmajor categories. One is called mandatory. I prefer the word automatic \nbecause it really isn't mandatory. That is the spending that has \noccurred and continues to occur because Congress, along with the \nPresident, at some point in the past has defined a certain amount of \nspending or certain programs that need to be continued year\n\n[[Page H10704]]\n\nafter year after year, regardless of what Congress does or until and \nunless Congress changes those programs. These are programs like Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. There are a lot of other mandatory \nprograms. These are important programs. There is no doubt about it.\n  The money that goes to those programs goes to them based upon an \nindividual in this country qualifying for those programs based upon \neither their income or their age or some other circumstance. The amount \nof money to be spent on those programs doesn't change at all unless the \nHouse, the Senate, and the President agree to change it.\n  That is the mandatory side or the automatic side. I prefer, again, to \ncall it automatic because it is automatic spending that occurs. It is \nonly mandatory in that Congress in the past decided that that is what \nought to be done. It doesn't bind us to it, but we have to come to some \nagreement, as a Congress and President, the legislative and the \nexecutive branch, in order to change that.\n  When you look at this chart here, what we see is that the mandatory \nprograms--or the mandatory spending, automatic spending, is in red. All \nother spending, which is the discretionary spending, is in blue. This \nis 1965, 2014, and 2040, the three different pie charts.\n  We see that, in 1965, 50 years ago, the amount of mandatory \nspending--that is the automatic spending that occurs year after year \nafter year unless Congress and the President agree to change \nsomething--the amount of mandatory spending as a percent of spending \nwas about a third. About a third of all spending for the Federal \nGovernment 50 years ago was mandatory spending. So two-thirds was \ndiscretionary.\n  Now, what is discretionary spending? If you think about all of the \nspending that occurs in Washington, everything that occurs in \nWashington that people like and want and desire, some people want to \nchange some of it and some people want to raise some things and lower \nother things.\n  But if you think about everything that Washington does with the \nexception of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and some other more \nminor mandatory programs--those are the ones on the automatic side--if \nyou think about what Washington does, all of the rest of that is the \nblue that is the discretionary spending.\n  What is that? You can just march through the agencies of the Federal \nGovernment and define what those are. It is transportation. It is \ncommerce. It is justice. It is the court system. It is roads. It is \nhighways. It is infrastructure. It is education. It is energy. It is \nall of the things. It is defense. It is a remarkable amount and needed \namount that we spend in the defense arena. All of those things--all of \nthose things--are the discretionary money.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  That is the blue on this graph. Remember that, in 1965--50 years \nago--that was two-thirds of the Federal budget.\n  Now fast forward to 2014. They are, essentially, the same numbers as \ntoday; although, the blue has decreased a little more. The mandatory \nside, the automatic side, is now two-thirds--not one-third but two-\nthirds--of the spending that comes out of the Federal Government, which \nmeans those programs have continued to grow. Again, those are important \nprograms--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--and we will address \nthe challenges that they have in a moment.\n  The spending there has grown to two-thirds of Federal spending, which \nmeans that the blue portion, the discretionary portion--that portion \nthat people think about when they think about what the Federal \nGovernment spends money on, which is, again, defense and infrastructure \nand education and energy and all of the things that the Federal \nGovernment does--has been squeezed, if you will, to one-third of \noverall spending at the Federal level.\n  What does that mean? That is the genesis. Is this important to \nanybody out there across this great land?\n  It is the genesis for the battles that we have had on the level of \nspending for defense--yes--or for highways or for infrastructure or for \neducation or for anything that we debate and discuss so as to try our \nbest to represent the American people in a positive way about what kind \nof money and the number of resources--hardworking taxpayer money--ought \nto go for those programs. That money is getting decreased.\n  The Federal Government's challenge is to be able to figure out how to \nturn this around because, in a few short years, the mandatory side will \nbe three-quarters of the spending out of Washington, which means that \nthat discretionary part--that part that people count on to try to grow \nthe economy and make it so that, again, the greatest number of American \ndreams can be realized by the greatest number of folks in a fair and a \ncompassionate system--will get further and further and further \ndiminished. So there is the challenge that we have, and the difficulty \nis getting folks to address the mandatory side.\n  Now, someone might say: Well, those programs are important. And they \nare. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--those programs--are \nimportant. So why not just leave them as they are? People are doing \njust fine. They think things are rolling along relatively well. Why not \njust leave them where they are?\n  Here is the dirty little secret about those programs: They are all \ngoing broke. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--all of them--are \nrunning out of resources over a period of time.\n  What does that mean? That means that the promises that the Federal \nGovernment has made--to seniors regarding health care, to individuals \nwho take utilization of the Medicaid system, to seniors who have access \nto Social Security resources to try to make it so that their retirement \nyears are more secure--will not be there. All of those benefits to \nthose individuals that the Nation has promised to them will not be \nthere. They will not be there at the level that has been promised.\n  You get some folks who say: Well, the length of time that it will \ntake for us to have any real challenge in that arena is just too long. \nYou don't have to worry about it. We have got more than enough time to \ntake care of it.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, it is right around the \ncorner. From Social Security's standpoint, the disability program was \ndestined to become insolvent next year. What did we do recently? We \nplugged the hole. We didn't solve the problem. We plugged the hole, but \nthat doesn't make it so that it is any less likely that it will be a \ngreater problem as the years go on.\n  Medicare. As a physician, I can tell you that the Medicare system is \nincredibly important to seniors across this great land. The Medicare \nsystem will run out of resources in 2030 to cover the services that \nhave been promised. That is 14, 15 short years away.\n  When you think that 15 years is too far in the future, just think \nabout the challenge that we had during Y2K, when the millennium turned \nover. That was just 15 years ago. Most folks remember that. Most folks \nremember the challenge that we had during that period of time. The fact \nof the matter is that 15 years is not a long time; so Medicare's going \nbroke in 15 years is something that we ought not ignore.\n  Social Security. When does Social Security go broke? In 2034, which \nis 4 years after that--a very short period of time. Again, what does it \nmean if Social Security goes broke? It means that the benefits that \nhave been assured and promised by your Federal Government are not going \nto be able to be provided to seniors. We think that is wrong. We think \nthat is reckless and immoral to not do anything to fix that. We think \nit is important to save and strengthen and secure Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Social Security.\n  You ask: What does that have to do with the budget? That gets us to \nwhat the Budget Committee did this past year, and I can't tell you how \nproud I am of the work that was done on behalf of the Republican \nmajority here in this House of Representatives.\n  What did we do? We put in place, adopted a budget that would solve \nthe challenges that we have in a way that gets us to a balanced budget, \nthat gets us on a path to paying off the debt, that puts us on a path \nto solving, saving, strengthening, and securing Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security, and that defines what the role of the Federal \nGovernment ought to be for all of the discretionary programs in that \nblue area.\n\n[[Page H10705]]\n\n  Where does the spending occur from the Federal Government level? This \nis a pie chart that defines, again, the mandatory side and the \ndiscretionary side of our spending. Remember, about two-thirds of \nspending at the Federal level is the automatic side. What are those \nprograms? It includes Social Security.\n  In 2014, which is the last full year that we had full numbers, there \nwas $845 billion for Social Security. Medicare: $505 billion for \nMedicare. Medicaid: $301 billion for Medicaid. Other mandatory \nprograms--which are the others that I have talked about, which are \nthings like food stamps and the like--are at $448 billion. Interest on \nthe debt, which is this one, is about $221 billion.\n  Let's talk about interest on the debt for a moment. This is money \nthat is spent to cover the interest on the debt that we already have. \nThe United States has a debt of about $18.2 trillion; so the interest \nthat we pay on that annually now is about $221 billion. It is destined \nto increase enormously over the next few years, and that has huge \nconsequences, again, on trying to find the greatest amount of \nopportunity and the greatest amount of success for the greatest number \nof folks so that the greatest number of American dreams may be \nrealized.\n  How much is it going to increase? This is looking at just 10 years. \nThe amount of interest--and that is if interest rates stay relatively \nreasonable--on the national debt, on the Federal debt, will be $800 \nbillion. It will be close to $1 trillion that is going to be spent just \non interest. That is more than on defense. That is more than on \nMedicaid. That is more than on Medicare. That is more than on \neducation. That is more than on transportation. That is more than on \nscience and space and technology.\n\n  Again, all of those things that the American people say that they \nwant and desire are going to be crowded because of the mandatory \nspending--the automatic spending, yes--but the interest on the debt is \napproaching $1 trillion a year.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we are trying to do on the Budget Committee is to \nsay to our colleagues and to say to the American people that that is an \nirresponsible use of hard-earned taxpayer dollars to have that level of \ndebt. It means that $1 trillion a year of that hard-earned money by the \nAmerican people, who send it to Washington and expect that it is going \nto be used in a responsible way, is going to go toward interest on the \ndebt. That doesn't do a thing to send a kid to college, to buy a house, \nto pay the rent, to start a business. Any of the kinds of things, \nagain, that the American people say they want are harmed by that level \nof spending on interest on the national debt. That is why this is so \nimportant.\n  These numbers mean that the amount of opportunity and the amount of \ngrowth in our economy that will be available to make it so that those \nAmerican dreams can be realized get lessened, and that is why it is so \nimperative that we address the challenges that we have from an economic \nstandpoint.\n  Some people would say: Well, that really isn't a problem. All we need \nto do is to raise taxes--right?--to take more money from the American \npeople. That is how you solve this problem.\n  Mr. Speaker, as you know, the level of revenue--the amount of money--\ncoming into the Federal Government now is at its greatest point ever in \nreal dollars. There is more money being sent to Washington by the \nAmerican people and by businesses and folks all across this great land \nto fund the government--more money than ever--than in the history of \nour society. That is a phenomenal statement because what that means is \nthat, if one believes that one just ought to raise taxes on people and \ntake more hard-earned money, then what is the limit? What is the goal?\n  Our goal, again, is to create the greatest amount of opportunity for \nthe greatest number of individuals and to create the greatest amount of \nsuccess so that the greatest number of American dreams can be realized \nin a fair and a compassionate system. That is our goal. We don't \nbelieve that that goal is furthered by taking more money from hard-\nearned American taxpayers.\n  The challenge is how you solve that. How do you make it so that you \ndon't get to a point at which $1 trillion a year is going to cover \ninterest on the Federal debt?\n  Here is a depiction of how that is solved. This is what I call the \nsmile chart. You can see the smile. The fact, however, is that the \nsmile is the blue line there and not the red line. This axis here is \nthe level of debt held as a percent of the gross domestic product. On \nthe lower axis, on the X axis, it goes from 1940 to 2040. Then the dark \ncolor here is the graph of what level of debt we had as a Nation from \n1940, which was at the beginning of World War II, until now. You see \nthat it goes up and down.\n  The largest amount of debt that we had in this area was just after \nWorld War II, which was when we covered the expenses for the war. It \ntended to tamp down, and it got into the 20 to 30 percent range of the \ngross domestic product. That is kind of the range at which economists \ntell you is the sweet spot for how you get the economy growing and \nrolling and expanding and creating jobs and opportunities.\n  You see over there, just after 2010, the incredible increase. That \nwas this President and the Federal Government's response to the \neconomic challenge that we had. What did they do? They printed a lot of \nmoney and increased the amount of debt--a huge increase in the amount \nof debt.\n  Now, the red line is where their projections go. It is where the \nPresident and his party's projections go with current programs. Again, \nthose are the programs that we have discussed. That is where their line \ngoes on debt, which expands incredibly. We don't get to that point on \nthat line because the economy won't tolerate that. It won't accommodate \nthat in a way that makes it so that people are going to be able to even \nfind a job, because you can't take that much money out of the economy \nand expect the economy to work.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  So what we did was put in place our budget, adopt a budget, along \nwith the Senate, that is the blue line. And that means that what we \nwould do is figure out how to solve these challenges, get us on a path \nto paying off the debt.\n  You have got to have a surplus before you can begin to pay off the \ndebt. But we have got to get on that path to paying off the debt so \nthat we aren't utilizing the incredibly hard-earned taxpayer money \nsimply for the kind of things that don't benefit anybody at all; and \nthat is, interest on the debt. You cannot continue to have this level \nof spending.\n  We are incredibly excited about the opportunities that we have. We \nhave got a lot of challenges in terms of having our colleagues come \nonboard and the American people recognizing that these problems are \nreal and they are real right now.\n  We began a program in the Committee on the Budget called Restoring \nthe Trust for All Generations. Mr. Speaker, if you had an interest, you \ncould go to our Web site at www.budget.house.gov and look up the \nprogram that we have, Restoring the Trust for All Generations, an \neffort to try to build the critical mass of individuals necessary to \nsay: Yes, we want that greatest amount of opportunity and success for \nfolks so that American Dreams can be realized in a fair and \ncompassionate system.\n  We recognize that in order for that to occur, we simply must address \nthe mandatory, the automatic spending issues that are so challenging \nfor us. In order to do that, we have got to make certain that we save \nand strengthen and secure Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and \nother mandatory programs in a way that makes sense to the American \npeople and put us on a path to being able to solve these challenges.\n  I am extremely excited about the opportunities available to us. I am \nfrustrated that we haven't been able to get to them sooner than now. \nBut I want to assure you, Mr. Speaker, that your Committee on the \nBudget and the individuals on that committee and the individuals in \nthis Conference, I believe, recognize the challenges that we have and \nare looking forward, with great anticipation, to 2016, to the \nleadership from Speaker Ryan and the admonition that he has provided \nfor us to say: Look, we have got to make certain\n\n[[Page H10706]]\n\nthat we define what the legislation is that solves and saves and \nstrengthens and secures these programs. We have got to get ourselves on \nthat path to make it so that we can get to a point where we have, \nindeed, balanced the budget without raising taxes and get ourselves on \na path to paying off the debt.\n  If we are able to do that, Mr. Speaker, then we will, in fact, be \nable to stand proudly before the American people and say: What we have \ndone is provided that amount of opportunity and that amount of success \nfor the vast number of the American people so that American Dreams can \nbe realized.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wish all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year \nand look forward to that new year, again, with great anticipation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/house-section/article/H10706-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H10706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A further message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, \nannounced that the Senate has passed with amendments in which the \nconcurrence of the House is requested a bill of the House of the \nfollowing title:\n\n       H.R. 515.
